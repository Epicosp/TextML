Abstract: Blockchain is receiving increasing attention from academy and industry, since it is
considered a breakthrough technology that could bring huge benefits to many different sectors.
In 2017, Gartner positioned blockchain close to the peak of inflated expectations, acknowledging
the enthusiasm for this technology that is now largely discussed by media. In this scenario, the risk
to adopt it in the wake of enthusiasm, without objectively judging its actual added value is rather
high. Insurance is one the sectors that, among others, started to carefully investigate the possibilities
of blockchain. For this specific sector, however, the hype cycle shows that the technology is still in
the innovation trigger phase, meaning that the spectrum of possible applications has not been fully
explored yet. Insurers, as with many other companies not necessarily active only in the financial
sector, are currently requested to make a hard decision, that is, whether to adopt blockchain or not,
and they will only know if they were right in 3–5 years. The objective of this paper is to support
actors involved in this decision process by illustrating what a blockchain is, analyzing its advantages
and disadvantages, as well as discussing several use cases taken from the insurance sector, which
could easily be extended to other domains.
Keywords: blockchain; bitcoin; insurance; smart contracts
1. Introduction
A blockchain is a distributed ledger maintained by network nodes, recording transactions
executed between nodes (i.e., messages sent from one node to another). Information inserted in
the blockchain is public, and cannot be modified or erased [1]. Smart contracts are self-executing
contracts (generally saved on a blockchain) whose terms are directly written into lines of code [2].
Recently, blockchain and its relations with smart contracts has received increasing attention from
media, which started to address it as “The next big thing” [3], “The new black”, “The philosopher’s
stone” [4] or “The new Graal” [5]. In [6], blockchain has been compared to inventions such as the steam
or combustion engine, since it is potentially able to bring benefits to a variety of everyday activities
and business processes.
According to Gartner’s hype cycle, blockchain is at the peak of inflated expectations, where the
enthusiasm is at the highest level possible [7]. Nonetheless, concerns started to be expressed as well
about a massive adoption of blockchain [5,8–13]. The common denominator in the above concerns
is that technology is considered, on the one hand, to be not fully mature yet [5,9] and, on the other
hand, to be overhyped [8], since its application often produces outcomes that could be achieved using
well-mastered alternatives [10].

The risk is that one is so much in love with this technology that it becomes impossible for
one to objectively judge its true benefits. As stressed by Adam Cooper, a technical architect of the
Bank of England, “[With blockchain] the focus as always should be on fulfilling user needs, not on
implementing technologies simply because they are clever or interesting.” [11].
The insurance sector, as with many others, started to investigate the application of
blockchain technology through considerable investments from both big and small companies [14,15],
investigations from consultancy firms [4,16,17], and the creation, in 2016, of the B3i, the first
blockchain-centered insurance consortium [18].
The hype cycle for the insurance sector [19], however, depicts blockchain technology at the
beginning of the curve connecting the technology trigger phase with the peak of inflated expectation,
meaning that this technology has not been fully explored yet in this particular sector. Hence, the
questions that insurance companies are asking themselves right now are “Are there clear use cases
exploiting blockchain technology and smart contracts in the insurance sector?”, “In case we want to
adopt a blockchain, what is the most suitable blockchain architecture for our needs?” and, more in
general, “Is blockchain technology mature enough for insurance?”. It has been estimated that they will
need to wait about 3 to 5 years to see whether they made the right choice today by deciding to invest
or not in blockchain for their business [20].
The objective of this paper is to help companies operating in the insurance sector to answer the
above questions by providing an overview of blockchain- (and smart contracts-) based use cases in
such specific sector, and by highlighting strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for this
technology. The authors decided to focus on insurance because, in this sector, blockchain technology
could have a relevant impact on a variety of processes and application scenarios. Notwithstanding,
it is worth observing that, despite the focus on the particular domain the authors are operating into,
many of the examples provided and considerations made throughout the paper could be helpful for a
number of other companies, not necessarily from the financial domain. In fact, the aim is to stimulate
reflections and discussions on this topic, leaving to the reader the final judgment on the actual benefits
that could come from the adoption of the considered technology in a specific scenario.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the blockchain technology,
by presenting its key concepts. Section 3 discusses several use cases from the insurance sector, by
mentioning prototype solutions available so far. Discussion is complemented by Section 4, which
reports a SWOT analysis performed on a wider context to broaden the scope of the analysis beyond
the insurance domain. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.
2. How Blockchain Works
The blockchain (literally, a “chain of blocks”) made its first appearance in the research scenario in
2008, in the frame of the Bitcoin initiative [21,22]. The objective was to transfer online payments from
one party to another, without relying on intermediaries. In this context, the blockchain was acting
as the underlying ledger recording Bitcoin transfers and guaranteeing, by means of cryptographic
operations, the authentication and non-repudiation of payments.
Even though Bitcoin is, by far, the most famous cryptocurrency, it is not alone. In fact, since 2008,
more than 1300 cryptocurrencies have been created [23], which are being used as exchange tokens in
many different blockchain-based applications.
The core concepts behind the blockchain technology are reported in the following.
- Transactions: each cryptocurrency transfer from one subject to another is represented as a
transaction from A to B. Cryptocurrency is neither a physical nor a software object, but the result
of incoming and outgoing transactions. For this reason, the blockchain keeps track of all the
transactions occurred from its birth.
- Blocks: transactions are grouped in blocks. Each block collects all the transactions occurring in
a given timeframe and keeps a reference to the preceding block (that is where the concept of
“chain” comes from).
Future Internet 2018, 10, 20 3 of 16
- Nodes: instead of being stored in a centralized database, the blockchain is spread over network
computers (the “nodes”), each containing a local copy of the entire blockchain.
- Majority consensus: since a central authority is missing, decisions on the network are made
according to a majority consensus. Each node modifies its local copy of the blockchain to make it
mirror the status of the majority of the network nodes.
- Mining: nodes could either passively store a copy of the blockchain, or actively take part to
the maintenance of the blockchain, in the so-called “mining” process. During mining, nodes
check previous transactions to verify whether a subject is entitled to spend a given amount
of cryptocurrency and, each time a block has to be added to the chain, solve a complex
computational-intensive mathematical problem. This problem was specifically designed to
limit the possibility for a malicious entity to manipulate the blockchain by falsifying transactions.
The probability of attacks is extremely low, since adding a new (malicious) block or modify a
previously added block to the chain would require control of the majority of the network nodes
(to make them agree with the modification).
- Wallet: people transfer cryptocurrency using wallets. Cryptocurrency cannot be stored on a
physical memory; rather, it is the result of previous transactions. Hence, the wallet only stores
credentials (a complex, unchangeable combination of automatically assigned numbers and letters),
which enable blockchain users to transfer cryptocurrencies they own. Each wallet is associated to
one (or more) unique addresses. Should a user want to send a given amount of cryptocurrency to
a peer, he/she would have to specify the recipient’s address and the desired amount, and use
his/her credentials to validate the transaction. This aspect is particularly important, since in case
of credentials loss, the cryptocurrency owned by the user would not “disappear”, but the user
would be no more able to spend it. Moreover, the fact that the user validates the transaction with
his/her credentials certifies that he/she was the actual initiator of the transaction.
In order to better understand how the blockchain works, it could be worth considering the example
shown in Figure 1. In the depicted scenario, Alice wants to send some amount of cryptocurrency from
her wallet (with address “x1z”) to Arthur’s wallet (with address “v4y”).

Alice makes a statement in which she specifies the amount to be transferred as well as the recipient
of the transfer, and validates this message with her credentials (for sake of readiness, the image reports
users’ names instead of their addresses). Then, she broadcasts the message to the network. Network
nodes verify if the message’s sender was actually Alice (by verifying if the message was correctly
validated using her credentials), and check if she possesses the amount to be transferred. In order to
perform this check, they use their local copy of the blockchain and analyze incoming and outgoing
transactions from Alice’s wallet address that are stored in previous blocks. If the message sent by
Alice is valid and she is entitled to spend the money, they add Alice’s transaction, together with other
transactions occurring in the same time frame, to a block. In order to add the block to the blockchain,
they then start solving a complex mathematical problem, where they have to find a random number
that, combined with a numeric summary of the previous block, provides a given result. During this
(mining) process, the fastest node receives a monetary reward. When a valid result is found, the new
block is added to the blockchain. As a result, Arthur receives the money.
The above example should have allowed the reader to get better acquainted with the main
characteristics of the blockchain, which make it a disruptive technology:
- Decentralized validation: the validation of transactions is performed by network nodes without
the need of intermediaries;
- Data redundancy: each network node has a local copy of the blockchain, which prevents
data losses;
- Data immutability: data stored in the blockchain could not be modified or deleted;
- Trust: cryptography enables trust between parties, since a transaction that has been validated
using user’s credentials cannot be repudiated;
- Transparency: everyone could read the blockchain and the transactions stored in it.
Though the example in Figure 1 refers to a transfer of cryptocurrency, application possibilities of
the blockchain are not limited to monetary assets, but could encompass a wide variety of use cases.
Among the early application scenarios that were explored for the blockchain, it is worth recalling
the notarial context. In fact, since the blockchain is immutable and publicly available, researchers
suggested using it for storing public records and attestations [1]. Another domain where the blockchain
has been recognized to be able to bring significant benefits is intellectual property protection. In this
context, blockchain technology could be used to prove/certify the existence of a document at a given
time [24]. In contexts where, e.g., freedom of thought is threatened, blockchain technology could be
used to store information in order to avoid censorship [25]: in fact, everyone can write information on
the blockchain and read it.
As time has passed, researchers have realized that the blockchain could also be used to store other
kinds of assets, including pieces of code. It was the birth of “smart contracts”, i.e., small programs
stored in the blockchain and programmed to autonomously behave in a given manner when some
conditions are met.
The idea of a smart contract has been known since the 90s [26], but it was only with the blockchain
technology—and, in particular, with the Ethereum blockchain (probably the most famous blockchain
after Bitcoin)—that smart contracts were able to unleash their full potential [27].
With a smart contract, a person could, for instance, encode his/her will in the blockchain in the
form of a set of rules. In case of death, the smart contract could then automatically transfer the testator’s
money or other kind of assets to the beneficiary. The testator may also provide additional constraints,
such as enabling the transfer only when the beneficiary reaches the age of majority, when he/she
obtains a diploma, etc.
Since smart contracts’ conditions are based on data stored in the blockchain, they need to rely
on external services, which take data from the “real” world (e.g., from death records) and push them
to the blockchain (or vice versa). These services are referred to as “oracles” [28]. By considering
the testator’s example, an oracle could inspect death records to identify whether the person passed
Future Internet 2018, 10, 20 5 of 16
away. If so, it could write this information on the blockchain (e.g., by changing the value of a Boolean
variable indicating whether the person is alive or not). The smart contract, then, would trigger a
conditional statement (based on the value of the variable), and execute the block of code initiating the
money transfer.
Based on the type of information collected and on the interaction with the external world, oracles
have been grouped into “software”/“hardware” oracles, and “inbound”/“outbound” oracles [29].
Software oracles are in charge of extracting information mainly from Web sources, whereas hardware
oracles are meant to extract information from the physical world (e.g., through sensors). Inbound
oracles insert information in the blockchain, whereas outbound oracles allow smart contracts to send
information to the external world (e.g., letting hotels’ intelligent lockers unlock themselves as soon as
a person pays for a night).
Oracles have a huge responsibility in the correct execution of smart contracts, as the insertion
of wrong information could trigger a money transfer without possibility of refund. Thus, there are
companies that have developed oracles that certify the authenticity of extracted data for a small
cost [28]. In some cases, it could be worth relying on more than one oracle, e.g., by considering a
situation as “happened” if 3 out of 5 oracles confirm it [30].
Recently, an even more complex application of smart contracts and oracles was proposed, which
is associated to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAOs [31]. In this context,
smart contracts are used to encode rules to govern an organization, e.g., how decisions are taken,
the weight of each member’s vote, etc. The advantage is that no external party is required to verify
that the organization is properly managed, and underlying rules can be verified by the wider public,
ensuring transparency and trust.
From the architectural point of view, it is worth remarking that there exist different types of
blockchains, which differ in terms of read/write permissions. “Public blockchains” (such as the Bitcoin
blockchain) are blockchains that could be readable and potentially writable by everyone. “Private
blockchains” are blockchains that could be written only by organization members. Read permissions
can be either restricted to the organization, or made public. In “consortium blockchains”, a set of
selected nodes belonging to different institutions control validation, and the blockchain is used to
share information among participant institutions. Public blockchains are particularly useful when
no central entity is available to verify a transaction, and full decentralization is needed. Private
and consortium blockchains provide some advantages, such as lower validation costs and shorter
validation times (given the fact that, because of the smaller number of nodes, the mathematical problem
can be simplified), reduced risk of attacks (since nodes that validate transactions are known) and
increased privacy (as read permissions could be granted only to selected nodes). Furthermore, in case
of errors or bugs in smart contracts, private and consortium blockchains could extraordinarily modify
or revert previous transactions.
The choice of the type of blockchain to adopt should be based on the amount of decentralization
required, and on time/cost constraints [8,32]. Eventually, some hybrid solutions, exploiting cross-chain
exchange layers between public and private blockchains, could be exploited [33], e.g., by using a
private blockchain for a company’s backend activities and a public blockchain for receiving/sending
money from/to customers. Finally, it must be underlined that, when selecting the blockchain to
use, one should pay attention to avoiding decentralization for the sake of itself. In fact, a number of
companies’ processes are currently managed in a successful way using relational databases, and the
switch to a (private) blockchain could not be worth the effort [8,32]. With respect to private blockchains
versus centralized databases, experts argue that “the biggest advantages of private blockchains in
comparison to centralized databases are cryptographic auditing and known identities. Nobody can
tamper with the data, and mistakes can be traced back” [34]. Others suggest that a blockchain could be
a solution more suitable than a database only in case a company “plans to start privately and evolve
into a regular public blockchain for public cross-verification as demand/volume grows” [34].

3. Blockchain Applications in Insurance: Selected Use Cases
As illustrated in the previous section, advantages of blockchain are various. A number of
enthusiasts already proposed using this technology in various sectors and contexts, including:
- Government [35], to record in a transparent way citizens’ votes, or politicians’ programs (for
verifying if promises made have been kept) or to enable autonomous governance systems [36];
- Intellectual property [24], to certify the proof of existence and authorship of a document;
- Internet [25], to reduce censorships, by exploiting the immutability of data stored in
the blockchain;
- Finance [37], to transfer money between parties without having to rely on banks;
- Commerce [38], to record goods’ characteristics as well as their ownership, especially for luxury
goods, thus reducing the market of counterfeit/stolen items;
- Internet of Things (IoT) [39–41], e.g., by exploiting smart contracts to automatically process
data coming from sensors, in order to let intelligent machines interact with each other [42] and
autonomously take actions when specific situations occur;
- Education [43], to store information on qualifications acquired by learners, e.g., to reduce job
application frauds; in this context, multiple actors (e.g., universities, training institutions, etc.)
could write qualifications achieved by a person on the blockchain; human resources staff could
then easily obtain information about when and where a given competency was obtained.
A rather comprehensive overview of applications developed in each of the above sectors can be
found in [32,44]. What should be evident from the above list is that benefits deriving from the adoption
of blockchain technology are not limited to a single sector/scenario. Moreover, even within a given
sector, blockchain can have different impacts considering the various stakeholders operating in it, their
business models, their needs, etc.
In the following, the attention will be specifically devoted to the insurance sector, where the
use of blockchain could positively affect different internal processes (from customer acquisition
and management, to frauds prevention, etc.) and could even allow companies to reach new
markets [4,16,17,32]. In particular, a selection of use cases that could potentially benefit from blockchain
technology will be introduced. For some use cases, prototype implementations have already been
developed. In other cases, the use of blockchain has been only analyzed from a theoretical point of view.
For each use case, advantages, disadvantages and impact on the insurance domain will be discussed.
3.1. Improvement of Customer Experience and Reduction of Operating Costs
In this use case, blockchain and smart contracts could be exploited to increase the speed of claim
processing as well as to reduce the costs (and mistakes) associated with the manual processing of
claims. From this perspective, a smart contract could encode the rules for enabling the transfer of
refund from the company to the insured.
A simple application could consist of triggering an automatic transfer of refund only if the
customer repairs the car at a certified mechanic, with the mechanic sending a transaction to the smart
contract to prove its identity.
More complex use cases could also involve oracles to gather information from the real world.
To make an example, in crop insurance an oracle could periodically check weather data and push this
information in the blockchain. A smart contract could then read these data, and trigger a payment in
case of persistence of bad weather.
These problems have been dealt with, for instance, in the prototype presented in [45]. In this case,
the focus is on travel insurances, and the idea is to exploit a smart contract developed on the Ethereum
blockchain for automatically refunding travelers if their flight/train was delayed.
Another interesting use case, which could widely benefit from the increasing diffusion of sensors,
is the exploitation of smart contracts in combination with IoT. For instance, homes could be equipped
Future Internet 2018, 10, 20 7 of 16
with sensors that can directly notify a smart contract of a damage (e.g., damp sensors could be used to
monitor damages on the roof) [46]. Similarly, smart appliances could automatically monitor their state,
and initiate a claim or directly contact the repairer for a quicker assistance when needed.
Solutions such as the ones envisioned above bring benefits to different actors: to the insurance
company, which could reduce the amount of resources normally devoted to claim processing, but also
to customers, who would receive money even before having become aware of the damage.
Another advantage would come from the fact that everyone could inspect the smart contract.
That is, the customer undersigning a policy would get a clear idea of its contractual conditions (even
though, at the moment, he/she should master some programming skills in order to understand
the smart contract code). Consequently, it would become easier for him/her to compare policies.
Furthermore, the choice of a policy would no more based only on how much he/she trusts a given
company (since trust would be implicitly guaranteed by the smart contract), but on objective data.
Despite these advantages, it must be said that the scenario above could be adopted only for a
limited number of policies. In fact, the majority of claims processed by insurance companies still need
to be evaluated by an external expert before being settled. In case of manual processing, however,
the customer experience could still be improved by managing payments in cryptocurrencies, whose
transfer would be quicker than with traditional methods (several seconds or minutes depending on
the blockchain used).
From the architectural point of view, probably the most suitable choice is to adopt a combination
of private and public blockchains. The private blockchain could be used to record policies and
claims data, whereas the public blockchain could be used to trigger the refund in terms of tradable
cryptocurrencies (such as Ethers or Bitcoins). The private blockchain could be maintained by trusted
company’s computers/nodes characterized by lower mining costs with regard to those of public
blockchains. The public blockchain would be maintained by the wider public, through the mining
incentives presented in Section 2. Alternatively, the company could decide to exploit only a public
blockchain. This choice could be successful in case the company needs to improve its own reputation
and obtain customers’ trust (as the process would be fully decentralized), but would imply higher
transaction costs.
3.2. Data Entry/Identity Verification
The cryptographic mechanism underlying the blockchain could be used to reduce the overhead
related to manual data entry and verification of new customers [47].
With the blockchain, customers would be identified by a unique address (e.g., the one linked to
their wallet). The first time they use a service, a certified intermediary would verify their identity and
link it to their address. From that time on, every time they undersign a policy, they would no more
need to provide an identification document; rather, they would only need to use their credentials.
Benefits of this use case could be seen again in a reduced time and cost to gather/provide
information.
Nonetheless, this use case also has some relevant drawbacks the company should be aware of.
A first drawback is related to the possible loss/steal of credentials. As said, since the blockchain works
without intermediaries, no one could reset users’ credentials. A solution could be to rely on external
services, which could store credentials and return them to the users in case of loss. However, using such
services would mean providing someone else access to one’s sensitive information. Another drawback
is linked to the fact that the current legal regulations should be modified to include blockchain-based
identification, and some governments could refuse to approve this type of identification, e.g., due to
mistrust in the technology.
From the architectural point of view, companies deciding to exploit blockchain-based Know Your
Customer (KYC) could rely on external services running on public blockchains. In fact, some KYC
services recently appeared, offering some prototypes based on existing blockchains. One example is
Civic [48] (based on the Bitcoin blockchain) and KYC Legal [49] (exploiting the Ethereum blockchain).
Future Internet 2018, 10, 20 8 of 16
Such companies already built a network of validators, which receive a reward for each performed
validation and charge small fees to companies requiring their services.
3.3. Premium Computation/Risk Assessment/Frauds Prevention
In this scenario, the blockchain is used to let multiple certified intermediaries record information
related to a person (by linking them to his/her address).
Such intermediaries could be insurance companies (e.g., to record previous claims), police officers
(e.g., to store criminal acts), medical staffs (e.g., to record a person’s injuries and treatments), or even
smart wearable devices (which could inject in the blockchain data about one’s physical activity).
A smart contract could read all the information linked to a person and automatically compute the
premium and perform risk assessment, based on his/her physical health, driving behaviors, etc. [50].
Another application scenario is represented by fraud prevention. In this scenario, a smart contract
could analyze collected data and identify frauds during claim processing (e.g., by crossing data related
to a person’s previous claims).
A scenario such as the one depicted in the above examples, however, could be difficultly realized in
the short term. In fact, it implies that each person possesses a unique blockchain address (as presented
in Section 3.2), and requires the active involvement of different actors (insurance companies, police
officers, medical staff, etc.) as the quality of the results would be a consequence of the quality and
quantity of data stored in the blockchain. Privacy is another relevant issue (especially for what it
concerns medical records). In this view, in the construction of such a system, a thorough attention
should be devoted to let only selected actors link information extracted from the blockchain to
a person’s identity. Furthermore, particular care should be devoted to the definition of common
standards to record the information, in order to enable interoperability.
The most suitable architecture for this use case is a consortium blockchain. The blockchain would
be maintained by selected nodes of the consortium, e.g., belonging to the different actors involved.
The limited number of trusted nodes would increase security and privacy. Furthermore, the blockchain
would keep track of the sender of each transaction. Finally, being controlled by a small number of
nodes, mechanisms to revert blockchain state in case of transactions erroneously made (e.g., a driving
infraction notified to the wrong person) could be devised.
3.4. Pay-Per-Use/Micro-Insurance
Smart contracts- and blockchain-based payments could enable new revenue sources, such as micro-
and pay-per-use insurances. Though in the past micro-insurances were threatened by administrative
costs, the exploitation of smart contracts could enable quick and cheap policy undersignment and
management (even on mobile devices) [51]. Similarly, pay-per-use insurances could become a praxis,
possibly in combination with IoT solutions for automatic undersignment. For instance, GPS data could
be used to automatically collect, e.g., a travel premium only if the customer is abroad, a car premium
only when the car is moving, etc. Pay-per-use mechanisms could be exploited in services such as Uber
or Airbnb, e.g., activating the service when a customer is picked up or hosted.
With respect to the other use cases described in the paper, from the point of view of actors and
technology to be involved, this is probably one of the quickest and easiest to be realized (because of
the limited number of involved actors, and because the feasibility of prototypal solutions has already
been demonstrated [51]). Moreover, from the point of view of the insurance company, introducing
blockchain-based pay-per-use insurances (which could be even paid by using cryptocurrencies) could
bring a competitive advantage, especially attracting young, technology enthusiasts.
Concerning architectural choices, companies aiming at addressing pay-per-use insurance could
rely on a public blockchain. In this way, a smart contract could collect money from customers (e.g.,
Ethers or Bitcoins), keep them until a given date and transfer them to the insurance company if
no damage occurs. Being on a public blockchain, everyone could inspect the smart contract code,
increasing trust between parties.
Future Internet 2018, 10, 20 9 of 16
3.5. Peer-to-Peer Insurance
Several peer-to-peer insurances already exist [52–54], though it must be said that, at present,
they are not “real” peer-to-peer models, as they have a traditional insurance model or risk carrier
behind them, supporting the heavy part of the insurance business.
In this context, smart contracts could represent an important innovation, as they would enable
the creation of DAOs, where self-insured groups’ functioning rules could be hard-coded.
A prototype solution named DYNAMIS and based on the Ethereum blockchain has already
been implemented [55]. This solution aims to provide supplemental unemployment insurance for a
community of self-managed people in terms of underwriting and claims acceptance and processing.
Even though in peer-to-peer insurance the blockchain could really become the key technology,
from the insurance company’s perspective it must be underlined that the objective of peer-to-peer
insurance is the removal of intermediaries (i.e., the insurance companies themselves). Hence, a wise
choice insurance companies could make here is to recognize this risk, and turn it from a threat into a
business opportunity, e.g., by providing the infrastructure for peer-to-peer insurance.
From the architectural point of view, since this scenario requires a high amount of decentralization,
a public blockchain would be more suited.
It should be underlined, however, that the adoption of peer-to-peer insurance models by the wider
public is not imminent yet. In fact, apart from a small amount of technology enthusiasts who aim at
reducing insurance costs, a high number of customers still considers the interaction with intermediaries
important and worth of extra costs [56].
4. A SWOT Analysis
The above discussion should have provided the reader with a broad overview of potential
applications of blockchain technology in the insurance sector. As seen, advantages appear to
be numerous. Nonetheless, only a few prototypes exist so far, and it has been estimated that
blockchain-based applications will be available to the wider public only in 10–15 years [5].
Starting from the considerations drawn in Section 3, in the following a SWOT analysis
summarizing advantages and disadvantages of this technology is provided (Table 1). The objective
here is to abstract from the specific domain considered, i.e., insurance, and to perform an analysis,
which could potentially be helpful in a variety of contexts/sectors.
The strengths of blockchain technology are mainly related to the technological aspects presented
in Section 2. By removing intermediaries, the cost of money transfers can be lowered (e.g., bank
commissions cease to exist). Transfers can also be made faster, as cryptocurrencies are directly moved
from a wallet’s address to another without intermediate steps (as it usually occurs, e.g., in overseas
bank transfers). Smart contracts provide a high degree of automation. Transparency is guaranteed as
well, as the blockchain could be accessed worldwide. In addition, since everyone could potentially
write on the ledger, the blockchain could become the repository of a huge amount of information,
which could be used for data analytics in different sectors (not necessarily related to insurance and
finance, such as medicine, education, etc.). The underlying cryptographic mechanism guarantees that
data are not modified and that transactions could not be repudiated. Finally, the replication of the
blockchain on each network node ensures that the blockchain would survive to unexpected events.
The most relevant weaknesses are related to scalability, energy consumption and performance.
In fact, at present, the number of transactions that could be handled per second is extremely
low when compared to traditional systems (mainly because of the computational power required to
validate new blocks). If, at the present time, blockchain-based transactions are quicker than traditional
bank transfers (on average they require few seconds to several minutes, instead of 1–2 days), for instant
payments and for other kinds of applications, performance should not be adequate to needs. In this
respect, it is worth outlining that some blockchain platforms are changing the process of validating
blocks, reducing the complexity of the mathematical problem to be solved and restricting the possibility
to perform mining only to a subset of trusted nodes. Apart from time, space is also an issue, since
Future Internet 2018, 10, 20 10 of 16
data are replicated on each network node. To make an example, the Bitcoin blockchain requires more
than 170 GB of storage on each network node [57]. In addition, the amount of energy consumed
by network nodes, and the cost of the hardware required to validate new blocks is extremely high,
estimated around 6$ per transaction [58] (though it must be underlined that several initiatives to limit
the amount of consumed energy are currently under development [59]).

- Low adoption from external actors means
lack of information
- Governments could consider blockchain and
smart contracts “dangerous”
- Medium-long term investment
- Not suitable for all existing processes
- Customers would still consider personal
interaction important
The fact that, once information is encoded in the blockchain, it is immutable and accessible by
everyone is another weakness, and could harm users’ privacy. To make an example, everyone could
check the amount of money owned by a person, by analyzing his/her incoming transactions. Should
other types of information be stored in the blockchain (e.g., medical records), this issue would become
even more relevant. To cope with privacy issues, some solutions to anonymize payments/transactions
have been proposed [60–63].
The immutability and self-execution of code could be another weakness for blockchain, since
smart contracts could become “candy for hackers” [9]. In fact, hackers could exploit bugs in smart
contracts to steal money, as it recently happened on the Ethereum network, where, in the most famous
attack of this kind, around $60 million were “stolen” in June 2016. Even assuming that smart contracts
are free of bugs, some applications would still need external oracles to inject information in the
blockchain. The weakest point, in this case, would become the oracle. As said, the consequences of
injecting in the blockchain wrong information could be partially mitigated by relying on more than
one oracle, each getting information from different sources.
Apart from technical aspects discussed above, other weaknesses affect blockchain usability. First
of all, the impossibility to receive assistance in case of credentials loss (even though this weakness
could be partially removed by relying on trusted services, as explained in Section 3). Another aspect
is cryptocurrencies volatility, which could become a limitation to the adoption of blockchain-based
payments. In fact, given the fact that cryptocurrencies are subject of speculation and considering
Future Internet 2018, 10, 20 11 of 16
that technology is not fully mature yet (and bugs frequently appear), value of cryptocurrencies show
huge fluctuations.
Another weakness is related to the fact that development tools are still in an early stage,
and standards for developing blockchain-based applications have not been defined yet.
Finally, it is worth remarking that, in some cases, blockchain would not be the most suitable
technology to use, as existing, well-mastered alternatives would enable the achievement of comparable
results [64].
Opportunities are mainly related to whether the market would embrace the technology or not.
At the present time, interacting with the blockchain requires some technical skills (e.g., mastering
the concept of blocks, installing a wallet, etc.). Several efforts are currently carried out in order to
reduce/hide the complexity behind the technology (e.g., the development of browser plugins which
let users easily inspect the ledger [65], the creation of user-friendly wallets [66], etc.). Should the above
initiatives be successful, companies providing blockchain-based applications and services (and, in the
insurance market, companies offering blockchain-based policies) could have a competitive advantage.
This advantage would become larger in case of an increasing diffusion of IoT, as smart contracts could
be coded to autonomously make decisions based on data acquired by sensors [39–41].
Another opportunity is related to the possibility to address new markets and create new types of
services, mainly by leveraging DAOs and low transactions fees. Blockchain could be successfully used
to support the sharing economy, from car and house sharing [67] to disk storage rental [68] (and, in an
insurance scenario, to support micro, on-demand and peer-to-peer insurances).
Finally, should a high number of actors write data on the blockchain, innumerable new
applications could appear. As a matter of example, a person’s previous medical history could be easily
retrieved by doctors in case of urgency; blockchain could become a repository of medical data which
could be used by research scientists; blockchain-based supply chains could be more efficient as data
could be shared nearly instantaneously among heterogeneous involved actors; in an insurance scenario,
data could be used for frauds prevention, policies personalization, etc. Nonetheless, the type and
impact of these applications would be a function of the amount and quality of information recorded.
Threats are linked to different external causes. First of all, there is still a risk that the market
distrusts this technology, perceiving it as unsecure or unreliable, due to bugs, cryptocurrencies
volatility, etc.
Other actors could think that it is too complicated, and the adoption rate on a worldwide
basis could be low. As a countermeasure, such actors should receive a suitable training to be made
aware of the advantages of this technology. Alternatively, efforts could be carried out to hide the
underlying complexity.
Particular attention should be paid to legal regulations, which could threaten the adoption of
blockchain. For instance, the regulation of the use and jurisdiction of smart contracts is still under
debate. To make some examples, there could be situations in which the outcome of a smart contract
would not be considered as legal by a court under existing laws (e.g., a smart contract regulating
transactions of illegal goods) [69]. Similarly, there could be situations where hackers exploit smart
contracts bugs to steal money. Some governments could consider blockchain and smart contracts too
“dangerous”, thus resulting in a limitation of the adoption on a larger scale.
Concerning practical aspects, blockchain-based applications are a medium- to long-term
investment, and they could not be suited for integration in all the existing processes. In fact,
as previously discussed for the insurance sector, some claims would still need to be manually processed,
as not all the damages could be evaluated by sensors.
Finally, should blockchain technology become a praxis, it could impact on companies’ relationship
with their customers. First of all, some customers could refuse to adopt it, as they might still consider
the personal interaction important. Similarly, companies that invested in human capital to offer a
good customer service could lose market share, as the competition could be moved from the quality of
service provided, to its price.

5. Conclusions
Blockchain is receiving an ever-growing attention from research and industry, and is considered
a breakthrough technology. The increasing enthusiasm reported in the media, however, could bias
an objective evaluation about whether to invest or not in this technology. The risk is that a company
decides to embrace blockchain technology because it is fascinating, without reflecting on whether it is
mature enough for an adoption in everyday activities, and by a wider public.
To help companies reduce the risk of chasing decentralization for the sake of itself just because
blockchain is now under the spotlight, in this paper we presented an overview of potential applications
and use cases of blockchain and smart contracts in the insurance sector. We also drafted a more general
SWOT analysis of blockchain, which could be potentially applied to a variety of other sectors.
We decided to focus on insurance because this is a sector where blockchain has not been fully
explored yet and in which blockchain could have a relevant impact on several processes and application
scenarios. Hence, use cases in this sector could be helpful in identifying advantages and disadvantages
of the technology itself.
The considerations made throughout the paper helped us answer the key questions reported in
the introduction.
Concerning question 1, “Are there clear use cases exploiting blockchain technology and smart
contracts in the insurance sector?”, at the present time a number of use cases and prototype solutions
have been devised in this sector. In particular, blockchain and smart contracts could be successfully
used to speed up claims processing and reduce operating costs. In this scenario, a smart contract
could trigger reimbursements based on data acquired from physical sensors (e.g., damp sensors
installed on roofs) or from the Web (e.g., weather or flights delay data). In another scenario,
data entry/identity verification, the blockchain could be used as the infrastructure to verify a person’s
identity. People’s identities could be linked to a blockchain address; then, each time a person needs
to be verified (e.g., to open a bank account), he/she could send a signed transaction from his/her
address, by proving he/she is the address’ owner. In the context of premium computation/risk
assessment/frauds prevention, the blockchain could act as a shared ledger recording a person’s
previous history (previous claims, committed infractions, medical history, etc.). Insurance companies
could rely on these data to identify frauds, or to automatically compute the premium of a policy.
In the scenario of pay-per-use/micro-insurance, blockchain and smart contracts could be used to
automatically activate/deactivate policies and covers, based on data collected by sensors. Finally,
in the last identified scenario, i.e., peer-to-peer insurance, blockchain and smart contracts could be the
key technologies to enable a shift to a full decentralization, e.g., supporting the automatic management
of self-insured groups’ funds.
Concerning question 2, “In case we want to adopt a blockchain, what is the most suitable
blockchain architecture for our needs?”, as presented in Section 3, the architectural solutions should
be chosen based on the company’s decentralization needs. In general, for the backend a private
blockchain may be sufficient. Private blockchains have been frequently demonized, since using an
instrument originally born to foster decentralization in a fully centralized environment may seem a
contradiction. Nonetheless, they have the advantage of keeping track of the sender of a transaction and
of all the previous occurred transactions, reducing the risk of data tampering. Furthermore, together
with smart contracts, they could be used to increase the automatization of existing tasks. In case
multiple institutions need to access data, a consortium blockchain may be preferable. This blockchain
could be maintained by nodes belonging to the different institutions of the consortium, and could be
used as a shared ledger. Finally, public blockchains could be useful to manage (automatic) payments
with existing cryptocurrencies, or when there is the need to provide trust (using an unmodifiable
ledger) between parties.
Concerning question 3, “Is blockchain technology mature enough for insurance?”, while we
believe that blockchain is a tremendous invention that could have an impact similar to the World Wide
Web in the 90s, we also think that this technology still needs several improvements before becoming
Future Internet 2018, 10, 20 13 of 16
mainstream. The reasons behind this statement are various: first of all, a current limitation of existing
(public) blockchains is scalability. In fact, the number of transactions per second is low, and the network
frequently suffers congestions. In a pay-per-use insurance scenario, these facts would translate into
long waiting times before the desired policy cover is actually activated (and, what if an accident occurs
while the transaction activating a cover was waiting for validation?).
Second, a winning blockchain is still missing. That means that a company could develop an
application exploiting a given blockchain, and discover after few years that the chosen blockchain is
no longer supported by the wider network. Using a public blockchain supported by few nodes could
increase the risk of attacks (as few nodes could control the majority of the network).
Third, the interaction with the blockchain is still complex for the “average user”. Mastering the
concepts of wallet, transaction, mining, etc. requires some technical background. At the same time,
Bitcoin has frequently been associated with a pyramid scheme or a fraud. As a consequence, there
is still a lot of misinformation on blockchain, and people could still prefer “traditional” applications
rather than decentralized ones. Furthermore, cryptocurrency volatility (which sometimes is driven by
media news) could scare the potential users of decentralized applications.
Finally, the resources and best practices to develop a free-of-bugs smart contract are still insufficient.
Smart contracts frequently experience attacks, in some cases with disastrous consequences [70]. This
aspect could especially threaten peer-to-peer insurances, which would widely rely on smart contracts
for their governance.
For the above reasons, we do not expect blockchain-based insurance applications to appear in the
very near future.
It must be said, though, that the blockchain community is devoting great efforts to improving the
above weaknesses. Regarding scalability, Lightning Network (for Bitcoin) [71] and Raiden Network
(for Ethereum) [72] are currently under development. Both solutions are investigating how to mix
online and offline transactions, in order to reduce mining costs and time. Concerning easing the
interaction with the blockchain, some applications that let users easily interact with blockchain-based
applications using their browsers or mobile phones are currently under development [65,66].
Concerning smart contracts security, bug bounties programs are more and more frequent, and a
wide community of blockchain white hat hackers is currently being created [73].
Once the above initiatives are successful, blockchain technology could be gradually inserted in
everyday lives. In the meantime, insurance companies are strongly suggested to start investigating it,
by acquiring the required competencies, and by creating some prototype solutions. Such prototypes
could be useful to evaluate how existing processes would be influenced and to what extent this
technology would be accepted by the staff or by customers.
What is clear already is that blockchain is bringing a radical transformation to the way we act and
think, and we all should be prepared for this change.

ABSTRACT
Several problems in healthcare stem from the complex network of intermediaries and the lack of
traceability of transactions. To mention a few: healthcare data is fragmented across several silos
negatively affecting research and services, about half of the clinical trials are never reported, the cost
of drug discovery is ever increasing, and substandard and fake medicines are still a huge problem.
Blockchain has the potential to solve these problems as it provides trust without any intermediaries,
has traceability as a default feature, and promises new business models by enabling novel incentive
structures. Due to its potential, blockchain has gathered significant interest in the healthcare industry.
In this paper, we review major use cases of blockchain in healthcare: patient data management,
pharmaceutical research, supply chain management of medical goods, prescription management,
billing claims management, analytics, and telemedicine alongside the related projects. We found that
most of the blockchain projects are limited as white-papers, proof of concepts, and products with
a limited user base. However, we observed that the quantity, quality, and maturity of the projects
are increasing. We also discuss technical, regulatory, and business challenges to the adoption of
blockchain in the healthcare industry.

1 Introduction
The healthcare industry is one of the world’s largest industries, consuming over 10% of gross domestic product
(GDP) of the most developed nations[1]. Simply put, this industry includes generalization and commercialization
of goods and services to treat patients with curative, preventive, rehabilitative, and palliative care. Being a complex
system of interconnected entities under heavy regulatory boundaries, patient data is highly fragmented and the cost of
healthcare delivery is continuously rising due to inefficiencies in the system and dependence on several intermediaries.
Furthermore, transparency on the whole process of enabling data sharing between multiple parties, even though
supposedly beneficial to the patient, is still lacking on full transparency and control from the patient’s view. Patients
have shown concern about the possibility of their data being used by for-profit entities [2]. This has accentuated a

need for an information technology system that can remove the middlemen and cut costs while maintaining trust and
transparency. The blockchain is a revolutionary technology which can assist in solving the challenges of healthcare by
providing decentralized trust. Blockchain-enabled decentralization promises to minimize the problem of vendor lock-in
that has plagued the healthcare industry.
Patient data is scattered across different entities in the value chain of the healthcare industry referred to as data silos and
sharing of data is prone to a multi-level process of permission control. Because of this, oftentimes crucial data is not
accessible and available at the time of urgent need. Blockchain can solve this issue with health information exchange
(HIE) by serving as a basis for a trusted decentralized database. It can enable one-stop access to the entire medical
history of a patient across all healthcare providers. Access control system built using trust on blockchain puts patients
in control of their data; they can grant consent and access rights to external parties like researchers to have access to all
or subset of their medical records. This feature fits nicely with the patient-centric model of healthcare where blockchain
can act as a catalyst inducing trust.
The records written on the blockchain are immutable and cannot be altered or deleted. This characteristic of blockchain
provides primitives like data integrity and provenance which can be used to build solutions to prevent drug counterfeiting
and medical frauds. For instance, fraudulent results and removal of data in clinical trials which do not align with
researcher’s bias or funding source can be prevented by enforcing the integrity of data in blockchain. In addition, it
allows keeping an immutable log of subject’s consent in a clinical trial. On a financial note, blockchain could save
hundreds of billions for the pharmaceutical industry by defining a chain-of-custody in the supply chain[3].
It is possible to write custom laws and rules forming contracts on the blockchain, which are equivalent to real-world
contracts and can be legally binding. These contracts are referred to as smart contracts. Smart contracts can be used in
several processes within healthcare including billing and insurance which helps in automating the process and reducing
the costs. Later in subsequent sections, we see several companies leveraging the smart contracts to build solutions.
In this publication, we discuss the problems in the healthcare ecosystem and how the right use of blockchain technology
may solve these problems. We begin by giving a brief introduction to inner workings of blockchain in Chapter 2. In
subsequent chapters, we review major use cases of blockchain in healthcare along with the projects pursuing these use
cases. We have reviewed works in the field of healthcare data management, pharmaceutical use cases like supply chain
and medication adherence, billing/claims management, analytics, telemedicine, and blockchain as a service. These
fields, though not all-encompassing, represent some of the major areas in the overall healthcare space. In Chapter 8, we
discuss the challenges in the adoption of blockchain based solutions in healthcare. The final chapter concludes with
the overall discussion on the landscape of healthcare, problems therein, promises of the blockchain, and the state of
blockchain based solutions.
Several other review papers have discussed the applications of blockchain in healthcare [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
2 Blockchain
Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin [9], an open peer-to-peer (p2p) value transfer network that solved the
problem of double spending for the first time. With the release of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies became the first use case
of the blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are analogous to fiat money like USD or EUR facilitating the exchange of value
but use cryptographic protocols as the basis for governance rather than depending on a central authority like banks. In
recent years, there has been increasing awareness that the blockchain has much more to offer than cryptocurrencies;
blockchain can be an ideal tool for creating trust based solutions.
In Bitcoin like cryptocurrencies, a blockchain represents an append-only linear chain of blocks or ledger replicated
across a network of computers; a block is a group of validated transactions in the network, and the two consequent
blocks are cryptographically linked. However, in recent times we observe variations on how blockchain is defined.
Often it is used as an umbrella term for the distributed ledger technology used in any p2p network that tries to solve
problems like double spending. In this publication, we broadly consider blockchain as a p2p distributed append-only
ledger with immutable and tamper-proof records. It is important to understand the concept and life cycle of a transaction
to understand how blockchain works. In blockchain, a transaction represents a change of state. For instance, a transfer of
coins from a sender to a receiver is a transaction where the account balance represents the state. When a new transaction
is created, it is broadcasted to the network where a miner node (computer) picks up the transaction and compose a block
by combining one or more transactions and broadcasts the block into the network. Each blockchain has a set of rules
that determine whether a block created by a miner is valid or not, and only the valid blocks are added to the chain. For
example, a block is considered valid and mined in Bitcoin if it has the correct cryptographic hash [10]. These set of
rules form the basis of consensus in the blockchain.

A PREPRINT- DECEMBER 10, 2018
Consensus
The consensus in a blockchain network is the mechanism on agreeing on a common version or state of the blockchain
which is considered to be the trusted truth of the blockchain. The consensus mechanism prevents the double spending
as trying to double spend an already spent transaction causes a conflict with the existing state, thereby the transaction
is rejected and will never be added to the chain. A consensus protocol includes the rules for transaction validation,
accepting the newly created block into the chain, and selection of fork/partition in case of network partitions. Depending
on the context and the use case, the need and requirement for the consensus could differ. Consensus mechanism can be
broadly classified as global or local.
1. In global consensus model, the first block of the chain called genesis block is common for all nodes in the
network and every node agrees on the same state of the network and stores the complete chain to validate any
transaction. Most common examples of global consensus blockchain are Bitcoin and Ethereum.
2. In local consensus model, every participant owns an individual genesis block and the consensus is only reached
among the parties involved in the transactions. This local consensus reduces the storage requirements on
individual nodes and is generally more scalable than global consensus counterparts. Example blockchains are
TrustChain [11] and Nano [12].
Most of the current blockchains use some version of the consensus protocol of Bitcoin called Nakamoto consensus [9].
The Nakamato consensus is a global consensus model; it uses proof of work (PoW) for accepting the new block and
dictates to choose the longest chain in case of network partitions. In PoW, miners compete to find a cryptographic hash
that solves a computationally difficult problem and the block proposed by the miner with the correct hash is added to
the chain. Proof of work is resource intensive and inherently non-scalable. Proof of stake (PoS) is an alternative block
validation model where the creator of the new block is chosen in a deterministic way depending on its wealth, also
called the stake [13]. PoS is much more efficient in terms of performance and energy consumption. We are observing a
shift from PoW to PoS or hybrid model in recent blockchains where Ethereum remains a strong proponent.
Smart Contracts
A smart contract represents a self-executing, self-verifying, and tamper-resistant piece of code with programmable
application logic which resides and executes on the blockchain. It formalizes the transaction rules and relationship
among entities and assets in the blockchain and gives the flexibility to write custom application logic which becomes a
law enforced by the blockchain itself without any reliance on trusted intermediaries. Smart contracts form the basis for
trust in the application layer.
From the early days of Bitcoin, it supported a basic scripting language [14] that allowed people to write custom
logic to spend transactions. This language gave the people the flexibility to design primitive contracts. For example,
enforcing a transaction to spend only after a certain time or requiring a multi-party signature to spend a transaction
became possible. Though Bitcoin scripts provided a way to write contracts, it was limited and restrictive. Then, the
blockchains specifically designed to support the execution of custom code came into existence. Ethereum [15] is a
pioneer blockchain explicitly designed as the smart contracts platform. With smart contracts, real-world rules and laws
can be embedded and enforced into the blockchain, and thus developing a decentralized trusted application (DApp)
became a lot easier. Cryptocurrency token and digital assets became the most popular contract applications. Soon an
outburst of DApps was seen contributing to a world-wide blockchain hype. Prediction markets [16] and decentralized
exchanges [17] are some examples which demonstrate the real strength and flexibility of smart contracts.
Apart from Ethereum, there are several other blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts: NEM [18], Hyperledger
Fabric [19], Stellar [20], NEO [21], etc.
Types of blockchain
Blockchain can be public or private depending on the permission level [22], but here we broadly classify it to three
different levels of granularity.
• Public blockchain A public blockchain is permissionless, and anyone can easily participate and validate the
transactions. Transactions are public and anonymous/pseudonymous. The blockchain is maintained by the
public community, so there is the highest level of decentralized trust. Bitcoin is the pioneer public blockchain.
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Waves [23], Dash [24], and Bitshares [25] are few examples of public blockchains.
• Federated blockchain A federated blockchain is a permissioned blockchain operating under the leadership of
a group often called the consortium. Predefined consortium nodes control the consensus. The transactions may
or may not be public. Some examples includes R3 Corda [26], EWF (Energy) [27], and B3i (Insurance) [28].

A PREPRINT- DECEMBER 10, 2018
• Private blockchain A private blockchain is a permissioned blockchain centralized to one governing orga-
nization. Transactions are validated internally and may or may not be public readable. Private blockchains
usually have faster block times and can process higher transaction throughput. However, these are vulnerable
to security breaches. The value of private blockchain can be seen as a trust transformer where trust is based on
an algorithm rather than an authority. Monax [29], HyperLedger with Sawtooth [30], private Ethereum are a
few examples of private blockchains.
Why blockchain?
Trust and traceability are the two basic promises of the blockchain obtained out of the box which solves the generic
trust problem on all public, federated, and organization levels. However, these traits are not always sufficient to
provide a complete solution, which is why we often see blockchain paired with strong cryptographic protocols like
zero-knowledge proofs [31]. This pairing ensures to provide trust, traceability, security, and control which are the core
building blocks for critical solutions in several industries including health care and supply chain. Data recorded in the
blockchain cannot be changed or deleted without leaving a trace. This immutability and traceability of the data is a
critical requirement for any health care system. Thus, the benefits of blockchain seem imminent. Here, we list some of
the core issues/concerns that need to be addressed in health care solutions and later show how blockchain could help in
solving them.
• Secure storage and integrity protection
• Privacy and ownership of data
• Data sharing
• Traceability and accountability of data
While each of these concerns can be addressed separately with the proper use of cryptography and privacy-preserving
technologies, the key concerns in such solutions have always been the governing trust model. In such solutions,
blockchain as a trustful decentralized ledger technology can act as a trust binding glue.
Challenges & Future
Despite the massive potential, there are limitations as of the current state of the blockchain. Currently, every node in
the network processes the transaction which makes the blockchain rather slow and unsuitable to handle real-world
transactions which range in tens of thousands of transactions per second. This disparity highlights the scaling issue that
blockchains have to overcome for wider adoption across all industries. Moreover, with the growth in usage, the size of
blockchain is increasing enormously, making it difficult for normal users to keep the full copy of it. On a positive note,
with huge investment and research efforts invested into blockchain [32], a better scalable blockchain may evolve in the
future.
Decentralization, consistency, and scalability (DCS) are the three desirable properties that blockchain platforms strive
to maintain. A blockchain system can only simultaneously provide two out of three properties; there will always be
a trade-off. Platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum are DC system where they provide sufficient decentralization and
consistency of data but lack scalability. On the other hand, Hyperledger is an example of a CS system which ensures
data consistency and can scale above 10K+ transactions per second at the cost of losing decentralization.
In the last decade, we have observed the evolution of blockchain in three generations. Cryptocurrencies represented the
first 1.0 generation which was primarily designed as an alternative payment system. Then, decentralized applications
based on smart contracts (Dapps) represented the 2.0 applications providing business logic abstraction and execution
on a trusted platform where safety and security of smart contracts is the key issue. Smart contracts which can be
validated and tested before deployment on a live blockchain prevents financial losses due to flaws in the code. The third
generation is taking a pervasive multi-dimensional approach connecting Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and
different branches of science. These different generations of blockchain are evolving simultaneously in their own pace,
addressing the issues like scalability, security, and privacy along the way. Moreover, projects like Holochain [33] and
Hashgraph [34] are developing scalable and general purpose platforms for agent-centric decentralized applications;
traditional blockchains are data-centric making them difficult to scale. We see more of these example use cases in the
following sections.

3 Healthcare Data Management
The management of healthcare data which includes storage, access control, and sharing of the data is an important
aspect of the healthcare industry. Proper management of healthcare data improves healthcare outcomes by allowing
holistic views of patients, personalized treatments, and efficient communication. It is also critical for operating
healthcare industry cost-effectively and efficiently. However, managing healthcare data is a challenging task due
to its sensitive nature and subsequent trust issues. And it is one of the main reasons why the healthcare system is
disconnected—healthcare data and services exist in disparate forms in several silos. This disconnected system is a
culprit for several inefficiencies in healthcare and is a major hurdle for healthcare research. Healthcare professionals
generally do not have access to the complete data of patients, thereby, hampering the subsequent diagnosis and treatment
steps; and researchers struggle to find the desired data for their studies, thereby, slowing down healthcare research.
Blockchain may enable the efficient sharing of healthcare data while ensuring data integrity and protecting patient
privacy. Secure, efficient, cost-effective, and interoperable HIE can be built with its right use alongside with other
technologies. Moreover, the adoption of blockchain can push forward the movement of patient-centric healthcare
model where patients control their healthcare data. The major hurdles behind data-sharing in both patient-centric and
traditional models are lack of trust and lack of incentives to share. The blockchain technology can solve both problems
by acting as a trust layer and introducing the incentive mechanisms such as rewarding crypto tokens for sharing data.
Moreover, blockchain can be the bridge for the integration of medical device data and healthcare internet of things; the
healthcare and lifestyle data collected by wearable devices can be critical for correct diagnosis but are underutilized
since there is a lack of a proper way for a physician to access the patient-generated data.
With blockchain-enabled trust and incentive structure, there is a promise for a global HIE and a marketplace on top
of it. But the lack of common healthcare data standards can be one of the major obstacles to overcome before the
development of an interoperable HIE connecting multiple disparate data silos. However, there is a possibility that the
incentives introduced by blockchain-based data exchange may fuel the creation and the development of the open data
standards. Blockchain-based HIE will be an interesting use case that requires the balance among privacy, transparency,
and efficiency. Moreover, country-specific regulations will be another obstacle for a HIE connecting multiple regulatory
regions. Since patients have full ownership of their healthcare data in many countries, blockchain enabled patient-centric
healthcare data model can be one fitting way to bypass these regulatory challenges.
3.1 Blockchain based projects for healthcare data management
Several projects are focusing on developing some form of blockchain based HIE and providing data and services
marketplace on top of it; see Table 1. Among them, some are targeting general electronic health records (EHR) data
while some are specializing in particular data modalities such as genomics and dermatology. For example, Medrec
[35] is an open source blockchain platform for EHR management. It was recently tested in collaboration with Beth
Israel Deaconess Center. Patientory [36] is one of the early blockchain based healthcare startup leveraging Initial Coin
Offerings (ICO) for funding. It is developing a HIE powered by its own blockchain. HealthSuite Insights of Philips
Healthcare is testing Verifiable Data Exchange Process, a product that enables the secure and traceable data exchange
between the members inside a network of hospitals and universities [37]; all the data exchanges inside the network are
stored in a blockchain alongside the identities of the people performing the exchanges to create an audit trail of the
data exchange. Medshare [38] provides a blockchain based data sharing of electronic medical records among untrusted
parties by introducing data provenance, auditing, and trailing on medical data. Utilizing smart contracts and an access
control system, they claim that their system can effectively trace the behavior of the data and revoke access to violated
rules and permissions on the data. Iryo [39] is creating a global repository of health data in OpenEHR format [40]. See
Table 1 for other similar initiatives on the use of blockchain-based solutions for healthcare data management.
Multiple projects are focusing on particular modalities of data such as genomics and imaging. Genomics, in particular,
has attracted a lot of interest from entrepreneurs and companies probably because of the recent popularity of personal
genome sequencing, the importance of genomics data, and an immense possibility of its monetization. Personal
genomics companies such as 23andMe and AncestryDNA monetize the genetic data by selling access to third parties
such as labs and biotech companies. Several startups such as Encrypgen [60], Nebula Genomics [49], LunaDNA
[50], etc. are developing blockchain based genomics data-exchange platform or network. With the blockchain-based
platforms, they claim to reduce the cost of genome sequencing, to give control of the data to patients, and to share the
value captured from the monetization of the data to patients.

4 Pharmaceutical sector
Pharmaceutical supplies are an important aspect of clinical care and healthcare delivery. In this section, we review the
various innovative applications and initiatives in the pharmaceutical sector, covering the entire spectrum right from
the drug discovery and clinical trials for the market introduction to solutions at the end of the chain like counterfeit
drugs identification and patient adherence to medication. An overview of the reviewed application areas and companies
within those application areas is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Overview of the reviewed application areas for the use cases of blockchain in the pharmaceutical areas. Per application
areas, examples of companies or initiatives involved in that particular area are also provided.
4.1 Drug discovery and Pharmaceutical research
Drug discovery and research take a significant cost on the operations of any pharmaceutical company. With increasing
costs of healthcare, together with the need to innovate faster on new medicinal treatments, it is imperative that multiple
pharmaceutical companies find an approach to collaborate competitively. Blockchain can enable the technological
platform to facilitate the transfer of trusted information and knowledge among multiple parties. The usage of blockchain
for robust digital proof of Intellectual Property (IP) through immutable records and time-stamping is one fitting
proposition for the collaboration. Blockchain-based solutions can also provide mechanisms to share clinical and trial data
competitively. Even under a non-collaborative research and drug development scenario, blockchain provides benefits for
effectively tracking and managing various aspects of clinical trials like data management, consent management, tracking
side-effects of drugs usage, etc. Also, it is not uncommon for a pharmaceutical research company to outsource their
clinical research projects. In this case, blockchain could provide a feasible mechanism to assure data integrity and proper
outcome validation. In the current system, the pharmaceutical companies might have incentives to misrepresent results,
6
A PREPRINT- DECEMBER 10, 2018
e.g. in disclosing the side-effect of new drugs. With an open research ecosystem based on blockchain technology,
research outputs are transparent, and research outputs are validated making the false representation of the results
difficult.
IP management. Many blockchain based solutions for IP management have been proposed in the generic space,
which can also be applied for the innovations in drug development. An example, in this case, is the ambition to
use blockchain backed electronic lab notebook solutions from Labii [61]. Bernstein [62] provides a blockchain
based management of digital trails with timestamping to safeguard priorities in IP; this feature can be beneficial in
collaborative pharmaceutical research. A solution from iPlexus [63] uses blockchain to make any unpublished and
published data from drug development studies readily available for use. Blockchain solves the puzzle of maintaining
trust and protecting IPs to enable such a groundbreaking initiative and framework.
Clinical Trials. Blockchain also has use cases in the management of the clinical trial process for pharmaceutical
research. Recently, IEEE Standard Association [64] organized a forum on Blockchain for Clinical Trial with the aim
to use blockchain to make innovations in patient recruitment, ensure data integrity, and make rapid advances in drug
development. Scrybe [65], a blockchain project presented in the forum, enables an efficient and trusted mechanism to
expedite the clinical trials and research process. Of others, it allows an easy and transparent framework for legal and
ethical validations of the trial process by the auditors. The work in [66] shows how blockchain can be used to manage
the consent, data, and outcome from a clinical trial in a trustful and open manner. Such innovations in clinical trial
rollout and management are crucial for advancements in pharmaceutical research. A lot of clinical trials run over the
budget and timelines. Competitive sharing of clinical and trial data can accelerate research and discovery. Such sharing
of data can be enabled with blockchain, using example approaches as discussed in Section 3.
Further, the research aspect of pharmaceuticals is quite broad that pervades the drug discovery process to device
manufacturers and clinical trial outcomes. A solution across this spectrum is provided by BlockRX [67] using so-called
advanced digital ledger technology (ADLT). The overarching goal is to inter-connect the currently disconnected parties
in silos.
4.2 Supply chain and Counterfeit drugs detection
The importance of the supply chain in the medical industry cannot be overstated. Right from the raw materials and
production, to different stages of storage and distribution, proper monitoring and tracking are required to ensure
optimal and intended usage. One of the growing concerns in recent years is that of counterfeit drugs. There must be a
mechanism for the end users and all the stakeholders of the supply chain to verify the ingredients of a drug. With lack of
a proper tracking mechanism, there are ample weak links in the supply chain where the drug can be tampered with, or a
counterfeit drug can be infused in the supply. To address this growing concern, new regulations have been brought forth
to have all stakeholders of the medicine supply chain provide a robust mechanism to track and trace the pharmaceutical
supplies that pass through them. Blockchain provides a perfectly fitting solution to this need for tracing and tracking,
where this information has to be maintained in an open yet safe and tamper-proof system accessible to multiple parties.
Many solutions have therefore been proposed using blockchain to track the supply chain of pharmaceutical supplies.
The MediLedger project [68] is building an open network for the pharmaceutical supply chain. The network is a
permissioned blockchain for the partners involved in the supply chain of pharmaceuticals. The concept is in line with
the track and trace regulations. The law requires a way to track prescription drugs through the entire supply chain
using interoperable systems, which MediLedger, a project launched by Pharma giants like Pfizer and Genentech, is
proposing to solve using blockchain technology. One of the most ambitious projects in this space is Ambrosus [69] with
its flagship product AMB-net, a blockchain based IoT network for supply chain targeted for food and pharmaceutical
industries. On top of AMB-net, companies can build their custom supply chain solutions. MODsense T1 from Modum
[70] provides a temperature sensor for monitoring the conditions in the supply chain of pharmaceuticals, helping meet
the regulatory requirements on Good Distribution Practice (GDP) of medicinal products for human use. The sensor data
and other digital records are maintained using a blockchain. Several other blockchain based solutions in the supply
chain industry also list the pharmaceutical industry as their primary application areas. BlockVerify [71], for example,
list pharmaceuticals as one of the main application areas for their supply chain solution preventing counterfeits. In the
provided solution, the history of the goods is recorded with the BlockVerify tag on a blockchain.
An overview of some of the initiatives of blockchain enabled supply chain solutions for the pharmaceutical applications
is given in Table 2.

potential usage of blockchain for pharmaceutical supply chain solutions.
4.3 Prescription management
Proper management of prescription is important to ensure the best healthcare service delivery. Misuse of the prescription
has been rampant in recent years leading to large-scale problems like Opioid crisis [79] . Many blockchain based
solutions have been proposed to remove the impediments on proper prescription management.
BlockMedx [80] is using an Ethereum based platform to securely manage prescription processes where all transactions
are all securely stored in a blockchain. After a doctor issues a prescription to a patient, the designated pharmacist can
verify it via blockchain before issuing the drugs. This system makes the management of controlled drug prescriptions
like opioid efficient. Project Heisenberg [81] is another example of an application using smart contracts on top of
Ethereum to track prescriptions. It provides separate portals for patients, doctors, and pharmacies for their stake into the
prescription process. ScriptDrop [82] works on streamlining pharmacy delivery to patients. They deliver the drugs to
the patients, relieving them of the burden of having to show up at the pharmacy for their medications. They also track
the usage of medicine (adherence) using virtual assistants. ScriptDrop is using blockchain to track the information about
adherence and delivery. ScalaMed [83] offers a blockchain based solution from for medical adherence and tracking of
all prescriptions (including historical) around a patient-centric model. It describes the solution as a digital prescription
inbox which will solve issues related to medicine mismanagement. Think about the prescription from your general
practitioner that you had in the recent past which might be problematic for your current ongoing treatment at a hospital.
In the current system, it is challenging to have these different data points in one place that is accessible to the patient and
this, in turn, could lead to undesirable incidents. The solution from ScalaMed brings all the information about current
and past prescriptions into a central place which helps avoid situations causing cross-reactions of the prescription drugs.
Though several blockchain based solutions are being investigated for prescription management, some centralized
conventional system could also provide a solution for certain markets where the involved parties are very few. Close
collaboration and joint tool for use by the clinician and pharmacy, where possible, e.g. due to enforcement by regulations,
could envision a simple solution like a single sign-on into a common database to have an overview of a patient’s
medication.

4.4 Billing Claims Management
Financial aspects of medical care are inherently important in the healthcare landscape. This area of financing aspect in
healthcare is rife with inefficiencies, mostly related to the trust and transparency, which can potentially be optimized by
the use of blockchain. Blockchain provides a mechanism for direct links between patients (one who makes claims) with
the bearers (one who clears the claim), as there is trust inbuilt. Smart contracts can be used in the premium negotiating
phases. Data regarding the current health status, medication usage, lifestyle, etc. tied through blockchain to evolving
premiums, through smart contracts. When many parties or intermediaries are involved in the claim handling, there
might be a lot of repetitive tasks and checks involved which might be burdensome for the end customer.
After seeing these opportunities for improvements, some propositions have been brought forth using blockchain for
billing claims management and broader financial aspect of care delivery. Gem [84] is using Ethereum to streamline the
claim management in healthcare services, among others. It brings the patients, providers, and the insurers together
into one ecosystem to provide real-time insights into patient’s health journey and ease health claims management.
Change healthcare [85] is using the HyperLedger Fabric framework [19] for blockchain based claims and revenue
management. HSBlox has unveiled its RevBlox(TM) and CuraBlox(TM) product [86] for claims management built on
top of their blockchain platform dubbed SETU (Simplified Exchange and Transparency for Users). Besides the trust
and openness provided by the blockchain, the company uses machine learning to facilitate an automatic decision on top
of claims, for instance, duplicate claim detection or pattern identification of claim denials. Dockchain from Pokidot [87]
provides blockchain-based financial data processing in a clinical setting, using features like smart contracts. Multiple
healthcare companies, including insurers like Humana and UnitedHealthcare, have been working on a pilot program
[88] using blockchain to maintain and share curated information from healthcare providers. This feature can solve a lot
of redundancies and inefficiencies related to insurance claims management. An overview of example initiatives on the
use of blockchain enabled solutions for billing and claim management in the healthcare field is outlined in Table 3.

procedure to expected clinical outcome, motivating the providers for a
first time right medical treatment.
Quantum Medical Transport collaboration
with River Oaks Billing Associates [95]
The collaboration is using blockchain based solution for medical billing
payments, mostly to make such transactions secure.
It is to be noted that while blockchain provides a technological medium for multiple parties to transact with trust, some
building blocks would need to be there to facilitate such a transaction. A simple example of this case is the need of
standard data formats so that information can be easily exchanged in regard to health conditions, treatments made, and
corresponding claims. If a common language is enforced in the underlying blockchain, then the onus is on the multiple
parties involved (hospitals, insurers, etc.) to bear the translation overhead from their domain language to the common
lingua.

A PREPRINT- DECEMBER 10, 2018
5 Analytics
Blockchain can have a huge positive impact on all three pillars of analytics: data, model, and computation.
Data
Access to the right data is the key to better analytics. Data are more valuable than algorithms, and this is especially true
in healthcare due to the sensitive nature of healthcare data. With blockchain-enabled HIE, researchers and analytics
companies can efficiently acquire the desired data for analysis. Also, confidence in the quality and attribute of the
acquired data increases if its provenance is tracked by blockchain. Not only data but the analytics process, for example,
training and validation of prediction models, can also be tracked using blockchain. This tracking feature can increase the
confidence of healthcare professionals and regulatory entities such as FDA on the prediction models, thereby increasing
their probability of being used in the clinical setting.
Model
Multiple model predictions can be pooled using a blockchain network to create a final robust model; prediction of
an ensemble of models is usually more correct than individual predictions. Also, incentive features such as crypto
assets and reputation scores can be used to encourage participation and submission of better models. For example,
Numerai [96] is a hedge fund which utilizes crowd-sourced machine learning for financial predictions. A similar
mechanism can be set up in health care for use cases such as early detection of cancer. Modelchain [97] has proposed
a framework for crowd-sourced machine learning while preserving patient information; inside a private blockchain
network, participating sites share only model parameters which are used to build the final model. In addition to the
prediction models, the predictions can come from individuals where correct predictions are rewarded while incorrect
ones are penalized. This mechanism can be utilized in public health, for example, to predict the outbreak of epidemic
diseases. For example, using Augur [16] which is a decentralized prediction platform, a bet has been created to predict
the spread of human-borne Nipah virus in United States [98].
Computation
With the increase in data quantity and model complexity, the demand for computing resources is rapidly increasing.
Research centers and analytics companies either have in-house computing servers or use computing services from
Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. With the introduction of the blockchain, decentralized computation has become the
third option. Recently there has been few promising projects developing open-source p2p computation platforms such as
Golem [99], SONM [100], etc. They have released some early products and have a consistent user base, although a tiny
one. One of the key challenges in decentralized computation is preserving data privacy while performing computation
on them, and it is particularly important in healthcare. Companies such as Enigma [101] and Oasis Labs [102] are
developing solutions for privacy-preserving computation on blockchain. Compared to traditional cloud computing
services, blockchain promises cheaper computation with greater data security and removes the need of vendor lock-in.
However, the blockchain-based solutions are still in the early stages and need to prove their claims in practice.
6 Telemedicine
Telemedicine is another area in healthcare that can benefit from blockchain technology by introducing a trust layer
between patients and healthcare professionals. Blockchain-based telemedicine platform can validate professional
identity and data integrity, ensure transparency and traceability, and incentivize the players to act fairly by providing
incentive metrics such as reputation scores and crypto tokens. Successful development of such platforms may create a
global healthcare marketplace in the future effectively balancing the global supply and demand of healthcare resources
and needs. In addition, such a network can incorporate the software services such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) if the
AI models are properly validated, regulated, and their performance continuously quantified by some proxy measures.
Within telemedicine, it is likely that the remote diagnostic services will be at the forefront of blockchain adoption. It
can be expected that diagnostic services solely based on quantitative and qualitative interpretation of medical data in the
absence of a patient will be first to adopt blockchain technology successfully. A large number of startups in this area
corroborates this anticipation. And many of these startups are targeting the services where the diagnosis of a medical
condition is based on interpretation of patient-generated imaging data such as dermatology. We found the projects
focusing on skin images unusually high in number, most probably due to its close relationship with the beauty industry
in addition to the above-mentioned reasons. See Table 4 for a non-comprehensive list of projects working on blockchain
based telemedicine platforms.

7 Consulting and Blockchain as a service (BaaS)
Several companies are developing services that can be utilized by existing healthcare organizations to benefit from
blockchain. Pokidok [89] provides platform as a service to healthcare organizations to integrate blockchain in
their existing legacy systems. Their primary services are identity and access management and benefits and claims
management. Hashed Health [103] provides expertise and services to healthcare enterprises to create new blockchain-
based solutions and integrate them with existing systems. Factom [92] is an enterprise-focused blockchain company
that offers solutions such as Harmony Connect and Harmony Integrate; these solutions enable existing applications
with blockchain capabilities such as trust and data integrity without the need to deal with blockchain components
such as cryptocurrencies, wallets, or network nodes. IBM [104] has introduced IBM Blockchain Platform on top of
Hyperledger Fabric [19] which allows users to create their own blockchain solutions. Guardtime provides blockchain
based solutions through its KSI technology stack [105]. Recently together with Instant Access Medical and Healthcare
Gateway, it launched a blockchain-supported personal care record platform called MyPCR [106]. SSOT Health [107] is
developing a platform to create healthcare blockchains based in Hyperledger.
8 Challenges
Although blockchain holds tremendous potential to improve and add value to the healthcare system and several
companies have already started testing it for specific use cases, there are several challenges to be tackled before its
mainstream usage. There are various facets to the challenges on the mainstream adoption of the blockchain technology.
These facets are for example:
• Technical
• Legal
• Business
• Trust issues
In this section, we touch upon some of the challenges to be expected for the widespread usage of the blockchain
technology in the healthcare sector.
8.1 Interoperability & integration with the legacy systems
Healthcare space has a vast number of technologies, devices, and components, not forgetting the personnel, which
all come together to solve the current needs in the space. There are large rooms for improvements, with blockchain
technology providing a promise to cover up some of this room. However, the blockchain technology would still be
just one piece, though likely very crucial, of the puzzle. The blockchain technology has to integrate well with existing
systems, and the integration is going to be a challenging ordeal because of several reasons such as interoperability. That
the healthcare space has multiple numbers of devices and device types make it even more difficult. All relevant parties
and stakeholders should all come together to make the use of blockchain technology more pervasive in healthcare. If
blockchain cannot be a catalyst for this cooperation between stakeholders and relevant parties, then it probably does not
have much value above and beyond being a simple and useful tool to solve some issues around trust. Many of the other
issues around ecosystem building will still be there, regardless of the blockchain. An important aspect of this discussion
also relates to the training of healthcare IT personnel. These personnel might be needed to be re-trained on blockchain
technology if the blockchain technology would enter into the healthcare space.
8.2 Adoption and incentives for participation
As discussed, adoption of blockchain technology in the healthcare space would require co-ordination and co-operation
of multiple stakeholders. These stakeholders, for example, could be the hospital, device manufacturers, care personnel,
11
A PREPRINT- DECEMBER 10, 2018
patients, etc. As the adoption of blockchain technology would require co-operation from multiple stakeholders, with
some changes in each of these stakeholder’s current operational and business model, it would be natural for these
stakeholders to expect some incentive to participate in the change process. In order to manage these expectations, new
business models must be explored that can provide fair incentives to all the stakeholders. The provided incentives
should acknowledge the costs and efforts in deploying or adopting a blockchain based technologies, along with any
underlying changes in the operational model that the deployed solution entails. Consider the solution for blockchain
based patient data management. In this particular scenario, a fair incentive scheme must be devised in a sustainable
business model that can be accepted by the patients, device manufactures, backend IT solution providers, hospitals, etc.
As this application is still evolving, it would be some time before proven robust incentive models are aplenty. In the
meantime, any associated risk of a particular incentive model must be rigorously assessed and quantified as much as
possible.
8.3 Uncertain cost of operation
While blockchain has promising features such as no need of central authority (and hence no central point of failure),
transparency and relatively fast settlement of transactions, the cost of operating blockchain systems are not yet known.
Today, a significant amount of resources in healthcare is being spent on personnel, time, and money to build and manage
the current traditional information systems and data exchanges. On top of that, there is an overhead of continuously
updating the systems, troubleshooting issues, performing backups, worrying about hacks and data breaches. The
blockchain-based HIE system could prove itself to be cost-effective and more efficient compared to the traditional
HIE system. This, for example, could come due to the enhanced security by design. Nonetheless, the overall cost
factors involved in a blockchain technology-based healthcare services must be robustly assessed in a given business and
operational model of a healthcare organization.
8.4 Regulation
A solution in the healthcare space needs to adhere to a various set of regulations as the patient’s health and even life
is at stake, directly or indirectly. Further, as it concerns health data, the concerns regarding data privacy are also the
highest. The blockchain technology being a new technological solution that is being adopted among the early users,
one of the challenges remain on how the solutions on top of blockchain technology comply with existing regulations
and standards. While existing HIE systems have multiple years to evolve towards meeting the regulatory requirements,
the blockchain technology might be still in the evolution phase to find the sweet landing spot within the healthcare
space where it can also adequately adhere to set healthcare standards and regulations. To achieve this, a number of pilot
deployments and rigorous test and validation of the underlying technological pieces must be considered by the solution
providers. The requirements to adhere to regulations could also be an impetus for further technological advancements
in the blockchain technology.
The requirements from recently enforced General Data Protection Rule (GDPR) is one of the cases which is leading
discussion and thoughts on how blockchain technology can further evolve to comply with set regulations. Blockchain
and GDPR has a dual relationship. On the one hand, GDPR, as an example, enforces provisions like the right to
erasure/right to be forgotten, giving a person (data originator) full right and control over his or her data which directly
conflicts with the immutable nature of blockchain. Healthcare data are generally stored off-chain and only pointers
to the data, usually, its cryptographic hash, is stored in the blockchain. This approach provides a way to make a
blockchain application GDPR compliant. However, one can always argue that the cryptographic hash can still be
considered a form of the personal data which is a separate discussion in itself. Over time better trade-offs are bound to
come where regulatory compliance feeds very well to only evolution and maturity of blockchain technology for even
more widespread adoption. At this point, it is wise to consider incorporating GDPR like regulations in blockchain
applications. On the other hand, from a decentralization perspective, regulations like GDPR and blockchain are perfect
partners. With the increasing awareness among users about their personal data and enforcement of privacy regulations,
there has been a surge in the interest around the patient-controlled health care data. Given the existence of user-friendly
applications for management of the personal data with proper security and incentive structures, individuals can have
access and control to their healthcare data and can participate in p2p global data-exchange required for healthcare
research and services, all powered by blockchain.
8.5 Governance
The basic premise of the distributed nature of blockchain helps to bring multiple parties into a trusted transaction
scheme, without the need of any centralized authorities. However, if we consider how healthcare organizations operate,
there can be several different operational models. In certain operational models of blockchain based solutions, it might
12
A PREPRINT- DECEMBER 10, 2018
be imperative to have a certain stakeholder assuming the role of a regulator to govern the overall operation of the
blockchain. This governing model might, for example, be needed to meet the regulatory requirements. It is not yet clear
how such a governance structure can be managed properly in a system with multiple disparate parties. This aspect of
governance will also have a tie-in with the intended incentive schemes. However, as the adoption of blockchain based
solutions will evolve in the healthcare space, we would see various solutions also to the requirements of governance.
8.6 Scaling
Not only in healthcare but any industry, the underlying blockchain network has to be scalable for successful application
of any blockchain-based solutions. It is likely that, at least in the early phase, several solutions in healthcare will use
semi-permissioned blockchains which are scalable and have high transaction throughput at the cost of decentralization.
However, there will still be a need for public blockchains for communication among permissioned blockchain networks.
Besides, a blockchain-enabled global HIE can only be possible with highly scalable public blockchains. In current
form, public blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are not fast and cheap enough to host any decentralized
applications on a large scale. However, there have been several ongoing scaling efforts such as lightning network, state
channels, plasma chains, sharding, zk-snarks, etc. and some of them are already being adopted in practice. In the future,
it is likely that the public blockchains will be fast and cheap enough for their mass adoption.
9 Conclusion
Blockchain technology has the potential to solve several problems plaguing the healthcare industry today. As a trust
mediator, it can enable novel healthcare solutions; and as an incentive machine, it can enable novel business models
that may lead to a new dynamic among various healthcare stakeholders like patients and providers. For example, a
patient-centric healthcare model and a global HIE might be realized by virtue of blockchain enabled decentralized trust
and incentive structures. Similarly, blockchain based decentralized network/services may minimize vendor lock-in
problems in healthcare.
In this document, we reviewed major use cases of blockchain such as healthcare data management, supply chain
management in the pharmaceutical industry, medication adherence, billing/claims management, analytics, etc. Examples
of organizations developing blockchain-based applications for these use cases were also presented. The proposed
applications range from moonshot projects trying to build a complete decentralized health care ecosystem to specific
applications such as data provenance, counterfeit drugs identification, consent management, etc.
Despite the immense potential of blockchain technology and an enormous amount of interest around it, we found that
its impact on healthcare is minimal and is still in the early days. Most of the blockchain based healthcare solutions are
still in the form of novel concepts represented by whitepapers, prototypes, or only a very small number of working
products with a limited user base. However, the field is evolving rapidly; we anticipate a significant positive impact
of blockchain in healthcare in the future. Challenges such as interoperability, integration with the existing systems,
uncertainty in cost, technological and adoption barrier, regulatory compliance, and scaling have to be successfully
tackled to help blockchain make its mark in the healthcare industry.

intermediaries and the lack of traceability of transactions. To mention a few:
healthcare data is fragmented across several silos negatively affecting
research and services, about half of the clinical trials are never reported,
the cost of drug discovery is ever increasing, and substandard and fake
medicines are still a huge problem. Blockchain has the potential to solve these
problems as it provides trust without any intermediaries, has traceability as a
default feature, and promises new business models by enabling novel incentive
structures. Due to its potential, blockchain has gathered significant interest
in the healthcare industry. In this paper, we review major use cases of
blockchain in healthcare: patient data management, pharmaceutical research,
supply chain management of medical goods, prescription management, billing
claims management, analytics, and telemedicine alongside the related projects.
We found that most of the blockchain projects are limited as white-papers,
proof of concepts, and products with a limited user base. However, we observed
that the quantity, quality, and maturity of the projects are increasing. We
also discuss technical, regulatory, and business challenges to the adoption of
blockchain in the healthcare industryComment: 17 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables, white pape","['text', 'Computer Science - Computers and Society']",disabled

Abstract 
Blockchain, the foundation of Bitcoin, has become one of the most popular technologies to 
create and manage digital transactions recently. It serves as an immutable ledger which allows 
transactions take place in a decentralized manner. This expeditiously evolving technology has 
the potential to lead to a shift in thinking about digital transactions in multiple sectors including, 
Internet of Things, healthcare, energy, supply chain, manufacturing, cybersecurity and 
principally financial services. However, this emerging technology is still in its infancy. Despite 
the huge opportunities blockchain offers, it suffers from challenges and limitation such as 
scalability, security, and privacy, compliance, and governance issues that have not yet been 
thoroughly explored and addressed. Although there are some studies on the security and privacy 
issues of the blockchain, they lack a systematic examination of the security of blockchain 
systems. This research conducted a systematic survey of the security threats to the blockchain 
systems and reviewed the existing vulnerabilities in the Blockchain. These vulnerabilities lead to 
the execution of the various security threats to the normal functionality of the Blockchain 
platforms. Moreover, the study provides a case-study for each attack by examining the popular 
blockchain systems and also reviews possible countermeasures which could be used in the 
development of various blockchain systems. Furthermore, this study developed taxonomies that 
classified the security threats and attacks based on the blockchain abstract layers, blockchain 
primary processes and primary business users. This would assist the developers and businesses to 
be attentive of the existing threats in different areas of the blockchain-based platforms and plan 
accordingly to mitigate risk. Finally, summarized the critical open challenges, and suggest future 
research directions.

Chapter I: Introduction 
 A Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger or database that facilitate the process 
of recording transaction (digital events) in the business network (Swan, 2015). In other words, A 
Blockchain is a distributed, transactional database that is shared across all the nodes participating 
in the network. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the 
participants in the network. Once the transaction is verified in the block and added to the 
blockchain, it is nearly impossible to erase or mutate the records. Bitcoin is the first 
implementation of Blockchain, introduced in 2009 (Nakamoto, n.d.). Bitcoin is a 
cryptographically secure electronic payment system, or cryptocurrency, that uses peer-to-peer 
(P2P) technology, and it operates without any trusted third-party authority such as a bank, or any 
other centralized institutes. The owner of Bitcoin can use it anywhere, at any time without 
involving any centralized authority. Since the introduction of Bitcoin, Blockchain has shown 
promising application prospects and attracted a lot of attention from both academia and industry. 
The reason for interest in the Blockchain is its features that provide security, anonymity, and data 
integrity, without any third-party involvement in the transaction control. 
Blockchain technique has been applied in many other disciplines, including Internet of 
Things, healthcare, supply chain, software engineering, cybersecurity and so on. With the 
introduction of smart contracts, blockchain marks the start of blockchain 2.0 era. A smart 
contract is a computer program that directly controls the transfer of assets between parties under 
the specific conditions. A smart contract not only defines rules and penalties around an 
agreement in the same way as a traditional contract does, but it can also automatically enforce 
those obligations. Ethereum is a next generation smart contract and decentralized application 
9 
 
platform, leveraging the blockchain, that introduced the smart contract (Buterin, 2014). 
Ethereum is now the most widely used smart contract platform. 
Since blockchain technology has already attracted many industries, specifically the 
FinTech (Financial Technology) industry, but there are some core challenges still creates huge 
concerns such as security, privacy, scalability, compliance, and governance.  
 According to CoinCapMarket site, there are currently 1560 Blockchain based projects 
operating and providing various services. These platforms offer services including, financial 
services, smart economy, IoT, green energy, online education, social media, audit, cloud 
computing, engineering, healthcare, cybersecurity and many others. With the market 
capitalization of 117 billion dollars (April 7, 2018) Bitcoin is the top cryptocurrency, which is a 
distinct target of adversaries. Ethereum is the second largest used blockchain platform which 
provides smart contracts. Most of the existing blockchains platforms are either based on the 
Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain protocols. 
Why are hackers increasingly focusing on blockchain based platforms? From the 
business perspective, there are four attack surfaces in the blockchain platforms. (1) Most the 
existing blockchain platforms provide digital currencies (cryptocurrencies) for monetary 
purposes to charge their services. For instance, Sia-blockchain based decentralize storage 
platform, requires individuals to pay in Sia coin to rent the storage. Furthermore, to buy digital 
currency (suppose Sia coins) digital currency exchanges are used. (2) Cryptocurrency exchanges 
are businesses that allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as 
conventional fiat money, or other digital currencies. (3) Moreover, some of the proof-of-work 
based-blockchain platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and others, need mining to authenticate 
10 
 
transactions and release new coins, as there is no central authority like Bank to take care of these 
functions. (4) To access coins, users need their private keys. Private keys are stored in wallets, 
and the wallet provides the services of holding users’ private keys and also create transactions 
(on user’s behalf) in the blockchain systems. As we can see, the above four areas of blockchain 
platforms (cryptocurrency, exchanges, mining, and wallet) involve interaction with money, and it 
encourages adversaries to perform various high-profit hacks and theft. Although blockchain is 
considered as a tamper-proof ledger, still, different security and privacy threats involve in 
blockchain platforms, which makes financial services industry wondering whether blockchain 
technology can be made secure enough from criminals.  
Problem Statement 
 Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, there are almost 1560 blockchain-based platforms on 
the market. These blockchain-based platforms serve either directly as an electronic payment 
system (Bitcoin) or use digital currency for financial purposes to charge their services 
(Ethereum). The use of digital currency (cryptocurrency) by almost every public blockchain 
platforms has grown the economy of cryptocurrencies at an enormous rate, and it’s now worth 
about $259 billions of dollars. The market capitalization for Bitcoin itself now worth about $117 
billion dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of cryptocurrencies motivates 
adversaries to exploit the weakness in these platforms for profit, and researchers to discover new 
vulnerabilities in the systems, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends.  
Various attacks including double-spending, transaction malleability, Sybil attack, attacks 
on Blockchain network, attacks on mining pools, bugs in smart contracts and in wallets software 
create huge security and privacy concerns in the market. The research (Luu & Velner, n.d.), 
11 
 
discovered that among 19,366 exiting Ethereum smart contracts, 8,833 of them are vulnerable, 
including the DAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 60. Hacker exploits a 
recursive calling vulnerability in DAO. 
Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, Japan, reported losses of USD 4.6 million 
due to hack (transaction mutability in Bitcoin) in April 2013 (Park & Park, 2017). Mt. Gox, 
which had already suffered losses due to hacking, again reported losses of 470 million dollars’ 
worth Bitcoin due to hacking in February 2014 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Bitfinex a 
Hong-Kong-based bitcoin exchange reporting losses of USD 65 million due to hacking in 
August 2015 (Park & Park, 2017). Recently on January 26, 2018, Japan-based Coincheck, one of 
the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, was hacked and loss of USD 534 million worth 
XEM, the native cryptocurrency of NEM (Asia, 2018). According to the Imperva Incapsula, a 
cloud-based service provider, report (Q3 2017 Global DDoS Threat Landscape), more than 73% 
of all bitcoin sites using the Imperva services were attacked in the third quarter of 2017 (“Global 
DDoS Threat Landscape | Q3 2017 | Incapsula,” n.d.). 
Nature and Significance of the Problem  
 Although there are some studies on the security and privacy issues of the blockchain, 
they lack a systematic examination of the security of blockchain systems. This research 
conducted a systematic survey of the security threats to the blockchain systems and surveyed the 
related attacks. It also provides a case-study for each attack by examining the popular blockchain 
systems and also reviews possible countermeasures which could be used in the development of 
various blockchain systems. Finally, this study classifies each of the security threats and its 
attack vectors based on the blockchain abstract layers, blockchain primary processes and primary 
12 
 
targets (business perspective). This systematic study would help the blockchain developers and 
researchers, and businesses in understanding the nature of the various security threats. For 
instance, the security threats that could affect the different layers of the blockchain systems or 
blockchain processes, and finally the targeted business users.

Definition of Terms 
Blockchain terminologies (“Comprehensive Blockchain Glossary,” n.d.). 
• Blockchain: A blockchain is a shared ledger where transactions are permanently 
recorded by appending blocks. 
• Block: Blocks are packages of data that carry permanently recorded data on the 
blockchain. A collection of transactions gathered into a block that can then be hashed 
and added to the blockchain. 
• Bitcoin: Bitcoin is the first decentralized, open source cryptocurrency that runs on a 
global peer to peer network. It is the first application of blockchain. 
14 
 
• Cryptocurrency. Also called digital currency, or tokens, are representations of 
digital assets. 
• Central Ledger. A ledger maintained by a central agency. 
• Distributed Ledger: Ledgers in which data is stored across a network of 
decentralized nodes. A distributed ledger does not have to have its own currency and 
may be permissioned and private. 
• Address: Cryptocurrency addresses are used to send or receive transactions on the 
network. 
• Mining: Mining is the act of validating blockchain transactions. The necessity of 
validation warrants an incentive for the miners, usually in the form of coins. It is also 
called block reward. 
• Difficulty: This refers to how easily a data block of transaction information can be 
mined successfully. 
• Fork: Forks create an alternative version of the blockchain, leaving two blockchains 
to run simultaneously on different parts of the network. 
• Node: A copy of the ledger operated by a participant of the blockchain network. 
• Consensus: Consensus achieved when all participants of the network agree on the 
validity of the transactions, ensuring that the ledger are exact copies of each other. 
Principles of Information Security, 5th edition, defined following terminologies as: 
• Vulnerability: Weakness or fault that can lead to an exposure.  
• Threat: Generic term for objects, people, other entity that represent a constant danger 
to an asset (via attacks). 
15 
 
• Threat agent: Specific object, person who pose a potential danger (by carrying out an 
attack). DDoS attack is a threat; if a hacker carries out a DDoS attack, he is a threat 
agent. 
• Vector: How the attack was carried out, e.g., malicious email attachment. 
• Exposure:  A successful attack. 
• Incident: Any attack, or all attacks using vulnerability X, etc. 
• Risk: Probability that “something bad” happens times expected damage to the 
organization.

Chapter II: Background and Review of Literature  
 This chapter discussed the concept of the blockchain including the key characteristics, 
applications, types of blockchain, how blockchain works, and consensus mechanisms. 
Furthermore, the chapter discussed the efforts that have been put so far various researchers study 
and addressed the security and privacy aspects of the blockchain  
Blockchain Overview  
Blockchain definitions: Different perspectives. Blockchain is a public electronic 
ledger, similar to the relational database, that can be openly shared among the different users and 
that creates an unchangeable record of their transactions, each one time-stamped and linked to 
the previous one (Mearian, 2018). Each digital record or transaction in the thread is called a 
block, and it allows either an open or specific set of users to participate in the digital ledger. 
Blockchain can only be updated by consensus between the participants in the network, and when 
new data is entered, it can never be changed or erased which provides high data integrity in the 
blockchain. The blockchain contains a verifiable record of each and every transaction ever made 
in the system. 
Bitcoin is the first application of Blockchain and the Bitcoin based Blockchain is a public 
ledger system that maintain the integrity of transaction. Satoshi Nakamoto the founder of Bitcoin 
defines Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash that allows online payments to be sent directly 
from one party to another without going through a financial institute (Nakamoto, n.d.).  
According to Don and Alex Tapscott “The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of 
economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but 
17 
 
virtually everything of value.” Virtually anything of value can be tangible assets like cash, car, 
house or intangible such as copyrights, patents, or branding.  
From network perspective, Blockchain is distributed file system where participants keep 
copies of the file and agree on the changes by consensus. The file is composed of blocks and 
each block includes a set of transactions plus main data that includes, timestamp and a 
cryptographic signature (hash) of the previous block, hash of the current block, and some other 
information. The hash of the previous block ties the current block to the previous block and also 
the subsequent blocks will require the hash of the current block, so these all block are chained 
together. If anything in the block is modified, one could compute its hash and will find a 
different value as the stated one and will not accept the block. Thus, including the previous 
block’s hash in the current block integrates the entire system history into the current block. 
The blockchain is commonly used for data storage. The data could be financial 
transactions, which are recorded in the digital ledger and it is replicated across a number of 
systems in almost real-time. The blockchain (digital ledger) usually exists over a peer-to-peer 
network and uses cryptography and digital signatures to prove identity, authenticity and enforce 
read/write access rights. The digital ledger can be written by the certain participants and can be 
read by a broader audience. Each block in the blockchain is cryptographically linked with the 
previous block which makes it hard to change the historical records or at least make it easy to 
detect when someone is trying to tamper (Zheng, Xie, Dai, Chen, & Wang, 2017).    
The key characteristics of Blockchain technology are, decentralization, immutability, 
anonymity, persistency and auditability. Blockchain technology is an integrated multi-field 
infrastructure, that contains cryptography, mathematics, Algorithm and economical model, peer-
18 
 
to-peer networks and using distributed consensus algorithms to solve the traditional database 
synchronization problem (Zheng et al., 2017). 
Key Characteristics of Blockchain  
Digital. All the information on blockchain is digitized, eliminating the need of manual 
documentation. 
Distributed. Transactions are grouped into blocks for processing and standard network 
protocol ensures every node (participant) receives every transaction in near real-time and applies 
the same rules. Blockchain is designed to be distribute and synchronized across the networks, 
which makes it ideal for multi-organizational business networks such as supply chain or financial 
associations. It also encourages organizations to come out from behind their firewalls and share 
data (Pattison, 2017). 
Decentralization. All participants (nodes) have own copy of all data in the system and 
no need for a central authority. This helps to obtain no single point of vulnerability or failure. In 
conventional centralized transaction system, each transaction needs to be validated through a 
central authority (e.g., bank) which requires some service fees, time and performance bottlenecks 
at the central servers. However, there is no central authority in the blockchain network, and no 
middle man/authority service fees is required, and also make the transaction faster. Consensus 
algorithms used to maintain data consistency in decentralized, distributed network (Zheng et al., 
2017). 
Immutability. Data is immutable in the blockchain. Once the participants agreed on a 
transaction and recorded, it is nearly impossible to delete or rollback transactions once they are 
included in the blockchain. If someone try to subsequently record another transaction about that 
19 
 
asset to change its state, but s/he cannot hide the original transaction. This gives the idea of 
provenance of assets, which means that for any asset you can tell where it is, where it has been 
and what has happened throughout its life (Pattison, 2017). 
Consensus. There are standard algorithm/mechanism used to ensure all nodes agree on 
the integrity of transaction data in the system, replacing the need for a trusted third party. Before 
one can execute a transaction, there must be an agreement between all the participants that the 
transaction is valid. This process is known as “consensus” and it helps keep inaccurate or 
fraudulent transactions out of the blockchain. Blocks that includes invalid transactions could be 
revealed immediately. 
Anonymity. Each user can interact with the blockchain with a generated address, which 
does not reveal the real identity of the user, but participants can see the transaction (Zheng et al., 
2017). It is arguable the bitcoin blockchain cannot guarantee the perfect privacy preservation due 
to its intrinsic constraints but there are some other alternative blockchain protocols that claims 
for providing highest privacy.  
Traceable. Every transaction added to a public or private blockchain is digitally signed 
and timestamped, which means that organization can trace back to a specific time for each 
transaction and identify the corresponding party (through their public address) on the blockchain 
(Swan, 2015). So, every block is immutably and verifiably linked to the previous block. A full 
history can always be reconstructed right back to the beginning (the genesis block). For example, 
Bitcoin blockchain stores data about user balances based on the Unspent Transaction Output 
(UTX-O) model. If any transaction has to refer to some previous unspent transaction, once the 
current unspent transaction is recorded into the blockchain, the state of that unspent transaction 
20 
 
will be switched to spent (Vyas & Lunagaria, 2014). Therefore, it is easy to verify and trace the 
transaction. 
Smart Contracts. Blockchain provides the functionality of smart contracts, or scripts 
that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. For instance, users of Ethereum–
Ether (alt-cryptocurrency) exchange must meet the pre-defined conditions that prove someone 
owns the cryptocurrency and have authority to send the money they claim to own. It is also 
possible to develop smart contracts that require more than one set of inputs to trigger a 
transaction (Mearian, 2018). For example, real estate transactions require sign offs between 
buyers, sellers and their financial institutions. 
Application of Blockchain 
Besides cryptocurrencies blockchain has many other applications. In financial services, 
blockchain can be used for asset management, insurance, cross-border payments. Blockchain can 
be used to facilitate distributed cloud storage. Blockchain has compelling use cases in the 
Internet of Things (IoT); encrypting the smart appliances on blockchain protects individual 
ownership and enables transferability. Blockchain can provide a robust solution for supply chain 
sensors. Blockchain can store, manages, protects, identify and transfers smart information for 
supply chain sensors. 
Smart Contracts are digital code which is embedded with an if-this-then-that (IFTTT) 
code, which gives them self-execution (Buterin, 2014). Smart contract is one of the profound 
features of the blockchain. Blockchain not only waives the need for third parties but also ensures 
that all ledger participants know the contract details and the contractual terms implement 
automatically once conditions are met. Smart Contract can be used in various areas, such as 
21 
 
financial derivation, insurance premiums, property law, crowdfunding agreements and others 
(Ream, Chu, & Schatsky, 2016). Healthcare can use blockchain smart contract to store and 
encrypt the personal health records with a private key which grant access only to specific 
individuals. The same strategy could be used to ensure that research is conducted through 
HIPAA laws securely and confidentially (Srinivasan, 2017). Besides there, blockchain can be 
used for other general healthcare management, such as supervising drugs, testing results, 
managing healthcare supplies, and regulation compliance. 
Blockchain provides solutions to the critical problems of ownership rights, royalty 
distribution, and transparency in the music industry. Blockchain can be used for digital voting, 
digital identity such as passport, and other certificates and many others.  
Blockchain in Cybersecurity. 
Protecting data integrity. Preventing data manipulation and maintaining data 
consistency, and integrity is vital in information systems. Many techniques used for to maintain 
data integrity are data encryption, data digesting (hash comparison), and digital signature. 
However, the blockchain built-in features, immutability and traceability, provide organizations 
with a mean to ensure data integrity (Swan, 2015). The combination of sequential hashing and 
cryptography with the decentralized structure offers blockchain its most robust features called 
immutability. It helps protect data integrity and identify any data tampering with it in contrast to 
a standard database. 
Keyless Signature Structure (KSI), a blockchain project led by a startup called 
GuardTime, aims to replace key-based (PKI) data authentication (Buldas, Kroonmaa, & Laanoja, 
2013). KSI stores hashes of original data and files on the blockchain and verify other copies by 
22 
 
running hashing algorithms and comparing the results with the stored copy in the blockchain 
(Dickson, 2017). If any manipulation may happen to the data, it will be quickly discovered 
because the original hash exists on many of nodes where blockchain is running. 
Non-repudiation. Since every transaction added to a blockchain is digitally signed and 
timestamped, which means that organization can trace back to a specific time for each 
transaction and identify the corresponding party (through their public address) on the blockchain. 
This feature relates to an important information security property called non-repudiation, which 
is the assurance that someone cannot duplicate the authenticity of their signature on a file or the 
authorship a transaction that they originated [1]. So, this feature help organization to trace and 
detect any tamper attempts or fraudulent transactions. 
Protecting identities. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the most commonly used identity 
protection technique used to secure emails, websites and other forms of communication. But 
most of PKI implementations rely on centralized, trusted third party Certificate Authorities (CA) 
to issue, revoke, and store key pairs for every participant, and hackers can compromise them to 
spoof user identities and crack encrypted communications. Publishing keys on blockchain 
eliminates the risk relating to false key propagation and identity theft. Moreover, there are 
various projects are ongoing to eliminate that need for issuing certificates by central authorities. 
These advances made blockchain more robust in terms of authentication and elimination of any 
possibility of being a single point of failure. For example, the CertCoin (Fromknecht & 
Yakoubov, n.d.) project developed at MIT, is one of the first implementations of blockchain-
based PKI. CertCoin aims to removes the Central Authorities altogether and uses the blockchain 
23 
 
as a distributed ledger of domains and their associated public keys (Dickson, 2017). CertCoin 
provides a public and auditable PKI that also does not have a single point of failure. 
Preventing distributed denial of service attacks. Distributed Denial of Service Attacks 
(DDoS) is one of the most common types of attacks, can also cause the most disruption to 
internet services and hence blockchain enabled solutions. The traditional Domain Name Services 
(DNS) system relies on DNS caching and due to this the 21st October 2016 DDoS attack on 
DNS servers which provides DNS services for major websites such as Twitter, Netflix, PayPal, 
and other services (Woolf, 2016). The October 2016 DDoS attack on DNS cut off access to these 
websites for several hours which shows another failure of centralized infrastructure.  The 
decentralization and peer-to-peer characteristics of the technology make it harder to disrupt than 
the conventional distributed application architecture (such as client-server), yet they are also 
subject to DDoS attack and adequate protection are required both at the network level and 
application level. 
Blockchain has a solution for this problem. Blockchain-based DNS approach improves 
security by removing the single target that attackers can attack to compromise the entire system. 
Nebulis is a project that is exploring the concept of a distributed DNS system that is near to 
impossible to fail under an access of requests. Nebulis uses the Ethereum blockchain and 
Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS), a distributed alternative to HTTP, to register and resolve 
domain names (Dickson, 2017). As the current DNS system highly relies on caching and DNS 
cache is always the high target of the hackers. So, by using the blockchain approach, it can 
provide a solution to the single point of failure. 
24 
 
Besides there, blockchain can be used for identity protection or identity security, 
traditional Endpoint protection, transaction and communication infrastructure security, protection 
from compromised nodes or server failure and security from malicious insiders. 
Eliminating human factor from authentication. Businesses can authenticate devices and 
users without the need for a password or other multi-factor authentications with the help of 
blockchain. This eliminates human intervention from the process of authentication, thereby 
avoiding it from becoming a potential attack vector. The current password-based authentication 
in the centralized architecture is still a huge problem. Usually, organization invest in security and 
standard but still if employees and customers use passwords that are easy to steal or crack, then 
these all efforts are ineffective. Blockchain offers strong authentication and resolving single 
point of attack at the same time (Eskandari, Clark, Barrera, & Stobert, 2015). Blockchain can be 
used in an organization to provide a distributed public key infrastructure for authenticating 
devices and users. This security system can provide each device with a specific SSL certificate 
instead of a password. Also, management of certificate data is carried out on the blockchain, and 
this makes it virtually impossible for attackers to utilize face certificates. With the help of 
blockchain, a security system used in an organization can leverage a distributed public key 
infrastructure for authenticating devices and users. This security system provides each device 
with a specific SSL certificate instead of a password. Management of certificate data is carried 
out on the blockchain and this makes it virtually impossible for attackers to utilize fake 
certificates. REMME a blockchain based project, authenticate users and devices without the need 
for a password, and provides SSL certificate to each device instead of password (“REMME 
Technical Paper,” 2017).  
25 
 
Secured decentralized storage. Blockchain can be used to build a decentralized, 
distributed storage and blockchain users can maintain their data on their computer in their 
network. This will assure that chain will not collapse. For example, if a hacker attempts to 
tamper with a block, the entire system (digital ledger) examines every data block to locate the 
one that differs from the test, it easily can reject the block from the chain and recognize it as 
fraudulent. As blockchain is decentralized, everyone in the blockchain network is responsible for 
verifying the data that is shared and maintained to ensure data cannot be altered. This approach 
facilitates more robust and secure storage as compare the current centralized storage. Some of 
the blockchain based decentralized projects are Sia (Vorick & Champine, n.d.), and Storj 
(Wilkinson et al., n.d.). 
How blockchain works? The blockchain is a database or a ledger that provides a way 
for information to be recorded and shared by a community. In this community, each member 
keeps his or her copy of the information, and all members must validate any updates collectively. 
It's distributed in nature, meaning that there is no central server holding the entire database or 
chain, but instead, the participating nodes have a copy of the ledger. The new records are 
appended to the ledger. 
Typically, from record perspective, blockchain consists of two types of elements (Banafa, 
2017). Transactions are the actions created by participants in the blockchain network. Blocks 
record these transactions and make sure they are in right sequence and have not been tampered. 
Blocks also record the timestamp when the transactions were added. Each block has one or more 
than one transactions. 
26 
 
Let us suppose A wants to send money to B. First, a block is created online and 
represents the transaction. Then this block is broadcasted to every participant in the blockchain 
network and set of participants approves the transaction and validates it. Once the block is 
validated, it is added to the chain which provides a permanent, non-reputable and transparent 
record of the transaction. Finally, B receives the money from A. The above steps are shown 
clarified in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1: How blockchain works simplified. 
Following are the detailed processes involved in the blockchain network (Piscini, 
Guastella, Rozman, & Nassim, 2016). 
Following are the detailed processes involved in the blockchain network (Piscini et al., 
2016). 
Transaction. Two parties want to exchange data, and this could be money, ship a 
product, contracts, medical records, customer details, or any other asset (tangible and intangible) 
that can be described in digital form. This transaction (record) is sent to everyone in the system, 
or in other words, all the participants get notification of the new transaction (Piscini et al., 2016).  
27 
 
There are two types of transactions in the Bitcoin. One is the standard transaction, created 
by the users which include coin. Another special type of transaction is called Coinbase 
transaction, or Generation transaction, which is created by the miner to award himself. In fact, it 
is the reward that miner gets for successful mining a block. The current block reward is 12.5 
Bitcoins per block, and the reward halves every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years 
(“Bitcoin Block Reward Halving Countdown,” n.d.). In case of Bitcoin, only the UXTO 
(Unspent Transaction Output Set) is stored in the memory and the remaining data is stored on the 
disk (“Weaknesses–Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). Once a client wants to process a transaction, before 
fetching transaction inputs from disk to memory, the client checks that all the inputs are unspent. 
Verification. Depending on the blockchain network's parameters, the transaction is either 
verified immediately or placed in a queue of pending transactions (Piscini et al., 2016). In this 
case, the nodes (computers) in the network determine if the transaction is valid or not based on a 
set of rules of the network, upon which participants in the network were agreed.  
Structure. Block contains the transaction or set of transactions, and each block is 
identified by a 256-bit hash valued, created by message digest algorithm agree upon by the 
network. In most cases, SHA256 message digest algorithm is used. Typically, a block contains a 
header, a pointer to previous block hash, and a group of transactions.  
Validation. Blocks must be validated before added to the blockchain. The most popular 
consensus algorithm based on which blocks are validated is Proof-of-Work (PoW), in which the 
solution to a mathematical puzzle derived from the block's header by miners. 
Mining. Miners use Proof-of-Work or other consensus algorithms to solve the 
mathematical puzzle, and once the problem is solved, the block is validated. The process of 
28 
 
mining consists of finding an input to a cryptograhic hash function which hashes below or equal 
to a fixed target value. It is brute force because at every iteration the content to be hashed is 
slightly changed in the hope to find a valid hash. In case of Bitcoin, a mining program essentially 
performs the following simplified code: 
 While(nonce <max): 
  If sha256(sha256(block+nonce)) < target: 
  return nonce 
  nonce +=1 
The task is to find a nonce which is included in the bitcoin block header, and hashes  below a 
certain value. 
 In case of Ethereum a simplified example could be: 
 nonce=random int 
 While hashimoto(block,nonce)*difficulty> threshold 
 increment nonce 
 return nonce 
Where difficulty is a dynamically adusts parameter defined originally in gensis block. If the above 
code, find the nonce and return it - “return nonce” that is the solution for the puzzle. 
The chain.  When a block is validated, the miner who solved the mathematical puzzle is 
rewarded, and then the validated block is broadcasted to the network (Piscini et al., 2016). After 
validation, the block is added to the majority chain, and by this, the action is completed (if it is 
money, then it is received to person B from A, as shown in the Figure 4 example). 
29 
 
If a malicious miner tries to submit an altered block to the chain, the hash function of that 
block and the hash function of all the following blocks will change, and other nodes would detect 
the changes and reject the block from the majority chain. 
Blockchain Architecture  
The blockchain is a sequence of blocks, which holds a complete list of transactions 
records or a log of all transactions like conventional public ledger (Zheng et al., 2017). Figure 2 
below illustrates an example of a blockchain. Each block contains block header, parent block 
hash (hash of the previous block), and list of transactions logs. The first block in blockchain is 
called genesis block which has no parent block. 
 
Figure 2: Bitcoin blockchain architecture 
Transactions data is permanently recorded in files called blocks. Each block contains 
block header and a record of some or all recent transactions, and a reference to the previous 
block. Each block consists of the block header and block body as shown in Figure 3 (Zheng et 
al., 2017).  
Block header. There are six elements in a block header. 
Block Version. It is 4 bytes in size that indicates the block version number, that is, it 
indicates which set of block validation rules to follow. For instance, when Bitcoin core software 
30 
 
upgraded then it specifies a new version. Parent block hash. It's a 256-bit hash of the previous 
block header, and it is 32 bytes in size, and it's updated when a new block comes into the 
blockchain. 
Merkle tree root hash. A 256-bit hash bashed on all the transactions in the block, and it 
is updated when a transaction is accepted, and it's 32 bytes in size. 
nBits. It is 4 bytes in size, and it's a target threshold of a valid block hash, in other words, 
it is the answer to a difficult-to-solve mathematical puzzle that solved by miners to validate the 
block and the answer to the puzzle is unique to each block it is the answer to a difficult-to-solve 
mathematical puzzle that solved by miners to validate the block and the answer to the puzzle is 
unique to each block. 
Timestamp. Current time as seconds in the universal time since January 1, 1970. 
Timestamp updated every few seconds, and it takes 4 bytes in size of block header. 
Nonce. It is a 4 bytes field, and it starts with 0 and increment for each hash calculations.

Cryptographic components.  
Digital signature. The typical digital signature algorithm used in Blockchain is the 
elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) (Zheng et al., 2017). Each user who 
participate in Blockchain network owns a pair of public and private key. The private key is kept 
confidential and used to sign the transactions and the signed transactions are broadcasted to the 
whole Blockchain network. The digital signature process involves two steps: signing phase and 
verification phase (Zheng et al., 2017). For instance, a user Alice wants to send a transaction or 
message to another user Bob. (1) In the signing phase Alice encrypts her data with her private 
key and sends to Bob the encrypted result and original data. (2) In the verification phase, Bob 
verify the value with Alice’s public key and check if the data has been tempered or not. 
Cryptographic hash function. A hash function is a mathematical process that takes input 
data of any size and preform an operation and returns output of a fixed size. Blockchain uses 
SHA256 message digest algorithm for generating Hash values. Data on the Blockchain is hashed 
in each block and if the block is changed or tempered, the hashed valued would be different and 
everyone in the network could detect that something had changed. Because the hashed value of 
the previous block is used to calculate the hashed value of the current block creating this link 
between the blocks and this makes Blockchain tamper-resilience linked-list. 
Merkle tree. Merkle tree is a data structure and it is used in Blockchain to contain a 
summary of all the transactions in the block, which maintain the integrity of the transactions in 
the block. In fact, Merkle tree contains cryptographic hashes of the transactions.  The most 
common and simple form of Merkle tree is the binary Merkle tree, where a bucket always 
consists of two hashes of two adjacent transaction hashes. Merkle tree produces an overall digital 
32 
 
fingerprint of the entire set of transactions, and provides a very efficient process to verify 
whether a transaction is included in a block or not (Antonopoulos, 2015). A Merkle tree is 
created by recursively hashing pairs of nodes until there is only one hash, called the root, or 
Merkle root. A Merkle tree is constructed bottom-up fashion. For instance, in the below Figure 4, 
there are four transactions, T0, T1, T2, and T3 and the hashes of each transactions forms the 
leaves of the Merkle tree called Hash0, Hash1, Hash2, and Hash3.  First, hash of two adjacent 
transactions for example, Hash0 and Hash1 is calculated and stored in the parent node Hash01, 
and the same is done for the Hash2 and Hash3 and their hash is stored in their parent nodes 
Hash23. This process continues until there is only one node left at the top which is called root 
(Antonopoulos, 2015). The final hash is 32-byte hash that is stored in the block header which 
summarizes all the data in the four transactions.

Types of Blockchain 
Typically, there are two types of blockchain public and private. 
33 
 
Public blockchain. A public blockchain as its name suggest is the blockchain of public, 
i.e., anyone can participate in reading, writing and auditing the blockchain without permission. 
Public blockchain is open and transparent hence anyone can review the transaction at a given 
point of time. As no one is in charge in public blockchain so the consensus mechanisms such as 
Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stack(PoS), and many others are used for decisions making.  
 Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and many others are example of public blockchain. Anyone 
can download the code and start running a public node on their local device, validating 
transactions in the network, thus participating in the consensus process- the process for 
determining what blocks get added to the chain and what is the current state (“Blockchains & 
Distributed Ledger Technologies,” n.d.). Anyone can send transactions across the world and 
expect to see them included in the blockchain once verified and validated. Transactions are 
transparent in public blockchain, but anonymous or pseudonymous. 
Private blockchain. In private blockchain the write permissions are kept centralized to 
one organization. Read permissions may be public or restricted to an arbitrary extent. Private 
blockchains are a way of taking advantage of blockchain by setting up groups and participants 
who can verify transactions internally. This create the risk of security breaches like a centralized 
system, as opposed to public blockchain secured by game theoretic incentive mechanisms 
(“Blockchains & Distributed Ledger Technologies,” n.d.). Private blockchain has its own use 
case, particularly, when it comes to scalability and state compliance of data privacy rule and 
other regulatory issues. MONAX, MultiChain are the examples of private blockchain. 
Consortium or federated blockchain. Consortium is sometime considered as third type 
of blockchain platform, but typically it a special type of private blockchain. This type of 
34 
 
blockchain removes the individual autonomy which is responsible for bringing changes in the 
blockchain as in private blockchain. In consortium or federated blockchains operate under the 
control of a group of institutions.  As opposed to public blockchains, consortium blockchain does 
not allow everyone to participate in the process of verifying transactions. A pre-selected set of 
nodes controls the consensus process; for instance, a consortium of ten financial institutions, 
each of which operates a node and of which seven must sign every block for the block to be valid 
(Seco, n.d.). The right to read the blockchain may be public or restricted to the participants. 
Banks usually use consortium blockchain and are faster and scalable and provides more 
transaction privacy. R3 (banks), EWF (Energy), and B3i (Insurance) are examples of the 
federated blockchain. 
Consensus Algorithms 
The purpose of a consensus algorithm is that everyone accepts and supports the decision, 
understand the reasons for making it, and shares collective responsibility for its consequences. 
The consensus is one of the fundamental problems of distributed computing. In blockchain, how 
to reach consensus among the untrusted nodes is a transformation of the Byzantine Generals 
(BG) problem. In BG problem, a group of generals who command Byzantine army and circle the 
city. The communication between the generals was by messenger. The problem was some 
generals prefer to attack while other refuse. To make the attack successful, the generals must 
agree upon a common battle plan, and all generals have to strike at the same time otherwise the 
attack may be failed. There is also a possibility that some generals may be traitors who will try to 
distract the loyal generals. The problem is to find a mechanism to ensures that all generals will 
reach an agreement and even if the communication is only verbal messages, this problem is 
35 
 
solvable if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal and agree upon the deal (Lamport, 
Shostak, & Pease, 1982). In blockchain, as there is no central node to control or monitor the 
distributed digital ledger, so the same problem raised but there must be some consensus 
mechanisms to solve this problem. Various consensus algorithms are used to bring consensus in 
the blockchain systems. 
PoW - Proof of Work. Bitcoin network uses Proof of Work (PoW) consensus 
mechanism (Nakamoto, n.d.). Bitcoin blockchain is a decentralized network, and it does not 
require authorization from any trusted third party to process the transactions. The nodes work 
with each other in a collaborative environment and develop the blockchain without relying on 
any central authority. However, some nodes may behave maliciously and act against the 
common goal. Thus, Bitcoin blockchain runs a fault tolerance consensus mechanism called PoW 
to assures that all nodes agree on the new entries (blocks) added to the bitcoin blockchain. PoW 
happens through miners trying to solve extremely difficult mathematic puzzles and finding a 
solution is basically a guessing game but checking if a solution is correct is easy. In PoW, each 
node of the network is calculating a hash value of the block header (Gervais et al., 2016). The 
block header contains a nonce and miners would change the nonce frequently to get a different 
hash value, and the consensus requires that the calculated value must be equal to or smaller than 
a particular given value. When one node finds a given value, it will broadcast the block to other 
nodes, and all other nodes in the network must mutually confirm the correctness of the hash 
value. Once the block is validated, other miners would append this new block to their 
blockchains. Nodes that calculate the hash values are called miners, and the PoW procedure is 
called mining in the Bitcoin blockchain (Gervais et al., 2016).  
36 
 
In Bitcoin blockchain, once the new transactions happen, they are broadcasted to all 
nodes in the network. Each node collects new transactions into a block and starts works on 
finding a problematic proof-of-work for its block. Once a node detects a proof-of-work, it 
broadcasts the block to all nodes. Other nodes in the network accept this new block only if all 
transactions in it are valid and not already spent. Nodes express their acceptance of the new 
block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as 
the previous has. Nodes in the network always consider the most extended chain to be the valid 
one and will keep working on extending it (Xu et al., 2017). 
In the decentralized network, the valid blocks might be generated simultaneously when 
multiple nodes find the suitable nonce nearly at the same time. Due to which a new branch will 
be created. But it is unlikely that two competing forks will generate next block simultaneously 
(Gervais et al., 2016). In PoW based consensus algorithm, the participants require no 
authentication to join the network, which makes the Bitcoin consensus mechanism makes it 
extremely scalable regarding supporting thousands of network nodes. However, PoW based 
consensus is vulnerable to 51% attacks, in which an adversary has control over 51% of the hash-
rate in the network. Hence it can write its blocks or fork the blockchain that at a later point 
converges with the main blockchain. Fifty-one percent of attacks can further leverage the miner 
to carried out other types of attacks such as double-spending, eclipse, and denial of service (Xu 
et al., 2017). The PoW based consensus algorithm wastes a lot of energy in hash computations 
during the mining process, but, it also facilitates high scalability regarding nodes participating in 
the network and operates entirely in a decentralized manner. To mitigate the waste of resources, 
some PoW protocols in which works could have some side-applications have been designed. For 
37 
 
example, the Primecoin is a new type of PoW based on searching for prime numbers (King, 
2013). 
PoS–Proof of Stack. Proof of Stack (PoS) is the most common energy-saving alternative 
to Proof of Work algorithm. In PoS, instead of investing in computing power in a race to mine 
blocks, a 'validator' invests in the coins of the system, i.e., the validators in PoS have to prove the 
ownership of the amount of the currency. It is believed that people with more coins will less 
likely attack the network. There is no coin creation (mining) exists in the PoS. Instead, all the 
coins created from day one, and validators (stakeholders) are paid strictly in transaction fees. In 
PoS, the validator is chosen to develop next block based on the number of coins (stake) has in 
the system. Once the validator creates a block, that block still needs to be committed to the 
blockchain, and various PoS systems handle this differently. In Tendermint, every node in the 
network has to sign off on a block until a majority vote is reached, while in other PoS systems, a 
random group of participants is chosen to sign the block to commit the blockchain (Vasin, 2014). 
There are some problems existed with PoS. Suppose if a validator creates two blocks for 
the same set of transactions and claim two sets of transactions fees, and also a signer signed both 
of those blocks. This is called the 'nothing-at-stake' problem, i.e., a participant with nothing to 
lose has no reason not to misbehave (Vasin, 2014). One proposed solution to this problem is to 
require a validator to lock their currency in a type of virtual vault, and those coins will severe if 
the validator tries to double sign or fork the network. The selection of validator based on the 
account balance is considered unfair because the single richest person is bound to be dominant in 
the network. Different solutions are proposed to tackle this problem. Peercoin chooses validator 
based on the coin's age and more extensive set of coins (King & Nadal, 2012). Blackcoin uses 
38 
 
randomization to predict the next generator and uses a formula that looks for the lowest hash 
value in combination with the size of the stake (Vasin, 2014). Compare to PoW, PoS saves more 
energy and is more efficient. However, as the mining cost is nearly zero, attacks might come as a 
consequence. 
PoA–Proof-of-Authority. In PoA consensus mechanism, transaction and blocks are 
validated by approved accounts, known as validators. The process of the validation is automated 
by running software and does not require validators to be continually monitoring their nodes. 
However, the validator nodes have to keep running and uncompromised. Any one of the 
validators can approve the non-consecutive block in the PoA-based system, which minimized the 
risk. Three main rules must be fulfilled for a validator (“Proof-of-authority,” 2018). (1) The 
identity of the validator must be verified correctly, (2) Eligibility must be challenging to obtain, 
(3) There must be a complete unity in the checks and procedures for establishing authority. 
The PoW-based system uses a mining mechanism to generate and validate a block. The 
PoS-based system uses an algorithm that selects participants with the highest stakes as validators. 
The PoA-based system uses identity as the only verification of the authority to validate, and there 
is no mining process to verify the work.  
Literature Review Related to Problem 
This section briefly reviews the related studies about the problem. Some studies provide a 
survey about the security and privacy issues on the Blockchain.  The authors Conti et al. (Conti, 
E, Lal, & Ruj, 2017) provided a comprehensive survey on security and privacy issues in Bitcoin. 
This paper studied the security and privacy works in details but it only focusses the Bitcoin not 
the blockchain in general. Lin et al. (Lin & Liao, 2017) provide a survey of blockchain security 
39 
 
issues and challenges. This paper presents a general overview about blockchain, how blockchain 
works, its characteristics, some of the Blockchain’s application and briefly studies some security 
problems in Blockchain such as 51% attack, and Fork problems. “Introduction to Security and 
Privacy on the Blockchain” (Halpin & Piekarska, 2017) paper is based on the IEEE Privacy and 
Security on the blockchain Workshop (IEEE S&B). They presented peer-reviewed papers that 
are collected from academia and industry to analyze problems ranging from deploying newer 
cryptographic primitives on Bitcoin to enabling use-cases like privacy-preserving file storage. 
This paper mainly focuses on the issues that discussed in the workshop.   
Vyas and Lunagaria (2014) state the security concerns and issues for Bitcoin. This paper 
focuses on Bitcoin protocol and discusses some of the attacks on Bitcoin such as majority attack 
(51 % attack), Double-spending attack, Timejacking attack, and selfish mining attack. Wüst 
(2016) completed a master's thesis on Security of Blockchain. In fact, this thesis provides an in-
depth study of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Bitcoin. This study provides a 
quantitative framework based on Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to analyze the security of 
different PoW Blockchain instances with various parameters against selfish mining and double-
spending attacks. 
Yli-Huumo, Ko, Choi, Park, and Smolande (2016) state a systematic review on finding 
out ""Where is current research on Blockchain technology?"". The objective of this study was to 
understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding blockchain 
technology from the technical perspective. This research report studied different papers that 
discuss various technical challenges of Blockchain Technology. For instance, Blockchain's 
scalability issues wasted resources and also presents some papers that were dedicated to security 
40 
 
and privacy issues of Blockchain. Though this research report discusses the security and privacy 
aspect of the blockchain more in general and provides the report based on the 14 papers that 
were covered in the scope of this report. However, this research provides a roadmap for technical 
challenges of Blockchain that should be researched.  
Literature Reviews Related to Methodology  
To best of our knowledge, this is the first state-of-arts that discussed the security issues in 
the both Blockchain 1.0 and Blockchain 2.0. The paper (Atzei, Bartoletti, & Cimoli, 2016) 
provides a survey on the Ethereum smart contracts and discusses 12 types of vulnerabilities on 
the Ethereum smart contract. Xu et al. (2017) state a taxonomy of Blockchain-based systems for 
architecture design. This paper classifies and compares blockchains and blockchain-based 
systems to assist with design and assessment of their impact on software architecture. This 
taxonomy discusses the architectural characteristics of blockchain and the effect of their 
principle design decision, and it does not provide insight on security and privacy issues of 
Blockchain. Lloyd's London presents a report called “Emerging Risk Report 2015” (Beecroft, 
2015) and this report discussed different risk factors specifically in Bitcoin. Lloyd's report 
studies risk in various domain of Bitcoin such as operational risks, technological risks, market 
risks and a minor report on security risks in Bitcoin. Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance 
conducted a global blockchain benchmarking Study (Hileman & Rauchs, 2017). This 
benchmarking study discusses the state of the blockchain ecosystem from the finance perspective 
and very slight attention to the privacy factors of Blockchain. 
The Gervais et al. (2016) paper introduced a novel quantitative framework to analyze the 
security and performance implications of various consensus and network parameters of Proof of 
41 
 
Work (PoW) blockchains. This paper formulates adversarial strategies for double-spending and 
selfish mining while taking into account real-world constraints such as network propagation, 
different block sizes, block generation intervals, information propagation mechanism, and the 
impact of eclipse attack.  
Apostolaki, Zohar, and Vanbever (2017) discuss the Bitcoin's Hijacking. This paper 
provides a taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on Bitcoin, considering both small-scale 
attacks, targeting individual nodes, and large-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. The 
paper discusses two general network attacks, partitioning attack and delay the attack. 
 Wan, Lo, Xia, and Cai (2017) discuss bug characteristics in blockchain systems. This 
paper performs an empirical study on bug characteristics in eight representatives open source 
blockchain systems. First, the article manually examines 1,108 bug reports to understand the 
nature of the reported bugs and then leverage card sorting to label the bug reports and get ten bug 
categories in blockchain systems. This paper further investigates the frequency distribution of 
bug categories across projects and programming languages, and finally, study the relationship 
between bug categories and bug fixing time. 
Summary   
This chapter summaries the basic concept of the blockchain, its features, applications, 
types of blockchain, consensus mechanism. Finally, the chapter included the literatures reviews 
based on the problem and methodology. 
  
42 
 
Chapter III: Methodology  
 This study followed the qualitative research methods which involves surveys and case 
studies. In this chapter, the classification methods and its underlying technologies and concepts 
required for the taxonomies are presented. 
Design of the Study 
 The study used qualitative research method, because it concentrates on collecting and 
analyzing data and gain greater insight and knowledge by reproducing or recognizing the 
problem. The qualitative research method involves survey and case study. To better under 
understand the security threats problem in the blockchain (both blockchain 1.0, 2.0), the study 
presented a systematic survey. The systematic survey reviews the existing vulnerabilities in the 
blockchain, and examines how these vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security 
threats. Moreover, the study provided a case-study for each attack by examining the popular 
blockchain systems and also reviews possible countermeasures which could be used in the 
development of various blockchain systems. In order to recognize specifically the targets for 
each threat, taxonomies are developed. The taxonomies classified the each of the examined 
security threats in term of affected abstract layers of blockchain, affected primary processes of 
the blockchain and finally the business users. 
Since in the qualitative research, the data are analyzed by themes from descriptions by 
informants and keep that in mind, the study developed taxonomies and classify the threats 
(Mcleod, 2008). 
 Moreover, this work also provided a comprehensive study about the blockchain concept, 
its characteristics, the underlying technologies to better recognize the problem. It also surveyed 
43 
 
the existing technical challenges in the blockchain such as scalabilities, usability and some 
government and compliance concerns. Though the government and compliance was not in the 
scope of this study, but provided a brief insight about the current standards and government 
issues. 
Data Collection 
 The data collected and analyzed in this study was from various relevant papers that are 
extracted from scientific databases. The relevant research included journal papers, conference 
papers, technical and white papers and used some academic blogs for obtaining up to date 
statistics to evaluate the objective of the problem discussed in this study. 
Tools and Techniques  
There is no specific tool used in addressing the problem, but the study used the taxonomy 
as a technique to evaluate and classify the security threats and attacks in the different domains of 
the blockchain. The three taxonomies as first based on the abstract layers of the blockchain, the 
primary technical processes in the blockchain and finally the primary targets (users) involves in 
the blockchain platforms from the business perspective. 
Taxonomy #1. This taxonomy is based on the abstract layers of the blockchain. The 
abstract layer considers in this taxonomy are: Network layer, Consensus layer, Data model layer, 
Execution layer. The taxonomy based on the abstract layers is formed by studying the nature of 
each of the existing vulnerabilities that lead to the security threats and attacks, and which abstract 
layer can be affect by each attack.  
Taxonomy #2. This taxonomy is designed in considering the primary processes of the 
blockchain platforms. By examining each of the security threats and how it can affect the four 
44 
 
primary processes. The four common processes in the blockchain platforms are: Network 
discovery, Transaction creations, Mining or Block generation and Block validation. 
Taxonomy #3. The taxonomy considered the primary target of the business users 
corresponding to each attack. The actors involved in the blockchain platforms are: User, 
Merchant, Miner, Mining pool, Cryptocurrency Exchanges, and Blockchain network. 
Summary  
 In this chapter, the approach to the study has been presented. In particular, the study 
follows a systematic survey the existing vulnerabilities in the blockchain and the related security 
threats and attacks. Furthermore, using the finding of the systematic survey, the security threats 
and attacks are classified in term of affected abstract layers, processes and business users. 
 
  
45 
 
Chapter IV: Data Presentation and Analysis  
 This chapter discussed the systematic survey conducted by this study. In particular the 
systematic survey addressed various area related to the security problem of the blockchain:      
(1) Reviewed the existing technical challenges in the blockchain such as scalability and usability 
and studied the solutions. (2) Presented the detail study of the existing vulnerabilities and 
analyses how the vulnerabilities lead to the execution of the security threats. In particular the 
systematic survey discussed the security threats to double spending, threats to mining or mining 
pool, threats to blockchain network, threats to wallets (client software), and finally threats to 
smart contracts. (3) Studied each of the security threats and their corresponding attack vectors or 
attacks by providing a case-study or attack scenario and reviewed the possible countermeasures. 
Finally, developed three taxonomies and classified each of the security threats in term of affected 
abstract layers of the blockchain, affected blockchain process, and finally the affected business 
users. 
Blockchain Technical Challenges and Advances  
Scalability. Almost all existing Blockchain systems including the Bitcoin, Ethereum, 
Ripple and their associated consensus protocols have a scalability limitation. The challenging 
restriction is due to the decentralized nature of the blockchain system-every node on the network 
processes every transaction and maintains a copy of the entire state of the ledger. Though a 
decentralization consensus mechanism offers some critical benefits, such as fault tolerance, 
strong security especially data integrity, political neutrality, and authenticity. However, it comes 
at the cost of scalability. Bitcoin and Ethereum are two more dominant blockchain protocols that 
many other existing blockchain systems leverages the components of Bitcoin or Ethereum or 
46 
 
both of them. In fact, Ethereum used the Bitcoin protocol and added smart contract functionality. 
The main scalability problem is the time take to put a transaction in a block, and the time taken 
to reach a consensus. More preciously following three functionalities or components of the 
blockchain networks need to be addressed. 
Throughput. Bitcoin manages around 7 transactions per second (“Bitcoin Charts & 
Graphs–Blockchain,” n.d.), Ethereum does about 20 transactions per second (“Ethereum Charts 
and Statistics,” n.d.). Other transaction processing network such as VISA controls 1667 
transactions per second and PayPal does 193 transactions per second. So, for the Bitcoin and 
Ethereum to compete with the more mainstream system like VISA and PayPal, they need to 
increase their throughput. In general, when the frequency of transactions in Blockchain rises to a 
similar level of VISA, the throughput of the blockchain networks need to be improved. 
Latency. It takes currently roughly 10 minutes in Bitcoin network to create or mine a 
block which contains transaction, for Ethereum it’s around 14 seconds (“Bitcoin, Litecoin, 
Namecoin, Dogecoin, Peercoin, Ethereum stats,” n.d.). To achieve efficiency in the security, 
more time has to be spent on a block creation and validation, to ensure that the inputs for the 
transactions have not been previously used, which lead to double-spending attacks. Existing 
blockchain systems need to improve the block creation and validation time, to complete a 
transaction while maintaining the security.  
Size and bandwidth.  The current size of the Bitcoin blockchain is 190.65 GB, and 
Ethereum blockchain size is 330.61 GB (March 23, 2018) (“Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, 
Dogecoin, Peercoin, Ethereum stats,” n.d.). When the throughput increases to the level of VISA 
network, bitcoin blockchain could multiply. The current average block size of Bitcoin is 1 MB. 
47 
 
Ethereum uses gas limit mechanism rather than the block size. The time to create a Bitcoin 1 MB 
block which contains on average 500 transactions takes on average 10 minutes (Yli-Huumo et 
al., 2016). If the Bitcoin blockchain needs to control more transactions, the size and bandwidth 
issues have to be resolved. 
The current Bitcoin blockchain is globally distributed in 11,875 full nodes (“Global 
Bitcoin nodes distribution,” n.d.), and Ethereum blockchain is globally distributed in 17,263 full 
nodes (“ethernodes.org–The ethereum node explorer,” n.d.) (March 23, 2018). That is, Ethereum 
is more distributed than Bitcoin blockchain. However, blockchain scalability issue increases as 
more nodes are added to its blockchain because of the inter-node latency that logarithmically 
increases with every additional node. Contrary to the traditional database system, in which the 
performance improved by adding more computer power (servers). But in the decentralized 
blockchain systems, as every node needs to process and verify transactions and maintain the 
updated copy of the blockchain the inter-node latency increases. The current existing blockchain 
systems tradeoff between the low transaction throughput and a high degree of centralization. 
Thus, to scale the current blockchain protocols, it’s important to limit the number of participants 
needed to validate each transaction, without leading to the risk of centralization and losing the 
network’s trust that each transaction is valid. 
Proposed solutions. There are a number of solutions proposed to address the scalability 
issue of the blockchain, which could be categorized into two types. 
Storage optimization of the blockchain.  It is harder for the nodes to maintain the full 
copy of the ledger, Bruce (Bruce, n.d.) proposed a scheme that contains three core components 
called, mini-blockchain, account tree and proof of chain, to enhance the scalability. The mini-
48 
 
blockchain is a variant of the Bitcoin protocol which aims to eliminate the need for storing the 
full blockchain and overcome the “blockchain bloat” problem. In this scheme, the old transaction 
records are removed (or forgotten) by the network, that is, old blocks can be trimmed from the 
chain. The block headers are kept as a Proof of Work record, but all other transactions can be 
discarded. The address balances are managed separately in a hash tree structure called the 
“account tree” which is a self-contained balance sheet designed to keep track of all non-empty 
addresses. New blocks act upon the entries in the account tree to perform transactions, and the 
master hash of the account tree is embedded into the block headers to ensure consistency and 
agreement between the nodes. To secure the whole system from the malicious activities, a chain 
of interlocking PoW solutions called the “proof chain” is used. The proof chain is merely a chain 
of block headers which encapsulate all the energy expended by the network on a given chain, 
and it secures the mini-blockchain and account tree against the attackers. The paper (van den 
Hooff, Kaashoek, & Zeldovich, 2014) propose a novel scheme called VerSum. Versum allows 
lightweight clients to outsource expensive computations over extensive and frequently changing 
data structure, such as the Bitcoin, Namecoin blockchain, or a Certificate Transparency log. 
VerSum assumes that at least one server is honest in the network, and when servers disagree, 
VerSum uses an effective conflict resolution protocol to determine which server(s) made a 
mistake and get the correct output by comparing the outputs from multiple servers. 
Redesigning blockchain. The paper (Eyal, Emin, & Sirer, n.d.) proposed a new 
blockchain protocol called Bitcoin-NG (Next Generation) to scale. The Bitcoin-NG is a 
Byzantine-fault-tolerant blockchain protocol that is robust to extreme churn and also shares the 
same trust model as the Bitcoin protocol. The main idea of the Bitcoin-NG is to split the 
49 
 
conventional block into two parts: Key blocks for leader election and microblocks that contain 
the ledger entries. Each block has a header that includes, among the other fields, the unique 
reference of its predecessors. Bitcoin-NG divides time into epochs or period, and in each epoch, 
a single leader is in charge of serializing state machine transactions. Miners are competing to 
become a leader, and once a miner becomes a leader he/she is responsible for microblock 
generation until a new leader appears. Bitcoin-NG also extended the longest (heaviest) chain 
strategy where only key blocks count and microblocks carry no weight. In this way, blockchain 
is redesigned, and the tradeoff between the block size and the network security has been 
discussed. 
Sharding is a concept that has been used by distributed systems for a long time, to 
improve scalability, performance, and input/output bandwidth. The existing blockchain systems 
including Ethereum face the big problem of scalability, that is, the speed of transaction 
verification. Each full node in the network has to maintain the copy of the entire blockchain. 
With sharding, it can be breaks down a transaction into shards and spreads it among the network. 
The nodes can work on individual shards in parallel. This in turn decrease the overall time taken 
by the transaction. Zilliqa (“whitepaper.pdf,” n.d.) is the first public blockchain platform that 
implement sharding. It automatically split the nodes in the network into parallel chains called 
“shards”, where each shard processes a small portion of all transaction in conjunction with other 
shards, resulting in a microblock from each shard. These microblocks are then merged into one 
complete block that is then added to the blockchain. Zilliqa claims that it is linearly scalable. 
Linear scalability means that as the number of the participating nodes in the network increases, 
the transaction throughput also increases at an almost linear rate. However, it is opposite in 
50 
 
blockchain, as the number of participating nodes increases, each transaction has to be 
broadcasted to a greater number of nodes before being validated and added to the blockchain, 
thereby limiting transaction throughput. Zilliqa uses PoW only to establish miners’ identities and 
it’s not used as a consensus protocol, which significantly reduces the energy consumption. 
Instead, Zilliqa uses an optimized Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol 
which give finality to transactions. Unlike the PoW, where multiple confirmations are required, 
PBFT does not allow temporary forks due to the consensus protocols, that is, once a block added 
to the blockchain no other block can share the same parent as the committed block, and as a 
result, no confirmations are required. Because of finality, the entire transaction history is not 
required to be stored on the blockchain, instead it is sufficient to store only the latest state. 
Plasma (Poon & Buterin, n.d.) is another proposed framework for scalability, which is a 
series of smart contracts that run on the top of the root blockchain (i.e., the Ethereum 
blockchain). The root blockchain enforces the validity of the state in the plasma chains using a 
mechanism called “fraud proofs.” Fraud-proof is a mechanism by which nodes can determine if a 
block is invalid using a mathematical proof. The Plasma framework forms the blockchain in a 
tree hierarchy, and each branch is treated as a blockchain that has its own blockchain history and 
computations that are MapReduce. The “plasma blockchains” could be considered as the child 
chains, each of which is a chain within a blockchain. The Plasma blockchain does not reveal the 
contents of the blockchain on the root chain (e.g., Ethereum). Instead, only the block header 
hashes are submitted on the root chain, which is enough to determine the validity of the block. 
The data is sent to the root chain in Byzantine conditions. As a result, the root blockchain 
process only a small amount of commitments from child blockchains, which in turn decreases 
51 
 
the amount of data passed onto the root blockchain and allows for a much more significant 
number of computations. 
Wasted resources, fork, and usability issues. 
Wasted resources. Many other existing blockchain systems, Bitcoin and Ethereum are 
based on the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, which requires mining (computational 
power) to do the proof of work or solve the puzzle. The Bitcoin’s current annual electricity 
consumption is 57.17 TWh (“Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index,” n.d.), which is estimated 
above $15 million/day. Electricity consumed per Bitcoin’s transactions is 847 KWh, which is 
more than a household's energy used in a week. Moreover, a single Bitcoin transaction takes 
thousands of times more energy than a credit card swap. Ethereum is the second largest 
electricity consumer blockchain system. Thus, immense computer power, and massive electricity 
consumption still an enormous challenge to the blockchain system. Besides that, the annual 
carbon footprint (kt of CO2) of Bitcoin network is 28,015 (“Bitcoin Energy Consumption 
Index,” n.d.) which is an unsustainable and not eco-system friendly. Some of the alternative 
proposed are Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Authority, and many mores, which does not require 
mining for creating and validating blocks. 
Usability.  There is no standard available for developing the Application Programming 
Interface (API), and different blockchains follow different programming languages for 
development. It makes it difficult to use in term of developing services, notably the Bitcoin’s 
API. There is a need to create a more developer-friendly API for the blockchains that should use 
some standards such as REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). 
52 
 
Versioning, hard forks, multiple chains. Usually, updates in the main protocols lead to 
versioning or hard forks, if all the blockchain community does not have consensus of the new 
update. This makes the blockchains split and usually happened for administrative or versioning 
purposes. For instance, after increasing the Bitcoin protocol block size from 1MB to 2MB makes 
a hard fork (called segwit) in the Bitcoin network and creates a fork or blockchain named Bitcoin 
Cash, and the blockchain core developers split into two teams. One is supporting the original 
Bitcoin protocol (BTC), and other advocates the new fork, Bitcoin Cash.

Double-spending Security Threats 
A double-spending attack is an attack where a consumer uses the same cryptocurrency 
multiple times for transactions, i.e., the given set of coins is spent in more than one transaction. 
For instance, Bob sends money to Alice (merchant) to get some product, Alice then ships the 
product to Bob, now since nodes always adopt the longer tail as the confirmed transactions, if Bob 
cloud generate a longer tail that contains a reverse transaction with the same input reference, Alice 
would be out of her money and her product. 
 
Figure 5. Double-spending attack simplified. 
There are various double-spending attack vectors or various ways to perform a double-
spending attack, such as Race attack, Finney attack, Vector76 attack, Alternative history attack, 
51% attack. 
Race attack. Race attack happened when an attacker sends two conflicting transactions 
in rapid succession into the Bitcoin network. This type of attack is relatively easy to implement 
in PoW-based blockchains. Merchants who accepts a payment immediately with 
55 
 
“0/unconfirmed” are exposed to the transaction being reversed (“Irreversible Transactions - 
Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.).  
Attack scenario. In Race attack, the attacker in order to do double-spending, sends a 
transaction paying the merchant directly, and as the merchant accept the payment immediately 
without waiting for confirmation and ship the product to attacker. Meanwhile, the attacker sends 
a conflicting transaction (that has the same coins previously paid to merchant) to himself to the 
rest of blockchain network. It is likely that the second conflicting transaction will be mined into 
block and accepted by the Bitcoin nodes as genuine, and the coins included in the transaction 
sent to merchant will be considered invalid. Here, the attacker can exploit the intermediate time 
between two transactions’ initiation and confirmation to launch a double-spending attack 
quickly.  
As the merchants are willing to accept payment (Bitcoin) on 0/unconfirmed, can take 
precautions such as disable incoming connections or only connect to well-connected nodes. But, 
still impossible to prevent such type of attack if there is no confirmation mechanism available in 
the network. 
Possible countermeasures. There are a couple of studies and proposals that could be used 
to detect and used as a precaution to double-spending attack, particularly on the Bitcoin network.  
Ghassan et al. (Karame, Androulaki, & Capkun, 2012) discusses the double-spending attacks on 
fast payments in Bitcoin, and propose an attack model that enables the detection of double-
spending attacks in fast transactions. The three detection techniques the paper presented are: (a) 
listening period, (b) inserting observers, and (c) forwarding double spending attempts. The 
Bitcoin daemon locally generates an error if it receives a transaction whose inputs have already 
56 
 
been spent, but this error is not displayed to the Bitcoin user. In the “listening period”, the vendor 
associates a listening period with each received transaction, and it monitors all the receiving 
transactions during this period. The vendor only delivers the product, or provide the service, if he 
does not see any attempt of double-spending during the listening period. Another technique is 
called “inserting observers”, in which the vendor inserts a node or couple of nodes that it 
controls within the Bitcoin network called “observer” that would directly relay all the 
transactions that it receives to the vendor. This helps the vendor to detect a double-spending 
attempt within seconds by himself or by its observers. The third technique is “communicating 
double-spending alerts among peers”. This technique is considered an efficient countermeasure 
to combat double-spending on fast Bitcoin payment. In this technique, the Bitcoin network peers 
propagate alerts whenever they receive two more transactions that share common inputs and 
different outputs (double-spending attempt). 
Another countermeasure called “Forwarding Double-Spending Attempts in the Network” 
present in Karame, Androulaki, Roeschlin, Gervais, and Čapkun (2015), states nearby peers 
should notify the merchant about the attempt that double-spending the same coins in the Bitcoin 
network. Specifically, whenever a peer receives a new transaction, it checks whether the 
transaction uses coins that have not been spent in any other transaction that exists in the 
blockchain and their memory pool. If the transaction does not have already spent coins in it, 
peers add the transaction to their memory pool and forward it in the network. On the other hand, 
if peers detect that there is another transaction in the memory pool that spends that same coins to 
different recipients (address), then peers forward this double-spending transaction to their 
neighbors (without adding it to their memory pool). The primary intention behind this technique 
57 
 
is not to prevent the double-spending attack, but to detect it and inform the vendor so s/he can 
identify the double-spending transaction before sending or providing service to the attacker. 
Podolanko, Ming, and Wright (n.d.) provide a countermeasure against double-spending 
attacks on Bitcoin Fast-Pay transactions. They proposed a solution called Enhanced Observers 
(ENHOBS), a hybrid of observers and the peer alert system. In this scheme, the ENHOBS will 
do more in-depth inspections of all transactions received and compares their outputs and inputs. 
Once a double-spending attack is detected, an alert message that also contains the double-
spending transactions as evidence through the P2P network. Once the alert is received and 
verified, any transactions that match the same inputs are dropped from the memory pool 
immediately. 
Bamert, Decker, Elsen, Wattenhofer, and Welten (2013) propose couple of 
countermeasures against double-spending. For instance, the merchant should connect to a 
sufficiently large random number of nodes in the Bitcoin network. This will make harder for the 
attacker to inject incorrect transaction information or double-spending transaction because the 
attacker does not know over which nodes the merchant communicates. Furthermore, the 
merchant should not accept direct incoming connections. Thus, the attacker cannot directly send 
a transaction to the merchant, and forcing him to broadcast it over the network. The nodes that 
will forward that transaction will review it and detected if the transaction has a double-spending 
attempt. The subsequent transactions using the same input (address) from the attacker would be 
ignored by those nodes and would make it harder for the attacker to do double-spending. 
Finney attack. An attacker, pre-mined one transaction into a block and spend the same 
coins before releasing the block to public network to invalidate that transaction. This is called a 
58 
 
Finney attack (Sompolinsky & Zohar, n.d.). The Finney attack is a fraudulent double-spend that 
requires the participation of a miner once a block has been mined. An adversary can only 
perform a double-spending in the presence of one-confirmation vendors.  
Attack scenario. To launch a Finney attack, (1) an attacker (A) privately pre-mined a 
block which contains the double-spending transaction (TAadd) that he sent to his address (attacker 
address - Aadd). (2) The attacker creates another transaction (TMadd) which uses the same coins 
(suppose same Bitcoins) and sends it to merchant (Madd) address. Transactions in the Blockchain 
network are group by node into a block and broadcast the block to the network, and transactions 
which are not yet in a block are considered unconfirmed. (3) The attacker waits until the 
transaction (that he sent to merchant) is accepted by the merchant, and merchant only accepts the 
transaction, when it receives confirmation from the miners indicating that this transaction is valid 
and included in the blockchain. (4) Once merchant receives confirmation, he sends the product to 
the attacker. (5) After receiving the product, the attacker releases the privately pre-mind block 
into the main (public) blockchain, thus creates a blockchain fork (suppose Bf). Now, if the next 
mined block in the network extends the fork blockchain (Bf) instead of the main blockchain, then 
all the miners will create new blocks on the top of the fork blockchain (Bf). As the fork 
blockchain is the longest chain in the network, the miners will ignore the previous blockchain, 
and the fork blockchain will be considered the valid blockchain onward. Thus, the block which 
has transaction (TMadd) which was sent to the merchant and confirmed in the previous blockchain 
by miners will become invalid and resulting the merchant loses his product and attacker receives 
the product and his coins back. 
59 
 
Possible countermeasure. Since a Finney attack can only be performed against a one-
confirmation vendor. In order to avoid the Finney attack, the vendor should wait for multiple 
confirmations before releasing the product or providing a service to the client. The waiting for 
multiple confirmation, will not prevent the double-spending attack, but will mitigate the risk and 
makes it harder for the attacker to spend the same coins more than once.  The countermeasures 
presented for Race attacks (Karame et al., 2012, 2015) can also be used to mitigate the risk of 
Finney attack. 
Vector76 attack. Vector76 is also called a one-confirmation attack, in which attacker 
uses the privately mined block to perform a double-spending attack on the exchanges 
(Sompolinsky & Zohar, n.d.). It is a combination of the race attack and the Finney attack such 
that a transaction that even has one confirmation can still be reversed (“Irreversible 
Transactions–Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). A vector76 attack is possible when a wallet service such as 
cryptocurrency exchange runs a node that accepts direct (incoming) connections. Assuming that 
this node is using a static IP address, which will not be difficult for the attacker to find the IP 
address. 
Attack scenario. The attack would be carried out as follows. Now, let’s assume that 
exchange (a digital market where traders can buy, sell or exchange cryptocurrencies) requires 
only one confirmation and then enables you to withdraw those deposited funds after that deposit 
transaction gets the one confirmation. To launch the vector76 attack, the dishonest miner 
(attacker) needs to maintain two nodes (say- Node A and B). The Node A is only connected to 
the exchange (e-wallet service) node, and the Node B is connected to one or more well-
connected peers in the blockchain network. Then, the dishonest miner creates two transactions 
60 
 
that spend the same coins. The first transaction T1 (suppose 30BTC) is sent to the attacker 
Bitcoin address in the exchange. The second transaction T2 (suppose 0.5 BTC) is sent to his own 
wallet. Both of the transactions are not yet broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. The dishonest 
miner tries to solve (mine) a block which includes the first transaction T1 (30BTC). Once the 
block is solved, then instead of releasing that solved block to the public Bitcoin network, the 
attacker keeps that solved block and instead carry out the T1 (30BTC) on Node A and T2 (0.5 
BTC) on Node B simultaneously. Now, the only nodes that know about the 30BTC transaction 
are the own attacker node (Node A) and the exchange node. The exchange node will propagate 
the 30BTC transaction to its peer. But the second transaction (0.5BTC) was done by Node B 
which was connected to well-connected peers in the Bitcoin network, likely has reached to most 
of all Bitcoin nodes in the network and verified by peers. The nodes in the network that know the 
0.5 BTC transaction will reject the 30BTC transaction as it is a double-spend of the same coin. 
When the attacker see this solved block on Node B, he then broadcast the previously withheld 
pre-mined block from Node A (which is connected to the exchange). As the exchange provide 
services based on the one-confirmation and that one-confirmation has been already done by the 
own attacker node (Node A), the exchange will deposit the 30BTC transaction into attacker 
account. The attacker would then immediately withdraw the 30BTC from his account. 
Eventually, the Bitcoin mining network will solve yet another block and that blockchain most 
likely knows of the 0.5BTC transaction and thus rejects the 50BTC transaction. When the 
exchange node sees the next block, it will discard the previous block obtained from the dishonest 
miner (attacker) which includes the 30BTC transaction as that block’s chain end at a block 
height that is below what is now the most extended chain. Thus, the exchange allowed a with 
61 
 
(“Irreversible Transactions–Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.) draw of the 30BTC even the deposit transaction 
for that was later reversed. So, in this scenario, the attacker got the 30BTC (Bitcoins) withdraw 
from his exchange's account and also keeps the 0.5BTC (Bitcoin) that was sent to attacker own 
wallet, and the exchange lost 30 Bitcoins in the attack. 
Possible countermeasure. The protective actions could be, waiting for multi-
confirmation, no incoming connections (Bamert et al., 2013), explicit outgoing connections to a 
well-connected nodes, inserting observers in the network, notify the merchant about the on-going 
double-spend (Karame et al., 2012, 2015; Podolanko et al., n.d.).  
Alternative history attack. The alternative history attack is still possible in case of 
multiple confirmations but requires high hash-rate and risk of significant expense in wasted 
electricity to the attacking miner (Lei, n.d.). 
Attack scenario. To launch the alternative history attack to carry out the double-
spending, the dishonest miner (attacker), submits to the merchant or network a transaction which 
pays the merchant. Meanwhile, the dishonest miner privately mines an alternative blockchain 
fork in which a fraudulent double-spending transaction is included. After waiting for the n 
confirmations, the merchant sends the product to the attacker. At this time, if the attacker finds 
more than n blocks, he releases his fork and regains his coins; otherwise, he keeps trying to 
continue extending his fork with the hope of being able to catch up with the network. If the 
attacker never able to extend his fork compare to the main blockchain fork, then the attack is 
failed, and he wasted his resource and also lose the reward for the mined blocks. The probability 
of success for such attack is based on the attacker’s hash-rate as a proportion of the total network 
hash-rate, and for the number of the confirmations, the merchant waits. Based on the bitcoin 
62 
 
network difficulty, it is hard to launch such attack on the Bitcoin network, but it is possible on 
the blockchain. The Reddcoin blockchain system was the victim of such attack in May 2014 
(“[Case Study] 51% attack and double spending,” 2014). The Reddcoin team considered it as 
51% attac, but eventually the attacker tried to do a multi-confirmation double-spending attack, in 
which the initial confirmation was 6 and after the attack. The Reddcoin blockchain increases the 
number of confirmations from 6 to 60. Later on, the Reddcoin blockchain system moved from 
Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake variety called Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV) to mitigate the 
risk of such attack. 
Possible countermeasure. The possible protective measures could be, no incoming 
connections (Bamert et al., 2013), explicit outgoing connections to a well-connected nodes, 
inserting observers in the network, notify the merchant about the on-going double-spend 
(Karame et al., 2012, 2015; Podolanko et al., n.d.). 
Fifty-one percent or >50% attack or majority hash rate attack. The blockchain relies 
on the distributed consensus mechanisms to maintain mutual trust in the network. However, the 
consensus mechanisms themselves have 51% vulnerability which can be exploited by the 
attackers to control the entire blockchain network. Though, the blockchain is designed with the 
assumption that honest nodes control the network. But when a user or group of users (miners) 
able to take control of more than 50% of the hash power in Proof-of-Work, then the 51% attack 
may be launched. The 51% attack or >50% is considered the most threatening attack on the 
blockchain network. It gives power to the attacker to destroy the stability of the whole network 
including actions such as double spending attack, exclude, modify, and self-reverse transactions 
and prevent some or all mining of valid blocks for their benefits. If the attacker controls more 
63 
 
than half of the network hash-rate, the success rate of Alternative history attack is 100% 
(“Irreversible Transactions–Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). Since, the attacker can generate blocks faster 
than the rest of the network, and maintain his private fork until it becomes longer than the main 
Bitcoin fork built by the honest network miners. Mainly in Bitcoin network, the 51% attack can 
lead to the various attacks. For instance, reverse transactions while the attacker is in control and 
initiates a double-spending attack. Prevent some or all transactions from to get confirmed. 
Prevent miners from mining any valid blocks. But the attacker cannot prevent transactions from 
being sent at all. Reverse other user’s transactions without their cooperation, or send coins that 
never belonged to him, or create coins out of thin air. 
Attack scenario. To launch the 51% attack to carry out the double-spending attack (the 
same coins are spent twice) the attacker performs the following: 
• Attacker submits to the merchant/network a transaction which pays the merchant. 
• Meanwhile, create a private blockchain starting from block number N (which 
includes the    double-spending transaction) and do not broadcast it to the network. 
• On the public blockchain, exchange coins for goods or services (for example, sell 
coins for BTC on an exchange). 
• Attacker waits for M blocks to be generated on the public blockchain to confirm the 
transaction (usually in Bitcoin network, merchant waits for 6 confirmation). 
• After m confirmation (at block N+M), the provider of goods or services deliver the 
product to attacker. 
• At this time, the private blockchain has generated more than m blocks, therefore 
longer than the public blockchain. 
64 
 
• Publish the privately mined blocks (private blockchain) to the network and replace 
the public blockchain, effectively removing the record of the previous transactions for 
goods or services. 
• Attacker received its money and assets back, and successfully launched the double-
spending. 
 The majority attack has never been successfully executed on the Bitcoin network. 
However, according to the Blockchain.info, in January 2014 the “ghash.io” mining pool reached 
42% of the total Bitcoin computing power, and in June 2014 the same mining pool hashrate 
fluctuated between 40% and 50% of the network’s total power over a week. This force some 
miners to voluntarily leave the ghash.io mining pool to drop the computing power and eliminate 
the fear of 51% attack. The Verge (XVG) a privacy blockchain experienced a 51% attack on 
April 4th, 2018, in which the attacker exploits a bug in the Verge code to exploit the timestamp 
(Sedgwick, 2018). The attacker stolen around 250,000 verge coins. The attack relented after 
three hours by initiating an immediate hard fork on the blockchain by the Verge team. 
Possible countermeasures.  The 51% attack is considered the most worst-case scenario 
as the adversary can do anything with the network. No amount of confirmation can prevent such 
attack; however, waiting for the confirmations does increase the aggregated resource cost of 
performing the attack. As the Bitcoin’s security model relies not on a single coalition of miners 
controlling more than half of the network hash-rate. So, a miner or a mining pool with more than 
50% hash power is an incentive to reduce their mining power and reframe from attacking. 
Therefore, the primary precaution is that no single miner or mining pool should have more than 
half of network hash-rate. 
65 
 
Other possible solutions are inserting observers into the network, communicating double-
spending alerts among peers (Karame et al., 2012, 2015). The paper (Eyal & Sirer, n.d.), 
introduced two-phase proof-of-work (2P-PoW), to disincentivize large mining pools. The paper 
(Luu & Velner, n.d.), proposes a novel approach for particle decentralized pooled mining using 
smart contracts. This paper claims that 95% of the Bitcoin’s and 80% of the Ethereum mining 
power resides with less than 10 and six mining pools, respectively. This makes the mining more 
centralized and pose the risk of transaction censorship from pool operators, and open up 
possibilities for cooperation between mining pools for executing severe attacks, including 51%. 
Mining Pools Security Threats 
 Mining pools are created by a group of miners to work together, pool their resources, and 
contribute to the generation of a block, and then share the block reward according to the added 
processing power. In case of the Bitcoin, when a pool solves a block, the 12.5 BTC (Bitcoin) 
generated by that block’s solution reward is split and distributed in between the miners (“Pool vs. 
solo mining–Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). The Bitcoin block mining reward halves every 210,000 blocks, 
so the coin reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoins (“Bitcoin Block Reward Halving 
Countdown,” n.d.). There is also solo mining when a miner performs the mining operations alone 
without joining a pool, and for each discovered block, 12.5 BTC and the transaction fees are paid 
to the miner. But in case of pools, the transaction fee is kept by the mining pool and not 
distributed among pool participants. However, the current difficulty level of Bitcoin 
(3,290,605,988,755) March 16, 2018 (“Bitcoin Block Reward Halving Countdown,” n.d.), makes 
it practically impossible for soloists to make a profit mining unless the solo miner has a vast 
amount of computer resources. The pool operator or manager controlled the mining pools. The 
66 
 
pool operator determines the amount of work done by individual pool members, by using the 
number of shares, a member find and submit while trying to discover a new block. 
 Different attack vectors exploit the vulnerabilities in the pool based mining approach. 
These attack vectors lead to both internal and external attacks on a mining pool. The internal 
attacks are carried out by some dishonest miners within the pool to collect more than their fair 
share of collective reward or interrupt the functionality of the honest miner in the pool and 
distant it from the successful mining attempts (Conti et al., 2017). In external attacks on pools, 
dishonest miners in the pool could use their higher hash power and perform some double-
spending attack. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is another significant external threat to 
the mining pool. 
 Most of the attacks on mining or mining pools uses the strategic objective to assure some 
of the dishonest miners a certain unfair advantage. For instance, to obtain an expected revenue 
from mining higher their fair share based on the contributed computer power. This strategic 
objective of dishonest miners leads to launch various types of attacks on the solo miners or 
pools.

Selfish Mining Attack. The selfish mining attack was first introduced by by Eyal and 
Sirer in the paper “Majority is not Enough” (Eyal & Sirer, 2014). There is another other paper 
that called the selfish mining attack as block-discarding attack (Bahack, 2013). In selfish mining 
attack, a dishonest miner(s), does not publish and distribute a valid solution to the rest of the 
network. In this attack, the dishonest miner(s) rather than acting like a regular miner and 
publishing blocks to the network immediately upon finding them, the attacker selectively 
releases blocks, or publishing many blocks all at once and thus forcing the rest of the network to 
discard their blocks and lose revenue (Eyal & Sirer, 2014). The primary motives of selfish 
mining are to obtain an unfair reward which is bigger than their share of computer power spent, 
and confuse other honest miners and lead them to waste their resources in a wrong direction.  
68 
 
Attack scenario. In paper “Majority is not Enough”  (Eyal & Sirer, 2014) by Eyal and 
Sirer, states the following  strategies for a selfish mining attack. In case a new block is 
discovered by honest miners, (1) if the size of the public chain (honest branch) is longer than 
then selfish branch (private chain created by attacker), then the selfish miners tries to set its 
private branch equal to the public branch. (2) if the selfish branch is one block is longer than the 
public branch, then selfish miners publish their private chain completely. (3) If the selfish branch 
is more than one block longer than the public branch, then the selfish miners publish only the 
head of their private branch. This scenario is simplified in the Figure 7. In case a new block is 
discovered by selfish miners, they keep this new block private and in case of competition with 
the honest miners, they publish their private branch to win the race. This scenario is simplified in 
Figure 8. 
Followings are the states to carrying out the selfish attack presented by (Eyal & Sirer, 
2014). 
Event: The honest miners discover a block. 
State 0: Only one single chain. That is, if the public chain is longer than the private chain 
of the attacker, set the private chain equal to the public chain. 
State 1: Dishonest miner (attacker) manages to mine a block, and kept the block private. 
State 2: Dishonest miner manages to mine another block and kept it private. 
State 2: Honest miners also find a block. 
In this situation, dishonest miner(s) published the private chain, and the honest miners 
lose their block. Because the private chain is longer than the public chain. 
69 
 
State 0: After releasing the private chain, the private chain became the public or main 
chain, and honest miners will start mining on top of it. The previous block mined by 
honest miners became invalid.  
 
Figure 7. Selfish mining attack with private chain simplified. 
Event: The dishonest miner discovers a block. 
State 1: A dishonest miner manages to mine a block, and kept it private. 
State 0’: Honest miners and dishonest miner chain are competing. 
Once, the honest miners find a new block as in state 0, the dishonest miner release the 
private block and hope the honest miners will mine on top of it. 
 
Figure 8. Selfish mining with one private block simplified. 
Possible countermeasures. There are different solutions proposed for such type of attack. 
Bitcoin improvement proposals (BIPS), suggested to randomly assign miners to various branches 
of pools, to lower the probability of the selfish mining attack. The paper (Heilman, 2014), 
proposed a solution called Freshness Preferred (FP). In which the block with recent timestamp 
70 
 
should be chosen. The FP uses unforgeable timestamps in blocks beside the timestamp that is 
already existed in each block header. The unforgeable timestamp can prove that a block was 
mined recently. As in case of the selfish mining, the attacker withholds a block, so using this 
approach it will decrease the motives for selfish mining because the withheld blocks will lose 
block race against the newly minted or fresh blocks. Thus, if dishonest miner releases a long list 
of blocks (private chain) then the rest of honest miners will weight their validity against the 
timestamp they were hashed and the timestamp they were reported to the network.  
 The paper proposes an algorithm called ZeroBlock, which uses timestamp-free 
prevention of block withholding attack (Solat & Potop-Butucaru, 2016). The key idea of this 
solution is that each block must be generated and received by the network within a maximum 
acceptable time (mat). If the miners could not mine a new block within mat interval, then miner 
itself need to generate a dummy block, called ZeroBlock. As in case of block withholding attack, 
the selfish miners hold the block and publish it later to the public chain, so that private blocks 
mined by selfish miners could have more value than mat. The dummy block is generated locally 
by honest miners. It conveys the solved blocks to prove, that the network witnesses the block and 
that a competing block is absent before miners can work on it. The dummy block includes the 
index of mat interval and the hash of the previous block, and the computation of each mat 
interval is done locally by each miner, which is based on the expected delay for a block mining 
and the information propagation time in the Bitcoin network. 
Block-withholding attack (BWH). The paper “The Miner’s Dilemma” (Ittay, n.d.), and 
the paper by Bag, Ruj, and Sakurai (2017), presented another attack on the mining pool called 
the block-withholding (BWH) attack. In block withholding attacks, blocks are discarded, and 
71 
 
dishonest miners never publish a mined block to sabotage the pool revenue. However, in selfish 
mining, dishonest miners just kept the mined block secret until the right time to release them. 
Block withholding attack is usually made by infiltrating another pool.  
Attack scenario. The mining pools have two types of users, one is pool manager, and 
other are regular miners. The pool manager forwards unsolved work units to pool members or 
miners. Miners in the pool generate partial Proof-of-Work (PPoW) and full Proof-of-Work 
(FPoW) and submit them to the pool’s manager as shares. Once a miner creates a block, it is 
submitted to the manager with FPoW, and then the manager broadcast the newly generated block 
to the Bitcoin network to receive the mining reward. Once the manager gets the rewards, it is 
distributed among the miners based on their PPoW. The paper (Ittay, n.d.) described the block-
withholding attack strategy as follows. 
As most of the pools nowadays are open pools and an attacker can register with a pool 
and participate as a regular miner. In block-withholding attack, the pool manager uses some of 
its miners for its own mining. The manager infiltrates a victim pool (another pool) by registering 
as a regular miner. He receives some of the work from the victim pool and then sends them to 
some of its loyal miners in his pool. The mining powers the attacker (manager) redirects towards 
the victim’s task is called the infiltration rate, and the miners are called infiltrating miners. Once 
the attacker receives the PPoW from his infiltrating miners, he sends them to the victim pool, 
which estimates their true mining power. But, when the attacker gets FPoW from his infiltrating 
miners, it withholds and discards them, and therefore it does not contribute to the victim’s 
revenue. The victim pool was thinking that the infiltrating workforce was doing useful mining 
and shares its revenue with the victim pool, but it tricked. The attacker then distributes its 
72 
 
revenue from its own mining and from its infiltration among all its loyal miners. In this scenario, 
the attacker’s mining power is reduced, since he used some of his miners for the block 
withholding, but he earns additional revenue through his infiltration of the other pool. Also, the 
total effective mining power in the system is reduced, causing the Bitcoin protocol to minimize 
the difficulty (Ittay, n.d.). 
Possible countermeasure. Since pool registration typically requires only a Bitcoin 
address for revenue collection and sometimes an email address, so it’s challenging for the victim 
pool to find out who is the attacker. The paper by Courtois, Bahack & Lear (2014) suggests a 
solution for block withholding attack, that pool manager should only allow trusted miners to 
register who are personally known to him or her. Also, if the pool revenue goes down than 
expected from its computational effort the pool should be closed. The paper (Bag et al., 2017) 
presented a cryptographic commitment scheme to counter BWH attack. This scheme can be 
implemented by making a small change to the existing Bitcoin protocol which will protect a pool 
from rogue miners and also from rogue pool managers. This scheme makes it impossible for the 
miners to distinguish between a PPoW and FPoW, and it is designed that the administrator 
cannot cheat on the entire pool. 
Fork-After-Withholding attack (FAW). The paper by Kwon, Kim, Son, Vasserman, 
and Kim (2017) introduced the fork after-withholding attack. FAW is another variant of BWH 
attack. In case of the FAW attack, the attacker’s reward is always equal to or greater than that for 
a BWH attacker, and it is four times more practical per pool than the BWH attack. In fact, the 
FAW attack combines components of selfish mining and BWH attack.  
73 
 
Attack scenario. To launch a FAW attack, an attacker (individual or pool) do as follows. 
(1) The attacker divides his computing power between the innocent mining and infiltration 
mining. The infiltration mining is the mining as part of a target or victim pool. (2) When the 
attacker finds an FPoW as part of infiltration mining in a pool, he holds that block privately and 
does not publish it. (3) Depending on what happens next, the privately owned FPoW block can 
be either release to the target pool manager hoping to create a fork (as in the selfish mining) or 
discard it (as in block withholding). The attacker will immediately release the privately held 
FPoW if he notices that other miners who are not part of the target pool and propagating a valid 
block. The attack does this to create a fork. But the attacker will drop his privately held FPoW in 
two cases. (a) The attacker notices that another miner in the target pool finds an FPoW, (attacker 
will still share in the reward from FPoW publish by another miner in the target pool). (b) If the 
attacker themselves finds another FPoW through their innocent mining and the attacker will 
receive a greater share of the block reward for the block they located outside of the target pool 
(Kwon et al., 2017). 
Possible countermeasures. There is no efficient solution so far reported and finding a 
cheap and efficient countermeasure remains an open problem. The same paper (Kwon et al., 
2017) suggest a partial solution to reward higher the miner who finds an FPoW in a pool, as 
compare to other miners who only submit PPoW. For instance, rewards 0.1 BTC to the miner 
who finds an FPoW in a pool and 0.9 BTC shared among the other miners in the pool according 
to their PPoW submissions. But, because of the high reward difference, miners may be hesitated 
to join pools using this reward system. 
74 
 
There are some other attacks that directly or indirectly disrupt the miner or mining pools 
activities. The paper by Rosenfeld (2011) presented the Pool Hopping attack. Pool-hopping is the 
exploitation of the circumstance by mining only when the attractiveness is high and living when 
the attractiveness is low. The attractiveness is the expected earnings. The main idea of this attack 
is that if a miner mines in a pool in which a lot of shares have already been submitted and no 
block has yet been found, he will gain less in expectation because the reward will be shared with 
the miners who have contributed to this pool. So, at a particular moment, it may be profitable to 
stop mining in this pool and participate in some other pools or mine individually. Usually, it is 
considered a good practice if the miner will not frequently change the pool based on the 
attractiveness. The paper by  Bonneau (n.d.) discusses a theoretical attack called, Bribery attacks, 
in which an attacker might purchase mining power for a short period via bribery. The bribery can 
be performed in-band with the system itself enforcing the bribe. That is, the attacker attempts to 
bribe using Bitcoin itself by creating a fork which contains the bribe money and available for the 
miner adopting the fork. Besides in-band payment, out-of-band payment, in which attacker will 
pay directly to rent their computing power, or by Negative-Fee mining pool, in which the 
attacker forms a pool by paying a higher return. This attack could lead to Majority attack, or 
Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) to disrupt the whole Bitcoin network functionality. 
Blockchain Network Security Threats 
The blockchain peer-to-peer nature of the network, which includes all the nodes who 
maintain and run the blockchain protocols and provides services come under the blockchain 
network. In case of the Bitcoin there are two types of nodes: those that accept incoming TCP 
connection, and generate blocks in the blockchain (miners) and other nodes (users) who only 
75 
 
create transaction and submit it into the Bitcoin network. There are various attacks can happen at 
the Blockchain network layer. 
Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS). The distributed, decentralized natures of 
the blockchain makes it harder for the attacker to launch an effective DDoS attack on the 
blockchain system than the conventional client-server model. However, blockchain ecosystem is 
still subject to DDoS attacks. A DDoS is an effort to make target system resources unavailable 
by overwhelming it with service requests. DDoS attacks can be either network layer or at 
application layer attacks. The DDoS at network layer cause network saturation by consuming 
much of the available network bandwidth. The DDoS at application layer attacks, intend to bring 
down a server by consuming much of its processing resources (e.g., memory or CPU) with a 
high number of requests. The application layer DDoS attacks usually facilitated by DDoS 
botnets. According to the Bitcoin forum, there are 23 built-in, prevention mechanisms in the 
Bitcoin client version 0.8.0, against the denial of service attacks and 7 Bitcoin protocol rules to 
prevent the denial of service attack in Bitcoin (“Weaknesses–Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). Nevertheless, 
Bitcoin and other blockchain base platform are still vulnerable to sophisticated DDoS, and it 
becomes the most common attack on the blockchain ecosystem. DDoS main target is crypto 
exchanges, mining pools, e-wallets, smart contracts and other financial services in the blockchain 
system. According to the Imperva Incapsula, a cloud-based service provider, report (Q3 2017 
Global DDoS Threat Landscape), more than 73% of all bitcoin sites using the Imperva services 
were attacked in the third quarter of 2017 (“Global DDoS Threat Landscape | Q3 2017 | 
Incapsula,” n.d.), which means the cryptocurrency exchanges and services are the relatively high 
target of DDoS attacks. The paper (Vasek, Thornton, & Moore, 2014) performed an empirical 
76 
 
study of DDoS attacks, and  documented 142 unique DDoS attacks on the Bitcoin services 
between May 2011 and October 2013. The study found that 7% of all popular operators have 
been affected by DDoS attacks, but the currency exchanges, mining pools, gambling operators, 
eWallets, and other financial services are much more likely to be attacked. Between these two 
studies (2013 and 2017) ( “Global DDoS Threat Landscape | Q3 2017 | Incapsula,” n.d.; Vasek et 
al., 2014), we can conclude that still the DDoS attacks high intension is currency exchages and 
mining pools and definetely most of the exchanges are using some sort of wallet services.  
Possible countermeasures. Various anti- DDoS services are available that could 
protections for the blockchain network and applications in the market such as CloudFlare, 
Incapsula, or Cloud Services (Amazon) and many other, if used by the currency exchanges and 
mining pools can mitigate the risk of DDoS on their services. At the consensus protocol level the 
paper by Bentov, Lee, Mizrahi, and Rosenfeld (2014) proposed a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) 
consensus mechanism that combines the PoW components with the PoS. The authors claim that 
PoA protocol offers good security against the possible attacks on the Bitcoin, and has relatively 
low penalty in terms of network performance and storage usage.  
Transaction malleability attack. The transaction malleability considered as a flaw in the 
original Bitcoin protocol. The paper by Andrychowicz, Dziembowski, Malinowski, and Mazurek 
(2015) proposes the transaction malleability attack, and also the paper by Decker and 
Wattenhofer (2014) did a study to traces the Bitcoin network for over a year and showed that the 
transaction malleability problem is real and it was not well-known before the closure of MtGox 
hack (transaction malleability hack). In transaction malleability attacks, attacker tricks his target 
into believing that a transaction has failed. The attacker then asks for the transaction to be 
77 
 
repeated. In this way, the attacker who was already owned X Bitcoins could fraudulently obtain 
twice the amount. This could be happened by changing the transaction hash (transaction ID) of a 
Bitcoin transaction before it is confirmed on the Bitcoin network. 
Each user in the Bitcoin network may create an arbitrary number of addresses that can be 
used to send and receive Bitcoins. An address is derived from an ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital 
Signature Algorithm) key pair that is later used to prove the ownership of the Bitcoins associated 
with that address. The ECDSA is a cryptographic algorithm used by the Bitcoin to ensure that 
funds can only be spent by their owners. The only operation allowed to modify the address 
balances is the transaction. A transaction is identified by the SHA256 hash of their serialized 
representation, which consists of one or more inputs and outputs. The input is used to specify 
which bitcoins will be transferred, and the output specifies the address that should be credited to 
the Bitcoin being transferred (Decker & Wattenhofer, 2014). The input, output, number of 
Bitcoins to send and some other data are cryptographically signed, into a unique piece of data 
called hash. The hash is essentially the transaction ID. Once the miner confirms the transaction, 
the transaction ID is included in a block and stored in the blockchain. Now, as any modification 
to the original data should generate a different hash. Thus, if the attacker can modify somehow 
the same transaction data, it will produce a different hash. So, two transactions can exist with the 
same inputs and outputs, valid signature but the different hashes. This is called transaction 
malleability. The main reason for the success of this attack is that in Bitcoin each transaction is 
uniquely identified by its transaction ID (hash). 
 A malleability attack is considered as a variant of the double-spending attack but with 
some difference. In transaction malleability attack, the attacker is no longer the person who is 
78 
 
issuing the transaction (as in double-spending case). Instead, it is the receiving party (Decker & 
Wattenhofer, 2014). In fact, the attacker would cause the victim to create a transaction that 
transfers some Bitcoins to an address controlled by the attacker. Once the attacker receives the 
transaction, the same transaction is then modified by altering the signature of it, without 
invalidating it. The modified transaction then has a different transaction identification hash. The 
changed transaction is then broadcasted to the network, and either of the two transactions may 
later be confirmed. The malleability attack is considered successful if the modified version of the 
transaction is later confirmed (Decker & Wattenhofer, 2014). Now, if the victim relies only on 
the transaction identity hash to track and verify its account balance, and the victim will see that 
transaction it issued has not been confirmed. It will credit the amount to the attacker or 
attempting to send another transaction at a later time. The attacker would have doubled 
efficiently the funds the victim sent it. 
 The current reference Bitcoin core client is not vulnerable to this attack as it tracks the 
unspent transaction output set by applying all confirmed transactions to it, rather than concluding 
only from transaction it issued (Decker & Wattenhofer, 2014). 
Attack scenario. MtGox a popular Bitcoin exchange suffered from transaction 
malleability attack that eventually led to the filing for bankruptcy of MtGox. The attacker tried  
to exploit the vulnerability in the MtGox client that identified both transactions as different,    
and this leads to the transaction malleability. The attack on the MtGox proceeds as follows:      
(1) Attacker deposits n Bitcoins in his MtGox account. (2) Then the attacker sends a transaction 
T to the MtGox to transfer his n Bitcoins back. (3) MtGox issues a transaction T' which transfer 
the n Bitcoins back to the attacker. (4) The attacker performed the transaction malleability by 
79 
 
tweaking the signature data and get the transaction T' which is semantically equivalent to T but 
has a different transaction identification hash or transaction id. Now assumes that T' gets 
included into the Bitcoin blockchain instead of T.  (5) Once the attacker receives the T', he 
complains to MtGox that the transaction T was not successful. (6) MtGox did an internal check, 
and it will not found a successful transaction of T. Thus, MtGox credited the attacker's account 
again. The problem is that the MtGox should not only search the transaction based on the 
transaction id but also any semantically equivalent of T (Conti et al., 2017). 
Possible countermeasures. The BIP 62 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 62) that intended 
to deal with malleability and listed the sources of malleability (“bitcoincore development–How 
much of BIP 62 [(‘Dealing with malleability’] has been implemented?,” n.d.). The BIP 62 was 
supposed to be implemented as soft fork to fix this issue and enforced the new transaction 
validity rule which consider multiple metrics for transaction verification. 
Timejacking attack. Timejacking attack is an attack on the Bitcoin network that is due 
to a theoretical vulnerability in Bitcoin timestamp handling. In Timejacking attack, attacker try 
to announce inaccurate timestamps when connecting to a node. Once the network time counter of 
node is altered by the attacker, the deceived node may accept an alternate blockchain. This could 
significantly increase the chances of a successful double-spending, drain a node’s computational 
resources, or simply slow down the transaction confirmation rate (Boverman, 2011). 
 Attack scenario. Each node in the network internally maintains a time counter that 
represents the network time, which is based on the median time of a node’s peers which is sent in 
the version message when peers connect. But, if the median time differs by more than 70 minutes 
from the system time, the network time counter reverts to the system time. An attacker could 
80 
 
plant multiple fake peers in the network and all these fake peers will report inaccurate 
timestamps, which could potentially slow down or speed up a node’s network time (Boverman, 
2011).  
Possible countermeasures. The Boverman (2011) study mentioned a few solutions to 
overcome this dilemma. (1) Use the node’s system time instead of the network time to determine 
the upper limit of the block timestamps and when creating blocks. (2) Restricted the acceptance 
time ranges. That is, the node’s network time could be restricted to a value within 30 minutes. 
This changes the maximum initial attack window to between 30 and 60 minutes instead of 70 
and 140. However, it would not prevent splits entirely, and nodes with incorrect daylight savings 
handling might be left behind. (3) Use only trusted peers. 
Routing attacks. The paper (Apostolaki et al., 2017) introduced the routing attacks on 
the Bitcoin network. This paper studied the impact of that Internet routing attacks (such as BGP 
hijacks), and malicious Internet Service Providers (ISP) can have on the Bitcoin network. The 
routing attacks can impact individual nodes and also target the whole network. This paper states 
that two key properties make routing attacks practically: (a) the efficiency of the routing 
manipulation, and (b) the significant centralization of Bitcoin concerning mining and routing. 
More specifically, the key observation suggests that any attacker with few (<100) hijacked BGP 
prefixes could partition nearly 50% of the mining power. 
A BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)  hijack is a routing attack in which an ISP diverts 
internet traffic by advertising a fake announcement in the internet routing system (“BGP 
hijacking,” 2018). This research shows that most of the Bitcoin nodes are hosted in few ISPs; 13 
ISPs host 30% of the entire Bitcoin network and most of the traffic exchanged between Bitcoin 
81 
 
nodes traverse few ISPs. Particularly, 60% of the all possible Bitcoin connections cross 3 ISPs, 
in other words, 3 ISPs can see 60% of all Bitcoin traffic. These two characteristics make it 
relatively easy for a dishonest ISP to intercept a lot of Bitcoin traffic (Apostolaki et al., 2017). 
Thus, because of the extreme efficiency of the Internet routing attacks and the centralization of 
the Bitcoin network in few networks worldwide (mining pools), the paper shows following two 
attacks that are practically possible. 
Partition attack. Any ISP can partition the Bitcoin network by hijacking few IP prefixes. 
The goal of a partition attack is to disconnect as set of nodes from the network entirely. This 
requires the attacker to divert and cut all the connection between the set of the nodes and the rest 
of the network, and partition the network into disjoint components. By preventing nodes within a 
partition to communicate with outside nodes, the attacker forces the creation the parallel 
blockchains. To perform partition attack, the attacker first diverts the traffic and intercepts the 
Bitcoin traffic (e.g., based on the TCP ports) and identifies whether the corresponding 
connections cross the partition he tries to create. If So, the attacker drops the packets, if not 
meaning that the connection is inside the partition P. The attacker keeps monitors the Bitcoin 
traffic to detect the “leakage points.” Leakage points are nodes currently within the partition P, 
which maintains connections with nodes outside of P, that the attacker cannot intercept which is 
called “stealth” connection. 
• Attack scenario. The following figure shows the partition attack scenario (Apostolaki 
et al., 2017). 
 
82 
 
 
Figure 9: Partition routing attack simplified. How ISP adversary can intercept Bitcoin traffic by 
hijacking prefixes to isolate the set of nodes P = (A,B,C,D,E,F) (Apostolaki et al., 2017). 
Here AS8 is the Autonomous Systems or ISP number 8. 
 
The attack is as follows: (1) Nodes of the left and right side of the network communicate 
through a Bitcoin connections denoted by blue lines. (2) The attacker attracts the traffic destined 
to the left nodes by performing a BGP hijack. (3) The attacker cuts these connections, effectively 
partitioning the network into two parts. (4) During the attack, nodes within each side continue 
communicating with nodes of the same side. After the attack, the attacker can discard all the 
blocks mined within the smaller partitions including all the transactions and the miner’s revenue. 
Delay attack. The goal of this attack is to slow down the propagation of blocks towards 
or from a given set of nodes. Here an attacker can use routing attacks to the delivery of a block to 
a victim node by 20 minutes while staying completely undetected. During this period, the victim 
is unaware of the most recently mined blocks. So, it the victim is a merchant, it is susceptible to 
double-spending attacks, and if it is a miner, the miner wastes its computation power, and if the 
83 
 
victim is a regular node, then it is unable to contribute to the network by propagating the last 
version of the blockchains. 
• Attack scenario. Following figure shows the partition attack scenario(Apostolaki et 
al., 2017). 
 
Figure 10: Delay Routing attack simplified. Example of delay attack, how an AS-level adversary 
(AS8) which intercepts a part of the traffic can delay the delivery of  
a block for 20 minutes to a victim node C (Apostolaki et al., 2017). 
 
The attack is as follows: (1) Nodes A and B broadcast the same block to the victim node 
C, using the INV message. (2) Node C request the block via a GETDATA from node A. Then 
attacker changes the content of the GETDATA such that it triggers the delivery of an older block 
from node A. (3) The older block is delivered. (4) Shortly before 20 minutes after the original 
bock requested by node C, the attacker triggers its delivery by modifying another GETDATA 
message originated by C. (5) The bloc is delivered just before the 20 minutes timeout. The victim 
does not disconnect from node A. 
The potential damage of this attack is disturbing; among other these attacks could reduce 
miner’s revenue and render the network much more susceptible to double-spending. These 
84 
 
attacks could also prevent merchants, exchanges and other large entities that hold Bitcoins from 
performing transactions. 
• Possible countermeasures. The paper by Apostolaki et al. (2017) also provides a set 
of countermeasures against routing attack. Such as Increase the diversity of node 
connections. That is, the more connected as AS is, the harder it is to attack it. So, it is 
better, that Bitcoin nodes are multi-homed. Another countermeasure could be select 
Bitcoin peers while taking routing into account. Bitcoin nodes randomly establish 
eight outgoing connections, while randomness is vital to avoid biased decisions, 
Bitcoin nodes should build a few extra connections considering routing. Furthermore, 
monitor the round-trip (RTT). The RTT towards the hijack destination increases 
during the attack, so by observing the RTT towards its peers, a node could detect 
sudden changes and establish extra random connections as a protection mechanism. 
Also, it is a good practice to use gateways in different ASes. Based on this study they 
found that most of the pools are using gateways in the same AS. So, by hosting these 
gateways in different ASes would make it harder for the attacker to launch the routing 
attacks against the network.  
 Sybil a ttack. The Sybil attack is an attack wherein a reputation system is weakened by 
forging identifies in P2P networks (Douceur, n.d.). That is, one attacker with many identities. In 
a Sybil attack, the attacker subverts the reputation system of a P2P network by creating a large 
number of pseudonymous identities and then use them to gain a suspiciously large influence. A 
Sybil attack in Bitcoin network is an attack where a single adversary is controlling multiple 
nodes in the Bitcoin network. The paper by Douceur (n.d.) shows that, without a logically 
85 
 
centralized authority, Sybil attacks are always possible except under extreme and unrealistic 
assumptions of resources and coordination among entities. Thus, Proof of Work does not prevent 
a Sybil attack from occurring. However, Bitcoin uses PoW to make it infeasible for a successful 
Sybil attack to feed false information to the victim. Also, Bitcoin nodes initiating multiple 
randomly outbound connections to other peers in the network.  
Attack scenario. To Sybil attack a Bitcoin node, the attacker has to first identify the 
victim’s node and then replace that all of that node’s peers with the attacker nodes. Then the 
attacker tries to isolate the user and disconnect the transactions initiated by the user or a user will 
be made to choose only those blocks that are governed by the attacker. If no nodes in the 
network confirm a transaction that input can be used for double-spending attack. 
Possible countermeasures. Bitcoin protocol is considered Sybil resistance, because it 
considers the true chain to be the one with most cumulative proof of work (not the longest chain 
as is often incorrectly stated), the result is that a new peer joining the network only needs to 
connect to a single honest peer to find the true chain. This is also known as Sybil resistance, 
which means that it’s not possible for someone to launch an attack against a node by creating 
many dishonest peers that provide the false information (Lopp, 2016). A worst-case scenario is 
when honest node is being massively Sybil attacked but still has a single connection with an 
honest node that is connected to the true Bitcoin network. As long as a single honest node is 
passing the true data to the honest full node (which is being attacked), it will ignore all the 
attempts from the Sybil attacker’s nodes.

Figure 11: Sybil attack on honest node of Bitcoin network (Lopp, 2016). 
The paper by Bissias, Ozisik, Levine, and Liberatore (2014), proposed a two-party 
mixing protocol called Xim. It is decentralized protocol to simultaneously address Sybil attack, 
denial of service attacks, and timing-based inference attacks. It is a multi-round protocol that 
includes a decentralized system for anonymously finding mix partners based on ads placed in the 
blockchain. Xim’s design increases attacker cost linearly with the total number of participants, 
and by increasing the cost, it can mitigate the Sybil-based DoS attack effects. Usually, in other 
mixing protocols such as DarkWallet, SharedCoin, and CoinShuffle participants pay only 
standard transaction fees. The transaction fees are practically negligible; because the cost to the 
attacker is just the sum of the instances where they are successful, rather than to the number of 
identities they created. So, if Sybil attackers wishing to maintain a fixed success rate must pay 
for each participating address, and so their costs grow linearly with the total number of mix 
participants, while honest participant’s costs are fixed and constant with the number of 
participants (Bissias et al., 2014). 
Eclipse attack. In eclipse attack, an adversary able to control a sufficient number of IP 
addresses to monopolize all connections to and from a victim node (Wang, 2015). That is the 
87 
 
attacker force network partition between the public network and a specific miner. If successful 
the attacker can then exploit the victim for attacks on Bitcoin’s mining and consensus systems, 
including 0-confirmation and N-confirmation double-spending attacks, selfish mining and 
adversarial forks in the blockchain. To perform an eclipse attack, an attacker can manipulate the 
node so that all its outgoing connections are to attacker IPs. For this, the attacker need to fill 
victim node’s peer tables with attacker IPs. Once the node is restarted it loses its current 
outgoing connections. Finally, the node makes new connections only to the attacker IPs. The 
node restarts frequently occur, because of software updates, a packet of death/DoS attacks, and 
power or network failures. 
To understand the attack scenario for the eclipse attack, some keys Bitcoin network 
information is essential. For instance, a Bitcoin node has a maximum of 8 outgoing TCP 
connections, and 117 incoming TCP connections by default. These connections form the gossip 
network to propagate Bitcoin transactions and blocks. The eclipse attack targets only the Bitcoin 
nodes that accept incoming connections because not all nodes accept incoming connections.  
 
 
 
 
 
88 
 
 
Figure 12: Bitcoin’s P2P network incoming and outgoing connection (Wang, 2015). 
With proper manipulation of the P2P network, an adversary can eclipse a node so that it 
is only communicating with malicious nodes. Moreover, in Bitcoin network, Public IPs are 
stored in a node’s “tried” and “new” tables. These tables are stored on disk and persist when a 
restart. The tried table stores IP address that a node has successfully made incoming and 
outgoing TCP connections. The new table stores IP addresses received from DNS seeders or 
ADDR messages. A DNS seeder is a server that responds to DNS queries from Bitcoin nodes 
with a list of IP addresses for Bitcoin nodes. The maximum possible number of IP addresses that 
can be returned by a single DNS query is around 4000. ADDR messages, containing up to 1000 
IP address and their timestamps, are used to obtain network information from peers. If more than 
1000 address are sent in an ADDR message, the peer who sent the message is blacklisted. Nodes 
accept unsolicited ADDR messages, and an ADDR message is solicited only upon establishing 
an outgoing connection with a peer. When a node restarts it randomly selects an IP address from 
89 
 
either tried or new tables. If the connection is successful, add that IP address as a new outgoing 
connection, and this is repeated until eight outgoing connections are established. 
Attack scenario. The attack is as follows (Goldberg & Aviv Zohar, 2015): (1) The 
attacker first gets a large number of IP addresses, e.g., control a distributed botnet. (2) Then the 
attacker fills the tried table of victim node with attacker-controlled addresses. (3) Overwrite 
addresses in the new table with “trash” IP address that are not part of the Bitcoin network. For 
this, the attacker peers send unsolicited ADDR messages filled with “trash.” The “trash” 
addresses are unallocated or as “reversed for future use” like 252.0.0.0/8 block (“IANA IPv4 
Address Space Registry,” n.d.). (4) The attacker force or wait for the victim node be restarted. 
(5) Once the victim node is restarted, with high probability, victim forms all of her outgoing 
connections with attacker controlled IP addresses. 
Possible countermeasures. The paper by Wang (2015) provides eight countermeasures to 
makes eclipse attack difficult. Such as random selection of addresses from the tried and new 
tables. Moreover, diversify incoming connections, that is, a node should accept only a limited 
number of connections form the same IP address. As nowadays, a bitcoin node can have all of its 
incoming connections form the same IP address. Also, ban unsolicited ADDR messages. A node 
could choose not to accept large unsolicited ADDR messages (with >10 addresses) from 
incoming peers, and only solicit ADDR messages from outgoing connections when its new table 
is too empty.  
Wallet Security Threats  
Blockchain-based currencies use private key-based authentication, though passwords 
remain the most common form of user authentication (Bos et al., 2013). Users’ needs their public 
90 
 
and private keys, to access coins or make transactions in the blockchain. A Bitcoin wallet is a 
collection of private’s keys that are used to manage those keys and to make transactions on the 
Bitcoin network (Eskandari et al., 2015). Bitcoin uses Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm 
(ECDSA) which is a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) to sign and validate 
transactions (Goldfeder, Gennaro, & Kalodner, n.d.). A digital signature of a transaction is an 
encryption of the transaction hash calculated with a private key. The signature of the transaction 
can be verified with an associated public key. The digital signature proves that the transaction 
has not been altered, and the owner of the private key has issued that transaction. In the process 
of creating signature a pre-selected random value is used along with the private key, and the 
random value should be different for each transaction. 
Various types of key management schemes are used in the blockchain ecosystem. 
Typically, wallets could be either online (hot - connected to the Internet) or offline (cold-
disconnected from the internet. Online and offline wallets could be summarized into four 
categories; software, hardware, paper and online wallets. Software wallets are applications or 
client’s software that users can download onto their desktop, laptop, or mobile devices to store 
their private keys local, and are considered online wallet. Different types of software’s wallets 
are available in the market such as Bitcoin core, Bitcoin XT, Armory. Hardware wallets are 
stand-alone hardware cold-storage that is used to store private key offline. Popular hardware 
wallets in the markets are Ledger Nano, TREZOR, PI wallet. A paper wallet is a fancy term for 
printing out your public and private keys on a piece of paper, and sometimes QR barcode is used 
to store the private key. In online wallets or web-based wallets, private keys are stored in the 
91 
 
cloud rather than a local computer. Most of the currency exchange offers web-based wallet 
facilities.  
Private key security threats. 
Vulnerable signature. In Bitcoin, the private key is the major authentication component, 
and Bitcoin mainly reply on the ECDSA to sign and validate transaction. The paper (Bos et al., 
2013) states that the ECDSA has insufficient randomness in signature generation, which could 
lead to compromise of private key. In the process of creating signature a pre-selected random 
value is used along with the private key, and the random value should be different for each 
transaction. This research found that 158 unique public keys had used the same nonce value 
(random value) in more than one signature, and this make it possible to compute these users’ 
private keys. As ECDSA has poor randomness property, and Bitcoin highly used ECDSA, so 
securing private keys with new cryptographic algorithms besides ECDSA is still an open 
challenge.  
Lack of control in address creation.  Bitcoin address is the hash value of a public key 
encoded with a pair of public and private keys (Park & Park, 2017). The paper by Ateniese, 
Faonio, Magri, and de Medeiros (2014) states an extension of the Bitcoin protocol that preserves 
its decentralized nature, while enabling payers to optionally specify the involvement of a trusted 
authority that attests to the identity of the payee, by requiring payees to use certified Bitcoin 
addresses. That is, to send and receive Bitcoins only to and from certified users and control of 
creation of Bitcoin addresses by trusted authorities. The certified addresses are still anonymous 
within the Bitcoin system, but the authority can validate the legitimacy of the entity to whom it 
releases a certificate address. The certified addresses are allowed to co-exist with the standard 
92 
 
auto-generation Bitcoin addresses. The paper claims that this can help in mitigating identity 
theft, particularly, considering the case where a man-in-the-middle (MIMT) attacker changes the 
payee’s Bitcoin address for the attacker’s address. Moreover, the certified Bitcoin address are 
blinded, that is, the trusted authority can mint coins on behalf of a particular user, but it cannot 
spend any of them. Also, the author claims that they mitigate the existing reservations against the 
adaptation of Bitcoin as a currency in commercial uses. But this scheme has some tradeoff of 
user privacy concerns with respect to trusted authority. 
Possible collison and pre-image attacks. The paper by Giechaskiel, Cremers, and 
Rasmussen (2016) states that most of the digital currencies including Bitcoin rely on 
cryptographic primitives to operate, and these primitive are breakable with increased 
computational power and advanced cryptanalysis.  
The possible effects of broken primitives could be collision attacks and pre-image 
attacks. A collision attack is an attack in which the adversary tries to find two inputs producing 
the same hash,.i.e., a hash collision, and in contrast to this a pre-image attack where a specific 
target hash value is specified (“Collision attack - Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). This research analyzes and 
reveals the possible of impact of the collision attack on Bitcoin could be repudiate payer, or 
destroy coins, and pre-image attack could cause uncover address, double-spending, steal coins or 
completely destroy blockchain. Though for such cryptographic attacks huge computation power 
is required which could be possible if someone completely dedicate a large size mining pools or 
has high possibility with quantum computing. 
Flawed key generation. Sometimes due to faulty implementations of ECDSA and the 
associated hash functions for key generations creates weakness in wallets which lead to exposure 
93 
 
of private keys. This happened in December 2014 to hybrid wallet provider called 
Blockchain.info (Beecroft, 2015). This mistake happened during the update of the code for the 
Blockchain.info, and this affected the inputs to the ECDSA algorithm were not sufficiently 
random to generate an effective one-way function. Due to lack of randomness, it’s easy to 
determine private key using user’s public key. This issue was resolved within two-and-a-half 
hours (Beecroft, 2015). However, the flaw in the implementations is often possible which could 
leak of private keys. 
Bugs and malware threats. The paper by Wan et al. (2017) provides a large-scale 
empirical study on bug characteristics in blockchain systems that examine 1,108 bugs reports. 
This research discussed various types of bugs in blockchain client software’s both such as 
semantic bugs (runtime), memory, concurrency, performance, security, GUI, configuration, 
build, compatibility and hard fork bugs in the blockchain systems including the client software. 
There are also various reports about the bugs in the hardware wallets. Recently author Rashid 
(2018) claims and demonstrate how an Evil Maid attack is possible on the currently popular 
hardware wallet named, Nano S. Ledger. This attack would allow extracting the PIN, recovery 
seed and BIP-39 passphrases used, and lead to disclosing of all the private keys in the wallet. To 
launch this attack, an attacker needs to update the MCU firmware of ledger using some social 
engineering or using an infected computer. This vulnerability is shared with the Nano S. ledger 
team to be fixed. The reports Risks and opportunities for systems using blockchain and smart 
contracts (Staples, 2017) and Cryptocurrency Mining Malware (2017) argue and predict the 
possible malware that could affect the various cryptocurrencies. 
 
94 
 
Smart Contract Security Threats 
 A smart contract is a program or scripts that automatically execute when certain 
conditions are met. Ethereum blockchain was designed as a smart contract platform, and the 
most well-known and used framework for smart contracts (Buterin, 2014). The Ethereum Virtual 
Machine (EVM) is a runtime environment where smart contracts run in the Ethereum. A good 
metaphor is that the EVM is a distributed global computer where all smart contracts are executed 
(Araoz, 2016). Every single operation that is executed inside the EVM is simultaneously 
executed by every node in the network. To limit the resources used by each contract run in the 
EVM, a mechanism is used called gas. Each operation of contracts has a cost measured in gas, 
and each gas unit consumed by a transaction paid for in Ether, based on the gas/Ether price 
which changes dynamically (Araoz, 2016). Ether is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin used by 
Ethereum (Buterin, 2014).  
The paper by Atzei et al. (2016) analyzed security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart 
contracts and group them into the level where they are introduced such as Solidity, EVM 
bytecode, or blockchain. Solidity is the language for smart contracts, i.e., the source code is 
written in Solidity, and EVM is the virtual machine where contracts run. The research analyzes 
12 types of vulnerabilities and that most of them have been already exploited. The 12 types of 
security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts as shown in the following table. 
  
95 
 
Table 2 
Taxonomy of Vulnerabilities in Ethereum Smart Contracts  
 
 Vulnerabilities in the smart contract based Blockchain.  
Vulnerabilities in solidity. Call to the unknown. It refers to use of some functions in 
solidity to invoke functions and to transfer ether may result in the execution of an unknown, 
possible malicious fallback function. That is, i the intended function to be called, does not exist, 
then the fallback function is executed, and malicious users can exploit this vulnerability by 
calling their own fallback function (Atzei et al., 2016). 
Gasless send. The function send is used to transfer Ether, and it is possible to encounter 
out of gas expectation. If the callee of a send function is a contract with relatively expensive 
fallback function than the caller gas limit–which could be up to 2300 units, for sending Ether to 
an address and if the gas is insufficient, then an out-of-gas exception will be thrown. 
Exception disorders. There are several situations in which exception may be raised. 
However, Solidity is not uniform in a way it handles exceptions (Atzei et al., 2016). The 
Number Vulnerability Cause Level 
1 Call to the unknown Called function does not exit Solidity 
2 Gasless send Callee's fallback function is invoked 
3 Exception disorders Irregularity in exception handling 
4 Type casts No expectation is thrown, if type-mismatched 
5 Reentrancy A non-recursive function re-enter before termination 
6 Keeping secrets Contracts private fields, secrecy is not guaranteed 
7 Immutable bugs Defective contracts cannot be patched or recovered EVM 
8 Ether lost in transfer Ether sent to orphan address is lost 
9 Stack size limit The number of values exceeds 1024 in the stack 
10 Unpredictable state Actual state of the contract is changed before invoking Blockchain 
 
11 Generating 
randomness 
Malicious miner biases the outcome of random number 
12 Time constraints Timestamp of the block is changed by malicious miner 
 
96 
 
irregularity in how exceptions are handled may impact the security of the contract. This is 
usually happened due to unchecked send errors or called contracts that throw exceptions, and the 
effect is the calling transaction is entirely reverted, and all gas is lost (Cook, Latham, & Lee, 
n.d.). 
Type casts. The Solidity compiler can detect some types' errors. But in some cases, the 
compiler does not recognize mismatched type error. Mainly, if the arguments to a direct call 
from one contract to a function of another contract are incorrectly typed, or the address of the 
contract is invalid, either nothing will be executed, or the wrong code will be executed (Cook et 
al., n.d.). In all cases, no exception is thrown, and the caller is unaware of the error. 
Reentrancy.  Due to the atomicity and sequentially execution of transactions, some 
programmers believe that when a non-recursive function is invoked, it cannot be re-entered 
before its termination. But, it is not always the case, and a fallback mechanism may allow an 
attacker to re-enter the caller function, and this result of repeated execution of the function and 
consume all gas (Atzei et al., 2016).  
Keeping secrets. Some fields in contracts are public, which are readable by everyone, and 
some held private which should not be directly readable by other users/contracts. However, 
contract fields declared private, are still not guaranteed to remain secret.  
Vulnerabilities in EVM. 
Immutable bugs. Once the smart contracts are added to the blockchain, due to the 
immutable property of blockchain, it cannot be altered. The programmers consider that the 
contract’s runtime behavior should be as they are expecting. However, if they found the contract 
is defective, then there is no direct way to patch it. The immutable bugs have been exploited in 
97 
 
various attacks to steal Ether or to make it unredeemable by any user (Atzei et al., 2016). 
Sometimes developers need to plan a hard-fork to resolve such issue as the Ethereum team did 
after the “DOA attack.” 
 Ether lost in the transfer. If Ether is sent to an orphan address, it is lost forever. The 
orphan address does not belong to any user or contract, and there is no way to detect if the 
address is orphan (Atzei et al., 2016). 
Stack size limit. Each time a contract calls another contract or even itself, a transaction’s 
call stack grows, and once the stack is reached to 1,024 frames, an exception is thrown. An 
attacker was able to exploit this vulnerability by generating an almost-full call stack (via a 
sequence of nested calls), and then he invokes the victim’s function, which will fail upon a 
further invocation. By October 18th, 2016 Ethereum team resolves this issue by changing some 
gas rules and certain instruction costs (Atzei et al., 2016). 
Vulnerabilities in Blockchain. 
Unpredictable state. Fields and balances determine the state of a smart contract. When a 
user sends a transaction to invoke some contracts, he cannot be sure that the transaction will be 
run in the same state the contract was at the time of sending that transaction. This may happen, 
because at the same time other transaction may change the state of same contracts. This 
vulnerability is said to be available in up to 15.8 percent in all smart contracts, and this bug is 
also called Transaction-Ordering Dependence (TOD) (Rivlin, 2016). 
Generating randomness.  There are two types of execution of EVM bytecode, 
deterministic and non-deterministic (Atzei et al., 2016). Deterministic, where all miners’ 
executing a transaction will have the same result, and non-deterministic is to stimulate non-
98 
 
deterministic choices such as contracts for lotteries, games, etc. In non-deterministic execution of 
EVM bytecode pseudo-random numbers are generated, where the initialization seed is chosen 
uniquely by all miners. A malicious miner could exploit this vulnerability by arranging their 
block to influence the outcome of this random number generation. 
Time constraints/timestamp dependency. Most of the applications use time constraints to 
determine which actions are permitted or mandatory at the current state of contract. The time 
constraints are implemented by using block timestamp, and some Dapps (Distributed 
Applications) use this timestamp to generate random numbers. However, the clock in Ethereum 
is set by local clocks of its miners. Thus, such Dapps can be affected with slight adjustments to 
miner’s reported times (Cook et al., n.d.). 
Attacks based on exiting vulnerabilities. The above 12 mentioned vulnerabilities led to 
six types of attacks (Atzei et al., 2016). (1) The DAO attack–DOA was a contract implementing 
a crowd-funding platform and this attacked happened by exploiting the “call to unknown” 
vulnerability of the Solidity. (2) King of the Ether Throne attack–the “King of the Ether Throne” 
is a game where players compete for getting the title of “King of the Ether,” and this attack was 
happened by exploiting the “gasless send” and “exception disorders” vulnerabilities in the smart 
contract source code. (3) Multi-player games attack- Consider an online game between two 
players and suppose one of the players carry on an attack by exploiting the “keeping secret” or 
disclosing private field in the smart contract which can help him to reveal the opposing player 
state, and by this, the attacker can win the game. Game industry uses Ethereum smart contracts. 
(4) Rubixi attack–Rubixi is a smart contract to implement a Ponzi scheme, which is a fraudulent 
high-return investment program where participants gain money from the investments made by 
99 
 
newcomers. An adversary or contract owner can collect fees, and steal Ether, and later exploit 
the “immutable bugs” vulnerability of contract source code. (5) GovernMental–it is another 
flawed Ponzi scheme, in which participant must send a certain amount of Ether to the contract to 
join. If no one joins the scheme for 12 hours, the last participants get all the Ether in the contract. 
The attack on GovernMetal could happen variously. For instance, by exploiting the “exception 
disorder,” “stack size limit,” and the main attack is called “Mallory attack,” in which the attacker 
starts invoking herself recursively, and, making the stack grow and eventually, stack overflow 
happened. It could also be happened by exploiting the “time constraints” vulnerability in the 
blockchain. (6) Dynamic libraries–This attack could happen by exploiting the “unpredictable 
state” of the blockchain. For example, consider a contract which can dynamically update one of 
its component (library), and the user does not know what the next state of the contract is. This 
allows an attacker to change these components with malicious ones.  The attack scenario for each 
of the above attacks are explained in detail in the paper (Atzei et al., 2016). 
Eclipse attacks on Ethereum network and client. The eclipse attacks on the Ethereum 
is discussed by the (Wüst & Gervais, 2016) by presenting three vulnerabilities in the Ethereum 
blockchain and client. First, by exploiting the block propagation design of Ethereum, an 
adversary can partition the P2P network without monopolizing the connections of the victim. 
Second, the paper presents an exploit to force a node to accept a longer chain with lower total 
difficulty than the main chain, and finally, identify a bug in the Ethereum difficulty calculation. 
Low-source eclipse attacks on neighbor discover process. The paper by Marcus, 
Heilman, and Goldberg (n.d.) presented low-source eclipse attacks on Ethereum nodes that 
exploit the P2P network used for neighbor discovery. The attack in this scenario can be launched 
100 
 
using only two hosts, each with a single IP address. This attack can control all the victim’s 
incoming and outgoing connections, thus isolating from rest of the peers. This research also 
provides countermeasures to harden the eclipse attack on Ethereum, and the countermeasures 
have been consolidated in the Ethereum geth 1.8 client released on February 14, 2018. 
Low-level attacks. Some attacks exploit vulnerabilities at the EVM specification level, 
combined with the security flaws in the Ethereum client (Atzei et al., 2016). For instance, some 
of the IO-heavy operations gas values are set too low, and hence these could be used by an 
adversary to launch a denial of service attack on Ethereum. The Rivlin study (2016) reported the 
denial of service attack on Ethereum due to the underpriced operation called “SUICIDE”. After 
few other incidents due to underpriced operations the issue is fixed for seven IO-heavy 
operations in the EIP (Ethereum Improvement Protocol) 150 (vbuterin, n.d.). 
Countermeasures solutions. The paper Luu, Chu, Olickel, Saxena, and Hobor (2016) 
proposed a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. This research 
found that among 19366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8,833 them vulnerable, 
including the DAO bug which led to a 60 million USD loss in June 2016. The also introduced 
four types of bugs namely. (1) Transaction-ordering dependence which is similar to 
unpredictable state vulnerability, (2) Timestamp dependence (3) Mishandled exceptions,          
(4) Reentrancy vulnerability.  
The paper by Chen, Li, Luo, and Zhang (2017) identified 7 gas costly patterns and group 
them to 2 categories; useless code related patterns and loop related patterns. They found that 
under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore users are 
overcharged. They developed a tool called GASPER, which automatically locating gas costly 
101 
 
patterns by analyzing smart contracts’ bytecodes. Their preliminary results on discovering the 
three representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5%, 90.1%, and 80% 
contracts suffer from these 3 patterns respectively. The three representative patterns are: 
Detection of dead code. Some lines of code in a contract are never executed but they are 
still part of contract and deployed on blockchain. Since the consumption of gas is due to the size 
of bytecode, and hence the dead code wastes money. GASPER detects dead code through three 
steps; logs the addresses, collects the addresses, and finally reports all the blocks that are found 
in the CFG (Chen et al., 2017). GASPER constructs Control Flow Graph (CFG) for scanning 
purposes. 
Detection of opaque predicates. Opaque predicates are statements in the contracts which 
results are known to be either true or false without execution. Since the results of opaque 
predicates are already known, and the results do not affect any other statement or contracts, so it 
should be removed for saving gas. In order to detect opaque predicates, GASPER executes the 
smart contracts symbolically, and records the executed branch either true or false when a 
conditional jump encountered. Then, the conditional jump with one never-executed branch is 
considered as an opaque predicate (Chen et al., 2017). 
Detection of expensive operations in a loop.  The expensive operations in a loop refers to 
execution of statement that may executed multiple times in one invocation. Moving them out of 
loop can save gas. GASPER detects this pattern through two steps. First, it looks for loops in the 
bytecode, and second, it searches the loop bodies for expensive operations. GASPER first 
searches for back edges in the CFG, which shows the existence of loops, and then identifies the 
102 
 
entry bock and exit block for each loop. A block is considered to be in a loop if it is closer to the 
exit block than to the entry block (Chen et al., 2017). 
The paper by Cook et al. (n.d.) also propose a prototype for a tool called DappGuard, 
which is intended to be used for live monitoring and protection for Solidity smart contracts. This 
tool considers all the 12 types of vulnerability discussed in the above table.    
Data Analyzed: Security Threats Classification Taxonomies 
Taxononmy#1. Taxonomy based on Blockchain abstract layers. This taxonomy 
leveraged some of the work introduced by Dinh et al. (2017) and Croman et al. (2016). The Dinh 
et al. (2017) design of a framework for private blockchain systems and considered four common 
layers of abstraction. By comparing the over 200 Bitcoin variants, Ethereum, and other 
permissioned blockchains, and meaningfully compare them, the study identifies four common 
abstraction layers in all of these systems. The consensus layer contains protocols through which 
a block is considered appended to the blockchain. The data layer contains the structure, content, 
and operations on the blockchain data. The execution layer includes details of the runtime 
environment that support blockchain operations. The application layer contains classes of the 
blockchain applications or blockchain platforms. In related work (Croman et al., 2016), 
blockchain is divided into several planes: network, consensus, storage, view, and side plane. This 
study did not consider the execution of smart contracts.  
This study evaluates both studies (Croman et al., 2016; Dinh et al., 2017) and considered 
the five common layers of abstraction and included the network layer besides the four other 
layers, shown in the Figure 5. The network layer manages various protocols that are used to 
establish the communication channel between the nodes in the blockchain network. The common 
103 
 
protocols included in the network layer are peer to peer (P2P) protocol- for establishing 
communication between the nodes connected in the decentralized environment, transmission 
protocol–for passing the block updates between the peers or nodes, and verification protocol 
responsible for verifying the transactions by each of the participant nodes or peers.  
 The taxonomy formed based on the abstract layers mainly considered the network, 
consensus, data model, and execution layers. Since the application layer includes the business 
model of various applications of the blockchain and could be different for each of the platform, 
hence we excluded it from examining. In taking into account, the four abstract layers of the 
blockchain, the taxonomy is formed and classified the security threats based on the nature of the 
vulnerabilities for each threat. The nature of each vulnerability and the corresponding security 
threats and attacks are discussed in detailed in next chapter, and the taxonomy based on the 
abstract layers are presented in Table 3.

Blockchain architecture abstraction layers. Blockchain architecture (Figure 5) consists 
of a network layer, a data layer, a consensus layer, an execution layer, and an application layer. 
Most of the existing blockchain platform includes these five abstract layers. 
 
Figure 13.  Blockchain abstract layers. 
Network layer. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) is a decentralized communication model and is one 
way of distributing data in a network. In the P2P network model, each party has the same 
capabilities, and either party can initiate a communication session. Unlike the client/server 
model, in which the client makes a service request, and the server fulfills the request. The P2P 
network model allows each node to function both as a client and server.  
 In P2P network model as each peer has 100% (or as close to it as possible) of the data, 
and updates are shared around. Data replication, and sharing updates happen many times; once 
per machine, and each addition or change makes more network traffic, and due to which P2P is 
considered less efficient than the client-server model (“A-Gentle-Introduction-To-Bitcoin-
106 
 
WEB.pdf,” n.d.). However, each peer is more independent and can continue operating to some 
extent if it loses connectivity to the majority of other peers. In other words, P2P provides a 
solution to the single point of failure problem, which makes P2P network model more robust, as 
no central server that controls everything, so shutting down the P2P network is difficult. Another 
problem with P2P models is, as there is no central server to manage the updates or modification 
of data, so if each peer is updating at different speeds and have slightly different states, it will be 
difficult to determine the real state of the data. To tackle this problem, even if the peers in the 
P2P network are untrusted like in Bitcoin blockchain, some consensus algorithms like PoW or 
PoS are used to ensure the changes to the blockchain and mitigate the risk of corrupting the 
ledger by bad peers. 
 In blockchain, the P2P network layer is responsible for inter-node communications which 
include discovery and data transfer (usually transactions and block propagation) (Pay, 2017). 
Typically, a sample of this layer is the DEVp2p library used by the Ethereum blockchain (Costa, 
2014/2018). DEVp2p is a wire protocol used by Ethereum to facilitate the P2P communications 
between the nodes in the Ethereum Blockchain network. DEVp2p nodes communicate by 
sending messages using RLPx (Recursive Length Prefix), an encrypted and authenticated 
transport protocol. RLPx is a cryptographic P2P network and protocol suite which provides a 
general-purpose transport and interface for applications to communicate through a P2P network.  
  Peers in the network are free to advertise and accept connections on any TCP port they 
wish, however, a default port on which connection may be listened and made is 30303 (Costa, 
2014/2018). Though TCP provides a connection-oriented channel, DEVp2p nodes communicate 
regarding packets and RLPx facilities to send and receive packets. DEVp2p nodes find peers in 
107 
 
the network through the RLPx discovery protocol DHT. Peer connections can also be initiated by 
providing the endpoint of a peer to a client-specific RPC API. Further details about RLPx is 
presented here (Mandeleil, 2015/2018). 
 Bitcoin is structured as a peer-to-peer network based on unencrypted persistent TCP 
connections as its foundational communication structure. The collection of nodes running the 
bitcoin P2P protocol is called bitcoin network. Each node in the bitcoin network maintain a list 
of IP address of potentials peers, and the list is bootstrapped via a DNS server, and additional 
addresses are exchanged between peers. Each node in the network maintain a minimum of eight 
unencrypted TCP connections in the overlay, and each node establish new connections if the 
current number of connections is lower than eight (Conti et al., 2017). The number of connection 
can be exceeded from 8 till 125 if incoming connections are accepted by a Bitcoin peer. By 
default, each peer listens on port 8333 for inbound connections, and to establish a new 
connection, peers perform an application layer handshake, using the version and verack 
messages. During the handshake, the version and verack messages are exchange, to ensure 
compatibility between peers. 1) The “version” message is created by a node which want to create 
an outgoing connection, and it will immediately advertise its version. The remote node will 
respond with its version, and no further communication is possible until both the peers have 
exchanged their version (“Protocol documentation–Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). 2) The “verack” 
message is sent in reply to version (“Protocol documentation–Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). This message 
consists of only a message header with the command string “verack”. The “verack” packet shall 
be sent if the version packet was accepted. The verack message. The exchange of version and 
verack messages are called “Version Handshake” between the peers in the Bitcoin network. For 
108 
 
example, when a local peer (L) wants to connect to a remote peer (R), the remote peer will not 
send any data until it receives a version message back from the local peer. The messages include 
a timestamp for time synchronization, IP addresses, and the protocol version. Following is  the 
protocol handshaking process between bitcoin’s nodes in the network (“Protocol documentation–
Bitcoin Wiki,” n.d.). 
• L -> R: Send version message with the local peer’s version. 
• R -> L: Send version message back. 
• R -> L: if both peers’ version is compatible, R send verack message. 
• R: Sets version to the minimum of the 2 versions. 
• L->R: Send verack message after receiving version message from R. 
• L: Sets version to the minimum of the 2 versions. 
 Each node randomly selects its peers, and it decides a new set of peers after a fixed 
amount of time. This is done to minimize the possibility and effects of netsplit attack, in which 
an attacker creates an inconsistent view of the network at the attacked node. To detect when 
peers have left the network, Bitcoin uses a soft-state approach. If 30 minutes have been passed 
since messages were last exchanged between neighbors, peers will transmit a “hello” message to 
keep the connection alive. 
 Miners continually listen to new block announcements which are sent via INV messages, 
containing the hash of the mined block. If miners discover that it does not hold a newly 
announced block, it transmits a GETDATA message to one of its neighbors, and the neighbor 
responds by sending the requested information in a BLOCK message. In case the requested 
block does not arrive within 20 minutes, the miner triggers the disconnection of that particular 
109 
 
neighbor and requests the same information from another neighbor. The propagation of 
transactions occurs in a sequence given as INV, GETDATA, and TX messages, in which nodes 
announces, request, and share transactions that have not yet been included in the blockchain 
(Conti et al., 2017). 
Data model layer. The data layer contains the structure, content, and the operation of the 
blockchain data. According to Mastering Bitcoin, transactions are data structures that encode the 
transfer of value between participants in the bitcoin network (Antonopoulos, 2015). A block 
contains a list of transactions, and a list of smart contracts executed as well as their latest states. 
In the data layer, each block is identified by the cryptographic hash of its contents and linked to 
the previous block hash, and all blocks together create the chain of blocks or digital ledger. 
Transactions hashes in a block are group together in a Merkel tree. Each transaction is a public 
entry in the bitcoin blockchain. Transactions are the essential part of the blockchain network. 
Every components and service in the blockchain network is designed to ensure that transactions 
can be created, propagated on the network, validated, and finally added to the blockchain. 
Typically, data models have a block, a block header, and transactions. In Bitcoin, transactions 
are system states representing digital coins in the network. Bitcoin introduces the Input-Output 
transactions data model that is also used by other protocols such as MultiChain and Chain core. 
Ethereum, on the other hand, uses the state replication model, where each new block's state is the 
outcome of the transactions that were included in the block. For instance, in Bitcoin transferring 
money between sender and receiver involves searching for transaction belonging to the sender, 
then marking some of them as spent, whereas it is easily done in Ethereum by updating two 
accounts in one transaction. An account in the Ethereum has a balance as its state and is updated 
110 
 
upon receiving a transaction. A special type of account, called “smart contract,” contains 
executable code and private states, and when receiving a transaction, in addition to updating its 
balance, the contracts' code is invoked and performed the specified arguments in the transaction. 
The code can read the states of other non-contract accounts, and it can send new transactions 
during execution (Dinh et al., 2017). Ethereum has chosen not to use the Input-Output 
transaction model because it does not allow multi-stage contracts or scripts that cloud keep an 
internal state (Dinh et al., 2017). 
Consensus layer. The role of consensus layer is to get all nodes in the blockchain system 
to agree on the blockchain contents. That is, if a node appends a block to the blockchain, the 
other nodes in the network must approve and also append the same copy of the block to their 
blockchain. The consensus layer contains protocols through which a block is considered verified 
and appended to the blockchain. Blockchain systems, use a spectrum of Byzantine fault-tolerant 
protocols. The consensus layer works jointly with data model layer, in creating, verifying and 
appending a block the blockchain. The data model layer concerns about the structure of the block 
and consensus layer concerns about which consensus mechanism to be used for creating the 
adding the block to the chain. 
The Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm is the broadly used consensus mechanism used 
in the existing blockchain systems, particularly in the cryptocurrencies area. PoW was introduced 
by Bitcoin and assumes that each node in the Bitcoin system votes with his “computing power” 
by solving proof of work instances and creating the appropriate blocks. Bitcoin uses a hash-
based PoW which requires finding a nonce value, such that when hashed with additional block 
parameters (e.g., a Merkle hash, the previous block hash), the value of the hash has to be smaller 
111 
 
than the current target value. When such a nonce is found, the miner creates the block and 
forward it to the network layer to its peers. Other peers in the network which has P2P 
connections, can verify the PoW by computing the hash of the block and checking whether it 
satisfies the condition to be smaller than the current target value (Gervais et al., 2016). 
Proof-of-Work selects at each round a random node which can append a block, where the 
node’s total computing power determines the probability of being selected. This simple scheme 
works against the Sybil attack; an attack in an open, decentralized environment in which 
adversary requires multiple identities (Bissias et al., 2014). The major problem with PoW 
mechanism is that as nodes spend their CPU cycle solving puzzles and it consumes a lot of 
energy and computing power. In addition to this problem, sometimes two nodes may be selected 
to append the same block to the chain, and both blocks can be accepted, and this cause fork in 
the blockchain. To tackle the fork problem, additional rules are used by most of the PoW-based 
blockchain systems, for instance, only blocks on the longest chain are considered and accepted. 
Ethereum, like Bitcoin uses PoW variant called GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) 
which accepts blocks in heavy branches (Buterin, 2014). To solve the energy and resources 
usages problem, an alternative to PoW called Proof-of-Stake (PoW) is used. Other famous 
consensus algorithms used in existing blockchains are Proof-of-Authority (PoA (“Proof-of-
authority,” 2018), Proof-of-Burn (PoB) (“Why Proof-of-Burn | Counterparty,” n.d.), Ripple 
(Schwartz, Youngs, & Britto, n.d.), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) (Castro & 
Liskov, n.d.), Stellar (RES, n.d.) and others. 
 Execution Layer. The execution layer contains details of the runtime environment that 
support blockchain operations (Dinh et al., 2017). Each blockchain system uses its own 
112 
 
programming and scripting languages which entail runtimes environment including compiler, 
decoder, virtual machine and others. Most of these runtime environment operations are 
maintained at the execution layer of the blockchain systems. A contract (or chaincode) is 
executed in a runtime environment, and there are two requirements of execution. (1) Execution 
must be fast because there are multiple contracts and transactions in one block and they must all 
be verified by the node. (2) Execution must be deterministic; ideally the same at all the nodes. 
Deterministic execution prevents unnecessary inconsistency in transaction input and output states 
which leads to blocks being aborted and aborting a block usually wastes computer resources. 
 Smart contracts are programs that serve to negotiate, facilitate or enforce the performance 
and state of an agreement (contract). The term of the contract is coded as a program in the 
programming language provided by the underlying blockchain platform. These smart contracts 
can complement or substitute legal contracts. Ethereum develops its own machine language 
(bytecode) and a virtual machine called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for executing the 
code. EVM is a runtime environment, which provides all the needed support and services for 
executing the smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain system. EVM is optimized for Ethereum 
specific operations. For instance, executing a code (running a transaction or contract) in 
Ethereum costs a certain amount of gas, and the total cost must be properly tracked and charged 
to the transaction’s sender. Gas is the internal pricing for running a transaction or contract in 
Ethereum blockchain system. The gas system is not very different from the use of KW (Kilo 
Watt) for measuring electricity. One difference from actual energy market is that the originator 
of the transaction sets the price of gas, to which the miner may accept or ignore. That is, miners 
are free to ignore transactions whose gas prices limit is too low, on the other hand, with Bitcoin 
113 
 
miners’ priorities transaction with the highest mining fees. The idea behind using gas is to limit 
infinite loops. For instance, 10Szabo (which is about 1/100,000 of an Ether), or 0.00001 Ether 
(Ethereum currency) or 1 gas can execute a line of code or some commands in the contract. So, if 
there is not enough Ether in the account to perform the transaction or execute the smart contract, 
then it is considered invalid. The idea is to stop denial of service attacks from infinite loops and 
to make an attacker pay for the resources they use, from bandwidth to CPU calculations through 
to storage [56]. 
 Party (Dixon, n.d.) another Ethereum based blockchain system also uses EVM for 
executing the code. However, Hyperledger (“Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf,” 
n.d.) does not consider these semantic in its design, so it merely supports running of compiled 
machine codes inside Docker image. 
Application layer. The application layer includes the use-cases of the blockchain 
application. Most of these applications of blockchain are due to key features of blockchain 
mainly two features. First, data in the blockchain is immutable and transparent to the 
participants, meaning that once a record is appended, it can never be changed and this feature 
achieved data integrity. Second, it is resilient to dishonest and malicious participants. The most 
extensive application of blockchain is still cryptocurrencies. According to Coinmarketcap site, 
currently, more than 1500 different cryptocurrencies projects exist in the market. Besides 
cryptocurrencies, there are other use-cases of the blockchain in the market such as asset 
management, supply change, identity management, security settlements, IoT, Cloud security, 
financial services, Healthcare and many more.

Taxonomy #2. Taxonomy based on Blockchain primary processes. This taxonomy is 
inspired from the work (Ellervee, 2017), which designed a comprehensive reference model for 
blockchain-based distributed ledger technology. The reference model was designed with 
intension to better understand the standardization and uniform processes involved in the 
blockchain. In order to designed a reference model the study (Ellervee, 2017) separated the 
blockchain based platforms into four groups: permissionless (public) blockchain, permissioned 
(private) blockchain, blockchains with smart contracts, and blockchain with transaction only as 
shown in the Table 4. 
Table 4 
Classification of Blockchain Platforms 
 Permissionless Permissioned  
Transaction only Bitcoin MultiChain Blockchain 1.0 
With Smart Contract Ethereum Chain Core Blockchain 2.0 
 
The four groups of blockchain platforms are characterized as follows: 
• Permissionless. The permissionless blockchains are fully public blockchains, where 
anyone can read, write data (Ellervee, 2017). 
• Permissioned. In permissioned blockchain, rules are pre-defined for different 
permissions on different users on the network. There can be different permissions for 
reading data, creating transactions, validating blocks, creating new blocks and others 
(Ellervee, 2017). 
• Blockchain with transaction only. These blockchain platforms are built for 
transaction capabilities such as Bitcoin and MultiChain. They support transferring 
115 
 
value from one account to another (Ellervee, 2017). These types of blockchain are 
also named as Blockchain 1.0. 
• Blockchain with Smart Contracts. These blockchain enable “smart contract” like 
capabilities and allow building business logic process mechanism into the chain 
(Ellervee, 2017). With the invent of smart contract concept, these blockchain 
platforms are considered as Blockchain 2.0. 
The reference model summarized the four platforms provide similar four general process: 
Network discovery, Transaction creation, and Mining (Block generation and submission), and 
block validation process. 
Process are realization of services that the actors (users) of the technology use. The 
typical services in the blockchain are creating transaction, mining or creating blocks, and 
validating blocks. The table 5 provides overview of the processes from different platforms. 
Table 5 
Blockchain Processes in Blockchain Platform 
Platform Processes  
Bitcoin Network discovery process, Transaction creation process, Mining process, Block 
verification process 
MultiChain Handshake process, Transaction creation process, Mining process 
Ethereum  Network discovery process, Transaction creation process, Mining process, Block 
validation process 
Chain Core Network discovery process, Transaction process, Chain consensus process 
 
• Network discovery process. Each platform has a network discovery process, which 
includes four main steps (Ellervee, 2017): 
116 
 
- Peer discovery: finding peers to connect to, either user already knows the IPs or 
acquires them 
- Handshake: version check, establishing connection, providing ownership of 
private key 
- Network discovery: finding neighboring peers and letting the network know that a 
new node has connected. 
- Synchronization: downloading the latest block data from the network. 
• Transaction creation process. In bitcoin to create a transaction user, need to enter 
value and the receivers address, and then the transaction is signed by the user and 
broadcasted to the network (to neighboring nodes). The neighboring nodes check the 
transaction for validity and if valid, then they will propagate it forward to other peers.  
In Ethereum the same process as Bitcoin is followed up, i.e., supports the regular 
value transactions. The input parameters for the transaction are similar to Bitcoin (i.e., 
amount and the address of the receiver). Besides input parameters Ethereum also 
support creating contracts and calling contract functions, which is an additional 
metadata added to a transaction (Ellervee, 2017). 
• Mining process or Block generation process.  Mining is based on the proof-of-work 
consensus mechanism. In mining process or block generation process a miner add 
collected unverified transaction and metadata, and calculate the computationally 
exhaustive proof-of-work for the block and build a new block. If he is the first one to 
solve the task and mine the block, he can submit the block to the network and receive 
the reward for the work ( Ellervee, 2017; Nakamoto, n.d). In Ethereum, the mining 
117 
 
process also requires a state transaction process, since it keeps a state of the 
blockchain. In the state transaction process, transactions are validated and in case of 
contracts, code execution is also performed. Finally, when all the state transaction 
function, miner in Ethereum will provide the proof-of-work to the blockchain 
(Buterin, 2014; Ellervee, 2017). In MultiChain the proof-of-work is optional and 
mining is permissioned (Greenspan, n.d.).  
• Block validation process. In public blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum the 
validation process is performed by every node once the miner broadcast a new block ( 
Buterin, 2014; Nakamoto, n.d.). Since in the public blockchains the miners are 
anonymous, there has to be a guarantee that the miner has truly produced a valid 
block. In Bitcoin, this is called a consensus if all the nodes validate the new blocks 
against the same rules. In Ethereum, the validation is similar to Bitcoin, but it also 
includes the state transaction process, which has to be performed by each before 
accepting the block (Ellervee, 2017).  
This taxonomy classified the security threats based on the primary affected blockchain 
process and shown in Table 6:

Taxonomy #3. Taxonomy based on Blockchain affected business users. This 
taxonomy is based on the affected target of security threats. It mainly focuses on the affected 
users by each of the security threats. In design of this taxonomy the taxonomy leveraged the 
(Ellervee, 2017) work with some modification. Blockchain a decentralized network of  
individual nodes, and each node has different purposes and different roles. The study (Ellervee, 
2017) shows an overview of the actors who are present in the analyzed blockchain platforms in 
Table 7. 
Table 7 
Overview of Actors in Blockchain Platforms 
Platform Actors  
Bitcoin Client (sender or receiver of Bitcoins), Miners 
MultiChain Client, Miners 
Ethereum  Externally Owned Account, Contract Account, Miner 
Chain Core Client (Issuer/Spender of assets), Blockchain operator (Generator/Signer) 
 
Generally, each of the platform involves a Client and Miner. The client interacts with the 
blockchain and exchanges or adds value by creating and broadcasting transactions. In Ethereum, 
an Externally Owned Account (EOA) can be understood as physical actor, and Contract Account 
(CA) can be understood as a system user which acts upon a request by an EOA, or by another 
CA. Miners deal with validating transactions and building new blocks. 
With keeping in mind the (Ellervee, 2017) study, this study defined and considered the 
actors as follows: 
• User. The human act who interacts with the blockchain by creating transaction can be 
called a “User”.  
120 
 
• Miner. Human or system actor responsible for verification and validation of 
transactions, building new blocks, signing new blocks and publishing new blocks to 
the blockchain. This actor supports trust between the parties involved.  
• Mining Pool. When miners share their computer power to solve together the proof-
of-work, miners create a pool. Since the difficulty of some blockchain such as Bitcoin 
and Ethereum is very high, and it is difficult for a solo miner to solve the problem, so 
they share their computer resources and collectively solve the problem. The rewards 
for the solving difficulty or mining block is then shared among all the participant 
miners in the pool. 
• Merchant. Any business which accept digital currency as payment systems.  
• Blockchain Network. It includes the nodes, which created the decentralized network 
of the blockchain and maintain the data of the ledger. 
• Exchange.  The cryptocurrency or digital currency exchanges are the business that 
provides services to customers to trade digital currencies for other assets, such as 
conventional fiat money, or different digital currencies. 
The affected business users or actors based on each security threats or attacks are shown in

 This chapter concludes this study. It also suggests the lessons learned, future research 
directions and conclusion of the work. 
Results 
One of the major contribution of blockchain is the degree of transparency and 
decentralization that it provides along with the adequate level of security and privacy, which 
previously considered impossible. However, Blockchain is still some evolving technologies and 
besides many interesting security and privacy features, there are still huge security and privacy 
concerns available in the Blockchain ecosystem. Based on the comprehensive survey on the 
security aspect of the Blockchain, there are security threats existing due to the available 
vulnerabilities in the Blockchain. Besides, the security threats that lead to double-spending 
attacks, there are security threats to Blockchain network, blockchain miner or mining pools, 
private key security threats and smart contracts. The study also analyzed based on the nature of 
each vulnerabilities discussed in this study, and classified the security threats to different fields 
of the blockchain. 
Future Research Directions  
Consensus mechanism. As most of the popular public Blockchain such as Bitcoin, 
Ethereum and others used proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus algorithm to protect the user’s 
actions. Proof-of-work also provide a practical solution for the Byzantine Generals problem and 
achieve distributed consensus. However, PoW based blockchain expose itself to a number of 
security threats. The main threat is double-spending which is almost always possible in Bitcoin. 
Another major disadvantage of PoW based blockchain is the waste of computer resources. To 
124 
 
solve this problem some blockchain such as Ethereum plan to use the hybrid consensus 
mechanism of PoW and PoS. But as Bitcoin is still dominate blockchain and PoW always 
requires huge wastage of resources both electricity and computer resources. Thus, providing 
more robust, secure and easily scalability consensus algorithms are a possible research direction. 
• One the major contribution of blockchain like Bitcoin is the degree of transparency 
and decentralization, which was previously considered impossible.  
Mining pool protocols. The original concept of mining, which could be based on Proof 
of Work, Proof of Stack, Proof of Burns or some other scheme, not only secures the blockchain 
but it also provides distributed consensus. Without mining schemes, the fake identities would be 
able to easily disturb the consensus process and ruined the normal functions of systems by a 
Sybil attack. However, the rapidly increasing mining pools threatens the decentralized of some 
of the blockchain like Bitcoin.  
Game theory and stability. Since most the blockchain functions depends on the miner 
and miners can behave selfishly by holding on to their blocks and releasing it whenever they 
want. This kind of selfish behavior may pose a game theoretic problem between the selfish 
miners and the honest miners in the network. The selfish miners or attacker may try to contribute 
to an increase of their chain length compared to honest chain miners in the network, and 
eventually launch different types of attacks including double-spending. Thus, achieving 
equilibrium to bring stability in the network is a possible research direction. 
Cryptographic and keying techniques. The current Simplified Payment Verification 
(SPV) protocol which is a lightweight protocol used for the verification of the transactions send 
from the user, is often vulnerable to attacks like Sybil or double-spending. A more robust 
125 
 
verification protocol is required. For the key manipulations and calculations, a distributed 
approach is always preferred more than the centralized one. Thus, in this direction, innovative 
means of key computation and storage of the Blockchain is a possible research direction. Also, 
was discussed Bitcoin highly rely on ECDSA algorithm and it has poor randomness property and 
hash functions like SHA-256, creates another research direction. 
Improving blockchain protocol. Despite blockchain potential, it still faces significant 
concerns in term of privacy and scalability. The immutable nature of the blockchain makes it 
impractical for many other applications. Recently, the research called “Redactable Blockchain” 
(Ateniese, Magri, Venturi, & Andrade, 2016) present modification in blockchain techniques that 
allows operations such as re-writing one or more blocks, compressing any number of blocks into 
a smaller one. 
Fastness. Bitcoin PoW is designed to validate a new block on average within 10 minutes, 
and it is recommended to wait for six confirmations before accepting a transaction, which makes 
it impractical for many real-word application such as a point of sale payments. Fasting mining 
with the same robustness is a future requirement.  
Blockchain data. The blockchain will produce a lot of data, including block information, 
transaction data, contract bytecode, etc. However, not all of the data in the blockchain is valid. 
For instance, a smart contract can delete its code by SUICIDE or SELFDESTRUCT, but the 
address of the contract will not be erased. Moreover, there are a lot of smart contracts containing 
no code or totally the same code (redundant), or some smart contracts are never being executed 
after its deployment. Thus, an efficient data cleanup and detection mechanism is desired to 
improve the execution efficiency of the blockchain systems. 
126 
 
No practical defense for attacks. Throughout our comprehensive and systematic survey, 
we provided the reported defense mechanism or countermeasures of each of the attack discussed 
in the study. However, some of the attack such as Fork after Withholding (FAW) (Kwon et al., 
2017) attack, and Punitive and Feather forking attacks (Narayanan, 2017) remains open 
challenges. 
Conclusion  
 This study focuses on the security issues of the blockchain technology. By studying the 
different fields of the blockchain such as consensus mechanisms, blockchain network, mining 
process, data storage and key management, and smart contracts functionality, the study reviewed 
all the existing vulnerabilities in this area. Additionally, based on the understanding from the 
survey the study classified the security threats in two various domains.

ABSTRACT. The popularity of blockchain technology continues to grow 
rapidly in both industrial and academic fields. Most studies of blockchain 
focus on the improvements of security, usability, or efficiency of 
blockchain protocols, or the applications of blockchain in finance, 
Internet of Things, or public services. However, few of them could reveal 
the concerns of front-line developers and the situations of blockchain in 
practice. In this article, we investigate how developers use and discuss 
blockchain with a case study of Stack Overflow posts. We find 
blockchain is a relatively new topic in Stack Overflow but it is rising to 
popularity. We detect 13 types of questions that developers post in Stack 
Overflow and identify 45 blockchain relevant entities (e.g., frameworks, 
libraries, or tools) for building blockchain applications. These findings 
may help blockchain project communities to know where to improve and 
help novices to know where to start. 
 
Introduction 
The public interest of blockchain has been increasing since it was proposed
1
.  Blockchain 
is essentially a public ledger of all committed transactions or digital information shared 
by all participants. One of the most popular examples of blockchain applications is 
Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency by which transactions could happen without any third party2. 
Nevertheless, the ability of blockchain is far beyond Bitcoin. It enables the refinement of 
existing techniques and the appearance of new applications3. 
From the technical point of view, blockchain is a technique involving several fields of 
computer science, e.g., networking, cryptography, and information security. Many studies 
of blockchain have been conducted in these fields, for example, protocols design, self-
certification, and vulnerability protection
1
. However, few of them focus on problems 
from front-line developers’ perspective. What is the state of blockchain technology in 
software development communities? Is it also a hot topic? What kinds of problems do 
developers encounter about blockchain? What programming frameworks, tools, libraries, 
or techniques can be used in blockchain relevant tasks? These questions are still open to 
us. By answering the questions, novice developers could know what resources to exploit 
to support their blockchain relevant programming tasks and blockchain project 
communities could better acknowledge how to make blockchain technology more 
practical to front-line developers. 
In this article, we conduct a case study by Stack Overflow, a popular technical 
Question and Answer (Q & A) website attracting millions of developers. We extracted all 
the blockchain relevant question posts and investigate how blockchain is discussed by 
developers there.

Overview of the Study 
In this study, we attempt to draw a profile of blockchain in the eyes of developers with 
Stack Overflow as a point of penetration. In brief, the motivation of this study contains 
three parts. First, we want to evaluate the popularity of blockchain, or to check whether 
blockchain is hot. To this end, we use the frequency of blockchain relevant questions in 
Stack Overflow as an index. Second, we want to acknowledge what are the frequently 
encountered problems about blockchain. Hence, we analyze the blockchain relevant 
questions in Stack Overflow to find the common terms. Third, we also want to know 
what frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques can be used by developers in blockchain 
relevant tasks. So we try to identify these entities from tags of Stack Overflow posts. In 
summary, the study is to answer the following three questions: 
Q1: How frequently blockchain relevant questions are posted in Stack Overflow? 
Q2: What are the common problems when blockchain is involving? 
Q3: What blockchain specialized entities (programming relevant platforms, frameworks, 
tools, libraries, techniques, etc) do there exist? 
With these questions, the study is conducted according to the following steps. At first, 
we extract the question posts in which the string “blockchain” is mentioned. An 
evolvement analysis of these posts is conducted. Next, we manually categorize these 
extracted question posts into different types in perspective of developers’ demands. The 
description of each type is summarized further. Then, blockchain relevant tags of the 
extracted question posts are selected. After that, these tags are identified as commonly 
used frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques related to blockchain. Figure 1 outlines 
the process of this study.

specialized in Blockchain technology such as platforms, frameworks, or techniques.

which contains all the posts of Stack Overflow. The file contains 15,483,377 question 
posts which were posted from July 2008 to March 2018. We parse the file to obtain post 
metadata, for example, the post title, the post body, the tags, and the score. 
With these data, we extract the question posts in which “blockchain” is mentioned. 
Specifically, we first remove all the code snippets and hyperlink text (enclosed in <a 
href=“...”> HTML tags) from the bodies of all the question posts. Then, we go through 
the titles, bodies, and tags of all the question posts. A question post is extracted as 
blockchain relevant if the string “blockchain” or “block[^a-z]chain” appears in at least 
one of these three fields, where “[^a-z]” represents a character but not a letter. Using 
these heuristics, 1,785 question posts are identified as blockchain relevant. 
 
Evolvement of the Blockchain Relevant Posts 
Among all 15,483,377 question posts in Stack Overflow, only 1,785 of them are 
blockchain relevant. We suppose that blockchain is an emerging concept and going to 
rise. To prove this idea, we investigate the evolvement of the blockchain relevant 
question posts. Figure 2 presents the number of blockchain relevant question posts per 
month. The Stack Overflow website was operative as early as July 2008, but blockchain 
relevant question posts were not mentioned for a long time at the beginning. The first 
blockchain relevant question was posted in January 2012. The time span before that date 
is omitted in the figure. The data of March 2018 is eliminated as it is not complete. 
We have two observations from the evolvement. On the one hand, blockchain is an 
ongoing topic in Stack Overflow programming practice. The monthly number of 
blockchain relevant question posts shows a clearly increasing trend especially since 
January 2016. Moreover, the increasing speed tends to increase, too. That means more 
and more programming issues about blockchain are raised and discussed. Although the 
current number of blockchain relevant question posts is relatively small, we believe that it 
could rise fast in the future. On the other hand, the application of blockchain is lagging 
behind the theory of blockchain. The idea of blockchain was conceptualized in 2008
4
. 
But only still 2012, it emerged in Stack Overflow, where blockchain is viewed in the 
application perspective. There is a time delay between theory and application. However, 
blockchain has attracted the attentions from programming communities and blockchain 
relevant questions are continuously growing. 
A1. Currently, blockchain relevant questions only occupy a small part of all Stack 
Overflow posts, but the monthly number is increasing over time (Figure 2).

Question Types Summarization 
 
Posts Categorization 
To give a summary of what tasks developers face with, we categorize the blockchain 
relevant question posts into different types. As the extracted question post set is not very 
large, and for the sake of accuracy, we do this work manually. 
To make the results more understandable, we do not focus on technical details but the 
demands of askers. A question post is labeled with a unique type which reflects the main 
purpose of the asker. For example, in a post, the asker writes “I want to query the 
blockchain to find the moment when an unconfirmed transaction comes through for a 
particular Bitcoin address” (#25882458). That is, the asker wants to access the 
blockchain to obtain some information of transactions. Then we may label the post as 
“access”. In another example, “what’s the difference between distributed hashtable 
technology and the Bitcoin blockchain?” (#26415908), the asker just wants to 
discriminate the two concepts but does not leak the practical requirements. Then the post 
could be labeled as “discussion”. 
With this consideration, we categorize the posts following the iterative process of 
mobile app reviews tagging5. Specifically, for each of the blockchain relevant question 
post, we label it with an existing type. If a question post does not match any existing 
types, then we add a new type to the existing types and relabel the blockchain relevant 
question post from the beginning. Finally 13 types of blockchain relevant question posts 
are detected. 
 
Types of the Blockchain Relevant Question Posts 
For the 13 types of blockchain relevant question posts, we summarize their substances 
and give a brief description and an example question post for each type. The details are 
shown in Figure 3. 
As a question post is labeled with a unique type, the blockchain relevant question posts 
are grouped into 13 clusters. If a large number of question posts belong to the same type, 
then this type of issues are frequently encountered and should be paid more attention to. 
The number of question posts a type involves (cluster size) reveals the popularity of this 
type. To find the popular types, we rank the 13 types according to the numbers of 
question posts and the results are displayed in Figure 4 (a). 
The top three types are Configuration, Deployment, and Discussion, which account for 
more than 40 percent of all the posts. Questions of Configuration are about how to 
configure the environment to work well. Many askers reported to get errors during the 
configuring process, such as post#38572046: Error Running custom blockchain 
(hyperledger) application with security enabled. Similarly, Deployment is about how to 
set up or install the blockchain system, such as post#47194702: How can i integrate 
etherium or waves platform wallet on my site? Among all the askers of these two types of 
questions, a number of them are in the learning phase and do not have certain tasks. 
Askers of 113 question posts declared that they tried to follow the steps provided in the 
tutorials. Questions of Discussion are related to more general topics. The askers may 
want to talk about the ideas (e.g., are there already other practical uses for blockchain? 
#23846848), understand the mechanisms (e.g., Where are chaincodes executed? 
#36910077), resolve their puzzles (e.g., bitcoins, how can someone receive much less 
than have spent? #37772139), or verify their thoughts (e.g., Is blockchain a decentralised 
5 
 
database? #38558703). These facts imply that the application of blockchain is still in the 
initial phase. Many developers are confused with the principles of blockchain and many 
developers have set out to work with blockchain. 
 
Figure 3. The 13 types of blockchain relevant question posts. 
Then we evaluate the 13 types in another perspective. A question post can be evaluated 
with different metrics. For example, score measures the quality of the post, viewcount 
measures the number of visitors, and favoritecount measures how many developers mark 
it as favorite. A post may get high values of these metrics under the following scenarios: 
Access 
Example post: How to retrieve a value from a Blockchain using PHP? (#21331341) 
Design decentralized applications by leveraging blockchain technology Application 
Example post: How can blockchains be used in audit trails? (#45593747) 
Authenticate the participants by verifying the certifications or signatures Authentication 
Example post: Using the Blockchain.info API to verify bitcoin signatures in C# (#34364767) 
Configure blockchain systems to make them work correctly Configuration 
Example post: Error Running custom blockchain (hyperledger) application with security enabled (#38572046) 
Connect to blockchain systems or peer networks Connection 
Example post: How to correctly respond to remote server? (#21520358)

Example post: How to create contracts on Ethereum block-chain in python? (#38975431) 
Achieve encryption or decryption of payloads, or calculate hash values Cryptography 
Example post: How to decrypt the transaction payload when confidentiality is turned on? (#38143344)

Example post: How can I integrate etherium or waves platform wallet on my site? (#47194702) 
Post the opinions, discuss the puzzle about blockchain technology Discussion 
Example post: What's the difference between distributed hashtable technology and the bitcoin blockchain? (#26415908)

the question is just what many other developers want to ask; the topic of the question is 
what many other developers concern; the question is related to the jobs what many other 
developers are doing. In brief, many other developers are interested in the question. To 
find the types developers interested in, we rank the 13 types according to the average 
score, viewcount, and favoritecount of posts they involve. The results are shown in 
Figure 4 (b) – (d). 
We note that the three metrics of question posts belonging to Contract and Protocol 
are all in top ranks. Questions of Contract are about how to develop or implement the 
smart contract, that is, to contribute, verify or implement the negotiation or performance 
of the contract6. In brief, they are about the business logics of blockchain, e.g., 
post#42768684: How to Destroy Tokens/Coins in a Smart Contract? Questions of 
Protocol are about how to deal with protocols to make blockchain work correctly. That is, 
they are about the underlying logics of blockchain, e.g., post#38215761: How exactly to 
make consensus when Chaincode has coding block of authority or event? In general, the 
types that developers are interested in are all related to the operating mechanisms of 
blockchain. 
There are some implications of the findings. The official organizations of existing 
blockchain platforms, frameworks, or libraries may provide more manuals, tutorials, or 
books to facilitate the novice developers to handle these techniques. The practitioners of 
blockchain may write more informal reading materials to make the masses understand the 
fundamental principles of blockchain more easily. Moreover, the blockchain 
communities may set up specialized forums or websites so that the blockchain enthusiasts 
could discuss or exchange their ideas more conveniently. 
A2. Questions about blockchain can be roughly categorized into 13 types (Figure 
3). Among them, questions about configuration, deployment, discussion, and 
mechanisms (contract or protocol) of blockchain are notable.

Blockchain Relevant Entities Detection 
 
Tags Selection 
In Stack Overflow, a question post contains up to five tags. The tags can usually reveal 
the main technologies the question post involves
7
, and they can usually be identified as 
named entities, e.g., operating systems, APIs, and platforms8. Therefore, we attempt to 
find commonly used frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques which are relevant to 
blockchain from the tags of the blockchain relevant question posts. 
To select blockchain relevant tags, we leverage association rule mining. Generally, if a 
tag frequently appears and only appears in the blockchain relevant question posts, then 
this tag is highly possible to be specialized in blockchain. There are usually two measures 
of each tag: support indicates the frequency the tag appears in the blockchain relevant 
question posts; confidence represents the proportion of the appearances of the tag in the 
blockchain relevant question posts to the total appearances of this tag. 
The common process of association rule mining is to set thresholds for the two 
measures respectively and select the tags whose measures are above the thresholds. 
However, blockchain is a relatively new topic in Stack Overflow and blockchain relevant 
tags may appear very few times, for instance, only one time. Therefore, we set the 
threshold of support to be zero, i.e., all the tags which appear in the blockchain relevant 
question posts are considered, so that more potential blockchain relevant tags can be 
selected. 
For confidence, we sort the values of this measure of all the tags in a descending order 
and draw a curve of the sorted values with their ranks. Then we find the knee of the 
curve
9
. That is, in the curve, the value decreases steeply before the knee and get smooth 
after the knee. The value at the knee is chosen as the threshold of confidence. In this way, 
49 tags are selected as their measures exceed the corresponding thresholds. 
 
Entities Identification 
For each of the blockchain relevant tag, we check the tag’s descriptions in Stack 
Overflow to determine what the entity the tag represents. For example, in Stack Overflow, 
the tag “web3js” is described as “The web3.js library is a collection of modules which 
contain specific functionality for the ethereum ecosystem allowing to ...” It implies that 
the tag “web3js” represents web3.js, which is a JavaScript library used for Ethereum. 
Nevertheless, descriptions of some tags can not be found in Stack Overflow. Under 
this condition, we search the tag on the Internet and check which descriptions are related 
to blockchain. Fortunately, there are no ambiguities. That means, a unique entity can be 
deduced from the information of the tag which is related to blockchain. 
When the entities of all the blockchain relevant tags are identified, the blockchain 
relevant frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques are clear to us. 
 
Blockchain Relevant Entities 
The identified entities of the 49 selected tags are analysed and summaried. Sometimes 
two tags represent the same entity, i.e., the two tags duplicate each other. Then we merge 
them into one. There are 45 unique entities in total. Figure 5 draws the word cloud 
(https://wordart.com/create) of the 45 entities. The size of an entity name indicates the 
number of blockchain relevant question posts containing this entity as a tag. There is 
undeniably that the biggest one is Blockchain. Moreover, we give each entity a summary

to show its connotations. If the readers are interested in any of these entities, then more 
information could be got by retrieving on the Internet with their full names as keywords. 
These entities cover a wide range of categories. A large part of them belong to 
Platform/Framework which helps users to build their blockchain systems in different 
aspects. For example, Ethereum allows users to build and run decentralized applications 
operated through blockchain techniques; Corda allows businesses to transact directly in 
strict privacy; and BigchainDB allows developers and enterprise to deploy blockchain 
applications with a blockchain database. Entities in Tool are softwares or systems for 
certain uses, e.g., Parity, Hyperledger Explorer, and MetaMask are for interaction with 
blockchains. Library is a set of APIs for developers to build applications associated with 
blockchain or Bitcoin. We note that all the listed Platforms/Frameworks, Tools, and 
Libraries are freely available. Among all the categories, currency means cryptocurrency, 
a specialized one for blockchain. A cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which 
cryptography techniques are used to regulate its generation and transfer10. Bitcoin is the 
first decentralized cryptocurrency and we find cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, for 
example, Dogecoin and Litecoin. Technique/Protocol is referred to as technique, protocol, 
standard, or concept used in blockchain, or just blockchain itself. Moreover, there are 
other categories, e.g., Solidity, an advanced programming language. 
For all 45 entities, we find three big groups: Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. In 
the word cloud (Figure 5), the font colors of the entity names which are in the three 
groups are set to be magenta, orange, and cyan, respectively. It means that these entities 
are relevant to Hyperledger, Ethereum, or Bitcoin. The numbers of involving posts of the 
three groups are 638, 432, and 320, which are relatively large numbers compared with the 
total number of blockchain relevant question posts (i.e., 1,785). Therefore, we can say 
that Hyperledger and Ethereum are two most concerned about blockchain platforms in 
Stack Overflow. Moreover, unsurprisingly, Bitcoin is discussed frequently. 
With the identified blockchain relevant entities, the beginners could have a glimpse of 
blockchain relevant concepts. Especially, they could use these open source frameworks, 
tools or libraries to build their blockchain systems, for example, they could begin with the 
most popular platforms in Stack Overflow, Hyperledger or Ethereum. 
A3. We identify 45 blockchain relevant entities (Figure 5) in Stack Overflow. The 
entities in three groups, which are relevant to Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin, 
are frequently mentioned. 
 
Conclusion 
Blockchain is going to be a hotspot in both industrial and academic fields. Our study 
investigates what are mostly concerned in the perspective of software developers. We 
find that most developers in Stack Overflow are just in stage of learning and attempt. 
Many of them want to know how to correctly deploy and configure the blockchain 
systems with existing platforms or frameworks and they are also interested in the 
mechanisms of blockchain. In general, the three primary topics discussed in Stack 
Overflow are Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. 
With these findings, the blockchain project communities could acknowledge the 
directions for making more practical blockchain techniques and novices could know what 
resources to exploit to build their first blockchain projects. In the future, we plan to 
expand our study to other Q & A platforms, forums, or blogs.

ABSTRACT 
Blockchain technology has recently gained widespread attention by media, businesses, public sector agencies, and 
various international organizations, and it is being regarded as potentially even more disruptive than the Internet. Despite 
significant interest, there is a dearth of academic literature that describes key components of blockchains and discusses 
potential applications. This paper aims to address this gap. This paper presents an overview of blockchain technology, 
identifies the blockchain’s key functional characteristics, builds a formal definition, and offers a discussion and 
classification of current and emerging blockchain applications.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The concept of blockchain has become so prevalent in the mainstream, that many are heralding it as the next 
major disruptive technology.  There have been comparisons of its importance to that of the Web and even the 
Internet (Hernandez, 2017; Mougayar, 2016). While at its core, blockchain is just a method of securely 
storing and distributing information, it is the potential uses of blockchain technology that make it so 
empowering: sharing asset transactions between disparate agents with unquestionable transparency – all the 
while without a controlling central authority.  Blockchain creates trust through cryptographic operation by,
allowing parties to securely exchange value without the use of an intermediary.  Many market sectors are 
poised for disruption and new startup ventures are vying for dominance in these spaces with a fervor not 
witnessed since the dot.com boom (Nofer et al., 2017). Despite significant interest, there is a dearth of 
academic literature that discusses the functional technology underpinning blockchains as well as the potential 
business applications of this technology. This paper aims to address this gap. This paper is intended to serve 
as a bridge to blockchain: it provides a technological primer to establish the key concepts and then explores 
industry applications and trends.  We will peek underneath the hood, identify key characteristics of the 
blockchain technology, and build a formal definition.  Next, we will offer a discussion and classification of 
emerging blockchain applications. 
2. CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS
2.1 Origins & Underpinnings 
The innovation of blockchain technology originated from combining the multi-disciplinary fields of software 
engineering, distributive computing, cryptographic science, and economic game theory. As depicted in 
Figure 1, blockchains operate at the intersection of these fields that provide the footing for a stable and 
scalable software infrastructure, a basis for security of digital assets, support for a global decentralized

network of peers along with economic incentives for these peers to be good actors in the network. Real-world 
blockchain applications comprising these multidisciplinary fields are often discussed under the umbrella term 
of Cryptoeconomics – defined as “a discipline concerned with the production, consumption and transfer of 
wealth using computer networks, cryptography, and game theory to enhance prosperity of groups in current 
and future digital market economies” (Lielacher, 2017). 
Figure 1. Multidisciplinary Foundations of Blockchain Technology 
Blockchain is an underlying construct of Bitcoin, so no discussion of blockchain today is practical 
without also touching on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.  On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto1 published a 
brief but groundbreaking paper to a cryptography forum.  In it he outlined a way to overcome the  
double-spend scenario – a problem which plagued previous cryptocurrencies.  Despite not mentioning 
blockchain explicitly, he described its structure as a chain of hashed timestamps: “Each timestamp includes 
the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones 
behind it” (Nakamoto, 2008). Although this approach was later refined for Bitcoin, the concept was laid out: 
a chain of blocks, each cryptographically linked to the previous, using a hash digest.  From this we denote 
that a blockchain is little more than a sequence of records, each hashed and linked to the previous block 
(Figure 2). 
Figure 2. Nakamoto’s Blockchain Proposal (Nakamoto, 2008) 
However, this approach alone wasn’t sufficient to eliminate the double spend issue. In a double spend 
scenario, the attacker attempts to create a race condition in which they spend the same virtual assets twice 
before either is validated.  For a blockchain to guard against this, Bitcoin needed a method for its network to 
form consensus.  Nakamoto introduced a Proof-of-Work model, in which agents would repeatedly hash the 
block with a random number (nonce) until they achieved a value less than a specified target.  Once found, the 
block would then extend the existing chain. As the blockchain is decentralized over peer-to-peer, any agent

can participate in the proof-of-work consensus model to validate transactions (Bitcoin incentives agency with 
potential economic gains). 
The Bitcoin cryptocurrency required a construct into which it could record the order of transactions, 
verify them, and then secure the entry.  Blockchain technology provided this mechanism through a collection 
of ever extending blocks, where each block represents a pool of transactions, and are cryptographically 
linked to a parent block via a hash digest.  Since the blockchain is represented in a freely distributable file, 
there is no master copy; it is distributed among all parties.  The Bitcoin network relies on this decentralized 
distribution along with the proof-of-work consensus model to coordinate which blocks are added to the chain 
and to update all other copies. 
The blockchain in Bitcoin functions as a database to store transactions, using a series of inputs and output 
resembling double entry accounting. Interestingly, bitcoin balances are not maintained, just inputs and 
outputs.  There are no “coins” minted and serialized for consumption, as one may think.  By traversing the 
blockchain, the available balance for a user can be quickly calculated.  Any attempt to “corrupt” the 
blockchain and award more coins in a transaction will fail as the blockchain hashes would have to be 
recalculated – a computationally hard problem – and the blockchain’s decentralized nature ensures other 
nodes will have legitimate copies. 
The first usage of Bitcoin dates to January 3, 2009 at which point Nakamoto created the blockchain 
genesis block (the first block in the chain and the only one not to have a parent block to link to), and issued 
himself the first 50 bitcoins (Blockchain Luxembourg S.A., 2017; Zohar, 2015).  All blocks in the Bitcoin 
blockchain trace back to this original transaction.  This leads to one more observation: blockchains form an 
immutable historic record of every transaction from the date of origin in a transparent, decentralized data 
store. 
A blockchain gains its secure, immutable nature by combining two innovations: a cryptographic link 
between records that makes changes progressively more difficult the longer the chain is, and the distribution 
of the data to all participating nodes on the decentralized network in which it is expected honest nodes 
outnumber potential attackers. 
2.2 Functional Characteristics  
Despite being initially linked to Bitcoin, blockchain technology can be used independently in a variety of 
different use-cases and markets, ranging from insurance to the health industry.  A blockchain can be applied 
in virtually any industry in which assets are managed and transactions occur.  It can provide a secure chain of 
custody for both digital and physical assets through its functional characteristics that facilitate transactions 
through trust, consensus, security, and smart contracts. These aspects of blockchains are explored in the 
following sections. 
2.2.1 Transactions & Smart Contracts 
A transaction is an exchange of assets that is managed under the entity service’s rules. Such rules are usually 
operationalized through scripting languages (e.g. Bitcoin’s Forth) and are used for advanced transactions 
(such as escrow and multi-party signatures) to be performed. These rules also form the basis for smart 
contracts. 
A smart contract is a set of logic rules in the form of a coded script which can be embedded into the 
blockchain to govern a transaction. The contract is executed autonomously and is used to govern the 
transaction (Buterin, 2016).  In this way, contracts act as smart software agents (Stark, 2016).  Once a smart 
contract is embedded in the blockchain, it becomes an autonomous agent that is permanently tamperproof. 
An application then reads the code when performing a transaction, executes and processes the results.  
The contract nature of a smart contract isn’t just restricted to application specific code.  It can also be 
used to codify the terms and condition of an agreement into the transaction workflow. Ethereum (the second 
largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin) is an alt-coin technology that has been designed to support smart 
contracts.

2.2.2 Consensus & Trust 
In events surrounding nuclear disarmament near end of the cold war, President Regan made a Russian 
proverb famous: “trust, but verify.” The same could be claimed for blockchain. It is trusted by consensus as 
all parties must have identical copies of the blockchain; but each participant is responsible for verifying it. 
Blockchain’s decentralization is a core strength, as a copy of the database file is owned by all actors. In 
order to ensure the integrity of each copy, a consensus algorithm is required. The consensus algorithm allows 
the community to ensure that each added block is legitimate. It also prevents attackers from compromising 
and forking the chain (Coindesk, 2017). Nakamoto suggested using a proof-of-work approach, in which a 
hard cryptographic puzzle must be solved by miners (Nakamoto, 2008). Miners expend computing resources 
and are rewarded for their efforts using various incentives. Other consensus models such as proof-of-stake, 
proof-of-burn, proof-of-elapsed-time, and proof-of-capacity have been proposed in the literature to overcome 
some of the weaknesses of the original proof-of-work model by attempting to balance fairness and resource 
expenditure (Kiayias et al., 2017; Zamfir, 2015). 
The nature of blockchain is trustless.  Blockchain is designed to eliminate the need for any one entity to 
gate transactions. It establishes a trust model based on a group consensus, where the network validates 
transactions and authorizes their addition to the chain.  There are no middlemen; the notion of trust becomes 
implicit as each record in the blockchain is verified by the community which holds multiple copies of the 
blockchain. By removing trust agents from transactions, blockchain has the ability to disrupt many major 
industries. 
Traditional transaction models rely on central authority to act in the clearinghouse role.  Trust is granted 
to the central authority with an expectation that it will remain honest while verifying and clearing 
transactions. The instances of records reside with the authority. If the central authority is compromised, either 
intentionally (manipulation) or unintentionally (hacked), the interlocutor can wreak extensive havoc on the 
system. The blockchain model eliminates the central authority (Figure 3) by instead disseminating copies of 
the records to all parties. Each participant maintains their own instance of the blockchain. They broadcast 
changes by forming new blocks and requesting validation based on the rules of the consensus model.  Once 
validated, the block is added to everyone’s chain. The process is potentially safer than the traditional model, 
and the middleman agent isn’t required, invoking a disruption to the status quo.
  
Figure 3. Traditional vs Blockchain Transaction Model 
A blockchain relies on mathematics via cryptography to establish independent trust for each transaction, 
and on computationally expensive consensus models to replace central authorities. Pools of recent 
transactions are ordered into a block. The block is then cryptographically linked to a chain of blocks (the 
blockchain) and is verified through a consensus model that involves significant computing resources 
(mining). As the blockchain is an open-access file replicated on multiple full-nodes of the network, no one 
entity controls the transaction list. Since each block is hashed and inserted into the chain, it is immutable and 
serves as a final record of past transactions. An entity cannot change the chain without changing all blocks 
that follow it, an effort which is computationally hard and expensive.  This secures the blockchain and 
establishes trust independent of a central authority. 
2.2.3 Public and Private Blockchains 
Blockchains can be classified as public, private or hybrid variants, depending on their application (Buterin, 
2015; Mougayar, 2016): 
ISBN: 978-989-8533-74-6 © 2018
52
 Public – Public blockchains have no single owner; are visible by anyone; their consensus process is 
open to all to participate in; and they are full decentralized.  Bitcoin is an example of a public 
blockchain. 
 Private – (also called permissioned) Private blockchains use privileges to control who can read from 
and write to the blockchain.  Consensus algorithms and mining usually aren’t required as a single 
entity has ownership and controls block creation. 
 Hybrid – Also known as consortium, these blockchains are public only to a privileged group.  The 
consensus process is controlled by known, privileged servers using a set of rules agreed to by all 
parties.  Copies of the blockchain are only distributed among entitled participants; the network is 
therefore only partly decentralized. 
Although a public blockchain distributes itself in a decentralized peer-to-peer fashion, this isn’t 
necessarily true for a private blockchain. Private blockchains are those used by enterprises to record asset 
transactions within a limited user base (restricted scope). Hybrid blockchains can be visualized as very small 
scale public blockchains; they are decentralized only across a limited participant base. 
As a summary, we can formalize the afore-noted features of the blockchain into a list of four core 
characteristics: 
 Immutable – (permanent and tamper-proof) a blockchain is a permanent record of transactions.  
Once a block is added, it cannot be altered.  This creates trust in the transaction record. 
 Decentralized – (networked copies) a blockchain is stored in a file that can be accessed and copied 
by any node on the network.  This creates decentralization.  
 Consensus Driven – (trust verification) each block on the blockchain is verified independently via a 
Consensus models which provide rules for validating a block, and often use a scarce resource (such 
as computing power) to show proof that adequate effort was made.  In Bitcoin, this is referred to as 
the mining process. This mechanism works without the use of a central authority or an explicit  
trust-granting agent. 
 Transparent – (full transaction history) since the blockchain is an open file, any party can access it 
and audit transactions2. This creates provenance under which asset lifetimes can be tracked. 
3. TOWARDS A DEFINITION 
There are many different blockchain definitions offered, ranging from application-specific to the excessively 
technical. For example, Coinbase, the  world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, defines blockchain as “a
distributed, public ledger that contains the history of every bitcoin transaction” (Coinbase, 2017). As an 
application-specific definition, this characterization does not account for the fact that blockchains can be 
reused for other cryptocurrencies and industry applications independently. The Oxford English Dictionary 
broadens the definition somewhat, defining blockchain as “a digital ledger in which transactions made in 
bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly” (Oxford Dictionaries, 2018).
This definition also falls short as blockchain technology can be used independently of Bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies. Both these definitions also highlight the role of a blockchain as a digital ledger, and much 
of the literature would agree with this.  However, this domain is evolving rapidly, and ledger usage is simply 
a feature of the blockchain but not its essence. This feature only pertains to blockchain applications that focus 
on managing the exchange of value in the case of virtual assets. 
A somewhat broader definition is offered by Webopedia where a blockchain is defined as “a type of data 
structure that enables identifying and tracking transactions digitally and sharing this information across a 
distributed network of computers, creating in a sense a distributed trust network.  The distributed ledger 
technology offered by blockchain provides a transparent and secure means for tracking the ownership and 
transfer of assets” (Stroud, 2015).  While this definition succeeds in capturing more of the characteristics of 
blockchain, it highlights distribution as a key feature of blockchain computing without acknowledging that 
blockchains are not just a distributed technology, but also a decentralized one (Swan, 2015b; Wright and De

Filippi, 2015). The key distinction here is that while a distributed system partitions work among participants 
in an optimal fashion, a blockchain requires that each and every participant maintain a full node of the system 
and enforce its rules independently. In a system where nodes operate on local information (decision locality) 
to accomplish goals rather than the result of a central ordering influence, this decentralization ensures that 
pulling the plug is near impossible – only one node needs to remain operational for the network to function. 
Evidently, there is a need for a clear and concise definition of blockchain. Based on the theoretical 
underpinnings of blockchain technology outlined in the previous sections, we provide the following 
definition of a blockchain:  
“a decentralized database containing sequential, cryptographically linked blocks of digitally signed 
asset transactions, governed by a consensus model.”
Through this connotative definition, we aim to highlight the core constituents for blockchain technology 
in that it is a peer-to-peer networked database governed by a set of rules. Furthermore, blockchains represent 
a shift away from traditional trust agents and a move towards transparency.  As a technological building 
block, it permits applications from a broad swath of industries to take advantage of sharing, tracking, and 
auditing digital assets. The next section identifies potential opportunities and use-cases for blockchain 
technology in different industries. 
4. BLOCKCHAIN BUSINESS APPLICATIONS 
4.1 Value Proposition of Blockchain Technology 
Since the fundamental use-case for blockchain technology is to drive greater transparency and substantiate 
accuracy of transaction data across the digital information ecosystem, potential applications of such 
technology are practically endless. In addition to virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, a multitude of other 
potential blockchain applications and services have been envisioned and discussed by industry pundits and 
technology research firms (CBInsights, 2018; Mougayar, 2016). To make sense of the blockchain application 
ecosystem, Mougayar (2016) identifies the value proposition of blockchains as pertaining to the enablement 
of one or more of six elements denoted by the mnemonic ATOMIC (Assets, Trust, Ownership, Money, 
Identity, and Contracts). These elements constitute the crux of blockchain business applications by 
facilitating the creation, management and transfer of digital assets through automated validation rules, 
cryptographically verified rights and ownerships, and the validation of transactions without requiring 
intermediaries. Using a blockchain platform implies that each of these six elements is programmable, and by 
disintermediating these facets, blockchains can enable new services to come to market with cheaper 
transaction fees and faster execution. In this way, blockchain technology is poised to disrupt many business 
models which rely on (often costly) intermediaries. 
Mougayar (2016) also classifies the role of blockchains as spanning four aspects: blockchain as a 
development platform; blockchain as a smart contract utility; blockchain as a marketplace, and finally, 
blockchain as a trusted service application (Rosic, 2017). These potential roles are discussed herewith. 
4.2 Blockchain as a Development Platform 
At present, the development of blockchain applications and services requires a highly specialized skillset, and  
the state of the blockchain developer toolkits is immature (Aru, 2017).  The introduction of Blockchain as a 
Service (BaaS) platforms such as those by Microsoft (Azure) and IBM (Cloud) provide an inexpensive 
environment for developers to rapidly prototype on test blockchains before deploying to live ones (Sofia, 
2016). Other examples in this space include technology platforms that enable secure sharing of data across 
industrial networks through blockchain’s tamperproof ledgers (e.g. Xage3); and technologies that offer 
blockchain enabled verification of data transactions (e.g. Guardtime4). These BaaS solutions form the basis 
for programmable trust, ownership and identity, and also facilitate the operation and governance of enterprise 
blockchain applications and services.

4.3 Blockchain as a Smart Contract Utility 
Smart contracts provide a programmatic interface to blockchains.  Smart contract utility is defined as “being 
able to perform useful functions to create, maintain or augment the value of digital assets” (Sorin et al., 
2016). The smart contract, when triggered, transacts value based on digital assets.  Utility is captured in code 
and stored on the blockchain.  This code is executed when a predetermined condition occurs.  Activities often 
managed by third party central authorities are mitigated to the blockchain instead, disintermediating 
transactions (Mougayar, 2015). Examples include escrow, multi-party transactions, digital notarization, and 
time stamping. Blockchain startups such as R35 are collaborating with banks and regulators to operationalize 
blockchains as a new operating system for financial markets (Irrera, 2017). A specific instance of this 
functionality can be observed in the example of Visa and DocuSign who have partnered to operate a  
proof-of-concept blockchain project to streamline vehicle leasing experience for customers by simplifying 
transaction management between multiple parties including sellers, buyers and insurance companies (Hirson, 
2015). 
4.4 Blockchain as a Marketplace 
Any robust ecosystem requires a market for generating value. In the cryptoeconomics marketplace, 
blockchain provides a payment infrastructure (via cryptocurrencies) and a proof-of-ownership structure (via 
digital asset tracking).  This has enabled peer-to-peer marketplaces with no governing authority, such as 
OpenBazaar6 and Soma7 providing accessible, disintermediated trade (CBInsights, 2018). In these 
marketplaces, blockchain platforms can be used to directly match buyers and sellers allowing them to 
transact through smart contracts. Blockchain technology is also being touted as an enabler for next generation 
online workforce marketplaces in the context of the gig economy that relies on independent contract workers 
and freelancers for short-term engagements, and the shared economy where consumers increasingly become 
prosumers. In such instances, blockchain platforms can ensure that service providers are not constrained by 
any central authority – hence, allowing them to extend flexible offerings, and payment interactions and 
service transactions can function in a transparent environment (Aitken, 2017).
Overall, as a marketplace enabler, blockchains can be used to operationalize programmable assets, 
ownership and money. 
4.5 Trusted-Service Application 
Finally, in its role as a trusted service application, blockchain technology comprises end-to-end functionality 
by facilitating highly specialized applications for any purpose imaginable. This more generalized use of 
blockchains to enable all types of applications through a combination of programmable assets, trust, 
ownership, money, identity, and contracts is sometimes referred to as blockchain 2.0 (Bheemaiah, 2016; 
Swan, 2015a). On the front-end, trusted service applications built on the blockchain using smart contracts can 
provide disintermediated, secure services to end users. On the backend, many of these applications reside on 
public blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum) which cannot be shut down or restricted. Furthermore, many 
companies now provide APIs (application programming interface) allowing developers to build applications 
using blockchain protocols and mechanisms (Bheemaiah, 2016). 
Based on our discussion of potential blockchain business applications, we propose the following 2x2 
matrix (  
Figure 4) for mapping industry sectors against blockchain scope (public vs private vs hybrid), and 
blockchain access (as a service or as application).  In this context, an application refers to “a program 
designed to perform a function or a suite of related functions of benefit to an end user” (Horak, 2008), while 
a service is “a transport of data and/or applications”  (Horak, 2008).

Figure 4. Blockchain Access-vs-Scope Matrix
In order to map horizontal markets on to the above matrix, each offering can be assessed against the 
following criteria: 
 Access - Is the primary function to transform data (an application) or to present data (service)? 
 Scope - Is blockchain usage globally unrestricted (public) or enterprise permissioned (private)? 
For contrast, consider the examples of health care and real estate.  The health care industry is seeking to 
facilitate secure transit of patient records via the blockchain.  Access is therefore service oriented while the 
scope remains private to health care partners.  In comparison, the real estate industry has shown interest in 
investigating blockchain for land registration records.  This application is meant to be open and transparent to 
the public. 
Overall, these current and envisioned use-cases for blockchain technology are poised to create a global 
decentralized yet trusted value ecosystem that can lead to exciting new economic opportunities in the public 
and private sectors alike. 
5. CONCLUSION 
This paper offers a conceptual overview of blockchains through a description of its underlying technological 
functions and a discussion of its potential business applications. As outlined, contemporary and future 
blockchain-based innovations span a myriad of use-cases and industries beyond digital currency and the 
financial sector. Taking this into consideration, we offer a connotative definition that specifies the core 
elements of blockchain technology independent of Bitcoin. Furthermore, we describe various functional 
characteristics of blockchain mechanisms, and offer examples of business applications where these 
mechanisms can potentially be useful.

ABSTRACT 
The Impact of Blockchain Technology on Financial Transactions 
by 
Al Tilooby 
August 2018 
Chair: Lars Mathiassen 
Major Academic Unit: Executive Doctorate in Business  
Blockchain technology could emerge as a disruptive innovation that streamlines financial 
transactions and attenuates their cost. Therefore, the financial industry must assess the 
opportunities and challenges presented by the technology. As a grand breakthrough, it could 
transform financial transactions and introduce new possibilities for established financial 
institutions as well as for new entrants. At the same time, incumbents and startups need to 
overcome technological, regulatory, and adoption challenges before blockchain technology can 
become a mainstream reality. Despite its potential, the literature on its impact on financial 
transactions is still fragmented, with weak empirical insights and limited theoretical 
explanations. Therefore, financial industry managers lack guidance on how to plan and prepare 
for the impact of blockchain technology on the operation of financial transactions. 
Against that backdrop, this dissertation explores the asserted and potential impacts on 
financial transactions with emphasis on asset verification, record keeping, data privacy, and 
transaction costs. The dissertation adopts a pluralist approach to examine the subject matter 
based on three approaches: analysis of the extant literature about blockchain technology 
concerning financial transactions; perception analysis based on interviews with financial 
executives, subject matter experts, and researchers; and a theoretical interpretation using 
 xii 
transaction cost theory. Therefore, the dissertation synthesizes insights from the three approaches 
to offer managers of financial institutions guidance concerning the opportunities and challenges 
of blockchain technology.

I INTRODUCTION 
I.1 Financial Transactions 
Financial transactions are foundational to the national and global economy. The global 
financial systems transact trillions of dollars daily and serve billions of customers (Tapscott & 
Tapscott, 2016). Taking the USA as an example, the Automated Clearing House system 
processes more than forty trillion dollars’ worth of annual transactions—and that only represents 
about 20 percent of the electronic payments in the nation (Kiviat, 2015). With many competitors 
seeking a share of this huge market, to remain competitively efficient, financial institutions must 
frequently disrupt their operations and processes driven by new technologies such as blockchain 
(PwC, 2017). 
Workie and Jain (2017) distinguish three phases of a blockchain-based financial 
transaction: 1) the initiation phase, where a client accesses the blockchain network to buy or sell 
financial assets, 2) the verification of financial assets in the blockchain ledger by involved 
stakeholders, and 3) the recording of the information into the blockchain ledger. In alignment 
with these three phases, this dissertation focuses on four areas of financial transactions: asset 
verification, record keeping, data privacy, and transaction costs. Table 1 illustrates the mapping 
between the four areas of dissertation focus and the three phases of a blockchain-based financial 
transaction. Asset verification and record keeping map directly to the first and second phases 
respectively. However, users and financial institutions are concerned about data privacy and 
transaction costs during all phases of financial transactions. To cover the four areas of focus 
methodically, the dissertation explores the opportunities, challenges, and recommendations from 
technological, regulatory and adoption perspectives.

Table 1: Financial Transaction Phases and Areas of Research Focus 
At present, financial transaction costs involve many layers of fees that are collected by 
intermediaries. Digital payments and currency transfers require heavy consumption of human 
and infrastructural assets of financial institutions that act as intermediaries to conduct, clear, and 
settle transactions (Yli-Huumo, Ko, Choi, Park, & Smolander, 2016). Transaction fees are 
significant—McKinsey states that the global payment industry enjoyed a 1.8 trillion dollar 
revenue in 2015 (Bansal, Bruno, Istace, & Niederkorn, 2016). Moreover, it takes several days to 
settle transactions—transactions such as money transfers require nearly three days to settle (Guo 
& Liang, 2016; Kiviat, 2015). Although profitable to the intermediaries, these costs burden the 
parties making the transaction. Blockchain technology might make these transactions faster and 
less costly by eliminating several layers of intermediaries. The decentralized nature of 
blockchain could imply costly layers of redundancy, infrastructural costs, and delays. 
Nonetheless, the reverse could be true because the technology could provide its own cost-
efficiencies—as will be described later. Efficiencies could be gained in the same way that 
double-entry accounting has improved security and reliability despite its redundancy, and 
analogous to how computer technology has improved security and reliability—until cyber risks 
evolved. Blockchain technology could, therefore, be the next step in security and reliability. 
Nonetheless, many challenges and issues would need to be resolved before getting there.

I.2 Blockchain Technology 
Blockchain technology was introduced by Nakamoto (2008) to bypass middleman actors 
such as financial institutions by allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions. To achieve this goal, 
Nakamoto suggested a peer-to-peer distributed ledger. In this way, payer and payee can 
exchange directly over the network, utilizing encryption and consensus mechanisms (Guo & 
Liang, 2016; Tsai, Blower, Zhu, & Yu, 2016; Zhu & Zhou, 2016) to make transactions 
tamperproof since any modification to the historical data record is detectable by participating 
blockchain network nodes (B. Lee & Lee, 2017; Tapscott & Tapscott, 2017). 
One of the fundamental objectives of any payment system is to guard against double 
spending. In other words, the system should be able to track who owns the money and should 
only allow the person who owns the money to spend it once and not more than once. Blockchain 
technology solves the double spending issue through a consensus mechanism (Nakamoto, 2008; 
Pazaitis, De Filippi, & Kostakis) that will be detailed later in this dissertation. 
Blockchain technology comprises several technological and non-technological concepts 
and ideas. The integration of these concepts and ideas allows value exchanges without a trusted 
central institution (Kiviat, 2015). As a result, there is a growing interest in the technology 
because it provides security, anonymity, and data integrity without third-party organizations in 
control of the transactions (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). Although it could theoretically 
disintermediate, in reality, blockchain networks re-intermediate trust away from the center 
(Mougayar, 2016) and form ‘multi-center, weakly intermediated’ schemes (Guo & Liang, 2016). 
The decentralized nature of blockchain technology could also make the data more transparent 
when compared to centralized transactions (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). However, since public 
blockchain network users could opt to act anonymously, a high level of privacy could diminish 
 4 
the degree of transparency from the perspective of entities that need to know more about end 
users. 
Initially, blockchain technology emerged as the underpinning platform for the Bitcoin 
cryptocurrency. However, for the reasons outlined, banks expect it will help them streamline and 
reduce the costs of activities such as international payments and trading settlement (Irrera & 
Shumaker, 2017). This expectation opens the door for a potentially disruptive technology that 
could have broad implications for the financial sector. Zhao, Fan, and Yan (2016) and Mougayar 
(2016) predict that the transformational effect of blockchain technology on enabling trustworthy 
transactions globally will parallel the paradigmatic influence of the Internet on accessibility to 
information. Zhao et al. (2016) further elaborate that decentralized trust—arising from 
blockchain technology—will attenuate costs of transactions that are due to non-technical aspects 
of centralization. Similarly, Guo and Liang (2016) posit that applying blockchain technology can 
resolve many of the efficiency bottlenecks, delays, fraud, and operational risks they assert infest 
the financial industry. Nonetheless, blockchain networks are inherently slow since 1) getting a 
whole network to a consensus on a single truth is time-consuming and 2) peer-to-peer nodes 
have to act both as a client and a server (Tsai et al., 2016). 
I.3 State of Adoption 
Since blockchain technology could offer opportunities to reduce cost and improve the 
speed of transaction settlements, exchanges, banks, and the whole securities industry are 
increasingly interested in the technology (de Meijer, 2016). Moreover, international institutions 
including the International Monetary Fund, and nations, such as the USA, the UK, Japan, China, 
Russia, India, and South Africa have initiated research on blockchain technology applications 
targeting many fields (Guo & Liang, 2016). 
 5 
Recently, international institutions, including the United Nations and the International 
Monetary Fund (Guo & Liang, 2016), as well as central banks in the U.K., China, the USA, 
Korea, Singapore, Japan, Russia, India, Netherlands, and South Africa have recently announced 
blockchain technology plans (Mori, 2016; Tsai et al., 2016). National stock exchanges such as 
Nasdaq; banking titans such as J.P. Morgan; and financial bodies such as the USA Depository 
Trust & Clearing Corporation and the People’s Bank of China have all started their blockchain 
technology research laboratories (Guo & Liang, 2016; Mori, 2016). Most financial institutions 
have pilot programs for blockchain technology. For instance, R3—founded in 2015 as a 
blockchain technology consortium—has partnered with over eighty financial institutions and 
bodies (R3, n.d.). China Financial Blockchain Consortium (Guo & Liang, 2016) is another 
alliance. Traditional companies have jumped on the blockchain technology bandwagon with a 
variety of offerings. For instance, IBM has built a supply chain blockchain with a mission 
statement to lubricate exchange, enhance trust, increase accountability, and elevate transparency. 
IBM CEO Ginni Rometty stated: “What the Internet did for communications, blockchain will do 
for trusted transactions” (IBM, n.d.). Startups such as Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings 
already offer financial institutions services that facilitate digital asset dealing (Pilkington, 2015). 
According to Coindesk (2017a), enterprise-oriented blockchain-based projects grew in size, and 
pilot projects continued in partnership with major groups and corporations as summarized in 
Table 2.

Table 2: State of Enterprise Blockchain Technology (Coindesk, 2017a) 
I.4 Research Approach 
Even though blockchain technology could impact many aspects of our lives, thus far, 
there are only a few published academic papers that treat the technology from a business 
perspective. aver Research on blockchain technology has been mainly attentive to technical and 
legal topics (Lindman, Tuunainen, & Rossi, 2017) primarily published in practitioner-oriented 
journals and on websites that are targeting Bitcoin evangelists and hobbyists. Over 80 percent of 
the extant literature focuses on Bitcoin systems, and less than 20 percent deals with other 
blockchain technology applications (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016) with most of that focused on 
technological (Beck, Czepluch, Lollike, & Malone, 2016; Lindman et al., 2017; Teigland, Yetis, 
& Larsson, 2013) and legal problems (Bollen, 2013; Ingram & Morisse, 2016; Lindman et al., 
2017). Hence, as blockchain technology permeates, further research in the domains of 
information systems (IS) and management is called for (Giaglis & Kypriotaki, 2014; Lindman et

al., 2017; Van Alstyne, 2014). This dissertation contributes to the efforts of bridging this gap in 
knowledge. 
To explore the impact of blockchain technology on financial transactions, this 
dissertation uses a pluralistic method that combines a review of the literature, an analysis of the 
perspectives of key industry players and observers, and a theoretical interpretation through the 
lens of transaction cost theory (Coase, 1937; Ouchi, 1980; Williamson, 1975). A pluralist 
approach that compares and contrasts multiple plausible perspectives on reality is crucial to the 
emergence of rigorous scientific knowledge (Azevedo, 1997; Van de Ven, 2007) as it can 
provide complementary insights and possible synthesis of them to study an emerging business 
phenomenon. Furthermore, using multiple perspectives on a complex business problem 
decreases the likelihood of unintended bias in interpretations (Van de Ven, 2007). 
When utilizing a pluralist methodology, the researcher moves iteratively between data 
and theory (A. S. Lee & Baskerville, 2003) contrasting perspectives and synthesizing findings 
into a holistic account. Consistent with the approach, this dissertation moves between description 
and theory by drawing on a) the intersection of literature about blockchain technology and 
financial transactions, b) interviews with financial industry executives and subject matter experts 
about the impact of blockchain technology on financial transactions, and c) transaction cost 
theory (Coase, 1937; Ouchi, 1980; Williamson, 1975) as a particularly thought-provoking 
theoretical framework that promises insights into the potentially disruptive effects of the 
technology. When applying the first and second methods, we adopt a broad view of the 
phenomenon exploring various types of blockchain technology impacts on financial transactions. 
In this way, we report findings such as technical, regulatory, and adoption issues. Moreover, in 
this case, the term ‘transaction cost’ has a broader meaning to engulf ‘transaction theory’ costs, 
 8 
production costs (Dyer, 1997; Zajac & Olsen, 1993), and transition costs that are related to 
deploying blockchain technology. Nevertheless, when we look through the prism of transaction 
cost theory, we zoom in to solely focus on ‘transaction theory’ costs. 
A detailed account of how the dissertation has applied the pluralist methodology is found 
in appendix A. 
I.5 The Role of Theory 
The field of IS is concerned with studying phenomena that emerge from the interaction 
between technological systems and social systems (Gregor, 2006; A. S. Lee, 2001). As such, the 
use of blockchain technology in any industry satisfies the definition of IS and could be explored 
targeting the four central goals of IS theory (Gregor, 2006). The second goal is to explain how, 
why, and when things occur based on causality and methods of argumentation (Gregor, 2006). 
The third goal is to probabilistically predict what will transpire in the future if certain 
preconditions obtain (Gregor, 2006). Finally, the fourth goal is future-oriented like prediction 
with theory offering a prescription of normative methods and structures for the development of 
artifacts to attain desired outcomes (Gregor, 2006). 
This dissertation provides descriptive accounts and examines opportunities and risks from 
business and societal perspectives (Lindman et al., 2017) to uncover new explanations 
underlying the blockchain technology phenomenon by invoking transaction cost theory to 
explicate the interaction of the financial sector with blockchain technology (Gregor, 2006). In 
part, the goal here is a response to the assessment of Zhao et al. (2016) that research in the 
economic and social validity of blockchain technology applications is lagging because it takes 
more effort to uncover. Additionally, there is a lack of a deep understanding regarding how 
blockchain technology decentralized services are designed, developed, and organized to 
 9 
revolutionize trust (Lindman et al., 2017). In addition, this research seeks to foresee (Gregor, 
2006) the impact of blockchain technology on financial transactions by enlisting perceptions by 
key industry players and observers and by adopting theoretical interpretations. Hence, the final 
integrative goal of this research is to prescriptively (Gregor, 2006) outline insights into how 
financial organizations can prepare for blockchain technology opportunities and threats. 
The transaction cost theory is a fitting theoretical framework for understanding and 
explicating the impact of blockchain technology on financial transactions because blockchains 
could impact how transactions are conducted. Transaction cost theory is interdisciplinary by 
virtue of joining economic perspectives with aspects of organization theory and contract law 
(Williamson, 1979). The theory is concerned with minimizing the cost of transactional activities 
that are not directly attributed to the production of goods and services, and are instead related to 
the cost of searching, bargaining, monitoring, and enforcement activities that are associated with 
the transaction of goods and services (Husted & Folger, 2004). Consequently, a persistent goal of 
transaction cost theory is concerned with organizational boundaries around the decision of 
whether a transaction is more efficiently performed within a firm or outside a firm’s boundaries 
(Coase, 1937; Geyskens, Steenkamp, & Kumar, 2006). 
Ouchi (1980) defines a ‘transaction cost’ as any activity that is conducted to satisfy the 
expectations of participants in an exchange. Usually such costs are attributed to the difficulty of 
redeploying assets to their next best use—the asset specificity challenge (Husted & Folger, 2004; 
Klein, Crawford, & Alchian, 1978; Williamson, 1985, 1991)—or to the difficulties in measuring 
individual contributions to team effort—the metering problem which is also referred to as 
performance ambiguity (Alchian & Demsetz, 1972; Husted & Folger, 2004; Milgrom & Roberts, 
1992; Ouchi, 1980). Another problem with perceiving equity is contingent goal incongruence— 
 10 
the degree to which exchange participants have incompatible objectives (Husted & Folger, 2004; 
Ouchi, 1980). 
There are two primitives in transaction cost theory that are closely related to the 
aforementioned notions. First, bounded rationality—the individual’s limitation on receiving, 
sustaining, retrieving, and processing information (Simon, 1955; Williamson, 1973). The second 
is opportunism—exemplified by dodging duties, breaching agreements, and stealing (Alchian & 
Demsetz, 1972; Husted & Folger, 2004) as each participant endeavors to maximize their 
advantages in transactions through dishonesty and lack of transparency (Williamson, 1973). 
Moreover, Williamson also specific two more transaction costs determinants: frequency, 
meaning how often a contract is invoked (Milgrom & Roberts, 1992; Williamson, 1979) and 
uncertainty, comprising ex ante difficulties of anticipating all future scenarios, language 
equivocality, and ex post performance ambiguity.

II TECHNOLOGY: BLOCKCHAINS  
Blockchain technology is both an economic innovation—a new architecture for enabling 
humans or machines exchanges without the need of full trust—and a technological innovation—
a novel decentralized ledger that engenders trust (Liebenau & Elaluf-Calderwood, 2016; 
Lindman et al., 2017) because the technology could provide the platform to record transactions 
and share data between participating parties in a more efficient, transparent, and verifiable 
manner (Workie & Jain, 2017). However, disruptive innovations usually surpass the internal 
absorption and usurpation capabilities of established institutions (Mougayar, 2016) and both 
established institutions and startups will have to navigate the regulatory and adoption turbulences 
and technological hurdles as will be detailed later in this dissertation. 
II.1 Blockchain Explained 
To explain how blockchain technology works, we start with a simple scenario based on 
Bitcoin blockchain. In our scenario, Alice wants to use some of her Bitcoins to buy an audible 
book from Bob through the Bitcoin blockchain—Figure 1. 
Figure 1: A Simplified Blockchain-based Transaction 
Alice initiates the exchange by sending a broadcast message to the blockchain network. 
The message contains the electronic address of Bob and the amount required to pay for the 
audiobook. Next, the blockchain network assembles Alice’s transaction information and adds it 
to its public ledger. Then, seeing the payment from Alice, Bob sends Alice the electronic keys to

concepts that explain how the transaction in the scenario works. 
To support the ensuing elaboration of the above scenario, we describe in Table 4 the 
relevant Bitcoin blockchain terms. 
Table 4: Bitcoin Blockchain Terms 
Term Description 
Transaction According to (BitcoinWiki, n.d.) a Bitcoin transaction is 
1. A transfer of value that is broadcasted to the network and 
recorded by the network into a block. 
2. Typically references previous transaction outputs as new 
transaction inputs and dedicates all input Bitcoin values to new 
outputs. 
3. Not encrypted, so it is possible to browse and view every 
transaction ever recorded into a block. 
4. Once buried under enough confirmations it can be 
considered irreversible. 
Block A unit of data in the blockchain that includes a hash of itself, the hash 
of the prior block, and multiple transactions (Narayanan, Bonneau, 
Felten, Miller, & Goldfeder, 2016). 
 
Bitcoin blockchain reached 510188 blocks as of 2018 Feb 20th 
(Blockchain, n.d.). 
Blockchain Is a chain of blocks where each block is cryptographically linked to 
the prior one (Mattila, 2016). 
Blockchain 
Network 
A peer-to-peer arbitrarily connected network with no hierarchy, no 
centralization, and no master nodes; where each full node stores a 
replica of the blockchain and relays info to its connected neighbors 
(Narayanan et al., 2016). 
Node Any computer that connects to the Bitcoin network (BitcoinWiki, 
n.d.). 
Full node A special type of node that fully validates transactions and blocks; 
almost all full nodes also support the network by accepting 
transactions and blocks from other full nodes, validating those 
 15 
II.2 Authentication 
How does the Bitcoin blockchain network and Bob know that Alice authenticated the 
transaction? The answer is digital signature. Alice initiates the transaction by using her private 
key—a password that only Alice knows—to digitally sign, and therefore, authenticate the 
transaction. Paralleling the objectives of a traditional hand-written signature, a digital signature is 
a cryptographic mechanism that utilizes pairs of private and public keys to satisfy four objectives 
(Badev & Chen, 2014). First, only the signatory can sign with her specific signature. Second, it is 
not possible to append the signature to other than the signed documents. Third, the signatory 
cannot deny her signature. Fourth, the recipient can validate that the document has the authentic 
signature of the signatory. Narayanan et al. (2016) explain how the public and private keys are 
generated using a mathematical algorithm such that if Alice signs a message with her private 
key, and Bob knows her public key, then Bob can verify that Alice has indeed signed the 
message and that the message has not been tampered with. Figure 2 depicts this authentication 
scenario. 
transactions and blocks, and then further relaying them to 
neighboring nodes (BitcoinCore, n.d.). 
 
The number of full nodes is unknown. (Bitnodes, 2018) asserts that 
there are 11389 reachable full nodes as of 2018 Feb 20th, but 
estimates by different sources vary significantly. 
Miner A full node that competes to build the next block (Tapscott & 
Tapscott, 2016). 
 
Estimates vary, but they are thousands Bitcoin miners.

Figure 2: Authentication Using Digital Signature—Adapted from Badev and Chen (2014) 
II.3 Content and Verification 
What is in the transaction initiated by Alice? Narayanan et al. (2016) explain how 
transactions are constructed in a Bitcoin blockchain network, in the scenario where Alice intends 
to send some Bitcoins to Bob. The transaction comprises a pointer to where Alice acquired the 
Bitcoins in the historical record of the blockchain, the amount she wants to transfer to Bob, the 
public key of Bob which is the payee's digital address, Alice’s digital signature for the whole 
transaction, and a small transaction fee as an optional incentive for the node that assembles her 
transaction. Figure 3 illustrates the content of the transaction broadcasted by Alice to the 
blockchain network. 
Upon receiving Alice’s transaction, the blockchain network verifies a few items such as 
Alice’s digital signature and her claim of ownership of the Bitcoins. Following the verification of 
the veracity of the transaction, one of the nodes in the blockchain network assembles Alice’s 
transaction into a block of data alongside hundreds of other transactions, and hence, the block 
becomes part of the chain or ledger. The network is now aware that the Bitcoins spent by Alice 
are owned by Bob. By virtue of Alice’s transaction being part of the public ledger, Bob may 
confidently send Alice the keys to the audiobook she bought from him.

II.4 Network Operation 
How does the Bitcoin blockchain network operate? Our scenario is based on the Bitcoin 
blockchain network. Figure 4 depicts the steps of our scenario in more details. 
Figure 4: Alice Transacting with Bob through Blockchain Network 
To contrast and, therefore, appreciate the simplification blockchain technology brings to 
the table, Figure 5 depicts a traditional credit card transaction. 
Input: Pointers to where Alice acquired the Bitcoins 
Output 1: Bitcoins to be transferred to Bob and his public key 
Output 2: Change address—Alice’s public key and change amount 
Signature: Alice’s digital signature of the whole transaction 
Notes:  
• The total of inputs should be equal or greater than the total of outputs 
• When total of inputs is greater than total of outputs, the difference is considered as a 
transaction fee

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency operating over a public blockchain network. According to 
Narayanan et al. (2016), the Bitcoin blockchain network comprises many nodes that are 
arbitrarily and partially connected to relay information to each other using the blockchain 
protocol. The Bitcoin blockchain network is a peer-to-peer network that has no hierarchy, no 
centralization, and no master nodes. 
Some full nodes participate in the tasks of validating and relaying transactions in the 
Bitcoin blockchain network (Swan, 2015). Such full nodes are called ‘miners’—a metaphor for 
their quest to compete with each other to build new blocks. Since the Bitcoin protocol allows full 
nodes to share their knowledge about transactions with their neighbors, the network guards 
 19 
against double-spending by validating each new transaction against the list of unspent 
transactions in the ledger (Bjerg, 2016). ‘Miners’ are motivated by two monetary incentives 
described by Narayanan et al. (2016). First, each new valid block conceives a set amount of new 
bitcoins that will belong to the builder of that block. Second, the block builder collects the 
transaction fees of all the transactions included in the block. 
Narayanan et al. (2016) go on to explain this operation of a blockchain network. Before a 
‘miner’ builds a new block, she must find a solution for a hard-to-solve mathematical puzzle. 
This endeavor is referred to as proof of work since it requires spending a significant amount of 
computational power to solve the puzzle. That is the reason, on average, it takes nine minutes to 
generate a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain network. Next, other ‘miners’ verify the integrity 
of the newly-built block and append it to the longest chain. The longest valid chain is considered 
the operational blockchain that the network nodes honor and extend. Honoring and extending the 
longest valid chain is another significant component of the consensus mechanism that allows the 
network to function without a central authority. 
II.5 Chain of Blocks 
How are blocks structured? From a database perspective, the blockchain is a series of 
data blocks that are cryptographically chained together (Mattila, 2016) as each block contains the 
‘hash’—a unique short encryption of the message—of the preceding block, and therefore, it is a 
chain of blocks or a 'blockchain'. A hash function produces an easy to compute, but extremely 
hard to invert fixed-length compact ‘hash’ from a message of arbitrary length (Gilbert & 
Handschuh, 2003). Figure 6 illustrates a high-level schematic of a blockchain ledger or database. 
Since the header of the block contains a ‘hash’ of the data of the current block, and the current 
block contains the hash from the previous block, back to the genesis block, the history of every 
 20 
past block predicates the latest block. The ‘hash-chaining’ of blocks makes it extremely difficult 
to hack a blockchain—as we mentioned earlier, it is hard to solve the mathematical puzzle for a 
single block, let alone to work backward to rebuild many blocks that satisfy the required 
solutions. 
Figure 6: Chain of Blocks in a Bitcoin Blockchain (Narayanan et al., 2016) 
Each Bitcoin block is a collection of transactions in the range of 2000 transactions per 
block. Figure 7 depicts a simplified representation of the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. 
Figure 7: Simplified Blocks of Transaction(Narayanan et al., 2016) 
II.6 Blockchain Categories 
This dissertation adopts the definition of blockchain by Mougayar (2016) as “a 
technology that permanently records transactions in a way that cannot be later erased but can 
only be sequentially updated, in essence keeping a never-ending historical trail.” As such, 
immutability is the defining attribute of blockchains. Therefore, except for immutability, which 
must be present in every blockchain, the rest of the attributes exist at varying degrees (Coletti,

2015; DeRose, 2015; Pilkington, 2015). The key attributes of blockchain technology are 
distributed ledgers, cryptography, consensus mechanisms, and peer-to-peer transmission (Guo & 
Liang, 2016; Tsai et al., 2016). It is, therefore, a meta-technology that integrates several 
technologies to form a gestalt—greater than the sum of its parts (Mougayar, 2016). 
There are different flavors of blockchains with diverse sets of attributes (Pilkington, 
2015) and varying levels of control that define categories of blockchains. Table 5 illustrates a 
typological distinction between the main categories. These different categories provide flexible 
trust-based services (Lindman et al., 2017) as will be further elaborated later. Each blockchain is 
a standalone database with varying levels of access and control. Public blockchains are 
unconditionally accessible by every Internet user (Buterin, 2015; Pilkington, 2015). At the other 
end of the spectrum, access to an entirely private blockchain is controlled by a central locus of 
governance (Buterin, 2015; Pilkington, 2015). In between the public and private dichotomy, 
there is a continuum (Allison, 2015; Brown, 2014; Pilkington, 2015) of permissioned, hybrid, or 
partially decentralized blockchains (Buterin, 2015; Pilkington, 2015).

III APPLICATION: FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS 
Analogous to how the digital wave disrupted the telecommunication industry, blockchain 
technology is emerging as a FinTech paradigm shift (Guo & Liang, 2016) that promises to 
enhance the efficiency of financial transactions and to transform the global financial network 
altogether (de Meijer, 2015). Leaders of the financial industry expect the technology to disrupt 
the sector. A 2016 survey conducted by McKinsey unveils that approximately 50 percent of the 
executives in the financial industry are confident that blockchain technology will have a 
significant impact within three years (Guo & Liang, 2016; McKinsey, 2016). IBM pronounced 
that 66 percent of banks will have a scalable blockchain-based deployment by the year 2020 
(Fortune, 2016; Guo & Liang, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). Such predictions demonstrate that 
change is imminent and may materialize within the next few years. Furthermore, the financial 
industry has already begun to undergo a technological revolution (Accenture, 2015; Kiviat, 
2015). To move from general notions of the impact of blockchain technology on financial 
transactions, we focus on four specific issues that play indispensable roles across financial 
transactions. These are asset verification, record keeping, data privacy, and transaction costs. The 
relevance was explained earlier in Table 1 in relation to the three phases of any transaction 
described by Workie and Jain (2017): 1) the initiation phase, where a client accesses the 
blockchain network to buy or sell financial assets 2) the verification of financial assets in the 
blockchain database by involved intermediaries and stakeholders, and 3) the recording of the 
information into the blockchain ledger. 
In this chapter, ‘transaction costs’ have a broader meaning to include transaction costs 
from Transaction Cost Theory as well as production costs (Dyer, 1997) (Dyer, 1997; Zajac & 
Olsen, 1993. In addition, we touch upon transition costs of moving from current technologies in 
financial transactions to a blockchain-enabled environment. 
 24 
III.1 Asset Verification 
The first activity in trading a financial asset on a blockchain network is to verify specific 
attributes of the asset (Workie & Jain, 2017). The asset verification involves confirming that the 
parties who seek to exchange are the legitimate owners of the corresponding assets (FINRA, 
2017). Ownership according to Stephen Pair, CEO of BitPay, is established when some entity 
recognizes, documents, and defends the rights of someone over an asset (Tapscott & Tapscott, 
2016). As such, blockchain technology can facilitate direct ownership verification by virtue of a 
consensus mechanism (Workie & Jain, 2017) that is already agreed upon by all participants. The 
confirmation of the ownership of the asset in the blockchain network is carried by a single full 
node that constructs the block that encompasses the asset information and is also corroborated by 
other full nodes in the network which continuously verify the validity of every new block and the 
overall veracity of the whole ledger. The strength of the blockchain stems from that fact that no 
single custodian—full node—has control over the entire ledger at any time (Rechtman, 2017). 
Instead, it is akin to a majority rule. The apparent risk here is when a single entity controls over 
50 percent of the custodians of the network (Rechtman, 2017). Whether that is likely or not 
depends on the operational environment. 
The immutability attribute of blockchain data makes it possible to store information 
indefinitely in its database. Subsequently, this elevates the level of trust in the veracity of assets 
information on a blockchain. Furthermore, immutability leads to traceability (Mori, 2016) 
because blockchain contains verifiable timestamped records of every asset ever transacted in 
blockchain (Crosby, Pattanayak, Verma, & Kalyanaraman, 2016). Therefore, by virtue of its 
built-in native audit trail, blockchain technology is readily available to verify assets (Rechtman, 
2017). As such, asset verification becomes viable and possibly more reliable using blockchain 
technology. On the other hand, immutability means that it is not possible—especially in a public 
 25 
blockchain—to fix a mistake pertaining to an asset by editing the database. Instead, one must 
append the corrected representation of the asset in a new block. Therefore, immutability affords 
traceability and reliability; nonetheless, it makes it difficult to fix mistakes and human errors. 
Due to the nature of its distributed ledger, it is arguable that blockchain built-in 
redundancy is helpful in significantly reducing the risk of losing assets information (Rechtman, 
2017). Hence, compared to centralized databases, blockchain is more reliable and fault-tolerant 
because clones of the database—chain or ledger—are maintained by multiple network nodes 
(Mori, 2016). If most of the network nodes go down, the network will continue to verify records 
uninterrupted since the database is available in many other nodes and the consensus mechanism 
is independent of the number of operational full nodes. Nevertheless, redundancy comes with the 
price of taxing resources in terms of storage and processing requirement. 
In any case, a decentralized consensus mechanism requires significant infrastructural and 
operational expenses in areas of communication networks, computation, and storage to operate a 
chatty transactional financial system (Tsai et al., 2016; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 
2016). Moreover, it requires effort to integrate blockchain-based asset verification, at scale, with 
the financial legacy platforms and processes; and to enhance the capabilities of blockchain 
technology to meet the requirements of the financial industry (Tsai et al., 2016). Financial 
systems, for the most part, require high throughput and speed—stock exchanges execute over 
100K transactions per second that may require asset verification; hence, blockchain technology 
must be able to handle these types of loads. Moreover, Tsai et al. (2016) state that since the 
blockchain protocols are executed sequentially, it is difficult to meet the financial industry 
requirements no matter how much computational power is added, especially that blockchain 
network is inherently slow because it is peer-to-peer, which means that each node needs to act 
 26 
both as a client and a server. However, some people such as Mougayar (2016) argue that 
scalability is a moving target that has, historically speaking, been met by technological 
innovations and by the pressure of imminent demand. 
From a compliance point of view, before deploying a blockchain-based network, there 
are several regulatory rules concerning asset verification that broker-dealers need to devise ways 
to comply with. Some of these asset verification requirements are established by FINRA and 
Exchange Act Rules (FINRA, 2017). Furthermore, for a global blockchain covered by 
heterogeneous jurisdictions, the task of asset verification from a regulatory framework is further 
complicated (Mori, 2016). 
III.2 Record Keeping 
Record keeping is to resiliently and accurately preserve past information through time in 
a manner that satisfies involved parties (Witte, 2016)—precisely what blockchain technology 
does by design, and as such, blockchain technology is capable of keeping records (DuPont & 
Maurer, 2015). Furthermore, the technology could have a significant impact on record keeping 
(Kiviat, 2015) since it alters centricity and reshapes governance (Guo & Liang, 2016). Currently, 
financial institutions keep records across disparate databases, unlike a shared blockchain ledger 
which affords a central repository where records are accessible by all participating institutions. 
Guo and Liang (2016) asserts that many of the financial sectors’ problems stem from a) 
poor quality of records needed for assessing individual credit, b) inability to share records, c) 
lack of utilization of external sources of records such as the Internet data, and d) difficulties of 
meeting compliance requirements related to customers’ records such as know your customer 
(KYC). According to Moyano and Ross (2017), the annual costs of KYC due diligence per bank 
is up to 500 million dollars. They further conclude that financial institutions should collaborate 
 27 
among themselves, and other stakeholders, to develop blockchain-based record keeping systems 
to address these weaknesses. Such blockchain networks could be permissioned (private with 
appropriate access control) to allow financial institutions (exchanges, central banks, banks, and 
insurance firms) to enhance reputability, accountability, and controllability (de Meijer, 2015) by 
computationally, efficiently, and seamlessly keep records across the financial value chain 
(Kiviat, 2015). Nonetheless, to achieve this desired vision for record keeping, financial 
institutions need to agree on what records to share, how to contribute to the cost of building and 
maintaining the network, and how to manage access control. 
A record of information stored on a blockchain ledger attains further veracity over time, 
and as such, blockchain technology is well positioned to be the source of truth, the provider of 
accurate records, and ultimately, the platform for trust and record keeping due to its immutability 
attribute and consensus mechanisms (DuPont & Maurer, 2015; Mori, 2016). Consequently, 
blockchain technology can natively, seamlessly, and more transparently afford robust audit trails 
of records of dividend disbursements, ownership details, stock split terms, stock transactions 
timestamps, taxes reports, and compliance reporting requirements (Rechtman, 2017). Therefore, 
blockchain technology is a readily available reporting infrastructure (Workie & Jain, 2017) and 
is impactful to auditing and monitoring (Kiviat, 2015) requirements and practices desired by 
financial institutions and regulatory bodies. To attain this collaborative record keeping interface, 
it would require building the appropriate tools and processes. Additionally, inasmuch as 
blockchain data is immutable and irreversible, the industry must innovate solutions for how to 
address issues that may arise from erroneous human or platform record entries (de Meijer, 2015). 
Furthermore, there need to be considerations of computational resources for maintaining a 
blockchain’s growing ledger (Workie & Jain, 2017) that is redundantly stored in multiple nodes. 
 28 
However, the risk here is likely insignificant grounded on Moore’s law that computing storage 
and Central Processing Units (CPUs) tends to get cheaper and faster, thus allowing cheaper 
record keeping and faster record retrieval. Furthermore, if we envision a future permeated by 
machine-to-machine type of transactions, then when pushing the blockchain technology towards 
the internet of things (IoT) periphery, the current blockchain techniques are generally not 
appropriate since IoT devices work with low computational power and are limited to tiny 
amounts of energy consumption (Atzori, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). 
According to Rechtman (2017), to guard against fraud and errors, financial custodians 
keep records independently, and if a conflict arises between records during reconciliation, then 
the majority win—Figure 8 illustrates the reconciliation process. It is arguable that blockchain’s 
single truth can afford seamless records reconciliation. 
Figure 8: Records Reconciliation (Rechtman, 2017) 
 29 
In late 2015, Nasdaq finalized the first-ever private security record keeping over its 
blockchain, thus leading to a significant reduction of settlement time and the elimination of paper 
stock certification records (Nasdaq, 2015). Some of the financial sectors that could seek to utilize 
blockchain technology to enhance their record keeping practices are a) equity markets, where the 
current process require a slow and manual tracking of records of shares ownership, b) debt 
markets, where the current settlement time is long and involves multiparty, c) repurchase 
agreements, where currently there is risk of settlement failures and lengthy settlement time, d) 
corporate bonds, where blockchain technology could digitize the records of assets and codify the 
necessary calculations, e) derivative market, where records transparency could aid both 
regulators and participants currently struggling to conduct and monitor the intricate post-trade 
records and activities, and f) customer identity management, where a shared blockchain records 
could provide a centralized repository to ease the task (Workie & Jain, 2017). 
Again, there are regulatory requirements that need to be met by a blockchain-based 
deployment vis-à-vis record keeping. For instance, broker-dealers have to comply with 
recordkeeping compliance requirements such as Exchange Act and FINRA rules that mandate 
the minimum length of time for keeping the record, establish the required type of records, and 
detail accessibility to attestations (FINRA, 2017). 
III.3 Data Privacy 
Data privacy is an essential aspect in financial transactions because customers care about 
their data privacy, and consequently, businesses must care as well since it makes good business 
sense to care about the wants of the customers. Besides, financial institutions must comply with 
regulatory mandates around data privacy. We could think about data here to mean two things: a) 
content data that pertains to transactions and the like and b) identity data that provides 
 30 
information about the users of a blockchain network. Furthermore, privacy and transparency are 
two desired outcomes, but sometimes they conflict. While individuals usually care more about 
their privacy than transparency, the collective typically cares more about transparency. 
Blockchain technology can paradoxically and flexibly swing between a continuum of 
high degree of transparency—decentralization of a public blockchain ledger makes the data more 
accessible (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016)—and high level of privacy (Narayanan et al., 2016)—
pseudonymity of users of Bitcoin and similar blockchains is made possible by a lack of a central 
authority that governs the network users as well as by its built-in cryptography. The level of data 
privacy and transparency depends on whether the blockchain network is public, private, or a 
hybrid, in addition to other operational architecture issues—see Table 5. Furthermore, the level 
of transparency is also a function of the how the data is stored in the network since it is possible 
to encrypt the data before sending it to the network. However, if access control is not managed 
well, it can lead to dire consequences (Rechtman, 2017). Besides, although blockchain 
technology could reduce security and privacy risk, it could introduce new issues because of the 
decentralized nature of blockchain network (Workie & Jain, 2017). For example, safeguarding 
private keys is of amplified importance in a public blockchain network. Although stealing private 
keys from a blockchain network user is akin to stealing passwords from users of non-blockchain 
users, the subtle difference is that if a password is forgotten, in decentralized blockchain 
network, it is impossible to retrieve private keys due to the absence of a central authority. 
Some people express concerns that bitcoin and similar blockchains could be used for 
illegal activities encouraged by the anonymity of the users. However, as detailed by Narayanan 
et al. (2016), Bitcoin blockchain is pseudonymous—network identities could be traced to real-
world identities. Also, the culpability of cryptocurrency to criminal activities is not more than 
 31 
cash. Furthermore, since blockchain data is immutable, the fact that there is a permanent trace of 
activities on the ledger could be discouraging to criminals (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). 
Workie and Jain (2017) aver that innovative technologies, when operating in alignment 
with the goal of achieving market integrity and protecting investors, could enhance access, 
efficiency, and transparency. However, they go on to state the need to augment blockchain 
technology with policies that address privacy objectives such as a safeguarding “personally 
identifiable information and trade strategies.” Moreover, they assert that private blockchain 
networks could exclude non-network participants from access to data and, therefore, reduce the 
level of transparency. 
In the views of Guo and Liang (2016), one of the problems facing the financial sector 
stems from the lack of definition of privacy and security terms vis-à-vis ownership of user data. 
It is arguable that the design philosophy of blockchain technology is founded on enabling users 
to control their transactions and their data. Therefore, many blockchain technology advocates 
such as Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) call for shifting towards a society where users are in full 
control of their data. It is not clear if financial institutions will tilt towards the direction of less 
centricity in controlling users’ data. 
The area of user data is further complicated due to regulatory requirements such as KYC, 
Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and customer data protection (FINRA, 2017). Nonetheless, the 
lack of clarity of regulatory and compliance requirements create uncertainty for financial 
institutions when assessing blockchain technology with consideration of privacy and 
transparency requirements. Moreover, since a blockchain network could cross the boundaries of 
multiple jurisdictions, financial institutions must contemplate how to satisfy privacy and 
transparency regulatory requirements in these different jurisdictions. Besides, financial 
 32 
regulators are still comprehending the implications of blockchain technology (Kiviat, 2015). For 
example, the definition of finality in current settlements is radically different from the protocol-
based consensus mechanism in blockchain networks (Mori, 2016). 
III.4 Transaction Costs 
Past technological advancements had conceived substitutes that consequently intensified 
the degree of competition. For instance, Internet financial products have encroached upon the 
market share of traditional financial institutions (Guo & Liang, 2016). In order to survive and 
meet ever-increasing customer’s demands, the financial sector must continuously innovate (Guo 
& Liang, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016) and attenuate transaction costs (Zhao et al., 2016) through the 
deployment of new technologies. Hence, blockchain technology has been touted as the 
innovation engine for financial areas such as clearing and settlement, payment systems, 
operational risks, and insurance (de Meijer, 2015; Kakavand & Kost De Sevres, 2016; Peters & 
Panayi, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). 
Currently, interbank payments often pass through intermediary clearing houses where 
they get scrutinized through complicated, time-consuming, and expensive processes (Guo & 
Liang, 2016). The technology, according to de Meijer (2015) may reduce the cost of transactions 
and increase their speed in the areas of business-to-business payments and peer-to-peer 
remittance market; and could help in reducing the cost of the securities sector embodied by 
exchanges and traditional banks. Nonetheless, from an implementation perspective, Workie and 
Jain (2017) state that blockchain technology players, rightfully, focus on discrete applications 
that target current pain points of significant inefficiencies with a vision of implement the 
solutions gradually rather than adopting wholesale changes. A somewhat related point is made 
 33 
by Mougayar (2016) who avers that it is easier to adopt decentralization from scratch versus 
from centralized systems. 
Although blockchain technology could allow long-term cost reduction, in the short term 
some upfront expenditure is required to develop a blockchain-based infrastructure. Taking the 
payment sector as a major candidate for innovation through blockchain technology, in the year 
2013 and 2014, 5.4 billion dollars was invested in FinTech innovation (Kiviat, 2015) with the 
anticipation that blockchain technology could revolutionize the infrastructure and lead to new 
business models (de Meijer, 2015; Lindman et al., 2017) that could consequently generate more 
value and save cost. According to a 2016 World Economic Forum report, the investment in 
exploring financial applications of blockchain technology exceeded 1.5 billion dollars (Workie & 
Jain, 2017). 
In addition to the payment and clearing area, the technology could decrease transaction 
costs related to credit information (Guo & Liang, 2016) and significantly reduce the amount of 
time of settlement (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016) enabling near real-time settlement due to its 
network-based consensus mechanism, resulting in saving days of delay. However, the adoption 
of blockchain real-time settlement would require a departure from established procedures for 
lending and borrowing securities and the practice of conducting trades when the market is open 
during specific hours of the day (Mori, 2016). Blockchain technology could automate the back 
office operations in the area of clearing and settlement, and decrease the transaction costs related 
to authentication of trading records by making them transparent to all participating parties (de 
Meijer, 2015). Another target area of transaction costs reduction through the deployment of 
blockchain technology is private equity exchange. To exemplify, NASDAQ established a startup 
called chain.com to furnish a blockchain-based platform for private equity exchanges (Crosby et 
 34 
al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). One of IBM’s goals is to utilize blockchain technology in order to 
reduce coordination costs in capital markets and to streamline settlements in derivatives markets 
(Coindesk, 2017b). In supply-chain finance, blockchain technology could reduce costs of 
financing by automating manual processes and attenuating legal risks through smart contracts 
(Guo & Liang, 2016). 
McKinsey estimates that blockchain technology could a) reduce the cost of a cross-border 
transaction from 26 dollars to 15 dollars, b) lower the annual operational costs by as much as 15 
billion dollars, and c) reduce the annual cost of risk by as much as 1.6 billion dollars (Guo & 
Liang, 2016). A FinTech report estimates that blockchain technology will allow banks to save as 
much as twenty billion dollars in areas of cross-border payments, securities trading, and 
regulatory compliance (Mori, 2016; Oliver Wyman, Anthemis Group, & Santander Innoventures, 
2015). 
Some researchers suggest that the deployment of blockchain technology alone will not 
lead to significant reduction is transaction costs. For instance, Mori (2016) asserts that 80 percent 
of the challenges in the financial industry are attributed to business models and processes, and 
only 20 percent are attributable to technological hurdles. That means introducing blockchain 
technology alone is not enough. To be effective, such efforts must be coupled with fundamental 
changes of established process and business models. 
Blockchain technology could potentially permeate all sectors of the financial industry. Its 
impact will include private securities, insurance, Internet finance, and other financial sectors 
(Wang, Chen, & Xu, 2016). However, in accordance with systems development best practices, 
Tsai et al. (2016) suggest deploying blockchain features in modular and insular forms, with each 
module targeting a specific functionality such as accounting, or trading, but not both. 
 35 
Furthermore, the value of centralization itself should be carefully assessed as stressed by 
Auctus_Team (2017) who warns against forcing blockchain technology as a substitute for 
addressing problems that traditional centralized databases can solve sufficiently well. 
  
 36 
IV PERSPECTIVE: STAKEHOLDER VIEWS 
As one of the three pillars of the dissertation pluralist methodology, we have interviewed 
sixteen participants with expertise in blockchain technology and the financial industry. The 
views of the stakeholders augment the literature review presented above, and both chapters will 
be analyzed later through the lens of transaction cost theory. Six of the participants held 
executive roles in financial institutions, five were researchers, and five were subject matter 
experts. The diversity of views provided a number of opportunities, challenges, and 
recommendations regarding blockchain technology and its impact on financial transactions. In 
this chapter, we synthesize the participants’ perspectives with a focus on asset verification, 
record keeping, data privacy, and transaction costs. The views are grouped into four areas: 
transaction issue, technological issues, regulatory issues, and adoption issues. As mentioned 
earlier, in this chapter ‘transaction costs’ have a broader meaning to include transaction costs in 
the sense of Transaction Cost Theory as well as production costs (Dyer, 1997; Zajac & Olsen, 
1993); in addition, we touch upon transition costs of moving from current technologies to a 
blockchain-enabled environment. 
IV.1 Transaction Issues 
Participants agreed that financial services are based on trust. Hence, when a transaction 
transpires between two parties, the financial intermediary verifies the asset, records the 
transaction, and ensures that both parties are served satisfactorily: “When buying shares, 
financial institutions guarantee delivery of those shares and the agreed upon payment to the 
corresponding parties. Even if one party defaults, financial institutions absorb that risk by 
delivering to the other party.” Consequently, the intermediary financial institution charges a 
commission for the service. The above scenario exemplifies the type of trust-based service 
 37 
blockchain technology will have to deliver if it were to play a role in asset verification and 
record keeping. 
“Visa today takes 3% of the transaction fee if you pay at a Walmart. Inherently, Walmart 
will include that in the price since most of the transactions are credit card based,” said one of 
the participants. Financial institutions also incur high costs when they go through intermediaries: 
“Clearinghouses trade trillions of dollars daily. They charge a commission for each transaction. 
Although it is an extremely tiny commission, with millions and millions of transactions, banks 
have to pay substantial amounts.” Blockchain technology could afford opportunities to attenuate 
these types of costs. Current financial institutions have been closely linked to central banks, 
partially for regulatory purposes. Stock exchanges, brokers, and banks participate in assets 
verification and record keeping in a manner that is inefficient as it takes a long time and uses 
significant human resources. Some participants believed that blockchain technology would 
reduce transaction costs: “You have to stitch so many different things and pour millions of 
dollars. If you have blockchain architecture, this cost will drastically reduce, because everything 
is connected.” Another participant advocated using blockchain technology as a means “to 
support transactions across geographical distances without a very heavyweight institutional 
arrangement.” Nevertheless, others see the phenomenon as “full of hype and euphoria with real 
potential for only a few use cases.” Along similar lines, a financial executive participant stated 
that “blockchain technology opportunities are limited because of the way the whole asset 
industry is structured right now. Change is not happening, it would require quite a bit.” 
Nonetheless, the majority of participants believed that blockchain technology will further elevate 
that level of network-based trust and furnish a better platform for verifying assets, keeping 
records, protecting data privacy, and reducing transaction costs: “Blockchain technology can 
 38 
codify something of value and assign it a proof of authorship or a proof of ownership, and that 
becomes a digitally codified asset. Which when put on the blockchain will be immutable, 
meaning everybody can publicly verify it via a search and authenticate who owns it, at a specific 
timestamp.” Given that it could be shared publicly, at a much lower transaction cost than we do 
today.” Another participant expressed the current issue with transaction costs as follows: “Today 
in banking for example, if you own a credit card, if you pay merchandise from Walmart, the 
payment has to process through a number of channels, first of all, the card issuer: e.g., Bank of 
America. Also, the transaction has to pass through different payment networks such as Master 
Card.” 
A few of the participants pointed out that, in some regards, we now trust computers more 
than people as exemplified by Uber: “I will get in a car with somebody in the middle of the night 
that I have never met before. Still, I completely trust that the Uber driver has been vetted well 
enough by the network.” Blockchain exemplifies such networks that are capable of asset 
verification and record keeping concerning reputational data. However, like every newly 
introduced technology, blockchain is not fully charted waters as expressed by one of the 
participants: “It is so fascinating, and we still do not understand it. We still do not understand 
some of the negative.” 
Some participants compared the inevitability of the permeation of blockchain-based 
financial transactions to what some countries in Africa and South-East Asia have done regarding 
cellular technologies as “they leapfrogged western economies such as the USA or Canada. I 
could send money from one person to another person, in Kenya five years back. The USA is now 
trying it out. Now all the banks are doing it.” Hence, it is quite possible to leapfrog with 
blockchain technology, not hindered by all the regulations or all the legacy technologies. For that 
 39 
reason, “some of the venture capitalists think the next Apple or Google will come from the 
blockchain world.” Nonetheless, some participants posited that just like the Internet promised to 
decentralize and ended up moving in a different direction, blockchain technology will not deliver 
on all its promises. For example, the current transaction fee structure in a Bitcoin and similar 
blockchains has not fulfilled its promises of allowing microtransactions at low cost. Moreover, 
the quest of decentralization itself could prove to be elusive “It is frequently the case in human 
history that people think that anarchy is a good idea, but it turns out that every time that power 
is put in the hands of people, we end up coalescing into some centralization.” Blockchain mining 
pools is an example of how we are trending towards centralization as time passes. 
Many participants saw inadequacy in the number of transactions per second—
throughput—despite some promising consensus-based mechanisms. Therefore, they suggested 
that the technology is not ready for prime time for financial transactions. In the USA some banks 
have 35 million customers or more. In China or India, some banks have over 100 million 
customers. It is a daunting task for a blockchain to handle that type of volume in real or semi-
real-time: “Imagine, you are at a cashier, and instead of only Visa approving your transaction, 
every participant has to approve it, verify its authenticity, and get to unanimity.” Those are the 
type of challenges that need to be overcome computationally before blockchain technology could 
be adopted widely. Developers have to come up with algorithms that meets current processing 
standards because “when customers go to Walmart, they have expectations that their cards will 
be approved in less than 30 secs.” Contrarily, one of the participants pointed out that although 
instantaneously processed, Visa and similar settlements take several days in the backend. 
Payments fall into two buckets. The first bucket is consumer payments which are person 
to person, person to commercial, commercial to commercial, and commercial to person. The 
 40 
second bucket is treasury payments, and that is bank to bank. The payment sector uses the 
SWIFT (Society for the Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) platform to carry 
interbank payment instructions. In the SWIFT network one bank could connect directly to 
another bank, or the case could be it must go through an intermediate bank to exchange the 
payment information with another bank. No one bank is connected to all the banks. Those 
intermediaries collect transaction fees. Going through the SWIFT hob is essential since 
regulations mandate banks to know who is on the other end of the transaction. Nevertheless, 
treasury payments are not slow because of the speed of SWIFT. The speed issue could be due to 
banks holding on payments to check certain things. To resolve these issues, SWIFT is being 
replaced by a new platform called SWIFT GPI (Global Payment Innovation). SWIFT GPI is an 
improvement over SWIFT since it mandates filling some of the payment fields such as the tax 
rates. Moreover, participating SWIFT GPI banks must meet certain service level agreements. 
Against this backdrop, participants in payments sector had no high anticipations from blockchain 
technology in the treasury payments area since SWIFT GPI is resolving speed and transparency 
issues. Additionally, the issue with speed concerning treasury payments is not technological but 
a liquidity issue: “It is bit of a falsehood to think money is flowing all the time, because unless 
value passes from one place to another” via central banks, “it does not really happen. The 
limitation is business days and time zones. Commercial banks are governed by their central 
banks and central banks close. That is a critical component to how fast you can go when you go 
around to the other side of the planet.” 
It is not straightforward to compare the costs of transactions that are blockchain-based 
versus those that are not. For example, factors that contribute to a transaction costs stemming 
from a Visa payment are radically different compared to a cryptocurrency payment—
 41 
computational energy, fees, and so on. Therefore, “transaction costs should be viewed on a use 
case basis and cannot be generalized.” Moreover, use cases differ. For example, “if it takes me X 
amount of dollars to send one bitcoin from one party to the other, that is different from 
transacting a bond. When you start looking at it that way, you also have to look at matching 
architectures.” Asset verification and record reconciliation are not simple, and according to a 
participating financial executive, this is where blockchain technology could make a difference: 
“Let us take Apple shares for example. At any point in time, we need to know who has assets or 
equity in Apple because we need to have the correct info to be able to pay dividends, taxes, tax 
rates, etc. Keeping track of that is very tricky. Therefore, reconciliation is very complex, and 
something takes long. That is where blockchain technology might make a difference.” 
Some participants advocated using blockchain technology for internal operations 
concerning record keeping, asset verification, and data privacy protection: “It does not have to be 
a public or peer-to-peer in the consumer sense. They can use blockchain technology just within 
their ecosystem and start using distributed computing as the way to securely store private 
information.” For example, record keeping, and asset verification processes could indeed take 
advantage of blockchain technology: “hedge funds try to verify assets. They use excel sheets. 
Many things are messed up.” On the other hand, some participants argued that blockchain 
technology is more effective in attenuation transaction costs in large multiparty context: 
“Blockchain technology brings down transaction costs for large multiparty transactions where 
many institutions and people come together such as stock exchanges and the DTCC. For internal 
system concerned with record keeping, inventory management, and the like, there has not been 
much blockchain-based application development.”  
 42 
Potentially, blockchain technology could introduce a massive change regarding how we 
would interact with capital markets: “The way to raise capital today is either you through 
investment banks as a company or through private placements with institutional investors. 
Tomorrow it is going to be a blockchain environment.” Another participant echoed views along 
the same lines: “In the USA alone, only 55% of the people have access to the stock market, and 
these types of new technologies are going to socialize finance.” 
Before applying blockchain technology to enhance asset verification, record keeping, 
data privacy, or transaction costs, it must prove its advantage over established technologies: “You 
use blockchain technology in a use case that is very centralized. Besides, if your system does not 
require any trust because it is a single company, then you probably do not need blockchain 
technology.” Finally, one of the participants stressed the need to objectively contemplate the 
dichotomy of centralization versus decentralization without taking sides. “I listened to Vitalic 
Buterin—the founder of Ethereum—and he realizes that there is just as many good people and 
just as many bad people in both the cryptocurrency world and the banking industry.” Table 6 
highlights the summary of this section.

IV.2 Technological Issues 
“Most processes are semi-manual, and therefore the sector is looking for ways to 
optimize, automate, streamline, and make transactions faster while maintaining the same level of 
security,” said one of the financial executives while stressing that it is becoming increasingly 
difficult to generate satisfactory profit. Most participants believed that blockchain technology 
could play a major role in improving the processing of financial transactions. According to one 
of the participants, some studies show if blockchain technology is used as an infrastructure, 
transaction cost will decrease anywhere between 25 and 75 percent. However, a few participants 
stated that blockchain technology is meager as architecture or that “it is hype more than better 
technology.” Moreover, financial transaction systems are not just a single system that could be

simply replaced by a blockchain-based system. They are multiple interconnected systems. 
Consequently, one of the participants posited that “there would not be a chance for a disrupter to 
come and change the way things are set up. Few people would even understand what we do.” 
An executive from the insurance sector described a use case which illustrates how 
blockchain technology is being implemented to enable asset verification, record keeping, data 
privacy and transaction costs attenuation: Today when two people get into an auto accident with 
each other, their proof of insurance is paper insurance cards. The coverage could have been 
canceled. To improve the process of proof of insurance, “we developed a plugin that goes into 
Geico’s or Allstate’s mobile APP.” To exchange insurance information, the two people tap their 
phones together to access “the policy blockchain to get verification of current coverages.” 
Moreover, in the future, authorities could get a feed from the state department of motor vehicles 
of licensed motorist and compare that to that policy blockchain and be able to identify uninsured 
motorist proactively. The policy blockchain is a private blockchain “accessible by participating 
insurance carriers, insurance distribution firms, and brokers.” It uses ‘proof of authority’ as a 
consensus mechanism—the level of access is based on the user’s identity. When the two drivers 
tap their phones together, they get a temporary access to each other’s data. Although the ledger is 
distributed, some of the data is hashed such that participating institutions can only see what they 
want each other to see. Blockchain technology allows different degrees of so-called zero-
knowledge proof, whereby one can, for instance, prove she had a private data at an earlier time 
without revealing its content. For instance, “if I want to confidentially prove that I have the idea 
on a certain date, I would hash it and put the hash on the blockchain. Later, if someone says I 
have the idea, I can prove that I had the idea by showing its timestamped hash on the blockchain, 
and ‘unhash’ it with my public key.” 
 45 
There will always be cryptography researchers working on developing better encryption 
methods. Contrarily, there will always be cryptography researchers looking for ways to break 
encryption. Part of that is driven by the tension between privacy and transparency where, for 
instance, the government believes that it has good intentions when finding ways to break the 
current methods of encryption: “Government wants to have more visibility, and citizens often 
want more privacy. That ongoing is not just related to blockchain technology.” Additionally, 
hackers also play a role in breaking cryptography, and consequently, push researchers to find 
stronger cryptography schemes: “There is no model that humans can build that has perfect 
encryption. Also, in the next 50-100 years, we might see quantum computers that will break all 
methods of encryption we currently have. With the advent of AI (Artificial Intelligence), there 
might be better encryption built with AI. Nevertheless, there could also be better ways to break 
the cryptography by AI.” When someone breaks a hash function, we stop using it and come up 
with a stronger one. Breaking a hash function does not mean that hashed data could be inverted. 
Even after a hash function is ‘broken’ it is still useful for checking data integrity. It is almost not 
possible to recreate the original piece of data. Hence, breaking a hash function is not a danger to 
privacy or the data integrity. However, “we run the risk of the hash losing its proof of prior 
knowledge of something” as we have explained above. 
Another intriguing area related to privacy is identity. There are personal identity data and 
user-generated data. Many participating subject matter experts believed that blockchain 
technology allows users to control the use of their data: “Self- sovereign identity means if it is my 
identity, I should be empowered to share it with whomever I want, whenever I want, but only 
limited to whomever I want. The government can attest to my identity and can authenticate it but 
at the end of the day it is my identity.” 
 46 
Especially with public blockchains, another security issue is “the risk of losing 
passwords” or private keys since no central authority exists to allow retrieval of private keys. As 
such, backing up and storing private keys is crucial. Doing so, however, might compromise these 
private keys. When implementing blockchain technology, in addition to the costs of building up 
the blockchain network and employing blockchain technology experts, there are also security 
costs. It is not clear if blockchain technology security costs are higher than with current systems: 
“Currently they have to safeguard the database. So, they are facing similar issues. However, 
with blockchain technology, cybersecurity may be of a different nature. People cannot take over 
the blockchain, but if they can steal your keys, they can wreak havoc.” Blockchain by itself is 
phenomenally secure, is hard to hack, and even if someone manages to get closer to that, the 
system can upgrade to a different cryptographic protocol and keep it more secure: “Breaking in 
the blockchain is very remote. I do not foresee that happening in the near future. All the stories 
about someone stealing Bitcoins or hacking Ethereum are because of bad coding or bad ways of 
saving private keys.” 
All participants agreed that scalability is a significant technical challenge. Therefore, 
although we have touched on scalability in previous sections, we will treat it here for further 
details. Blockchain is “centralized and fully decentralized at the same time. Therefore, it takes 
long to validate transactions since it has to be one truth and it has to be distributed so that 
everybody has access to it at the same time.” It is not easy for an entire large network, through a 
censuses mechanism, to agree to a single record. That is one of the reasons it is difficult to 
achieve high throughput. Nonetheless, “there are several proposals to increase that.” For 
example, Bitcoin is testing a proposal called ‘lightning’ where transactions could be verified on 
‘sidechains’ and bundled together then pushed to the main blockchain as a single record. In 
 47 
addition to the speed issue, blockchain networks that use proof of work type of consensus 
mechanisms require much energy consumption. Nevertheless, “there are many other 
mechanisms such as ‘proof of stake’ that are faster and more energy friendly.” For private 
blockchains, scalability is less of an issue since the networks are smaller. Another challenge with 
scalability is the sheer size of the blockchain. Blockchain is sequential: “When you have a huge 
number of transactions every second, then the size of blockchain can grow to become 
unmanageable.” That also results in “fewer people being willing to store the entire blockchain,” 
thereby weakening some of the advantages of decentralization. Ethereum has a proposal called 
‘Plasma’ with the idea of storing only part of the blockchain. Of course, there must be a way to 
access the full history when needed. Furthermore, some of the participants reasoned that space is 
“not a big issue because we have already seen solutions in the past such as light nodes that do 
not need to store the full blockchain."" Besides, “memory and hard disk space are cheap these 
days.” From a strategic scalability perspective, “it is hard to be aware of all the different flavors 
of blockchains in an arms race to see who can provide better features.” 
The blockchain ledger could accept unstructured data which could pose a technical 
challenge since bad data could go in without governing rules. In a structured database, “there are 
some rules codified in the database, which make sure that the data that goes in is pure and 
pristine. Blockchain has no such rules.” The issue is especially concerning when considering the 
immutability nature of blockchain records: “In a public blockchain it is hard to go back and 
modify the record because one has to get agreement from everyone.” That is precisely what 
happened when Ethereum had to split into ‘Ethereum Classic’ and ‘Ethereum’ since people 
could not agree on whether to rectify the record or not after a hacking incident. In a permissioned 
blockchain, it could be manageable for participating parties to agree to modify the record. 
 48 
Notwithstanding that challenge, this dissertation adopts the core definition of blockchain as 
being immutable. Immutability, on the one hand, is an advantage because nothing is ever lost. 
On the other hand, as we mentioned earlier, it taxes the network computational resources. Many 
of the participants advocated storing data into the blockchain ledger only when there is a need for 
immutability and keeping the rest in a different database that could be accessible by the 
blockchain network. Some of the participants went further to express reservations regarding 
using blockchain as a database: “Many people try to turn it into a database. Blockchain should 
not be used as a database, is not made to be one, and is not very good one if you try to use it that 
way.” Using blockchain as a database is “basically wasting space.” 
A best practice adopted by a consortium led by one of the participants was to build a 
reusable blockchain framework that can “accelerate the building of applications on top of this 
framework.” Leaders of a consultancy recommended staying platform agnostic: “We see 
advantages in being platform agnostic and have the choice between all different platforms. We 
believe that there are use cases for every one of them.” Each blockchain platform has its 
technical advantages and disadvantages. For example, Ethereum is suitable for smart contracts 
while Ripple is a better fit for payments. As such, a participant who led a consortium averred that 
building an interoperability layer is vital: “One of the things that we have built into our 
blockchain framework, and again this is very bleeding edge, is an interoperability layer.”

IV.3 Regulatory Issues 
Since it deals with public money, the financial sector is “one of the most regulated 
industries in the USA.” Regulations are essential to protect the public from being subject to 
misguidance, robbery, “Ponzi schemes,” and other types of mischiefs. Although blockchain can 
be used to bypass regulations and intermediary financial institutions, participants argued that no 
matter how the technology is developed, it “will end up landing somewhere in a jurisdiction”

Some laws will be federal, and others will be state laws: “In the European Union (EU), there will 
be federal laws at the EU level, and there will be laws specific to each country.” As such, 
blockchain technology will be regulated like other financial services technologies where 
regulations vary greatly from country to country with “some common denominators to account 
for global concerns such as KYC and AML.” Regulating blockchain technology could, therefore, 
be challenging and “confusing because the beauty of decentralized networks is not having 
borders, although we still have borders and live in physical places. There are rules and taxes 
that we cannot just end on a dime.” In any way, some of the participants cautioned against 
overregulation: “Overregulation is not good because it stifles innovation.” 
The technology is still new and evolving making it difficult for the regulators to have a 
good grasp of how it works: “The problem is that the regulators themselves do not understand 
how cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology works. This is a new and evolving technology.” 
From a regulatory point of view, there are two schools of thoughts: the first advocates pushing 
new laws right now; the second advocates waiting and monitoring patiently to see what type of 
new laws will be required. Which school of thought prevails “depends on what the technology 
ends up facilitating.” It also depends on if ‘catastrophic’ events transpire as exemplified by one 
of the participants: “It is only a matter of time. In 2008 banks went bankrupt. The regulations 
were missing certain areas that caused the collapse of the banks. Then the government bailed out 
the banks causing a massive loss for the economy. It took more than ten years to recover.” 
Hence, right now the regulators ought to start thinking how to regulate blockchain technology 
and in what form without crippling innovation. A US-based participant argued that the state of 
regulatory uncertainty is hurting the growth of blockchain technology: “The largest problem is 
the regulatory framework. The USA is behind. Uncertainty is hurting blockchain technology. 
 51 
Only 12% to 18% ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is based in the USA. The country waited for too 
long.” Nonetheless, some participants expected regulations to solidify in the coming one or two 
years: “In the range of a one or two-year timeframe we could expect to see some regulatory 
guidance and control in place.” 
Current regulations have been tailored for a “financial ecosystem that we have developed 
over the past 100 to 200 years.” The regulatory framework will have to adapt to the new 
financial practices we are creating. Regulations typically lag innovation: “Regulations are 
always two phases lagging behind the maturity of the technology.” Moreover, regulations take 
time: “There are many approvals required, notices of proposed rule meeting—meaning making 
regulations based on feedback from the industry—or passing bills such as the Dodd-Frank Act.” 
Still, in some blockchain-related areas, we already have some regulations: “There are pockets of 
cryptocurrency or blockchain technology where there are regulations right now.” For instance, 
Bitcoin futures are now listed on Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of 
Exchange—both are well respected financial institutions that are regulated by the Commodity 
Future Trading Commission. 
When asked whether incumbents or startups will spearhead blockchain technology, 
executives in the financial industry answered in favor of the former. They reasoned based on 
regulations: “Regulatory requirements are the biggest hurdle for a blockchain-based alternative 
provider to be a disruptor and start offering services as we do.” Incumbents already adhere to a 
comprehensive set of regulatory and compliance requirements. As such, their answer implicitly 
averred that blockchain-based services would be heavily regulated. One of the participants 
illustrated the challenge facing new entrants as follows: “Google or Amazon tried to develop 
their own bank. Their CEO admitted that it was more complicated than they thought it would be. 
 52 
That was just plain vanilla capital banking or commercial banking. I do not think they could 
venture into corporate banking, investment banking, the whole payment industry, or securities.” 
Financial institutions spend a large part of their budget on compliance. Some participants 
stated that compliance costs are by far the primary cost factor: “We spend more money and time 
on people who look after compliance than we spend on people who serve clients.” As such, 
blockchain technology could potentially attenuate the compliance-related processes, and 
therefore, significantly reduce financial transaction costs. The idea is to store customer’s 
information into a shared blockchain ledger instead of each financial institution vetting every 
customer on their own: “Blockchain technology is a fantastic way to comply with KYC. All you 
have to do is to put the data on the blockchain, and anyone can use an App to verify.” Of course, 
this should be done in compliance with regulations governing customer data privacy. 
Blockchain technology can be used for positive and negative purposes. Some participants 
expressed concerns about using its cryptocurrency for illicit activities such as “drug trafficking, 
arms smuggling, or any illegal activity such as requesting ransom payments.” At some point in 
time “China banned Bitcoin. Banning is not a solution, but you need to have effective controls to 
avoid illegal activities.” North Korea, given the type of scrutiny put on its transactions, is 
allegedly channeling money through Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Hence, the recent 
appreciation of cryptocurrency is partially attributed to higher demand generated by North Korea 
and the like. 
When computers and the Internet sprung into existence, there was a need for some 
regulatory arrangements to allow authorities to snoop on suspects’ hard disks and online 
activities to check for illicit activities such as child pornography and terrorism. There might be 
“a need for some extra sort of blockchain sensors” to achieve similar objectives. In any case, the 
 53 
nature of privacy-related regulations “will vary greatly from country to country, from Estonia 
where everything is on blockchain, to countries where they will take many years before doing 
anything.” 
Blockchain technology could challenge some of the established data privacy norms. For 
instance, today, in the USA, three credit bureaus have the oligopoly on credit scores of people: 
Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If the USA has something like Lithuania’s identity 
management blockchain, anybody can check out credit scores and other details. That will be a 
significant change to how asset and record verification are conducted. Furthermore, the presence 
of blockchain technology could surface some renewed regulatory questions: “Who authorized 
Equifax to collect data on me?” Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion are not governmental 
entities; they are private companies. What are the users’ rights “regarding Equifax securing their 
identity?” “Who authorized Equifax to share their data?” and “What do they gain from Equifax 
sharing their data?” Users may gain access to services by virtue of their identity information 
being shared. However, there are no direct monetary benefits to the user. Hence, blockchain 
technology can alter the landscape of credit rating agencies: “People can even obtain a return 
from their data. That would affect the business model of credit rating agencies and may reduce 
their profits. They might even cease to exist.” 
One of the participants explained the regulatory framework surrounding blockchain-
based financial transactions as follows: “Mycelium is a smartphone App that taps into Bitcoin 
blockchain.” A person could be living anywhere in the world and be able to send and receive 
money to anyone anywhere. Having Mycelium is akin to having a global bank account “without 
having to go to a place and give my photo ID or registration. I just downloaded the app.” That 
puts a different burden on regulators since today, “regulators are used to work through the 
 54 
banks.” As such, regulators have shifted the burden of enforcing the prohibition of activities such 
as money laundering to the banks. The authorities just audit the bank’s ledger. With the presence 
of Mycelium, the regulators must pivot, change, and adapt to a different way of looking at 
transactions. Hence, KYC is no more like a person going into a place giving her identification 
card. KYC in the future “will mean who is downloading the information? What is the serial 
number of the device? To whom is the device registered?” There will be an expanded network of 
things coupled with a rich web of activities that the authorities could tap into to know the 
customer. The authorities will have to crawl these different pieces of information and stitch them 
together to get a reasonable picture of the customer. 
Nivaura, a UK-based company, “just a few weeks ago issued the first regulated bond in 
collaboration with the British regulator.” Nivaura resolved the technical aspects and engaged the 
regulator to agree to two things: 1) this is a financial instrument that lives in a public blockchain, 
and 2) it is a legal instrument, meaning that parties involved in the transaction have legal 
obligations they must adhere to (if not, one party could drag the other into the court of law). This 
is an illustrative “example of innovative companies engaging with regulators to expand the 
regulations in a way that makes sense in this blockchain real world” related to asset verification, 
and record keeping. A different example refers to the ‘proof of insurance’ example detailed 
earlier. In this case, the road had already been paved from a regulatory standpoint since every 
state in the USA had already agreed to honor electronic verification of proof of insurance. 
Notwithstanding other use cases could summon more restrictive requirements from regulators, 
especially with regards to data privacy, asset verification, and record keeping.  
Finally, blockchain technology could offer a collaborative platform that is also helpful to 
authorities in terms of streamlining the reports required by the regulators from financial 
 55 
institutions: “It is a big arduous task for them to gather that information across various back 
office systems. If you have the information on the blockchain, you could very easily create a use 
case to do all that regulatory reporting very quickly and cut out many working hours required 
for that.” Table 8 summarizes the perceptions of the industry stakeholders on regulatory issues 
concerning the impact of blockchain technology on financial transactions. 
Table 8: Industry Perceptions of Regulatory Issues 
IV.4 Adoption Issues 
The current financial ecosystem operates based on well-established processes and 
methods of transaction. With the introduction of blockchain technology, we can transact, verify 
assets, keep records, and protect data in a decentralized fashion with fewer intermediaries and 
fewer loci of control, thus, enabling a consumer-to-consumer web of transactions. Nonetheless, 
some participants questioned some of the core value propositions of blockchain: “To say you 
have a private blockchain, why even have a blockchain? Why not just have encrypted hard 
drives?” Other participants countered: “Who will maintain the common central database? You

have several banks, and each has its own interests. A central party, such as a stock exchange, 
will have monopoly power and will charge other parties. Blockchain technology allows 
decentralized environment management without relying on a central party.” Depending on how 
compelling the new technology is, the availability of resolutions of some of the challenges, and 
the degree of willingness to embrace, the financial transactions ecosystem might adopt the 
emerging technology at varying rates and degrees or might reject it all together. One of the 
participants averred: “The current ecosystem is not sophisticated enough to fully disintermediate. 
It may take 10 to 20 years to get there. Will there be a pure peer-to-peer transaction? That 
depends on the use cases and the relative value it creates.” 
The RiskBlock is an insurance consortium. They use a social concept called ‘proof of 
collaboration’ to encourage and monitor the effectiveness of blockchains shared among a number 
of highly competitive insurance companies that are typically cautious about how much 
information they share with each other and how much they work together: “One of the first 
hurdles that we had was to be able to prove that these competitors could come together on these 
various solutions and work together.” Regardless of the quality of the underlying solution, a 
shared blockchain would not be useful if participating parties are not willing to work together: 
“It does not matter how good the proof of insurance is if it is one-sided.” From a data privacy 
perspective, the starting point is public blockchain where everyone can see all the data records, 
although they may not see the identities of who are conducting the transactions. However, 
financial institutions do not want all their data to be public: “Some of them are legally bound 
from disclosing all their data.” Even if the data is encrypted, there is a risk that “someone could 
break the cryptography or reverse engineer the data.” The successful adoption of the RiskBlock 
for asset verification, record keeping, and data privacy protection is driven by the demonstration 
 57 
of immediate benefits to the participating parties such as “reduced cost, enhanced efficiencies, 
customer service improvement, and greater revenue.” As such, consortiums must focus on 
bringing true production value to their members: “Our motto is 'no science experiments' such as 
proof of concepts and standalone projects that never make it into production."" 
“No organization wants to be a dinosaur when significant changes transpire,” said one of 
the participants. Large financial service providers are, therefore, exploring blockchain 
technology by typically building pilot projects on top of the Ethereum public blockchain 
platform where implementations may be private, or may utilize some other framework such as 
Hyperledger—an open source blockchain technology development consortium. Many financial 
institutions have their in-house research teams. For instance, Bank of America, one of the biggest 
banks in the USA, has already filed for more than twenty-five patents in the area of blockchain 
technology. A participating financial executive stated that incubating blockchain technology 
projects is inevitable because “I fear that something might come along with blockchain 
technology that I did not see, and I lose positioning.” Another participant echoed views along 
marketing lines: “Every bank in London has blockchain technology projects, mostly so they can 
just say they have one.” Even technology giants such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle offer 
various implementations of the technology. However, many of the implementations are 
exploratory in nature: “Blockchain technology projects are fairly small-scale operations, and for 
the most part it is more about trying to figure it out.” Financial institutions are hesitant to spend 
heavily or build their own new private network within their organizations since: “CTOs, CIOs, 
and CFOs are waiting until blockchain technology is mature before they spend the money.” 
Nevertheless, there are high anticipations of growth: “I envision that in the next couple of years, 
 58 
the growth will speed up, and people who initially doubted blockchain technology will realize its 
potential.” 
Some sectors are more advanced in their roadmap than others: “The Australian stock 
exchange is going to move all their settlement on blockchain making it much more efficient. The 
verification will depend on cryptography. The transaction will ensue instantly.” The participant 
continued: “Traditional financial transactions such as stocks and bonds will still take place on 
established stock exchanges such as Nasdaq or NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), but they 
might move their settlement to a blockchain.” Senegal and Tunisia already have their currencies 
on blockchain. Singapore and China are thinking about coming up with national digital 
currencies “because of the transaction cost. It will boost the GDP by 3 to 4 percent just by 
replacing 30 to 40 percent of the national currency with cryptocurrency due to the reduction of 
friction.” 
Blockchain-based startups will force incumbents to reduce transaction costs: “Visa and 
MasterCard are now a duopoly in the payment sector. If we have many other options then, 
especially internationally, they have to reduce their fees drastically to remain competitive.” In 
essence, startups are innovating. However, established financial institutions are not sitting still. 
As such, “blockchain technology will disrupt many businesses like how Apple changed the 
Newsweek.” Overall, “the winner might be the customers because they will enjoy better service, 
faster transactions, more transparency, and to some extent they will be more in charge of their 
own data and their own assets.” Nonetheless, it is difficult to realize the possibilities of a new 
technology as exemplified by one of the participants: “In my daily routine, when I ask operation 
people: Can blockchain technology apply to this or that? The answer is always no.” 
 59 
As an adoption roadblock, the dichotomy between privacy and transparency is not a 
technical issue but a business choice concerning the balance between confidentiality and 
verifiability: “If you encrypt data, then you increase privacy and confidentiality, but you lose 
transparency and verifiability. This tradeoff will always be there. There is no technical solution 
to that. It is a business decision.” Public blockchain networks allow high degrees of anonymity 
but “we cannot have a system where people do things completely anonymously.” There are 
different blockchain networks with different objectives from a privacy perspective. ‘Zcash’ and 
‘Monero’ are the type of blockchain networks that claim to offer full privacy protection. 
However, participants believed that no blockchain is fully anonymous because one could track 
transactions back to a user’s activities and patterns. Concerning asset verification and privacy, all 
participants believed that it is easier to track blockchain-based transactions than tracking cash 
transactions.  
A general challenge is how to maneuver the idea of blockchain technology “in an aligned 
way of using it within the existing system and then in a radically new way of pulling things apart 
so you can do things in new ways.” Overall, adoption is more concerned with desired business 
outcome than with technology: “I would be more interested in getting a technology that helps me 
measure and manage liquidity. If a specific technology makes that possible, I will buy.” The fate 
and rate of adoption, therefore, hinges on creating relative value out of the technology. 
Consequently, viable ecosystems emerge around the technology: “Without the ecosystem, the 
technology itself is just sitting in a lab.” 
Another significant challenge is how to settle around standards that all the industry 
players will adopt. There are consortiums such as the R3 consortium and the Ethereum alliance. 
They sometimes call themselves a financial institution or a standard, but the adoption of which is 
 60 
not unanimous. For example, “Goldman Sachs used to be part of R3, then they left later probably 
because they have different goals.” 
There are several adoption challenges related to maintenance and governance: “In a 
private blockchain network, who should be an admin?” “If any dispute occurs, who resolves it?” 
“Who manages the blockchain infrastructure?” “If a new version is out, who is responsible for 
release management?” These are the type of challenges financial executives must think about 
when planning to adopt blockchain technology. 
A participant explained a framework for adopting blockchain smart contracts in which 
blockchain technologies could be used for two types of smart contracts. The first type is a simple 
encounter smart contract that is evoked repetitively. The second type is relationship smart 
contract that attempts to solve ongoing equivocal problems that might need intermittent human 
interaction. As such, the adoption of blockchain smart contracts becomes more accessible by 
thinking about them as partially automated: “Enabling them to get on with the job as much as 
possible and to only interact with them when needed.” As such, smart contracts could be adopted 
faster by making a conscious decision to “codify more into the automatic part and less into the 
human part. To solve an equivocal problem, it might need more human assistance.” 
A participant recommended adopting blockchain technology in a controlled way: “As a 
banker, rather than jump in, which could bring numerous problems I could not think of, I would 
cautiously watch the technology as it matures, then adopt it in a controlled way. Banks deal with 
billions of dollars. The accountability and penalties are extremely high.” Some participating 
consultants offer a strategic path for adoption: “The technology is evolving and improving so 
fast. So, it is a strategic decision to invest now while it is still developing to gain a head start.”

V THEORY: TRANSACTION COST ANALYSIS 
In this chapter, we add a theoretical perspective on the impact of blockchain technology 
on financial transactions by applying transaction cost theory to analyze the insights from our 
literature review and stakeholder perceptions. Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) provide a general 
transaction cost analysis of blockchain technology independent of industry. We build on and 
extend their work by presenting a transaction cost analysis for financial transactions. 
Specifically, we explore the transaction cost theory activities comprising searching, bargaining, 
and controlling (monitoring and enforcement) (Hennart, 1993; Husted & Folger, 2004; 
Williamson, 1985) to shed light on how the adoption of blockchain technology will affect the 
transaction costs related to asset verification, record keeping, and data privacy. We also go 
beyond the analysis of Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) by examining not only where blockchain 
technology attenuates transaction cost but also where it increases transaction cost. Finally, to 
compare transaction costs between traditional technologies and blockchain technology, we 
assume that the blockchain network is already up and running. This assumption allows us to 
avoid the complications in comparing sunk costs that are related to established technologies with 
implementation costs that are related to deploying blockchain technology. 
Transaction cost theory is concerned with the costs of transactional activities that are not 
directly attributed to the production of goods and services but are instead associated with the cost 
of searching, bargaining, and controlling activities that accompany the transaction of goods and 
services (Husted & Folger, 2004). Owed to the benefit of competition, transaction cost theory 
assumes a priori that markets are more efficient than hierarchies (Geyskens et al., 2006) and then 
moves on to define when hierarchies are better. Coase (1937), the founder of transaction cost 
theory, established that vertical integration into hierarchies applies when transaction costs are 
lower compared to the forces of free markets. The theory was further developed by Williamson 
 63 
(1985) specifying contracting between the firm and its stakeholders—customers, employees, 
partners, creditors, and suppliers—as the focus of analysis (Milgrom & Roberts, 1992). 
According to Ouchi (1980), transaction costs appear primarily due to the difficulty of 
evaluating the goods or services that are transacted. As such, transaction costs in Ouchi's view 
are due to activities that advance the goal of guaranteeing the expectations of the exchange 
participants. He further posits that the difficulty in achieving such a goal may be attributed to 
lack of trust between the parties. Williamson posits that transaction costs are determined by:  
1) Frequency, meaning how often a contract is invoked (Milgrom & Roberts, 1992; Williamson, 
1979). 
2) Asset specificity, referring to whether the asset could be deployed to a different purpose 
(Husted & Folger, 2004; Klein et al., 1978; Williamson, 1979), and therefore, raising the 
concern of goal incongruence (Ouchi, 1980) which is defined as the degree to which parties to 
an exchange have incompatible objectives (Husted & Folger, 2004). 
3) Uncertainty, comprising ex ante difficulties of anticipating all future scenarios, language 
equivocality (Milgrom & Roberts, 1992; Williamson, 1975), and ex post performance 
ambiguity concerning the difficulty of measuring performance (Ouchi, 1980) or in other words, 
the metering problem related to the intricacy of assessing the level of contribution of each 
individual or entity to a joint effort (Alchian & Demsetz, 1972; Husted & Folger, 2004; 
Milgrom & Roberts, 1992). 
4) Bounded rationality, positing that people have limited ability to store, process, and retrieve 
information (Simon, 1955; Williamson, 1973). 
5) Opportunism, exemplified by dodging duties, breaching agreements, and stealing (Alchian & 
Demsetz, 1972; Husted & Folger, 2004; Williamson, 1979). 
 64 
V.1 Searching 
Searching costs involve ex-ante activities (Husted & Folger, 2004) that are related to 
gathering information to support transactions such as identifying counter partners (Dyer, 1997), 
verifying assets, searching for information related to KYC, and gathering reputation data to 
assess credibility. Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) list three distinctive characteristics concerning 
blockchain technology search: 1) in a blockchain realm, the user can control the level of their 
privacy, 2) unlike the Internet which tends to present information that is unreliable, perishable, 
and abundant, blockchain information is tamperproof, permanent, and not as abundant, and 3) 
information on a blockchain is not just a snapshot at a specific time, it is a chronological account 
or a state machine in the words of Mougayar (2016). As such, we proceed to cover how each of 
the above blockchain technology attributes affects the searching cost in financial transactions. 
First, from a data privacy perspective, by virtue of blockchain technology empowering 
customers to control their data, customers can enter their correct expansive identity record 
elements, hence, arguably increasing its veracity and richness. Consequently, credit reporting 
agencies would not need to extensively search multiple data sources to draw an accurate view of 
the customer’s profile. In this way, the cost of searching blockchain is lower in terms of human 
power and effort since credit reporting agencies do not have to search disparate data sources that 
might have a lower quality of records or conflicting records of information. As such, it is helpful 
to service providers who according to Guo and Liang (2016) suffer from poor quality of records 
needed for assessing individual credit. Hence, Guo and Liang posit blockchain technology could 
decrease ‘searching’ transaction costs related to credit information. On the other hand, it is also 
arguable that due to opportunism, users being in charge of presenting their own data may falsify 
their records or be less transparent about them. Consequently, searching risk costs could increase 
by requiring more expenditure in searching multiple reputational elements to arrive at 
 65 
appropriate user risk profile assessments. Since users of a blockchain, especially a public one, 
could be pseudonymous, the cost for searching users’ private data could also increase in this 
case. Moreover, some of the data entered by the users could be encrypted making it impossible to 
search or use without the permission of the user, thus, incurring additional searching costs. In a 
blockchain, the data is phenomenally secure and conserved; however, if someone loses their 
private keys, then there is not a way to retrieve the password. Consequently, it is plausible that 
users who lose their private keys would create new identifications, and therefore, generate 
multiple profiles, resulting in increased costs of searching due to duplications and fragmentation 
of their data. Searching costs could also increase if people, empowered by blockchain 
technology, choose to monetize their identity data and their content data. In any case, Workie 
and Jain (2017) posit that blockchain technology eases customer identity management due to its 
shared, centralized repository. 
Second, blockchain records are tamperproof, permanent, and less abundant. Being 
tamperproof attenuates the likelihood of opportunistic behavior exemplified by participating 
entities attempting to falsify records, therefore, increasing the cost of searching for data elements 
to verify assets and keep records. When the information is less abundant it decreases the effect of 
bounded rationality, and consequently, reduces searching cost for asset verification and record 
keeping, as well as the search of users’ private data—a similar conclusion reached by 
Williamson (1975) who avers that the ease of verification is critical to the operation of capital 
markets. One of the reasons blockchain records and private data are permanent is immutability. 
Immutability of the blockchain records increases the fidelity of the information on the 
blockchain. Once a search for a particular record at a specific timestamp is run, the results will 
always be valid. Therefore, no costly repetitive search is needed. In addition to immutability, the 
 66 
permanence of blockchain data is also guaranteed by the nature of its distributed ledger, since, 
compared to centralized databases, blockchain ledger is more reliable and fault-tolerant owed to 
the clones of its ledger that is maintained by multiple network nodes (Mori, 2016). If most of the 
network nodes go down, the network will continue to verify records uninterrupted since the 
database is available in many other nodes and the consensus mechanism is independent of the 
number of operational full nodes. Therefore, the built-in redundancy could significantly reduce 
the risk of losing records and private data (Rechtman, 2017). As such, the cost of inability to 
search records is reduced owed to lack of risks of downtime due to failure or congestion. 
Third and finally, blockchain is a state machine, meaning that events or records are 
chronologically and immutably documented on the blockchain ledger. In this context, 
immutability means it is impossible to correct past records on the blockchain. As such, the 
immutability of records and private data could increase searching cost since one has to search for 
the latest update of the record, which could have multiple versions of it. This is especially true in 
a public blockchain where a high degree of goal incongruence could make editing a past 
blockchain record extremely difficult since it requires the consensus of many participants. In 
private blockchains, goal incongruence is arguably less, hence, it might be easier for 
participating entities to align around a protocol on how to edit or purge records. 
To illustrate searching transaction costs analysis, we turn our attention to two financial 
transaction activities: record reconciliation and KYC. Blockchain technology could significantly 
help record reconciliation—a combination of asset verification and record keeping. The savings 
in searching costs associated with reconciliations are significant as corroborated by the 
stakeholders perspective asserting that blockchain technology would help reconciliation: “Let us 
take Apple shares for example. At any point in time, we need to know who has assets or equity in 
 67 
Apple because we need to have the correct info to be able to pay dividends, taxes, tax rates, etc. 
Keeping track of that is very tricky. Therefore, reconciliation is very complex, and something 
takes long. That is where blockchain technology might make a difference.” According to 
Rechtman (2017), to guard against fraud and errors, financial custodians keep records 
independently (Figure 8). Therefore, it is necessary to search the records of all custodians and 
compare them to make a manual judgment call concerning a reconciliation decision. Assuming 
individuals and parties are opportunistic, have different goals, and act with bounded rationality, 
searching for reconciliation is costly. Contrarily, the veracity of the data on a blockchain is 
automatically corroborated by all nodes of the network and is shared as a single truth across the 
whole network. When recording an asset, the whole blockchain network automatically 
corroborates the new entry. Consequently, record reconciliation becomes a seamless activity. 
Therefore, blockchain technology significantly attenuates searching activities vis-à-vis record 
reconciliation. 
As a second illustration, the annual costs of KYC due diligence per bank are up to 500 
million dollars (Moyano & Ross, 2017) and Guo and Liang (2016) stress the difficulties faced by 
financial institutions in meeting KYC compliance requirements. Along the same lines, our 
participants suggested that blockchain technology could significantly reduce searching costs 
related to KYC: “Blockchain technology is a fantastic way to comply with KYC. All you have to 
do is to put the data on the blockchain, and anyone can use an App to verify.” However, some of 
the participants argued that blockchain technology will change the nature of searching where 
KYC in the future “will mean who is downloading the information, what is the serial number of 
the device, to who is the device registered, and so on.” In this case, financial institutions would 
have to crawl these different pieces of information to stitch them together to get a reasonable 
 68 
picture of the customer, arguably increasing searching costs. Some participants suggested 
blockchain technology might even shift the KYC burdens from financial institutions to 
government authorities. If this prediction transpires, it would mean increased searching costs for 
the authorities, but reduced searching costs for the institutions. It is unclear whether the KYC 
due diligence will remain with the banks or shift to the authorities; however, it is likely that the 
nature of searching for KYC information will change with blockchain technology. Further 
searching costs could be incurred due to pseudonymous behavior by some customers as we have 
explained earlier in this section. Table 10 summarizes searching transaction costs related to 
blockchain-enabled financial transactions.

V.2 Bargaining 
Bargaining transaction costs are related to negotiating, contracting, determining, 
devising, and arranging the steps to be taken and the terms of exchange when conducting 
business with others (Dyer, 1997; Husted & Folger, 2004; Milgrom & Roberts, 1990). As such,

 70 
in a blockchain-based financial transaction realm, bargaining takes place with customers 
concerning matters of access to private data and services and with partners when cooperating on 
a shared blockchain—partners could be collaborators or competitors. Accordingly, we proceed to 
cover three areas to examine the differences between bargaining costs with or without 
blockchain technology. The areas are bargaining with partners, bargaining with customers, and 
smart contract as a prominent blockchain native feature that is specially related to bargaining. 
First, we examine partnering bargaining costs. Workie and Jain (2017) suggest that 
blockchain technology is helpful where financial transactions involve multiparty in areas such as 
repurchase agreements when there are risks of settlement failure—an assessment corroborated by 
participants: “Blockchain technology brings down transaction costs for large multiparty 
transactions where many institutions and people come together such as stock exchanges and the 
DTCC.” In a blockchain realm, partners share a ledger with predefined consensus mechanism, 
agreed upon shared records, and code-based asset verification process. Consequently, the 
blockchain environment has reduced frequency, higher goal congruence, lower performance 
ambiguity, and less effect of bounded rationality. Therefore, parties sharing a blockchain enjoy 
attenuated bargaining costs of negotiation and renegotiations: A participant aver that the 
technology “supports transactions across geographical distances without a very heavyweight 
institutional arrangement.” Moreover, if the shared ledger was designed with high level of 
transparency, the result is further reduced performance ambiguity and opportunism since 
negotiations between partners are anchored on accurate records and realistic expectations. 
Arguably, the reverse holds true—a blockchain that emphasizes privacy results in higher 
performance ambiguity and opportunism. Therefore, we conclude that the higher degree of 
transparency of a blockchain, the less the transaction bargaining costs. To illustrate, we revisit 
 71 
our ‘proof of insurance’ earlier example. The policy blockchain is a private blockchain 
“accessible by participating insurance carriers, insurance distribution firms, and brokers.” It 
uses ‘proof of authority’ as a consensus mechanism—the level of access is based on the user’s 
identity. In this case, insurance carriers require significantly less bargaining effort to be able to 
settle an accident between two of their policyholders. 
Second, we examine bargaining with customers. Inasmuch as blockchain users are able to 
control their data, additional bargaining costs between the customers and the financial 
institutions are expected so as to be able to convince customers to share their information, or 
even buy the information in the case of some customers desiring to monetize their identity 
information: “Self-sovereign identity means if it is my identity, I should be empowered to share it 
with whomever I want, whenever I want, but only limited to whomever I want.” Since we have 
concluded earlier that the ability of the users to control their information will improve the 
veracity, richness, and access to their private identity data, it is arguable that due to decreased 
uncertainty, bargaining costs between customers and financial institutions will decrease. For 
example, credit and insurance rates are easy to bargain provided accurate, rich, semi-real-time 
telemetry data based on accurate user profile data or drivers record. It is also plausible that the 
richness of private data and the flexibility to share which type of private data elements will result 
in a decreased asset specificity of the user’s identity data elements a product in itself. Therefore, 
bargaining transaction costs will decrease. 
Finally, smart contracts is a prominent native feature of blockchain technology—digitally 
drafting and automatically enforcing transactions instead of arduous human interventions (de 
Meijer, 2015; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). A contract is “a framework that is a 
highly adjustable and almost never accurately indicative of real working relations, but a guide in 
 72 
cases of doubt or conflict” (Llewellyn, 1931; Williamson, 2008). Williamson posits that 
contracts are never complete due to 1) environmental uncertainty owed to the unpredictability of 
future contingencies (Geyskens et al., 2006), 1) behavioral uncertainty stemming from 
performance ambiguity ex-post (Milgrom & Roberts, 1990), 3) language equivocality where the 
more detailed the contract, the more likely it contains ambiguous clauses (Milgrom & Roberts, 
1990), and 4) bounded rationality (Simon, 1955; Williamson, 1973). Compared to traditional 
contracts, when constructing a smart contract, heftier negotiation costs obtain since smart 
contracts are code-based with less room for future flexibility needed to accommodate for future 
uncertainty, bounded rationality, and challenges concerning the conversion of equivocal 
language into algorisms (Simon, 1955; Williamson, 1973). Therefore, with a smart contract 
people might be more reluctant to commit to a code-based that is perceived to be a rigid contract, 
and if they do, it will take significant effort to agree to the terms and the translation of the terms 
into an algorithm. Furthermore, since a smart contract has to account for every scenario, it is 
arguable that more burdensome upfront negotiations costs obtain. Nonetheless, once a smart 
contract is deployed, no future renegotiations costs are expected, and therefore, not costs of 
renegotiations are incurred. To summarize, Table 11 illustrates the bargaining transaction costs 
as they relate to the impact of blockchain technology on asset verification, record keeping, and 
data privacy.

Table 11: Bargaining Transaction Costs 
V.3 Controlling 
Control costs are ex-post transaction costs related to monitoring and enforcing 
predetermined obligations to ensure their fair fulfillment or to respond to the breach thereof by 
any party (Husted & Folger, 2004; Milgrom & Roberts, 1992). In a blockchain-based financial 
transaction ecosystem, control costs comprise costs such as tracking assets, monitoring records, 
ensuring the protection of private data, enforcing AML laws, and policing the execution of 
financial contracts. 
We first explicate the reasons blockchain technology could be designed as a readily 
transparent control platform (Workie & Jain, 2017; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016), hence affecting the 
controlling costs of auditing, monitoring (Kiviat, 2015), and enforcement requirements and

 74 
practices desired by financial institutions, government authorities, and regulatory bodies. First, as 
we have explained earlier, blockchain timestamps events and records (Crosby et al., 2016). As 
such, owing to the dimension of chronology, it impacts control ling costs due to the effects on 
performance ambiguity, opportunism, and bounded rationality. Second, by design, blockchain 
transactions are immutable and tamperproof (Mougayar, 2016; Wang et al., 2016), thereby, 
affecting opportunism. Third, blockchain ledger is “centralized and fully decentralized at the 
same time,” thus, impacting goal incongruence and asset specificity. Fourth, blockchain 
technology employs code-based consensus mechanisms (DuPont & Maurer, 2015; Mori, 2016), 
and consequently, impacting controlling costs determinants of frequency, goal incongruence, and 
performance ambiguity. Finally, blockchain technology has smart contracts as a native feature 
(Auctus_Team, 2017; Mougayar, 2016), therefore, impacting the effects of frequency, 
uncertainty, bounded rationality, and opportunism. Next, we cover each one of the above 
attributes in relation to financial transactions controlling costs. 
First, the impact of timestamping on transaction controlling costs could be explicated by 
a scenario where a customer initiates a transaction to buy a specific financial asset. Owing to the 
timestamp of the event and the timestamp of the value of the asset, it would be possible to cross-
verify the value of the asset at that exact timestamp, and therefore, less transaction controlling 
costs are incurred due to the reduction of opportunism—where, for example, the seller could 
opportunistically claim an asset value at a different timestamp—or bounded rationality behavior. 
Likewise, user private data is readily available to be visualized as time series, hence, reducing 
the costs of monitoring activities stemming from performance ambiguity. 
Second, by design, blockchain transactions are immutable and tamperproof. Any 
opportunistic modification of the historical data record is detectable by participating blockchain 
 75 
network nodes (B. Lee & Lee, 2017; Tapscott & Tapscott, 2017). Evidence that is tamperproof 
reduces litigation transaction costs incurred by parties that are involved in a dispute. 
Furthermore, immutability leads to traceability (Mori, 2016) due to the verifiability of every 
record ever transacted on a blockchain (Crosby et al., 2016). Contrarily, in blockchains with a 
high level of privacy such as Monero, and Zcash, pseudonymous behavior by users could raise 
the costs for authorities to control illicit activates such as AML. On the other hand, blockchain 
being immutable, it is arguable that controlling costs associated with blockchain exchanges are 
less than cash exchanges since a permanent trace of activities on the ledger could be 
discouraging to criminals (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). From the regulators perspective, they are 
“used to work through the banks.” In a blockchain world, regulators might absorb the burden of 
enforcing the prohibition of activities such as money laundering. In such cases, financial 
institutions would enjoy less controlling transaction costs while the authorities would incur 
additional transaction controlling costs. 
Third, blockchain ledger is “centralized and fully decentralized at the same time.” As 
such, it has built-in redundancy leading to less transaction controlling costs attributed to the loss 
of access due to network downtime or congestion. Moreover, a blockchain ledger is a single 
source of truth (Pilkington, 2015) that is shared across the whole network. Therefore, monitoring 
costs are reduced owed to a reduced asset specificity of its data that is accessible by all 
authorized participants. However, in a blockchain environment, sharing data between partners, 
and sometimes competitors, is essential. For instance, “it does not matter how good the proof of 
insurance is if it is one-sided.” Hence, further transaction controlling is needed to monitor the 
‘proof of collaboration’ meta-records: “One of the first hurdles that we had was to be able to 
prove that these competitors could come together on these various solutions and work together.” 
 76 
Fourth, blockchain technology employs code-based consensus mechanisms (DuPont & 
Maurer, 2015; Mori, 2016). As such, less transaction controlling is needed due to the attenuation 
of the effects of bounded rationality and language equivocality. Furthermore, the blockchain 
records are also corroborated by other full nodes in the network continuously verifying the 
validity of every new block and the overall integrity of the whole ledger. As such, the built-in 
and code-based automation reduce manual efforts to achieve the same with traditional setups. 
Moreover, if ‘monitoring’ is considered as a skill, the generality of blockchain code-based 
capability reduces the asset specificity compared to more traditional monitoring procedures. 
Similarly, the current processes of digital payments and currency transfers require heavy 
consumption of human and infrastructural assets of financial institutions that act as 
intermediaries to conduct, clear, and settle transactions (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). With a public 
blockchain, parties can exchange directly over the network, utilizing encryption and consensus 
mechanisms (Guo & Liang, 2016; Tsai et al., 2016; Zhu & Zhou, 2016) with thinner layers of 
intermediaries and less involvement of external judicial systems to monitor and enforce the 
fairness of value exchanges. To illustrate, blockchain technology can enforce ownership by 
virtue of a consensus mechanism (Workie & Jain, 2017) that is already agreed upon by all 
participants, and therefore, reducing the transaction enforcement costs. 
Fifth and lastly, we examine controlling costs for smart contracts. In the ‘Bargaining’ 
section we have examined smart contracts ex-ante bargaining costs provided environmental 
uncertainty and the difficulties vis-à-vis the translation of equivocal language to code. If we 
assume a smart contract is already appropriately coded and deployed, it is arguable that the smart 
contract would significantly attenuate the monitoring, enforcement, and litigation controlling 
transaction costs. In general, contractual disputes represent a significant share of litigations in the 
 77 
US and the UK—44 percent and 57 percent of the cases respectively (Swan, 2015; Swanson, 
2014). Accordingly, Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) assert that smart contracts could 
disintermediation the law profession. 
The current financial transaction controlling process is slow and semi-manual. If replaced 
by blockchain technology, the ensuing elevated transparency could aid both regulators and 
participants currently struggling to conduct and monitor the intricate post-trade records and 
activities (Workie & Jain, 2017). Blockchain technology can natively, seamlessly, and more 
transparently afford robust audit trails of records of dividend disbursements, ownership details, 
stock split terms, stock transactions timestamps, taxes reports, and compliance reporting 
requirements (Rechtman, 2017). Therefore, financial institutions and regulators could build 
collaborative platforms that would reduce the transaction controlling costs required by the 
regulators from financial institutions: “It is a big arduous task for them to gather that 
information across various back office systems. If you have the information on the blockchain, 
you could very easily create a use case to do all that regulatory reporting very quickly and cut 
out many working hours required for that.”  
Finally, a blockchain could traverse multiple jurisdictions which could be “confusing 
because the beauty of decentralized networks is not having borders, although we still have 
borders and live in physical places. There are rules and taxes that we cannot just end on a 
dime.” Therefore, applying these multijurisdictional laws contributes to the transaction 
enforcement costs. For instance, the nature of privacy-related regulations “varies greatly from 
country to country, from Estonia where everything is on blockchain, to countries where they will 
take many years before doing anything.” Table 12 summarizes the financial transactions 
controlling costs.

VI DISCUSSION 
Blockchain is an integrative meta-technology characterized by a decentralized and 
distributed single truth ledger, immutable and tamperproof data records, code-based consensus 
mechanisms, time-stamped records, peer-to-peer transmission, built-in cryptography, and native 
applications such as smart contracts (Mougayar, 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Motivated by its 
potential to reduce the costs and improve the performance of financial transactions, the 
technology has been touted as the innovation engine for the financial industry (de Meijer, 2015; 
Guo & Liang, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). With its introduction, it is possible to verify assets, keep 
records, and protect data in a decentralized fashion with less friction and fewer loci of control 
(Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). As such, financial institutions are increasingly interested in the 
technology (de Meijer, 2016). 
Against this backdrop, this dissertation contributes to the body of knowledge concerning 
the impact of this emerging phenomenon on asset verification, record keeping, data privacy, and 
transaction costs. To achieve our goal, we have employed a pluralist methodology that develops 
and contrasts a review of the literature, an analysis of the perspectives of key industry players 
and observers, and a theoretical interpretation through the lens of transaction cost theory (Coase, 
1937; Ouchi, 1980; Williamson, 1975). By discussing and synthesizing these different 
perspectives in the following, this dissertation offers a number of specific contributions to the 
body of knowledge related to the impact of blockchain technology on financial transactions.  
VI.1 Blockchain Technology Can Enable Asset Verification, Record Keeping, and Data 
Privacy 
Enabled by the characteristics of its ledger, network, and protocol, blockchain technology 
can facilitate asset verification and records keeping (Workie & Jain, 2017) in a manner agreed 
upon by all participants. The network has a high level of goal congruence engendered by its 
 80 
nodes corroborating to verify the validity of new information and the overall veracity of existing 
records (Mougayar, 2016). No single custodian can exercise opportunistic control over the 
blockchain ledger at any time (Rechtman, 2017). The ledger is, therefore, a single truth that is 
redundantly distributed across the network enabling asset verification and record keeping with 
high integrity and accessibility. As such, blockchain technology eliminates the need for the 
current semi-manual processes where multiple custodians keep records in disparate databases 
and where each financial institution verifies assets on its own. Consequently, for blockchain 
participants, asset reconciliation becomes automatic since the ledger has a single shared pre-
agreed upon truth at any particular timestamp. This is of significant value because asset 
verification and record reconciliation consume much of the financial institutions’ resources: “We 
need to have the correct info to be able to pay dividends, taxes, tax rates, etc. Keeping track of 
that is very tricky. Therefore, reconciliation is very complex, and something that takes long. That 
is where blockchain technology might make a difference.” 
Data privacy and transparency are two desired outcomes, but sometimes they conflict. 
The tradeoff between privacy and transparency is a business decision concerning the balance 
between confidentiality and verifiability. A blockchain network could be designed to enable the 
desired balance between transparency and privacy (Narayanan et al., 2016; Yli-Huumo et al., 
2016). The level of data privacy and transparency depends on factors such as the agreed upon 
policy regarding the pseudonymity of the users, whether the data is stored using encryption, the 
access control scheme, and whether the blockchain network is public, private, hybrid, or 
permissioned. Moreover, blockchain users could control their “Self-sovereign identity” data 
(Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016) leading to the improvement of its veracity and richness, and 
therefore, reducing its asset specificity. 
 81 
These insights were corroborated by our literature review and empirical data and were 
further supported by our theoretical analysis. 
VI.2 On Balance, Blockchain Technology Can Lower Financial Transaction Costs 
In alignment with our theoretical analysis we focus on ‘transaction theory’ costs and 
further support our argument pluralistically with our literature review and empirical data where 
transaction costs takes a broader meaning of ‘transaction theory’ costs and production costs 
(Dyer, 1997; Zajac & Olsen, 1993), in addition to transition costs. As such, we proceed to 
discern the impact of blockchain technology on searching, bargaining, and controlling costs. 
First, considering searching costs, the ability of blockchain users to enter their own 
identity data increases the integrity and richness of the ledger. Therefore, significantly reducing 
searching costs for credit reporting data. Contrarily, pseudonymity behavior, encrypting records, 
and falsifying own records increase searching costs. However, it is less significant assuming 
users’ reputational data is important to them to receive financial transaction services. 
Furthermore, blockchain searching attributes increase the fidelity of the information and 
significantly reduces searching costs. On the other hand, the need to search for multiple versions 
due to immutability could be solved technologically. Our pluralistic findings detailed KYC and 
asset reconciliation as two major exemplars where blockchain technology positively attenuates 
transaction searching costs. 
Second, related to bargaining costs, blockchain tenants share a pre-agreed upon code-
based and transparent ecosystem. This significantly reduces the negotiation and renegotiation 
costs since bargainers are anchored on correct information. We argue that blockchains with more 
focus on privacy will be less profuse since the quest for transparency drives the value proposition 
of building a blockchain network. The ‘proof of insurance’ example drawn from our empirical 
 82 
data supports this conclusion. Indeed, there is a possibility that some users might try to monetize 
their identify data, therefore increasing bargaining cost. Nevertheless, it is less likely there will 
be many such users for reasons explained above. Certainly, negotiating smart contracts could 
significantly increase bargaining costs. Nonetheless, these bargaining costs are less significant 
compared to the savings on the controlling costs. 
Third and finally, we consider controlling costs. The ability to design a blockchain as a 
readily transparent controlling platform (Workie & Jain, 2017; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016) 
significantly reduces controlling costs (Kiviat, 2015) as shown by the long list of where 
blockchain technology attenuates controlling costs—Table 12. The few areas where blockchain 
technology increases cost are of less significance based on the following argument: a) we have 
already addressed private blockchains above b) the scenario of the authorities absorbing KYC 
and AML compliance requirements is merely a matter of shifting costs away from financial 
institutions, c) the need for monitoring the sharing of data between partners could reduce over 
time as goal congruency increases, and d) enforcing all global laws covered by a blockchain 
network might be of significance, but not too different compared to traditional technologies. 
Therefore, we conclude that, on balance, blockchain technology attenuates transaction 
costs. 
VI.3 Blockchain Technology Furnishes a Reporting Platform for Financial Transactions 
The findings from our pluralistic method concur that blockchain technology could 
potentially be the platform for reporting activities for financial transactions. Owed to 
immutability and decentralization, the permanence of blockchain data (Narayanan et al., 2016) 
makes it a reliable platform to keep important records indefinitely. The events are verifiable and 
traceable due to their timestamps (Crosby et al., 2016; Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). Furthermore, 
 83 
corroborated by the whole network (Rechtman, 2017), data on a blockchain ledger attains a high 
level of integrity and veracity. With its built-in cryptography, data privacy and access control are 
built-in capabilities. Besides, its native applications such as smart contracts (Mougayar, 2016; 
Wang et al., 2016) could enable process automation. As such, blockchain technology can 
natively, seamlessly, and more transparently afford robust audit trails of records of financial 
transactions (Rechtman, 2017) with minimal transaction costs. 
As a readily available reporting infrastructure (Workie & Jain, 2017), blockchain 
technology is impactful to auditing and monitoring (Kiviat, 2015) requirements and practices 
desired by financial institutions and regulatory bodies. The platform could enable financial 
institutions to exchange reports among themselves, as well as with authorities in compliance with 
regulatory requirements: “It is a big arduous task for them to gather that information across 
various back office systems. If you have the information on the blockchain, you could very easily 
create a use case to do all that regulatory reporting very quickly and cut out many working 
hours required for that.” 
VI.4 Blockchain Technology Requires Approaching Financial Transactions Differently 
Blockchain technology is greater than the sum of its parts (Mougayar, 2016). Thus, it is 
both a technological and economic innovation that offers a platform to record transactions and 
share data between participating parties in a more efficient, transparent, and verifiable manner 
(Liebenau & Elaluf-Calderwood, 2016; Lindman et al., 2017; Workie & Jain, 2017). The 
technology reshapes centricity and reshapes governance (Guo & Liang, 2016). Synthesizing the 
perspectives of our literature review, empirical data, and theoretical analysis, we found the 
following six aspects about blockchain-based financial transactions that behoove managers to 
approach financial transactions differently when considering blockchain technology. 
 84 
First, a blockchain network is a multitenant environment. Its value proposition obtains 
when the ecosystem is a decentralized multiparty that would benefit from an engendered trust. 
To be successful, blockchain participants should do away with isolated data records and share 
information on the blockchain ledger to enhance reputability, accountability, and controllability 
(de Meijer, 2015) by computationally, efficiently, and seamlessly keeping records across the 
financial value chain (Kiviat, 2015). In this way, blockchain participants are enabled to work 
with high level of goal congruence and low level of performance ambiguity. 
Second, blockchain records alter the nature of financial transactions and their transaction 
costs since they a) attain further veracity over time (Narayanan et al., 2016), therefore, redefining 
traditional concepts such as the finality of settlements (Mori, 2016), b) are immutably 
corroborated by the whole network, c) are secure, but could raise security issues of different 
nature, d) could be made accessible to only the intended audience, and e) are chronological 
accounts of events (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). 
Third, the technology could expand the richness and reach of financial transaction 
services (de Meijer, 2015). Nonetheless, much of the gain would not be owed to the automation 
of current processes, but to the development of new business models (Mori, 2016; Workie & 
Jain, 2017). An extreme exemplar could be the emergence of DAOs—organizations with self-
governed operations and user-produced value creation and rewards (Mougayar, 2016). 
Fourth, blockchain technology enables individuals to assume controls of their privacy 
aspects (Nakamoto, 2008). Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) further posit that not only would 
blockchain technology furnish a flexible means for individuals to control and protect their data, 
but also to monetize their identities and personal information. The implications were 
 85 
demonstrated in our empirical and theoretical analysis, and are exemplified by the potentially 
significant impact on credit reporting industry. 
Fifth, the current financial transaction regulations that have been tailored for a “financial 
ecosystem that we have developed in the past 100 to 200 years” will have to adapt to a different 
world. There might be “a need for some extra sort of blockchain sensors” to enable monitoring 
financial activities. The nature of compliance requirements such as KYC and AML could 
become different. As such, KYC and AML could be expanded to searching and monitoring a 
network of vibrant online activities. Moreover, the transaction costs of KYC and AML due 
diligence might shift from financial institutions to government authorities. 
Sixth and finally, blockchain-based startups will force incumbents to reduce transaction 
costs: “Visa and MasterCard are now a duopoly in the payment sector. If we have many other 
options then, especially internationally, they have to reduce their fees drastically to remain 
competitive.” Therefore, incumbents must invest in exploring blockchain technology since it is 
“a strategic decision to invest now while it is still developing to gain a head start.” Moreover, 
potentially, blockchain technology could introduce a massive change regarding how we would 
interact with capital markets in the form of ICOs. 
VI.5 Adoption of Blockchain Technology for Financial Transactions is Uncertain and 
Complex 
Like all newly introduced technologies, blockchain technology is far from fully charted 
waters: “It is so fascinating, and we still do not understand it. We still do not understand some of 
the negative.” Disruptive innovations usually surpass the internal absorption and usurpation 
capabilities of established institutions (Mougayar, 2016). To successfully transition to blockchain 
technology, incumbents and startups will have to resolve the technological, regulatory, adoption, 
 86 
and transaction hurdles as we found in our literature review, empirical data, and theoretical 
analysis. 
First, blockchain technology is not yet mature, and therefore, several technological issues 
arise. Many financial systems require high throughput, thus, presenting a challenge for 
blockchain technology provided its sequential ledger, consensus mechanism, and the need for its 
nodes to operate in server-client dual mode (Tsai et al., 2016). Storage requirements are also high 
given its ever-growing ledger (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). There are also security 
risks such as the 50% attack (Narayanan et al., 2016) and “the risk of losing passwords.” 
Immutability makes it “hard to go back and modify the record because one has to get agreement 
from everyone.” Moreover, its built-in redundancy comes with the price of taxing computational 
and networking resources. Therefore, the financial industry leaders “are waiting until blockchain 
technology is mature before they spend the money.” 
Second, the regulatory framework is still evolving, therefore, adding to the uncertainty 
surrounding a relatively new technology: “The largest problem is the regulatory framework.” 
Besides, “the regulators themselves do not understand how cryptocurrencies or blockchain 
technology works.” Thus far, there are a few compliance requirements concerning asset 
verification, record keeping, and data privacy (FINRA, 2017). Furthermore, for a global 
blockchain covered by heterogeneous jurisdictions, compliance is further complicated (Mori, 
2016). 
Third and finally, there are several general adoption issues. For instance, not all 
stakeholders appreciate the value proposition of blockchain technology, but some see it as “full 
of hype and euphoria with real potential for only a few use cases.” Some believe blockchain 
technology will not deliver on all its promises. Many stakeholders, therefore, advocate gradual 
 87 
adoption: “Rather than jump in, which could bring numerous problems I could not think of, I 
would cautiously watch the technology as it matures, then adopt it in a controlled way.” The 
decision of when to use blockchain technology versus traditional ones is complex 
(Auctus_Team, 2017) and “it is hard to be aware of all the different flavors of blockchains in an 
arms race to see who can provide better features.” Sharing a blockchain network requires 
participating parties to agree on governance and operational aspects and probably settling around 
standards that all the industry players will adopt. It requires effort to integrate the current 
multiple interconnected financial systems or replace with blockchain technology. Besides, 
although, on balance, blockchain technology attenuates transaction costs, it also increases some 
of them—Tables 10-12.

VII REFLECTIONS 
Based on our pluralistic methodology, we have uncovered specific areas that pertain to 
the impact of blockchain on financial transactions. In this section, we reflect on some general 
themes that have emerged through this dissertation. 
VII.1 Understanding the Complexity of Designing Blockchains 
We have detailed how complex blockchain technology is. As such, the industry needs 
guidance to simplify how to design, develop, and organize blockchain-based financial 
transaction services (Lindman et al., 2017). To assist with this goal, we emphasize the key 
dimensions of blockchains.  
Table 5 illustrates a few major categories of blockchains. However, the characteristics of 
blockchain technology allow financial institutions to conduct and operate a wide array of 
financial transaction services at any point in three-dimensional octants as shown in Figure 9. The 
figure shows the three operational axes.  
The first axis measures the degree of access control. Access refers to who can write and 
read which data on a blockchain. At the lowest end, a blockchain can be unconditionally 
accessible by every Internet user (Buterin, 2015; Pilkington, 2015). At the opposite end, access 
to an entirely private blockchain is controlled by a central locus of governance (Buterin, 2015; 
Pilkington, 2015). The second axis is the degree of privacy. Privacy refers to aspects of level of 
encryption and degree of user anonymity (Narayanan et al., 2016; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). A 
blockchain can be designed with a high degree of privacy, a high degree of transparency, or 
anywhere in between. The third axis is concerned with the degree of decentralization. 
Decentralization refers to several things including the type of consensus mechanism used, the 
ownership and distribution of the network nodes, and who participates in coding and 
 89 
development. Similar to the other dimensions, decentralization is not an ‘all or nothing’ 
(Narayanan et al., 2016). 
Figure 9: Dimensions of Blockchain 
 
Choosing levels of a blockchain access control, privacy, or centralization should be based 
on the suitability of the configuration to the business needs rather than on technological 
limitations. However, according to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, these choices are subject 
to what is called the “blockchain trilemma.” The trilemma states that between security, privacy, 
and decentralization, , one can only achieve optimal solutions in two of the three dimensions. 
High 
decentralization 
low 
centralization 
No access 
control 
High 
privacy 
High access 
control 
High 
transparency 
 90 
VII.2 Applying Transaction Cost to Blockchain Design 
We have analyzed blockchain transaction costs related to the activities of searching, 
bargaining, and controlling. This exercise proved useful, and there are additional opportunities to 
apply transaction cost theory to interpret the blockchain technology phenomenon. As we have 
discussed, transaction cost theory assumes a priori that markets are generally more efficient than 
hierarchies (Geyskens et al., 2006) and also defines when hierarchies perform better (Coase, 
1937). The determinants of the boundaries are frequency, asset specificity, goal incongruence, 
uncertainty, bounded rationality, and opportunism (Klein et al., 1978; Milgrom & Roberts, 1992; 
Ouchi, 1980; Williamson, 1979).  
Akin to the market versus hierarchy dichotomy, the choices of the type of access control, 
level of privacy, the degree of decentralization could be analyzed using the above transaction 
cost determinants. A typical blockchain is decentralized with multiparty sharing information on 
the ledger to enhance reputability, accountability, and controllability (de Meijer, 2015) by 
computationally, efficiently, and seamlessly keeping records across the financial value chain 
(Kiviat, 2015). However, other configurations are possible, and sometimes desirable. 
A highly accessible and decentralized blockchain is extremely immutable, and therefore, 
it is not possible to fix a mistake. In this sense, immutability affords traceability and reliability; 
nonetheless, it makes it difficult to fix mistakes and human errors. The choice of this 
configuration is arguably needed when there are high levels of opportunism and goal 
incongruence. A blockchain with high privacy could be the choice of users whose primary 
concern is opportunism. A transparent, decentralized, and accessible blockchain could the choice 
when transactions are frequent with a low level of asset specificity. 
 91 
VII.3 Appreciating the Blockchain Ecosystem 
For blockchain innovation to permeate, a surrounding and integrated ecosystem needs to 
flourish. Blockchain technology alone will not lead to a significant transformation of financial 
transactions. For instance, Mori (2016) asserts that 80 percent of the challenges in the financial 
industry are associated with business models and processes, and only 20 percent are attributable 
to technological hurdles. As such, redesigning processes and coming up with innovative business 
models are vital to the success of a blockchain technology paradigm shift. Doing so is not easy 
by any means as stated by one of the participants: “Blockchain technology opportunities are 
limited because of the way the whole asset industry is structured right now. Change is not 
happening, it would require quite a bit.” 
The ecosystem comprises a) blockchain-based new entrants to the financial transaction 
sector, b) incumbent financial services providers, c) interconnectors between different entities 
exemplified by cryptocurrency exchanges, d) technology innovators—incumbents and 
entrepreneurs—to supply the market with blockchain-based solutions, and e) regulators to 
guarantee compliance and to build the required regulatory framework. In addition, the ecosystem 
includes new types of consumers with new aspirations, passion, and demands. In this way, 
collaboration and convergent interests are essential to unleashing the power of blockchain 
technology. 
From a technology stack ecosystem point of view, we envision a future permeated by 
machine-to-machine type of transactions pushing the blockchain technology towards the internet 
of things (IoT) periphery. Besides, AI is expected to play an important role in adding analytical 
capability to blockchain technology. That is especially important for blockchain smart contracts 
to become smarter, more dynamic, and more flexible (machine learning type of AI), and more 
 92 
integrated with big data. The integration of these three technologies could lead to unprecedented, 
innovative waves of development. 
VII.4 Creating Value with Blockchains 
 To understand the value creation options owed to blockchain technology, it is worth 
revisiting blockchain as a meta-technology that integrates several technologies to form a gestalt 
(Kiviat, 2015; Mougayar, 2016)—see Figure 10 which illustrates the main characteristics of 
blockchains that we have covered in this dissertation. 
Figure 10: Blockchain Gestalt  
The original promise of blockchain technology introduced by Nakamoto (2008) was to 
bypass middleman actors and allowing direct peer-to-peer transactions, a vision celebrated by 
anarchists and alarming to institutionalists. Ten years passed since, and the technology adoption 
Decentralized

 93 
is shaping in a way that is rather different. Instead of disintermediating, we see the 
reintermediation of trust away from the center (Mougayar, 2016) and the formation of ‘multi-
center, weakly intermediated’ schemes (Guo & Liang, 2016) exemplified by cryptocurrency 
exchanges and blockchain-based escrow services. Many businesses were established to enable 
financial transactions and to exchange value. As such, blockchain technology permits the 
displacement of older and thicker layers of intermediation with newer and thinner ones. In doing 
so, the technology surpasses equivalence in terms of speed of financial transactions and their 
cost, level of trust, degree of flexibility, and broadening business models (de Meijer, 2015; Guo 
& Liang, 2016; Kiviat, 2015)—not only from a business side, but also from consumer and 
regulator sides.  
VII.5 Considering Blockchain Applications 
Blockchain applications can be categorized in many ways as we have seen in Appendix 
B, and Appendix D. We have uncovered three broad areas that are being actively pursued by 
financial transactions providers.  
The first area of applications is payments. Blockchain technology can reduce the cost of 
cross-border transactions, lower annual operational costs, and reduce annual cost of risk (Guo & 
Liang, 2016). Besides, the phenomenon of cryptocurrency in itself is destined for more adoption 
as exemplified by some countries augmenting their fiat currencies by cryptocurrency. The 
payment sector gave rise to new models of financial transaction services such as cryptocurrency 
exchanges, digital asset escrow service providers, and different type of cryptocurrency minters. 
The exchanges allow end users to swap cryptocurrencies with each other or with fiat currency. 
The concern of cryptocurrency being used for illicit activities is countered by blockchain 
 94 
traceability and the concept of pseudonymity (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). In this context, 
pseudonymity could be considered as a balance between privacy and transparency. 
Second, immutability and timestamps of blockchain data make the technology suitable 
for tracking assets and activities with an elevated level of trust in the veracity of assets 
information (Crosby et al., 2016; Mori, 2016; Rechtman, 2017). As such, blockchain technology 
affords a suitable platform for asset reconciliation (Rechtman, 2017). It is also a suitable system 
to achieve compliance auditing services required by regulators (Kiviat, 2015; Workie & Jain, 
2017). Moreover, supply chain financial transactions are another major field for blockchain 
technology as exemplified by IBM Hyperledger. 
The third area is identity management. The capabilities of blockchain in managing 
identity are exemplified by its implementation in the country of Georgia. Moreover, the 
technology allows “self- sovereign identity” where users have more control over their identity 
and their content. Blockchain technology can challenge some of the established identity privacy 
norms where individual and the collective—instead of central entities—are in control of 
reputational information. 
  
 95 
VIII CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Asset verification, record keeping, data privacy, and transaction costs are but some few 
areas of the financial transaction domain. Moreover, our theoretical framework is but one of 
many lenses to explore the impact of blockchain technology on financial transactions. Future 
research should, therefore, examine different theoretical frameworks and additional financial 
transaction areas to shed more light on the phenomenon. 
Although we have utilized transaction cost theory, we have focused on the impact on 
searching, bargaining, and controlling costs. However, we have left out a central transaction cost 
theory goal concerning organizational boundaries around the decision of ‘make, buy, or ally’ 
(Coase, 1937; Ouchi, 1980; Williamson, 1979). As such, future research should consider 
extending this dissertation to examine the governance aspect. 
Compared to our theoretical analysis where we solely focused on ‘transaction theory’ 
costs, while collecting and synthesizing the literature and the empirical data, we broadly 
examined various aspects of blockchain technology impact on financial transactions. Moreover, 
in this case, the term ‘transaction cost’ took a broader meaning to engulf ‘transaction theory’ 
costs and production costs (Dyer, 1997; Zajac & Olsen, 1993), in addition to transition costs—
blockchain technology enablement costs. As such, future research should look deeper into these 
broader areas of costs related to transitioning to and operating blockchain-enabled financial 
transactions.

APPENDICES 
Appendix A: Pluralist Methodology 
Mingers and Brocklesby (1997) define a methodology as a structured set of guidelines or 
activities to undertake a study. They further posit that a methodology will develop implicitly or 
explicitly within a particular paradigm embodying its philosophical assumptions in terms of 
ontology—the types and nature of entities—epistemology—the possibilities of, and limitations 
on, our knowledge—and praxeology—the nature of our actions. For further details about the 
characteristics of the main paradigm families the reader may refer to Appendix F.  
 This dissertation employs a pluralist approach, where all situations are viewed as 
inherently complex and multidimensional, therefore, would benefit from multimethodology 
(Mingers, 2001). The real-world is ontologically stratified and differentiated (Bhaskar, 1994), 
and therefore, pluralism is essential to portray the richness and multidimensionality of the real 
world. Mingers (2001) avers that research methods are instruments for provoking a response 
from a complex multidimensional world, and in this respect, different methods may produce 
useful information about various aspects of the world. Hence, to construct a rich view of a 
phenomenon, it is both desirable and feasible to use pluralist methodology to gain richer and 
more reliable representation of reality. From an engaged scholarship standpoint, pluralist 
methodology is sensible because practitioners are already ahead of academia in combining 
methodologies in practice (Mingers & Brocklesby, 1997). 
Furthermore, Mingers and Brocklesby (1997) advocate that a study comprises several 
phases where each phase has different tasks and requirements, and therefore, could be embarked 
upon more effectively with a different methodology or a diversity of methodologies. 
Additionally, Mingers and Brocklesby (1997) align with the view of postmodernists where 
 97 
methods or parts of methods may be removed from their theoretical and philosophical base and 
pressed into the service of different, even competing, logics. 
To the common argument that research methods are bound to particular paradigms that 
are incommensurable, Mingers (2001) reiterates that the world is almost certainly more complex 
than we could ever know, therefore, this argument is an epistemic fallacy—limiting what may 
exist to our current knowledge—and an anthropic fallacy—defining existence as centered around 
human being (Bhaskar, 1978). Hence, it is both ontologically desirable and possible to approach 
a phenomenon pluralistically. Mingers (2001) goes further to affirm the feasibility of detaching 
research methods from a paradigm and using them within a context that proposes different 
assumptions. 
Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998) list additional benefits of pluralist methodology. First, 
triangulation allows the researcher to validate data and results by blending a range of data 
sources, methods, or observers. Second, pluralist methodology aids creativity through the 
discovery of fresh or paradoxical factors that stimulate further research. Finally, pluralist 
methodology permits the expansion of the scope of the research to draw broader conclusions 
from situations (Mingers, 2001). 
Triangulating multiple perspectives or methods on a complex business problem or 
challenge attenuates the likelihood of unintended bias in interpretations (Van de Ven, 2007). 
Furthermore, a pluralist methodology that compares and contrasts multiple plausible models of 
reality is crucial to the emergence of rigorous scientific knowledge (Azevedo, 1997; Van de Ven, 
2007). Most importantly, a pluralist methodology can help to study a business phenomenon that 
is emerging and not well researched, by providing complementary types of insights. The essence 
 98 
of pluralist methodology is to combine perspectives and parts of methodologies (Mingers & 
Brocklesby, 1997). 
Against this backdrop, this dissertation iteratively traverses multiple perspectives by 
drawing on three methods. First, is exploring the literature on blockchain technology as it relates 
to the financial industry. The second method of this research is a number of interviews on 
blockchain technology with financial sector executives, subject matter experts, and academics to 
enhance the understanding of a complex phenomenon by engaging the perspectives of diverse 
scholars and stakeholders (Bechara & Van de Ven, 2007). Third, transaction cost theory (Coase, 
1937; Ouchi, 1980; Williamson, 1975) as a particularly stimulating theoretical framework that 
promises insights into the potentially disruptive effects of the blockchain technology. This 
dissertation will employ an iterative juxtaposing and analysis of these three perspectives and 
methods While collecting and synthesizing the literature and the empirical data, we broadly 
examined various aspects of blockchain technology impacts on financial transactions. Moreover, 
in this case, the term ‘transaction cost’ took a broader meaning to engulf ‘transaction theory’ 
costs and production costs (Dyer, 1997; Zajac & Olsen, 1993), in addition to transition costs—
blockchain technology enablement costs. However, during the theoretical analysis, we zoomed in 
to solely focus on ‘transaction theory’ costs. 
Underlying this qualitative dissertation, the researcher espouses, at the paradigm level, a 
critical realist stance that adopts a combination of an objective ontology and a subjective 
epistemology (Bechara & Van de Ven, 2007). This paradigm sits well with the context of the 
inquiry at hand as well as with the pluralist methodology because of five major assumptions 
made by Bechara and Van de Ven (2007). First there is a real world; however, we are limited in 
our ability to understand it. Second, all facts and data are theory-laden. Third, even though some 
 99 
methods are better than others in a given context, no form of inquiry can be value-free and 
unbiased. Fourth, triangulation produces more rigorous knowledge. Finally, the fit of a 
methodology is context specific. 
Appendix A.1: The Literature Review Method 
The first side of the triangular pluralistic methodology is the literature review. The 
literature review situates the research contextually and builds on prior research (Myers, 2013). 
The literature review is the foundation (Webster & Watson, 2002) that forms the empirical basis 
for conducting the research (Trochim, Donnelly, & Arora, 2015). A major purpose of the 
literature review is to recognize what is covered by the extant literature and to validate the 
originality of the intended contribution as inspired by the research question. 
According to Webster and Watson (2002), two forms of literature reviews exist. First, 
when treating a mature subject matter that is well covered by the extant literature. Second, when 
exploring an emerging topic that has a dearth of coverage by the extant research. Inasmuch as 
blockchain technology is emerging, the approach of research adopted here aligns with the second 
from where it is beneficial to augment with potential theoretical foundations (Webster & Watson, 
2002) as explicated by the subsequent theoretical interpretation section. Moreover, the 
triangulation with the perception analysis method helps in tightening the inherent looseness in 
extant body of knowledge of such an emerging field as in the case of the topic of this 
dissertation. 
Based on the research question concerning the impact of blockchain technology on 
financial transactions, the first step taken was to identify the intersection of the literature streams 
comprising the overlap of blockchain technology with the financial industry. Although a few 
technological articles were covered, the focus was on the business-related literature streams. To 
 100 
fully comprehend the underlying business aspects and technological schemes of blockchain 
technology, the researcher took notes from attending a virtual class offered by Princeton 
University (Princeton University, 2014) as well as reading five books on the topic. The effort 
was followed by a systematic literature review—a relatively broad survey of relevant literature 
that is considered complete when no new concepts emerge in the article set (Trochim et al., 
2015). Accordingly, a systematic review of related literature began by searching for articles 
covering the intersection of literature on blockchain technology and the intersection with the 
financial industry. The search of the extant literature yielded four hundred and twenty related 
articles. 
The next step was to examine the summaries of the articles mentioned above with two 
goals in mind. The first goal was to identify which articles are strongly related to this dissertation 
subject matter. The second goal was to group the concepts into subcategories. Following this 
winnowing effort, the articles were read, and related passages were identified. Furthermore, 
additional related articles—referenced in the set—were discovered. Next, the supplementary 
articles were read, and related passages were identified. The overall effort resulted in a) fifty-
seven articles of general nature detailing blockchain-related business and technological aspects; 
b) forty-three articles concerning the intersection of blockchain technology with the financial 
industry—inclusive of current and potential future blockchain-based financial applications; c) 
thirty articles covering various non-financial applications of blockchain technology; and d) seven 
articles related to legal and legislative areas of blockchain technology. In addition to the five 
books mentioned earlier, the literature set comprised academic papers, white papers, industry 
blogs, and videos. The deviation from the reliance on only academic articles is due to the 
newness and emergence of the blockchain technology phenomenon. 
 101 
Next, a systematic data analysis of the passages was conducted to identify and categorize 
text passages in relation to the corresponding ‘literature review’ sections in the manuscript. Open 
coding was employed to identify passages in the texts that describe relevant phenomena (Myers, 
2013). Later, axial coding was utilized to conceptualize and group the passages into categories in 
order to triangulate with the perception analysis data. Axial coding specifies each category’s 
properties and dimensions (Charmaz, 2014). Finally, selective coding (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) 
was employed to selects core categories and relate them to corresponding concepts from 
transaction cost theory—the theoretical framework. 
In addition, the literature review supports the systematic compilation and synthesis of all 
of the extant literature related to a research subject matter (Trochim et al., 2015) and concisely 
explicates what has been learned (Webster & Watson, 2002). Accordingly, to enable the 
synthesis of uncovered concepts, the literature review was organized into three chapters: 1) 
Introduction, 2) Technology: Blockchains, and 3) Application: Financial Transactions. 
Appendix A.2: The Perception Analysis Method 
The second pillar of the triangular pluralist mythology is the perception analysis. 
Interviews are like night vision goggles that permit the researcher a vivid view of the scattered 
objects in the field (Myers, 2013; Rubin & Rubin, 2011). The inclusion of the perception 
analysis of blockchain technology practitioners, experts, and researchers increases the rigor of 
the research because it fills the contextual gaps typically present in the extant literature 
concerning emerging fields such as the one being examined by this dissertation. Furthermore, a 
significant benefit for augmenting the literature review method with the perception data is to 
bridge the temporal lag where there is two to three-year between conducting studies and their 
publication in academic journals (Myers, 2013). Additionally, the perception analysis serves to 
 102 
validate insights from the theoretical interpretation method. Finally, interviews are primary 
data—collected by the researcher—that adds richness and credibility to qualitative research 
(Myers, 2013).  
The first step was to decide on how many people to interview in order to gain their 
perception. Inasmuch as this is a qualitative research, sample size has no significance. A more 
critical concern than the number of interviews is to make sure that the pool of participants 
embodies a variety of voices (Myers, 2013; Myers & Newman, 2007). As such, we believed that 
sixteen participants provided enough variety of voices. Our confidence level in reaching rigorous 
conclusions is further elevated by virtue of triangulating the data from the interviews with both 
the literature review and the theoretical perspective. To further ensure diversity of views, target 
participants were selected as follows: a) six financial industry blockchain technology executives, 
b) five senior blockchain technology subject matter experts, and c) five blockchain researchers. 
A semi-structured interview was devised with prepared questions; however, at times, we 
deviated from the script and improvised new questions depending on the conversation (Myers, 
2013). The reader may refer to Appendix I for details regarding structure of the interviews. 
According to Myers (2013), semi-structured interviews enable the interviewees to provide more 
rich insights and to offer valuable information. Contrasted with structured interviews where the 
researcher sticks to prepared questions, and unstructured interviews where no prepared questions 
are preformulated, semi-structured interviews allow flexibility while sustaining a reasonable 
level of focus. As such, each participant was separately interviewed once for a duration of sixty 
minutes by telephone. The researcher took notes during each interview. Additionally, each 
interview was recorded digitally and transcribed later. 
 103 
Next, we engaged in systematic data analysis of the interview transcripts. First, open 
coding was applied to uncover relevant concepts (Myers, 2013). 286 passages were captured. 
The second step was to use axial coding to conceptualize and group the passages into higher-
level concepts (Charmaz, 2014) resulting into 9 distinct codes. Third and finally, selective coding 
was employed to select core categories and relate them to other categories (Strauss & Corbin, 
1990) being our four arear areas of financial transaction in the case: asset verification, record 
keeping, data privacy, and transaction costs. The perception analysis was iteratively juxtaposed 
to the data generated with the literature review method. Moreover, data from both the interviews 
and the literature review was iteratively related to the insights from the theoretical interpretation 
method as will be explicated in the next section. 
During all phases of the interview process precautionary measures were taken to protect 
the privacy of the participants’ personal information and their organizational data. The tools used 
for conducting the interviews are listed in Appendices F, G, and H. 
On the one hand, the goal of practical knowledge is concerned with situations in a 
particular case. On the other hand, the purpose of scientific knowledge is to seek a generalization 
that can be used to explain and understand things (Van de Ven, 2007). As such, the perception 
analysis method covers the former, while the next method covers the latter. 
Appendix A.3: The Theoretical Interpretations Method 
The third and final leg of the pluralistic methodology is the theoretical interpretation. 
Theoretical frameworks provide abstract, conceptual understandings of the phenomenon under 
investigation (Charmaz, 2014). The approach adopted by the pluralistic methodology of this 
dissertation aligns with the way Yin (2013) advocates triangulating multiple sources of empirical 
data with theoretical schemes (Myers, 2013). As such, this dissertation embarked upon 
 104 
iteratively triangulating transaction cost theory concepts, as a theoretical framework, with the 
literature review and the interviews data. The endeavor provided more profound insights 
supported by: a) practical knowledge that aided the understanding of a particular practical 
situation and b) theoretical knowledge that helped in describing the fundamental nature of things 
(Van de Ven, 2007). 
This dissertation started by applying the literature review method as detailed in the 
‘Literature Review Method’ section. Next, the perception analysis method was applied as 
explained in the ‘Perception Analysis Method’ section. Lastly, transaction cost theory was 
invoked to understand and explain findings from the two preceding methods. This sequential 
approach aligns with Lawrence (1992) who advocates problem-oriented approaches rather than 
theory-oriented approaches (Van de Ven, 2007). Lawrence suggests to start by surveying the 
field to inspect the problem and make an initial assessment of significant parameters; and then 
explore relevant theory for promising conceptualizations (Van de Ven, 2007). Furthermore, this 
dissertation summoned transaction cost theory in a fashion aligned with the view of Locke and 
Latham (2004) who aver that extant frameworks are likely inspirational resource for making 
sense of data since theory can be used to open up new possibilities (Van de Ven, 2007). As such, 
the intended approach of this dissertation of exposing the tension between data and concepts of 
transaction cost theory led to an interaction of observations that refined research foci and 
generated possibilities to uncover new interpretations that, at times, conflicted with prevailing 
views or advanced different perspectives (Van de Ven, 2007). 
Drawing on the literature review and the perception analysis, we obtained perspicacity to 
identify transaction cost theory concepts with potential explanatory power of interpreting the 
blockchain technology phenomenon in the financial industry. To achieve that, we thoroughly 
 105 
studied research papers detailing the fundamentals of transaction cost theory as exemplified by 
(Coase, 1937, 2013; Commons, 1931, 1932; Ouchi, 1980; Williamson, 1973, 1975, 1979, 1985, 
1988, 1994, 2008, 2010a, 2010b, 2014). Next, to acquire expertise with the analytical utility of 
transaction cost theory concepts, we read studies that engage transaction cost theory as a 
framework for analyzing different phenomena as exemplified by (Anderson & Gatignon, 1986; 
Cheung, 1969; Pollak, 1985). 
Transaction cost theory is interdisciplinary as it joins economics with aspects of 
organization theory and contract law (Williamson, 1979). The kernel question of transaction cost 
theory is concerned with organizational boundaries around the decision of ‘make, buy, or ally;’ 
in other words, whether a transaction is more efficiently performed within a firm—vertical 
integration—or outside the firm—market governance—(Coase, 1937; Geyskens et al., 2006). As 
such, the goal of minimizing transaction costs determines the governance mechanisms (Husted & 
Folger, 2004). Transaction costs consist of searching, bargaining, monitoring, enforcement, and 
other costs that are not directly related to the production of goods or services (Husted & Folger, 
2004). Accordingly, the industry perception data and the literature review data were analyzed to 
examine impact of blockchain technology on transaction costs. The transaction costs approach 
allows identifying the circumstances—comprising goal incongruence and performance 
ambiguity in Ouchi’s view—which produce the costs of mediating exchanges between 
participants (Ouchi, 1980). In Williamson’s views, transaction costs are determined by: a) 
frequency, meaning how often a contract is invoked (Milgrom & Roberts, 1992; Williamson, 
1979), b) asset specificity, referring to whether the asset could be deployed to a different purpose 
(Husted & Folger, 2004; Klein et al., 1978; Williamson, 1979), and therefore, raising the concern 
of goal incongruence (Ouchi, 1980) which is defined as the degree to which parties to an 
 106 
exchange have incompatible objectives (Husted & Folger, 2004), c) uncertainty, comprising ex 
ante difficulties of anticipating all future scenarios, language equivocality (Milgrom & Roberts, 
1992; Williamson, 1975), and ex post performance ambiguity concerning the difficulty of 
measuring performance, (Ouchi, 1980) or in other words, the metering problem related to the 
intricacy of assessing the level of contribution of each individual or entity to a joint effort 
(Alchian & Demsetz, 1972; Husted & Folger, 2004; Milgrom & Roberts, 1992), d) bounded 
rationality, positing that people have limited ability to store, process, and retrieve information 
(Simon, 1955; Williamson, 1973), and e) opportunism, exemplified by dodging duties, breaching 
agreements, and stealing (Alchian & Demsetz, 1972; Husted & Folger, 2004; Williamson, 1979). 
Accordingly, we examine the aforementioned transaction costs determinants to contrast 
traditional technologies with blockchain technology. Therefore, we stress the differentiating 
characteristics of blockchain technology. First, blockchain timestamps events and records 
(Crosby et al., 2016). Second, by design, blockchain transactions are immutable and tamperproof 
(Mougayar, 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Third, blockchain ledger is “centralized and fully 
decentralized at the same time.” Fourth, blockchain employs code-based consensus mechanisms 
(DuPont & Maurer, 2015; Mori, 2016). Fifth and finally, blockchain has smart contracts as a 
native feature (Auctus_Team, 2017; Mougayar, 2016)—digitally drafting and automatically 
enforcing transactions instead of burdensome human interventions (de Meijer, 2015; Yli-Huumo 
et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). 
Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) provided a general transaction cost analysis of blockchain 
technology independent of industry. We build on and extend their work by presenting a 
transaction cost analysis specific to financial transactions. Specifically, we explore the 
transaction cost theory activities comprising searching, bargaining, and controlling (monitoring 
 107 
and enforcement) (Hennart, 1993; Husted & Folger, 2004; Williamson, 1985) to shed light on 
how the adoption of blockchain technology will affect the transaction costs related to asset 
verification, record keeping and data privacy. We also go beyond the analysis of Tapscott and 
Tapscott (2016) by examining not only where blockchain technology attenuates transaction cost 
but also where it increases transaction cost. Finally, to objectively compare transaction costs 
between traditional technologies and blockchain technology, we assume that the blockchain 
network is already up and running. The assumption allows us to avoid the complications in 
comparing sunk costs that are related to established technologies with enablement costs that are 
related to deploying blockchain technology. 
In this way, this dissertation sought to employ transaction cost theory to make sense of 
blockchain technology phenomenon in the financial industry. The approach is analogous to past 
analysis conducted by researchers such as the study by Cheung (1969) that utilizes the 
transaction cost theory concepts of uncertainty and contracts to examine contractual records in 
Chinese agricultural communities. Another example is the analysis of entry mode decision into 
international markets through the lens of transaction cost theory by Anderson and Gatignon 
(1986). A final and third example is the work of Pollak (1985) who examines the economic 
activity and behavior of the family through the lens of transaction cost theory. 
In summary, the employment of transaction cost theory enriched the insights of the 
findings because according to Van de Ven (2007) scientific inquiry involves a repetitive contrast 
between theoretical ideas and empirical data that aids in making sense of the observations. 
  
 108 
Appendix B: General Blockchain Applications 
Blockchain technology use beyond cryptocurrency is being tried in many industries 
where some forms of exchange is conducted (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). Zhao et al. (2016) posit 
that the evolution of blockchain technology runs through blockchain 1.0 with a focus on digital 
currency, then blockchain 2.0 concerning digital finance, to blockchain 3.0 encompassing a 
digital society. Zhao et al. discern that despite the burgeoning of many experimental projects, 
blockchain 2.0 and 3.0 will need many years to flourish and bring about significant economic 
impacts. Mougayar (2016) concurs and anticipates blockchain technology adoption and 
evolution to parallel the Web’s, which formed initially over seven years after the launch of the 
Internet in 1983, but then required additional efforts over three years (1994-1997) for most 
business to understand its potential. Therefore, Mougayar expects that blockchain technology 
will persist as a semi-complex phenomenon for the period 2015–2018, analogous to how it took 
Bitcoin three years (2009–2012) before it started to permeate into the main fabric of the 
economy. 
To establish a reference for understanding current and potential blockchain-based 
offerings, this dissertation will invoke the utilitarian framework of Mougayar (2016) which lists 
blockchain technology touch-points as programmable assets, programmable trust, programmable 
ownership, programmable money, programmable identity, and programmable contracts. Swan 
(2015) provides other classifications for applications —see Appendix D. The details of each of 
Mougayar’s six concepts will follow. Because blockchain technology applications may overlap 
with more than one touch-point, the examples offered under each are not necessarily mutually 
exclusive. Furthermore, because the concepts of programable assets and programable ownership 
are intricately conjoined, they will be combined in a single section. 
 109 
Appendix B.1: Programmable Assets and Programmable Ownership 
According to Swan (2015), blockchain technology allows registry, inventory, and 
exchange of hard assets such as houses and computers; intangible assets such as shares, 
reservations, and health data; and copyrights such as music albums, audible books, and digitized 
fine art. The exchange of assets is possible because blockchain immutably stores information 
about every transaction and ensures its legitimacy (Pilkington, 2015). In other words, the 
blockchain time-stamps documents signifying rights or ownership, therefore providing 
indisputable certifications that are cryptographically secure and enabling seamless verification 
capabilities (Mougayar, 2016) (Swan, 2015). As such, in a blockchain database, anything can be 
treated as a ‘smart property’ (Swan, 2015). Smart property is the notion of assigning a unique 
identifier such that an asset can be traced, administered, and exchanged (Swan, 2015). Mougayar 
(2016) considers smart property a native unit requirement for blockchain operations defined as a 
digitized version of an item that includes specific rights to use and typically has a value 
associated with it. Elaborating further, Mougayar states that smart property extends the concept 
of a digital asset by associating it to a blockchain such that it can never be double-spent, double-
owned, or double-sent. As such, a smart property is ""an asset or thing that knows who owns it"" 
and, as such, it enables more possibilities, flexibility, and discoverability to facilitate frictionless 
decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges (Mougayar, 2016). However, that does not imply that 
related contracts concerning the exchanges are not subject to existing laws (Swan, 2015).  
In this way, smart property enables things like domain name systems (DNS) as embodied 
by Namecoin—an open-source organization that seeks to heighten decentralization, security, 
censorship resistance, privacy, and speed of certain apparatuses of the Internet exemplified by 
DNS (Namecoin, n.d.)—and digital content distribution and anti-counterfeit—enabled by the 
immutability attribute which prevents double-spending, double-owning, or double-sending 
 110 
(Mougayar, 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Another example listed by Swan (2015) is a pre-
established smart contract that would automatically transfer a title deed of an automobile from 
the financing firm to the individual owner upon receiving the final payment. In this sense, 
blockchain becomes a single source of truth (Pilkington, 2015) for the latest status of ownership 
of assets. The absence of central human intervention to enforce verifiability is a fundamental 
blockchain technology novelty (Swan, 2015). 
Blockchain technology enables irrefutable proofs that are cryptographically secure 
through the time-stamping of documents representing rights or ownership (Mougayar, 2016). As 
such, blockchain technology allows exact ownership and chain of custody to be ascertained (de 
Meijer, 2015). Consequently, for the legal sector, this facilitates efficient digital asset exchange 
concerning document and authorship verification, title transfers, and contract enforcement 
(Kiviat, 2015). Two of the established blockchain-based enterprises are Viacoin (VIAcoin, n.d.) 
which offers notarizing services through the timestamping, transfer, and verification of 
ownership of documents (Kiviat, 2015); and Libra (Libra, n.d.) which supplies business 
customers with reports, audits, and digital asset transactions analysis in any blockchain database 
(Pilkington, 2015). 
Blockchain technology could furnish a transactional platform for sharing economy 
services (Mainelli & Smith, 2015), as it naturally allows trusted documentation of large-scale 
peer-to-peer activities (Lindman et al., 2017). Contrary to the misconception of considering 
Airbnb, Uber, and the like as sharing economy, these businesses do not share but rather 
aggregate, and in the process, they collect data for commercial exploitation (Tapscott & 
Tapscott, 2016). Moreover, Uber and Airbnb exemplify oligopolistic intermediaries according to 
Mougayar (2016). Swan (2015) expects the emergence of decentralized models of Airbnb—for 
 111 
lodging, Getaround—for vehicles rentals, and LaZooz—for peer-based ride sharing. Backfeed is 
a leader in the sharing economy space. On its homepage, Backfeed mission statement is to 
develop a distributed governance system for blockchain-based applications that allows 
collaborative creation and distribution of value in spontaneously emerging networks of peers 
(Backfeed, n.d.). Toyota Research Institute has a vision to use blockchain technology to allow 
car owners to monetize seats, trunk space and other unused resources (Coindesk, 2017g). Vitalik 
Buterin, founder of the Ethereum blockchain said: “Whereas most technologies tend to automate 
workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of 
putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers 
work with the customer directly” (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). 
Appendix B.2: Programmable Trust 
Joichi Ito, Director, MIT Media Lab said: “Blockchain is to trust as the Internet is to 
information"" (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). Blockchain technology embeds trust as an intrinsic 
attribute of transactions by implanting rules that represent trust, making blockchain a platform 
for validating transactions via logic in the network, not via a protected database entry or central 
authority (Mougayar, 2016). Swan (2015) describes blockchain as trustless in the sense that users 
do not need to trust each other or a central intermediary, but only need to trust the system. She 
further explicates that the blockchains immutability, transparency, access, and reach enable 
global trust. 
From executive stock exercises to online lottery to patenting—through time binding 
commitments with proof of knowledge—the blockchain trust fabric can transform any form of 
transaction. Democratic system could be strengthened by blockchain because the technology can 
elevate the level of trust in voting (de Meijer, 2015; Lindman et al., 2017) where transparency 
 112 
(Zhao et al., 2016) and immutability attributes are the primary blockchain technology enablers. 
The technology could also be used for the creation of smart property where blockchain becomes 
an inventory, tracking, and an exchange mechanism for hard assets like diamonds, and for 
tracing the authenticity and origin of goods for socially responsible consumers and businesses 
(Lindman et al., 2017). 
Blockchain technology can transform trust in supply chain management by exacting 
provenance (Kim & Laskowski, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016) because it furnishes a shared, 
consensus-based public ledger that can track the process from source to destination (Crosby et 
al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). According to Arvind Krishna, the director of research at IBM 
(Coindesk, 2017b), the technology could save billions of dollars spent in coordination costs in 
both capital markets and the shipping industry; a typical shipment gets scrutinized by about thirty 
administrations before reaching its final destination; blockchain technology is ideal to aggregate 
and transmit the certifications required during the process, and therefore could save 20 percent of 
the cost. 
There has always been tension between transparency and privacy. Transparency enhances 
the collective trust—increased transparency provides increased levels of trust (Mougayar, 2016). 
Nevertheless, at users’ level, trust is also concerned with privacy. In a public blockchain 
network, selective transparency and privacy are achieved via cryptographic technologies, where 
transactions can be verified without revealing all aspects of the identity of their user (Mougayar, 
2016). 
Another application of the trust feature in blockchain technology is prediction markets, 
where the platform could furnish a system for increased trust and confidence in the outcome of 
the process. For example, Predictious—enabling crowd predictions from the presidential 
 113 
elections to the Oscars (Predictious, n.d.)—and Fairlay—enables users to bet on sport events like 
horse races and popular events like elections (Fairlay, n.d.)—offer betting venues for the typical 
real-world outcomes (Swan, 2015). A distinct flavor of trust-based blockchain technology 
applications is distributed cloud storage—exemplified by Storj (Storj, n.d.) which allows users to 
store data securely, economically, and privately without a centralized authority (Kiviat, 2015; 
Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). Storj uses peer-to-peer protocols to provide secure, and private 
cloud storage (Swan, 2015) that enables users to monetize their extra space in a manner that 
provides more trust and privacy, compared to regular clouds, because the data is encrypted and 
fragmented. Mougayar (2016) affirms that blockchain networks do not replace cloud computing, 
but rather unbundle and democratize parts of it. 
Blockchain technology enables new business models and resolves the trust issue more 
efficiently via code-based networks (Zhao et al., 2016). A distinct and foundational blockchain 
technology application is an emerging business model called distributed autonomous 
organization—organizations with self-governed operations and user-produced value creation and 
rewards (Mougayar, 2016). The distributed autonomous organization is a transformational 
concept that could radically alter the architecture of trust, and subsequently, the structure of 
businesses. 
Appendix B.3: Programable Identity 
Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) posit that blockchain technology will allow ‘the virtual 
you—your avatar’ be owned by you, hence, empowering you to reveal only what you needed to, 
depending on the situation, while whisking up your data crumbs when navigating the digital 
sphere. Moreover, the blockchain technology concept of zero-knowledge—ability to proof 
something without revealing information—protects the confidentiality of transactions and the 
 114 
privacy of individuals where one can prove something without revealing any information about 
one’s identity or the content of the transaction (Narayanan et al., 2016). 
According to a Coindesk (2017c) article, about 2.4 billion individuals do not have a 
government-issued identity?, and for those who do, the current centralized systems that manage 
those identities are cumbersome at best. The article goes on to suggest that blockchain 
technology could aggregate fragmented identities and reputation systems that are spread out 
across numerous forms such as passports and birth certificates; and platforms like LinkedIn and 
Uber. Drummond Reed, chief trust officer of Evernym—a company building an identity network 
on a permissioned blockchain—argued that fear about privacy is unjustified, stating: ""You do not 
put private data on the chain. You put public data on the chain"" (Coindesk, 2017c). Put in a 
slightly different way, in a blockchain database, one can reveal their public elements of identity, 
while securely encrypt their private elements. Identity and reputation go together hand in hand. 
Identify reputation in the physical world is local according to Tapscott and Tapscott (2016)—
shopkeepers, employers, friends—however, in the blockchain digital economy, reputations is 
globally portable, allowing a resident of Africa to establish the reputation required to borrow 
money from America. Ultimately, the technology enables an open, democratic, and scalable 
digital economy (Wang et al., 2016). 
Appendix B.4: Programable Contracts 
Smart contracts are contracts that are digitally drafted and automatically enforced with 
the goal of attenuating human interventions (de Meijer, 2015; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016; Zhao et 
al., 2016), and hence, reduce transaction costs. Smart contracts are potentially a groundbreaking 
application of blockchain technology. Mougayar (2016) argues that smart contracts are a vital 
underpinning of blockchain technology and their role in blockchain technology is analogous to 
 115 
how HTML allowed information to be openly publishable and linkable on the Web. The 
possibilities for programmable contracts were implanted into the blockchain protocol at its 
contrivance (Swan, 2015). Smart contracts potentially could substitute some of the functions 
currently executed by expensive and slow legacy intermediaries (Mougayar, 2016). 
There are three elements of smart contracts that make them distinct: 1) autonomy— 
ensuing its launch the code acts on its own, 2) self-sufficiency—ability to direct resources on its 
own, and 3) decentralization—distributed over multiple servers where a smart contract is self-
executing across the network (De Filippi, 2014; Swan, 2015). Therefore, a smart contract 
embodies ‘code is law’ because it will execute ‘no matter what’ in a fashion that could introduce 
a new paradigm that requires hefty absorption by the society for smart contracts to become 
common (Swan, 2015). However, Lindman et al. (2017) contend that the standing of smart 
contracts will upsurge by virtue of the broader adoption of the Internet of things. 
A traditional contract is a promise between two or more parties to exchange commitments 
(Swan, 2015). She further posits that while trust plays a central role in traditional contracts, smart 
contracts minimize trust requirements because they are defined and executed by the code (Swan, 
2015). Smart contracts do not change the expected outcome, they only lessen the role of human 
judgment (Swan, 2015). Steve Omohundro, president of think tank Self-Aware Systems, said: 
""That intersection of legal descriptions and software is fundamental, and the smart contracts are 
the first step in that direction"" (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). Smart contracts will potentially 
attenuate court litigations (de Meijer, 2015) and enable frictionless transactions. 
Since the launch of Ethereum in 2015, smart contracts enjoyed increased cognizance. 
Ethereum actualizes the possibilities of smart contracts by furnishing an open source platform 
(Ethereum, n.d.) that is foundational to its mission (Mougayar, 2016). Smart contracts stimulate 
 116 
autonomous economic agents and decentralized autonomous organizations where code displaces 
human management and traditional corporations (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016) because coupled 
with the underlying blockchain platform, smart contracts enable innovative business models and 
settle the trust conundrum more profoundly (Zhao et al., 2016). As such, “smart contract also 
provides a means for owners of assets to pool their resources and create a corporation on the 
blockchain, where the articles of incorporation are coded into the contract, clearly spelling out 
and enforcing the rights of those owners” owners” (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2016). 
For example, a smart contract-based mortgage could reset automatically upon checking a 
prespecified agreement-encoded website (Swan, 2015) or could enable renting hotel rooms 
without human intervention (Zhao et al., 2016). Other simple examples listed by (Swan, 2015) 
are a smart contract that enacts a gift upon a grandchild’s eighteenth birthday, or a pre-
established smart contract that automatically transfers the ownership of a car title to individual 
owner upon completion of payments. A final smart contract example is envisioned by Toyota 
Research Institute where vehicle's sensors could store driving data on a blockchain, hence, 
allowing owners to be eligible for lower insurance rates by virtue of increased transparency, 
reduce fraud, and access to driving data that measures safety habits (Coindesk, 2017d). 
To interconnect smart contracts on the blockchain to off-chain databases, smart oracles 
are required. Smart oracles hold real-world information, such as an identity, a certificate, or any 
data element and could behave in an agent-like fashion to direct the smart contracts (Mougayar, 
2016). Therefore, one could envisage a world of interconnections and interactions between smart 
contracts, smart oracles, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence that would open a wide 
range of possibilities.

Appendix B.5: Programable Money 
As a continuation of the earlier chapter ‘General applications’, this section will discuss 
programable money as the sixth and final chapter touch-point of blockchain technology 
according to the framework of Mougayar (2016). Although Bitcoin will be the focus of the 
discussion, the argument applies to any brand of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is chosen because it is 
the first and the one with largest share in the cryptocurrency market, where numerous brands of 
cryptocurrency have emerged. One example is Litecoin—a platform similar to Bitcoin but faster 
(Kiviat, 2015). 
Money is defined as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account 
(Greeley, 2013; Van Alstyne, 2014). Although Bitcoins have no physical existence, no 
government sponsorship, and operate with mostly technical regulation, Bitcoin has all the of the 
three above mentioned attributes of money (Van Alstyne, 2014). Alternatively, according to 
Bjerg (2016) money could be conceptualized through any of three major theories: commodity 
theory, fiat theory, and credit theory; and “it is arguable that Bitcoin is commodity money 
without gold, fiat money without a state, and credit money without debt.” To the question of 
whether Bitcoin has value, Van Alstyne (2014) answers affirmatively that it already has. He 
further posits that, in the future, countries will establish their own cryptocurrency. Bitcoin 
adoption has increased rapidly, and today Bitcoin is honored as a unit of payment for various 
goods and services (Bjerg, 2016). 
As explained earlier, new Bitcoins are produced by ‘miners’ as a reward for their 
computational participation in the bitcoin network. The cryptocurrency is then circulated in the 
blockchain user’s network and is thereafter exchanged with goods, services or traditional fiat 
currencies. Van Alstyne (2014) argues for Bitcoin over conventional exchange methods stating 
that a) the Bitcoin network furnishes a near frictionless commerce platform that enables less 
 118 
expensive transactions (Andreessen, 2014), b) transcends credit cards at detecting fraud since 
Bitcoin transactions require public authentication, and c) the Bitcoin protocol guarantees that 
only authorized parties can spend from a specific account with a guaranteed desired level of 
privacy and pseudonymity. Nonetheless, the pseudonymity feature led some critics to raise 
concerns related to the misuse of cryptocurrency for unlawful activities (de Meijer, 2015; Van 
Alstyne, 2014). However, conventional payment methods are hardly any different in that respect. 
To the contrary, Van Alstyne (2014) argues that the preferred method of exchange for criminals 
is cash. Moreover, he avers that the immutability and traceability of the blockchain ledger make 
it possible for legal authorities to identify and track lawless activities. 
Bitcoin presents a conceptual departure from conventional forms of money (Bjerg, 2016) 
and, therefore, is a fundamental change to some foundational basics in the financial industry. 
Consequently, it could existentially threaten traditional financial institutions because it radically 
alters the way transactions are conducted. Subsequently, the financial industry must explore how 
to benefit from cryptocurrency while adjusting for consequences that may not be advantageous. 
Consequently, de Meijer (2015) avers that financial institutions may benefit from collaborating 
with the ecosystem around crypto technology. Furthermore, a) cryptocurrencies are increasingly 
adopted by users, b) more salespoints are accepting cryptocurrency as a method for exchange, 
and c) the market cap of cryptocurrencies continues to increase—The reader may refer to 
Appendix E to appreciate the growth of market cap of cryptocurrency. Therefore, the financial 
industry cannot ignore the cryptocurrency growing phenomenon.

Therefore, the financial industry must assess the opportunities and challenges presented by the technology. As a grand breakthrough, it could transform financial transactions and introduce new possibilities for established financial institutions as well as for new entrants. At the same time, incumbents and startups need to overcome technological, regulatory, and adoption challenges before blockchain technology can become a mainstream reality. Despite its potential, the literature on its impact on financial transactions is still fragmented, with weak empirical insights and limited theoretical explanations. Therefore, financial industry managers lack guidance on how to plan and prepare for the impact of blockchain technology on the operation of financial transactions.
Against that backdrop, this dissertation explores the asserted and potential impacts on financial transactions with emphasis on asset verification, record keeping, data privacy, and transaction costs. The dissertation adopts a pluralist approach to examine the subject matter based on three approaches: analysis of the extant literature about blockchain technology concerning financial transactions; perception analysis based on interviews with financial executives, subject matter experts, and researchers; and a theoretical interpretation using transaction cost theory. Therefore, the dissertation synthesizes insights from the three approaches to offer managers of financial institutions guidance concerning the opportunities and challenges of blockchain technology","['text', 'Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology', 'Financial Transactions', 'Asset Verification', 'Record Keeping', 'Data Privacy', 'Transaction Cost Theory']",disabled

Abstract 
 
“In the future, virtually every function in the world of financial services will be displaced, 
disintermediated and decentralized. The Internet gave us a powerful way to share and 
access information. Blockchain now gives us a powerful way to share and access value.”

During a February 2017 AICPA roundtable, Chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain 
Alliance and previous Global Head of Trading Analytics at Thomson Reuters, Ron 
Quarantana spoke to the revolutionary scale of blockchain. Quaranta, viewed by many as 
an expert in financial technology, predicts that the adoption of blockchain, both by the 
Big Four accounting firms and their clients, will disrupt the accounting industry by 
greatly reducing the time and skill needed to perform a quality audit. Some, such as 
Thomson Reuters’ Jon Baron, even claim that blockchain may eliminate the need for 
financial statement audits altogether. 2 To many, blockchain is synonymous with Bitcoin, 
the cryptocurrency that, over the past three years, has returned 3,310%, compared to 35% 
and 36% returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), respectively. 
Blockchain, however, is much more than Bitcoin, with applications stretching further 
than cryptocurrency. Rather, it is a peer-to-peer hosted public ledger that does not require 
a central authority to support or verify transactions, and is unalterable in future periods. 
In this study, I propose to examine what blockchain technology means for the 887,000 
people currently employed by the Big Four. More specifically, I seek to expand upon 
whether the potential adoption of blockchain in the coming years will reduce audit fees, 
impact audit quality, or perhaps do away with the audit completely.

Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 In a sector that is still struggling to fully recover from the Enron and WorldCom 
scandals of 2002, the opportunity to provide investors with greater trust and transparency 
is paramount. Blockchain has the potential to do just that, while also reducing costs and 
improving efficiency. However, great risk and uncertainty accompany the possible 
benefits. Experts predict blockchain adoption is expected to accelerate during 2018 and 
may have a profound impact for enterprises as well as their auditors. Blockchain has been 
compared to both the computer and the Internet in that these technologies have had 
similarly powerful implications for business models across different industries. 
Broadening the scope, technology has drastically altered the way audits are performed 
over time, and will continue to do so moving forward.  
 “When I started, it was common for computers to be assigned to each engagement 
team, not each individual” wrote Elizabeth Paul, a PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) 
partner who has been with the firm for twenty-five years. 3 Flash-forward a quarter of a 
century, and engagement teams cannot operate without technology, leveraging 
“sophisticated, proprietary software to capture, analyze, interpret, and document” the vast 
amount of information that must be audited every reporting period. 4 Technological 
advancements, including the computer, Internet, email, and proprietary software 
development, have certainly improved audit efficiency. A note often forgotten, however,

is that the businesses being audited evolved with this technology as well, becoming larger 
and more complicated, while also having more data and transactions in need of auditing. 
So while, in a vacuum, auditing firms could have reduced cost and improved quality 
(although whether technology has actually improved audit quality to date can certainly be 
debated) due to timesaving, the added efficiency was instead necessary due to 
increasingly complex audits.  
 While not the sole reason for the Enron scandal in late 2001, technological 
improvements played a role in the fiasco that resulted in what was at the time the largest 
corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. In the face of natural gas pipeline deregulation that 
took place in 1985, Enron altered its business model to stay profitable. Using high-speed 
internal networks, the company became a “Gas-bank”, selling natural gas reserves to 
buyers when the price became profitable. 5 Enron then extended this strategy to futures 
contracts and derivatives in coal, steel, and other natural resources in the early 1990s. Its 
utilization of cutting edge data analysis and other technology allowed Enron to make a 
profit on most of these trades. In October of 1999, Enron dove further into developing 
their business with technology, with the introduction of Enron Online, a commodities 
trading website that gave the enterprise even more data points related to vital trading 
information that it could then use in its own business.  The use of technology in its energy 
market trading was by no means illegal, but it both complicated and grew the business to 
the point that, by the late 1990s, Enron’s external auditor, Arthur Anderson, had “a whole

floor of auditors” working on the company at fiscal year-end. 6 The improved auditing 
efficiency due to technology in this case was offset by the business growth and changes, 
so much so that it allowed other errors to slip through the cracks.  
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
(SOX) in 2002, in part as a response to the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals 
that had previously taken place. SOX created an oversight board named the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), whose role is to set standards for the 
auditors of public firms as well as inspect the quality of audits performed. 7 SOX 
drastically changed both the time and cost needed to perform a quality audit, as well as 
what exactly an audit of a public company entails. I will discuss the SEC, PCAOB, SOX, 
and how they relate to the audit further in Chapter 2. With the change in presidential 
office and majority party, there has been a push to alter some of the SOX requirements, 
some proposing the extreme idea of repealing the act altogether. While articles have been 
written both in support and opposition of SOX, it seems unlikely, given the fallout 
following the Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco scandals, that SOX will be altered in the near 
future. Thus, the further discussion of blockchain and how it will impact the audit refer to 
what an audit consists of on day of publication, with SOX still enacted.  
 The question of what technological changes will occur in the near future, and how 
they will change the audit, should constantly be on the minds of both decision makers and 
individual auditors of the Big Four, as well as the regulators of the accounting and

auditing industries. Throughout this paper, I will tackle these concerns as they relate 
specifically to blockchain. In order to do so, it is first necessary to develop a deep 
understanding of the technology, and how it may be implemented and used by 
businesses, accountants, and auditors. Will blockchain achieve all that its proponents 
argue it can, or is the excitement around the supposed groundbreaking technology 
supported solely by hype? Throughout my research, I sifted through articles claiming that 
blockchain will fully automate the audit and thus eliminate the auditor completely. Are 
these articles hoping to garner clicks and attention through outrageous claims, or is there 
something substantial behind them? Should those entering the auditing profession be 
worried that they will be out of the job in years to come? This study has implications for 
both current and future auditors, as well as the regulators of the accounting and auditing 
professions. The paper will further examine the stances that the PCAOB, American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB), and SEC will take on the subject, as well as the potential new regulations 
therein. Tom Mornini, CEO of Subledger, a startup focused on helping businesses 
integrate blockchain into their accounting systems, commented that “the Big Four 
accounting guys clearly know it will affect their future, although I’m not quite sure that 
they are clear as to how.” 8 This study will answer that very question, as well as examine 
the future of the audit, and what multibillion-dollar investment decisions audit firms 
should be making today regarding emerging blockchain technology.

Chapter 2 - The History of Regulatory Authorities and the Audit 
 In 1494, Franciscan friar Luca Pacioli published “Summary of Arithmetic, 
Geometry, and Proportions,” which, among other teachings, outlined the double-entry 
accounting system. While many credit Pacioli for inventing what has become standard 
accounting practice, he instead was summarizing the methods being used by Venetian 
merchants to keep track of their day-to-day business. 9 Double-entry accounting is based 
on providing validation for every journal entry made with a corresponding event. In a 
simple example, in order to credit a revenue account, a merchant must have debited the 
cash account. This ensured that merchants were not recording fictitious sales or entering a 
sale twice. Pacioli should be credited, however, for compiling the method and publishing

method of accounting is overdue for an update, and blockchain proponents point to their 
technology as the basis for this upgrade. 
 It wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution that the auditing of a company’s 
financials, for the purpose of detecting fraud and establishing financial accountability, 
became relatively common. The Industrial Revolution, which spanned the late 18th and 
early 19th centuries, brought with it an influx of companies operating in the newly formed 
United States; and with these companies came new investment opportunities, such as the 
purchase of stock. The railroads specifically were instrumental in their reporting of

operating metrics and use of accountants. 10 Although the New York Stock Exchange 
(NYSE) was not the first stock exchange in the U.S. (that title goes to the Philadelphia 
Stock Exchange, which opened for business in 1790, one year before the NYSE), it 
quickly became the most popular and provided much needed liquidity to a company’s 
shareholders. 11 New York, and Wall Street in particular, was at the heart of American 
business and entrepreneurship, and the NYSE’s location helped it grow into the gold 
standard that it is today.  
 Prior to the development of the stock exchange, an investor would own a 
company’s stock for the purpose of receiving a dividend. In the event that said investor 
wanted or needed to sell the stock, they would have to seek out a broker to negotiate a 
trade, and would often receive less than fair value for their sale. The NYSE, however, 
created a market for the purchase and sale of stock. While certainly a positive for 
economic growth and opportunity, the stock market allowed speculators to purchase 
stock for the sole purpose of selling it later at a higher price, without thought of the 
potential dividends or underlying business. The introduction of speculators to the market 
meant that investors began relying more on a firm’s financial reports to ensure the 
company, whose stock they were purchasing, was sound. Not all firms at the time issued

differed on the scope of their audits.   
 The mid to late 1920s brought soaring stock prices and a prolonged bull market, 
all at a time when the popularity of the stocks reached a new high. From 1924 to 1929, 
the DJIA quadrupled. 12 With relatively little history of a long-lasting bull market, some 
investors believed that stock prices would never go down and could only increase in the 
future. The gains that investors experienced during the “Hoover bull market”, as it was 
coined, meant more ordinary civilians (those not directly employed in finance) began 
jumping into the market. Some mortgaged their houses and put the rest of life savings 
into stocks, while others simply invested on margin. By 1929, an estimated 40% of all 
bank loans were put into the market by investors. 13 Late October of 1929 saw the end of 
the bull market, and the crash that followed wiped out $25 billion in life savings, 
equivalent to $373 billion in today’s dollars. 14 Black Thursday (October 25, 1929) saw a 
record number of shares, 12.9 million, traded, only to have that record topped on Black 
Monday (October 28, 1929). Black Monday and Tuesday saw the DJIA drop 25%, and 
investors who had bought on borrowed money faced margin calls and were forced into 
debt. While many factors were at play, experts point to irrational speculation as a cause 
of the crash. It wiped out businesses and retirement savings, banks began closing their 
doors, and it caused the public to lose faith in the stock market. Trust in business,

financial reporting, and the capital markets is vital to a healthy economy. Following the 
crash, the trust of the American public was in need of repair. 
 Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President of the United States in November 
1932 after campaigning under the promise of a “New Deal” to help the country reverse 
the widespread economic depression. Within two months of taking office, Roosevelt, 
with the help of Congress, passed the Securities Act of 1933.  15 Prior to the “truth in 
securities” law, as it was often referred, an initial offering of stock to the public markets 
was regulated under individual state law, which allowed for looser regulation and a lack 
of transparency for investors.  
 The Securities Act of 1933 instead took the responsibility of regulation away from 
states and placed it in the hands of the federal government. Overseen by the SEC (which 
wasn’t officially created until June 1934 when Roosevelt signed the Securities Exchange 
Act into law), the 1933 Act requires companies to submit a prospectus, containing a 
description of the business, the security type, management information, and certified 
financial statements, prior to an initial public offering. Shortly after review by the SEC, 
the prospectus becomes public and can be accessed by institutional and individual 
investors. The Act’s two primary objectives are to “require that investors receive 
financial and other significant information concerning securities being offered for public 
sale; and (to) prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities.”

16 The Act specifically requires financial reports to “contain … audited financial 
statements” that are to be reviewed “by an independent public or certified accountant.” 
Furthermore, the financial statements must be in accordance with the accounting 
principles of the “standard setting body.” 17  
The federal government further protected investors by enacting the Securities and 
Exchange Act of 1934. Not only did this legislation officially establish the SEC, but it 
also requires all publicly traded companies listed on a U.S. exchange to submit various 
“annual and other periodic reports” 18 that are in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP), as verified by an independent auditor, to the SEC, who 
will then release the reports to the public. 19 The SEC mandates that companies issue 
reports four separate times during a fiscal year, broken into three quarterly reports and 
one full fiscal year report. The Securities Act of 1933 and Securities and Exchange Act of 
1934 cemented the need for auditors in public markets, with the role of provide assurance 
to creditors and other lenders that the financials prepared by management fairly represent 
economic position and are free of fraudulent information.  
Before 1933, accountants in the United States followed standards issued by the 
United Kingdom-based Association of International Accountants (AIA). After its

founding in 1934, the newly established SEC entrusted the responsibility for setting the 
accounting standards, known as GAAP, to the private sector. The AICPA served this role 
from 1933 until 1973, and was then replaced by the newly established FASB. Prior to the 
FASB, the AICPA organized and appointed members to the Committee on Accounting 
Procedures (CAP) to set standards. The CAP was then relieved of its duties in 1959 with 
the AICPA’s establishment of the Accounting Principles Board (APB). The APB was 
still under the oversight of the AICPA, and was primarily instituted with the intention of 
developing a condensed conceptual framework. In addition to setting GAAP (through the 
CAP and APB), the AICPA provided oversight on auditing procedures and issued 
numerous Statements on Auditing Procedures, which altered the work required by an 
independent auditor to provide assurance on the financials. Despite the establishment of 
the FASB, the AICPA continued setting these generally accepted auditing standards 
(GAAS) for the independent audits of public companies up until 2002. 20 The AICPA 
issued the first auditing standard, Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 1, as a response 
to the McKesson & Robbins fraud case.  
Prior to the Statement on Auditing Procedure No. 1, it was commonplace for 
independent auditors to trust, but not necessarily verify, management’s assertions and 
verification routines. 21 McKesson & Robbins’ independent auditor, Price Waterhouse 
(now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers), accepted the company as a client under the

agreement it would not examine inventories nor receivables. 22 After the fraudulent 
behavior was discovered, Price Waterhouse was forced by the SEC to repay all auditing 
fees received since it began serving the client, and the AICPA issued Procedure No. 1. 
While the procedure only “required that auditors inspect inventories and confirm 
receivables,” 23 it took a major step in implying that auditors were responsible for 
independently performing specific auditing procedures on the business and its 
transactions itself, rather than simply relying on management’s own work. Furthermore, 
the issuance of Standard Auditing Procedure No. 1 began a trend of reactionary measures 
to cases of fraud, which have shaped the auditing standards in place today.  
 The FASB established itself in 1973 as a seven-member board with the mission to 
“improve financial accounting and reporting standards.” 24 Compared to previous 
organizations, the FASB was distinguishable through its independence. It required 
members to sever all ties with accounting firms and previous employers, removing the 
chance of a conflict of interests. The SEC recognized the FASB as its new private sector 
choice for setting GAAP. Apart from issuing new standards, the FASB hoped to improve 
on the AICPA’s previous work, and created the Emerging Issues Task Force (ETIF) in 
1984 to more rapidly serve the accounting community when problems regarding financial

reporting occur. 25 The ETIF has been a positive step taken by the standard setters to 
quickly address issues that arise that cannot wait for a new standard to be issued, while 
also allowing the FASB to deeply assess what the longer-term solution should be. 
Regardless, the FASB is still criticized for the speed and timeliness at which they issue 
new standards, oftentimes years after financial reporting questions arise. To date, the 
FASB has issued eight concept statements regarding financial reporting and has also 
undertaken the project of condensing GAAP into a searchable database through the 
Accounting Standards Codification project.  
 2002 brought sweeping changes that the auditing profession hadn’t seen since the 
early 1930s. President Bush even commented on the day that he signed SOX into law that 
it is “the most far reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt” and that “the era of low standards and false profits is over.” 
26 Congress passed SOX as a response to the failure of the auditing profession to prevent 
or catch the fraudulent behavior that resulted in the Enron and WorldCom scandals. 
Named after its spokespersons, Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and 
Republican Congressman Michael Oxley of Ohio, SOX is enforced by the SEC and 
compliance is mandatory for all public reporting entities. 27  
 Aimed at improving accountability for both management and auditors, the law has 
increased both the cost of performing an audit as well as audit quality, although whether

this has occurred in a linear relationship is open to debate. SOX established the PCAOB 
as an oversight committee to the auditing industry that has the freedom to conduct 
inspections and investigations on specific audit engagements or the auditing firms 
themselves, and has the power to issue disciplinary fines or worse to public accounting 
firms. Furthermore, the PCAOB is in charge of registering the accounting firms that audit 
public companies, as well as establishing ethical and independence related standards. 28 
The auditing community, up until SOX, lacked a regulating body for its own work, and 
after the Arthur Anderson debacle, it became clear that the PCAOB was a needed entity. 
The PCAOB has instituted major changes to auditing rules and regulations, such as 
prohibiting a firm’s auditor from providing said client with consulting services, and 
instituting mandatory partner rotation and cooling off periods. 
 Other influential conditions of SOX are housed within Sections 302 and 404. 
Section 302 requires key members of management to personally certify the accuracy of 
their firm’s financials. By doing so, management becomes responsible for cases of 
fraudulent behavior that materially effect the financials and investors, and can face 
charges brought against themselves by the SEC.29 Section 302 rebalances the risk-reward 
structure that management faces when contemplating whether or not to commit fraud. 
Section 404 requires management to establish proper internal controls within their 
company and also requires independent auditors to opine on the adequacy of the internal 
controls as well as notify the public of any material weaknesses. Section 404 has

increased the cost of completing an audit drastically, yet “83 % of large corporations 
agreed that SOX increased investor confidence” and one third of those firms reported that 
it has reduced fraud. 30  
 SOX has changed the auditing industry in an attempt to better protect users of a 
firm’s financials from fraud and other inadequate accounting practices. Since SOX was 
enacted in 2002, both the public accounting firms and their clients’ businesses have been 
impacted by technological changes, including the developments of automation, big data, 
and machine learning. It is important to understand the key players in the regulatory field, 
and the acts they’ve taken in the past, as it will help better predict the steps they may take 
in the future. Blockchain is a promising technology that the SEC has on its radar. In order 
to understand what impact blockchain may have on the auditing world, however, an in-
depth knowledge of technology, and its benefits and limitations, is needed.

Chapter 3 - Blockchain: An Extended Discussion of the Technology 
 The cryptocurrency craze of the past year has driven the public’s awareness of 
blockchain. Some only know that blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin, and often 
confuse the two terms or use them interchangeably. While blockchain is a vital 
component of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, it is not limited to 
serving as the building blocks of digitally encrypted money. In fact, the immutable link 
between blockchain and bitcoin has caused an association that some companies are either 
confused by or exploiting. For instance, certain companies have been rebranding 
themselves in an effort to either fool investors or drastically change their line of business. 
 On December 21, 2017, beverage producer Long Island Iced Tea Corporation 
issued a press release stating it would be changing its name to Long Blockchain 
Corporation, due to the “once-in-a-generation opportunity” that blockchain could, among 
other benefits, create “a clearer audit trail.” 31 The company’s NASDAQ listed stock 
jumped 300 % following the announcement, with its market cap increasing from $24 
million to nearly $92 million in one trading period. 32 Whether the company will succeed 
in its new endeavors remains to be seen, but the NASDAQ is forcing its hand, with plans

to delist Long Blockchain based on the notion that the company is attempting to “take 
advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology.” 33  
 In the broadest sense, blockchain is a peer-to-peer network that securely keeps 
track of records or data and can be accessed publicly. Specifically relating to the financial 
world, blockchain is a distributed ledger platform that benefits from all of the underlying 
aspects of the technology. Before going further, it is important to note that there is not a 
single blockchain on which everything is stored. Instead, there are individual blockchains 
that serve a variety of specific purposes. There is a blockchain that coincides with every 
cryptocurrency, keeping record of the transactions involving, and trading of, each unique 
coin. The reason that there are multiple different cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, 
Etheruem, or Ripple, is that each is built on its own separate blockchain platform, all with 
subtle differences that support various attributes. As you’ll recall, however, blockchain is 
much more than the support system for cryptocurrency, and this technology has the 
potential to be used in keeping record of all sorts of transactions, data, assets, or 
contracts. Briefly, however, we will focus on the bitcoin blockchain, as I believe it 
provides a simple example of what exactly a blockchain is. The statements below 
regarding the bitcoin blockchain are ubiquitous with all blockchains; however, 
conceptualizing the blockchain platform using a virtual currency makes it easier to 
develop an understanding of the technology. Differences in various types of blockchains 
will be discussed in depth once a general knowledge base is achieved.

The bitcoin blockchain is a distributed ledger that contains, in chronological 
format, every transaction (as well as other data, such as time, sender, and receiver) that 
has ever occurred involving bitcoin, and can be viewed by anyone at any time. A 
distributed ledger is a ledger that is not stored on a single computer or single network. An 
example of a non-distributed ledger would be an excel file or other ledger-based platform 
that is saved in a single location, whether it be on a hard drive or on the cloud. Every time 
an addition to this type of ledger needs to be made, the user must open the file from the 
location where it’s saved, make the change, and overwrite the previous copy. This is not 
the case when additions are made to a distributed ledger. Up-to-date copies of the ledger 
are stored across “thousands of computers” that are connected to the bitcoin network.34 
 The bitcoin distributed ledger is also, however, a searchable database, where any 
user can verify a specific transaction along with other information about said transaction 
based on an identifying combination of letters and numbers. Each transaction is housed 
inside a larger grouping known as a block. These blocks, which are identified by a 
number referred to as the block’s ‘height’ (or less often a block’s ‘number’), contain an 
average of 983 distinct transactions. 35 A transaction, in this instance, would be one user 
sending any number of bitcoins to another user, either as a payment for services, goods, 
or other economic activity.  The number of transactions in a given block will fluctuate 
over time and depends mostly on size of transactions, number of transactions occurring in 
the market, and computing power needed to solve complex algorithms (as part of the

encryption process). A block’s identifying number is reported or referenced in the format 
of “block” followed by its height.  
The first block of the blockchain began with the height (identifying number) of 0, 
and is thus referred to as block 0, and each block’s height thereafter is simply one more 
than the previous block. 36 For example, the next group of transactions that occurred after 
block 0 are located in block 1, and so on. Thus, no two blocks in a blockchain can have 
the same height. At time of writing, the bitcoin blockchain consists of 512,239 distinct 
blocks, with the most recent block having the height of 512238 and being referred to as 
block 512238 (a block’s height is reported without commas). 37 Remember, this single 
block, block 512238, contains hundreds (738 distinct transactions for block 512238) of 
individual transactions within it. 38  
Anyone can download the bitcoin blockchain (by going to 
bitcoin.org/en/download) and can then see an extensive list of the transactions that have 
taken place since inception of the platform in 2009 (although this requires a lot of 
memory space, at time of writing the file size is over 145GB). 39 Another option that will 
save the data cost is to visit a third party that reports on the blockchain, such as 
blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info. A portion of the downloaded bitcoin blockchain is 
reproduced in Exhibit 1. 40 The height of each block is reported under the “Number”

Exhibit 1: 
 
 
Compiling hundreds of transactions into a larger group and timestamping when 
said transactions are processed isn’t revolutionary. What makes the blockchain unique 
and useful, however, is in the encryption method that the platform uses in processing and 
verifying transactions. This technology is also what makes a blockchain immutable. New 
transactions are added to the ledger through what is known as ‘mining’. Mining begins 
with a computer connected to the distributed ledger that also is running the bitcoin 
software (known as a node). Any computer with Internet access and enough storage can 
download the bitcoin software for free. Keeping the software running can prove costly, 
however, as it uses the computer’s data storage and power source. 41 A node will create a 
new block from outstanding transactions on the network by solving a difficult 
mathematical problem. This is done approximately every ten minutes for the bitcoin

	 24 
blockchain, but it is up to the programmer of the specific blockchain to design. The 
complex equation is produced by code written in the bitcoin platform, and must be solved 
in order for a node to add the new block to the ledger. The problem that needs solving 
requires finding a number that is based on the data in the newly organized block, as well 
as a hash function.42  
A hash function is an encryption technique that takes input data, alters it in a 
manner that is consistent to a set of rules, and creates a fixed length output. If the input 
data is at all altered, the output hash will be different. One benefit of hash functions is 
that they can take a relatively large amount of input data and produce an output hash that 
is compressed. Blockchain’s use of hash functions is what makes the ledger unalterable, 
secure, and trusted. The bitcoin blockchain mainly uses a hash function known as SHA-
256 (Secure Hash Algorithm - 256), although RIPEMD, the RACE (Research and 
Development in Advanced Communications Technologies in Europe) Integrity Primitives 
Evaluation Message Digest, is also used. 43  
SHA–256, which was created by the NSA, will take input data and produce a 
fixed length output of letters and numbers that is 64 characters (256 bits in computer 
science) long. 44 For example, SHA–256 takes simple input data such as the text string 
“blockchain” and produces the output hash, known as the message digest in the

important aspect of hash functions is that it is nearly impossible (would take “years” of 
time spent computing) to take the message digest and discern the input data. 46 In other 
words, the output hash cannot be reversed to find out what the input data was, thus 
keeping the data secure and private. It is important to remember that other blockchains, 
besides the bitcoin blockchain, use hash functions and can be programmed using unique 
hash functions.  
Nodes begin the process of adding a new block to the ledger by first verifying 
individual transactions. Nodes verify these transaction by “running a series of checks” 
that include confirming the coins being spent are available to the payer, confirming the 
payer has signed off on the transaction via his private password (key), and confirming 
that the payee’s transaction information matches that of the payer. 47 Each transaction is 
tagged with its own transaction ID, or TXID. Each TXID is generated, not surprisingly, 
using the SHA-256 hash function to secure the information. This TXID, however, can be 
used to look up, at any time, information about the transaction, such as amount of money

sent, sender, and recipient(s). The sender and recipient’s identity is protected by the 
address system. An individual or company’s address, or alphanumeric identifier used to 
specify the destination a payment would go to, operates similar to how an email address 
works. In order to the payer to send money to the payee, both must know each other’s 
correct address. Transactions must agree from both the payer and payee’s standpoint to 
be executed. To offer another layer of privacy, these addresses were only intended to be 
used for a single transaction. For instance, once the payer and payee have transacted, 
each should never use those specific addresses again. Instead, a payee will claim their 
money by entering their address along with a private alphanumeric key, which operates 
as a password of sorts.  
When this public address is matched with the correct private key, the bitcoin, or 
other cryptocurrency, will be deposited into their individual account. Those who choose 
to operate with less privacy, however, tend to reuse their addresses instead of generating 
new ones. Once a node combines a group of verified transactions into a new block, it 
must solve the mathematical equation. This complex math boils down to guessing a 
number that combines with the transaction data included in the new block and the 
previous block on the ledger’s own message digest or output hash. This combination of 
data then runs through the SHA-256 hash function to produce a desired output. The 
message digest required to solve the problem must start with a certain number of zeroes. 
48 The number of zeroes required can be altered to make the equation more or less 
difficult to solve, generally based on the number of miners working to solve the problem,

but also to give the platform protection. For bitcoin’s blockchain platform, the number 
that will produce an acceptable message digest from the hash equation, also known as a 
nonce, will be an “integer between 0 and 4,294,967,396.” 49 Computers will guess at 
random and run the hash function, as it is impossible to predict the message digest 
produced based solely on the data and a number added to it.  
Essentially, a massive game of guessing and checking followed by guessing again 
will continue until a nonce is found. Often, there is more than one nonce that will produce 
the required message digest. In other cases, no nonces exist that will combine with the 
specific input transaction data to produce the required message digest, and transactions 
must be either added or removed from the previous attempt to solve the equation. 50 The 
node will then work again to find a nonce based on the new grouping. In the bitcoin 
blockchain, the nodes that complete the mining are rewarded in bitcoins for the energy 
and computing power they have spent. It is a race of sorts to solve the complex equation 
and receive the reward. This economic reward is vital to a public blockchain such as 
bitcoin, as it ensures that transactions are being processed and that blocks are being added 
to the ledger. A more private-facing blockchain, however, can get around this bitcoin 
model through other means, which will be discussed in Chapter 4. 
When a miner solves the equation, the new block can be added to the ledger. 
Once added, other nodes in the system verify the new block through a method known as 
‘consensus’. Consensus is the process of several separate miners providing validity to a

new block. 51 This is done through the same process that a single miner uses to validate a 
transaction or block, but on a larger scale. Other nodes check the found nonce to see if 
the proposed block was solved correctly, and is valid. A simple way to think about 
consensus is that it is a checks and balances system for a decentralized ledger. Rather 
than requiring a branch of government to keep others in order, consensus operates by 
requiring multiple nodes to come to the same conclusion regarding a transaction block. It 
is the backbone that allows a public decentralized network to operate without foul play or 
mishap. If nodes think that the new block contains fraudulent activity, they can refuse to 
validate the block and create what is known as a fork in the blockchain, by either 
proposing their own new block and going through the entire mathematical process again, 
or by verifying a block proposed by another node. 52   
Once consensus is met, the new block is timestamped and added to the 
blockchain. It is transparent to the public, meaning any node can access it. When 
downloading the bitcoin blockchain, it would now include the verified block. Adding the 
approved block to the ledger uses the cryptography included in the previous step of 
solving the mathematical equation. Included in the input data entered into the SHA-256 
hash function is the message digest of the previous block. By including the previous 
block’s message digest (output hash) in the new hash encryption, the new block (along 
with all of the transactions housed inside it) can be added to the ledger and locked in

place. The block cannot be re-arranged, removed, or altered in any way. Altering any of 
the data of either the previous block or the new block would mean altering the input data, 
and would thus produce a different message digest, breaking the cryptographic link and 
alerting those viewing the ledger that data has been changed. The only way for a hacker 
or someone else who wishes to alter the blockchain to do so without being detected 
would require what is known as a “51% attack” or majority attack. 53  
Such an attack could only occur in a scenario where more than 50% of all nodes 
operating the distributed ledger platform are attacked simultaneously and the ledgers 
cryptographic output hashes and links are rewritten. Another way to think of this is that a 
platform attacker would have to rewrite every single block of the ledger in a very small 
amount of time. This would take massive amounts of computing power and money, and 
is viewed as “practically impossible,” 54 as long as the distributed platform is large 
enough. 55 Given the miniscule possibility of this occurring, the new block is chained into 
place on the ledger, unalterable, public, and free from error. All transactions on the 
platform have been verified.  
So does this mean that the bitcoin blockchain and other blockchain platforms will 
never need to be audited? In regards to the bitcoin blockchain, the answer to this question 
is, at least for the time being, a clouded maybe. The question is complicated by the ethos

of bitcoin. While it served a general purpose in this paper of helping develop an 
understanding of how blockchain operates, bitcoin differs drastically from blockchain. 
Satoshi Nakamoto detailed what has now become known as blockchain in their white 
paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System.” 56 Nakamoto is the 
identity, or pseudonym, of the unknown designer or designers of the bitcoin system. 
Though never identified, Nakamoto is revered for creating a system that allows secure 
payments through a trusted platform, without having to rely on financial intermediaries to 
vouch for specific parties. 
The platform relies on blockchain technology. Bitcoin, as well as other 
cryptocurrencies, have become a symbol of anti-establishment movements, as well as 
proof for the idea that trusted transactions can occur outside of the financial system of the 
21st century. Hidden within its design is a resistance to central banking and financial 
institutions. Bitcoin represents a desire to transact without the use of government-
sponsored currency. Furthermore, the transactions can be verified and separate parties 
can be trusted through the platform, without the need for an intermediary to vouch or 
attest. Blockchain technology, however, exists without the attached ideology of bitcoin.  
The technology is the intersection of security, trust, and transparency. By 
operating in a distributed manner, blockchain is not stored in any location and cannot be 
altered by a single bad actor. Blockchain solves the double-spend problem, so that digital 
currency or assets cannot be spent or owned by more than one party. The double-spend 
problem has been a thorn for intermediaries since the use of digital currency became

commonplace. It occurs when an owner of cash is successful in spending the same money 
in two different transactions. Melanie Swan, author of “Blockchain: Blueprint for a New 
Economy,” likens digital cash to an electronic document. This document can be saved as 
an attachment in various separate emails. In other words, it is “infinitely copiable.” 57 
Without blockchain, a third party (such as a bank, or “quasibank like PayPal”) is required 
to validate transactions and confirm that the payee hasn’t already spent the money used in 
a transaction.58  
The double-spend problem also exists in regards to digital assets, where 
ownership of the same tangible item can exist between multiple parties until an 
intermediary verifies the correct owner. Blockchain solves this problem through both the 
cryptographic and distributed aspects of the technology. The benefits and broad use-cases 
of the technology give rise to the possibility that blockchain will be integrated into a 
company’s business or accounting systems, changing what the audit may look like in the 
future. There are other specifics to blockchain platforms, such as the differences between 
permissible and semi-permissible blockchains, and proof-of-work platforms versus proof-
of-stake platforms, that still haven’t been explained. These will be discussed in Chapter 4 
and 5 when analyzing in what cases it makes sense for a client to adopt blockchain 
platforms.

Chapter 4 – Client Implementation of Blockchain Technology – Financial Firms 
 If blockchain is going to impact both the audit and the firms that perform audit 
services, it will need to find its place within the client’s business. Roger O’Donnell, an 
audit partner at KPMG’s New York office, reaffirmed this concept during a conference 
on current financial reporting issues that took place in late 2017. Commenting on 
leveraging the latest technology for the audit, O’Donnell mentioned, “A lot of it also 
depends on the clients (and) the systems that they have.” 59 Auditing is a client service, 
and although auditors have a responsibility to the investing public, among other 
stakeholders, they ultimately shape their audit around the systems and models that their 
clients are using. 
 Are the Big Four’s clients currently implementing blockchain, and if not, is it 
likely they will in the near future? The answer to this question will shape what steps audit 
firms should, or shouldn’t, be taking with regards to investment the blockchain space. It 
will provide insight into the tangible and intangible skills required for students pursuing a 
career in public accounting. For clients to implement blockchain into their business, there 
needs to be a clear value add that outweighs the cost, both in terms of initial investment 
as well as operational spend. J.P. Morgan Chase (J.P. Morgan), audited by PwC, began a 
blockchain pilot program in October 2017, aimed at enabling “faster, more secure 
transfer of cross-border payments between (itself), Royal Bank of Canada, and Australia 
																																																								
59 Michael Cohn, “Audit Technology Evolving Quickly at Big Four,”

and New Zealand Banking Group.” 60 Without blockchain, global payment processing, 
even for the nation’s largest bank, must work its way through a complicated system with 
multiple participants and various points of communication. The Wall Street Journal 
estimates that verifying and processing these global payments, which can take up to two 
weeks using legacy systems, could be cut down to “hours” by implementing blockchain 
technology. 61 The legacy systems in place often require banks to make or reply to 
inquiries from the transacting party.  
 J.P. Morgan receives an average of 150,000 of these inquiries annually when 
processing payments. The blockchain pilot program, known as the Interbank Information 
Network (IIN), processes payments quickly by securely linking both multiple banks’ 
information as well as their individual client records together, which will decrease “the 
number of steps needed… to check and rectify mismatches in a cross-border payment.” 62 
Clearly there is justified value proposition for updating global payments systems with 
blockchain. Unsurprisingly, little has been reported regarding the success of the pilot 
program. A bank as big as J.P. Morgan would be unlikely to broadcast either a success or 
failure of a pilot program, for fear tipping off competitors. A comment made by CEO

Jamie Dimon at a conference in Washington, D.C., however, provides a clue that CEO 
Jamie Dimon has been pleased so far. “We actually use it. It will be useful for a lot of 
different things, God bless the blockchain.” 63 CFO Marianne Lake commented that 
payments flagged for compliance “can be delayed for up to two weeks (using the legacy 
system), but this technology can reduce that to minutes.” 64 Furthermore, other 
announcements from the bank point to the success of the pilot platform. Umar Farooq, 
head of innovation for J.P. Morgan, mentioned that the bank has extended work on six 
other blockchain prototypes in their newly established Blockchain Center of Excellence, 
powered by Quorum, an “enterprise-focused” blockchain platform. 65  
 The pilot blockchain used by J.P. Morgan differs both from the distributed ledger 
that powers cryptocurrencies and from the blockchain that was outlined in Chapter 3. It 
would be illogical for a bank to allow the public to access the information on their global 
payments blockchain, yet a key aspect of cryptocurrency blockchains are their 
transparency. A bank, however, must protect both client information and information on 
flows of funds. No banking client wants his or her neighbor or coworker to be able to 
access and download the distributed payments ledger online. Cryptocurrency platforms 
provide both transparency and privacy through the use of unique addresses and private 
keys. Banks cannot operate in a similar fashion, as internally they must know the identity

of account holders in order to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-
Money Laundering (AML) regulation. Furthermore, complying with both AML and KYC 
not only requires institutions to maintain identity information on customers, but also 
requires the banks to continually monitor client’s transactions, which certainly doesn’t 
align with a blockchain designed for cryptocurrency. 66 
Taking a step back from financial institutions, similar compliance problems arise 
for other companies looking to implement blockchain technology. Companies in the U.S. 
must comply with parts of AML and KYC under Title 18 United States Code Sections 
1956 and 1957. 67  While far less strict than the rules governing financial institutions, 
Sections 1956 and 1957 prohibit companies from taking part in transactions of greater 
than $10,000 that derive from either criminal or illegal activity. Thus firms are required 
to perform due diligence on their customers and suppliers, and continue to monitor both 
for any violations. This prevents businesses, not just financial institutions, from operating 
on a blockchain where identities are concealed.  
The public transparency of the blockchain described in Chapter 3, but without 
private identities, doesn’t suit businesses operating strategies either. No firm would 
willingly provide supplier information or up-to-the-minute sales data on a public 
blockchain that could be downloaded by a competitor. Furthermore, while the investing 
public tends to be in favor of further transparency, it remains to be seen whether the SEC

would allow firms to have current transaction data available instantaneously to the public. 
So while aspects of Satoshi Nakamoto’s blockchain provides value that justifies 
implementation by firms, the broad transparency as well as anonymousness of individuals 
on the platform described in Chapter 3 creates problems for enterprises. Ironically, a 
public blockchain is both too transparent (instant access for anyone to information on it) 
and not transparent enough (hidden identities) to be implemented by firms. Vitalek 
Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum and a leader in the blockchain space, wrote a blog 
post in early 2016 addressing the issue at hand. Buterin commented, “When I and others 
talk to companies about building their applications on a blockchain, two primary issues 
always come up: scalability and privacy.” 68   
   The development of what is known as a private or permissioned blockchain 
solved these aforementioned problems. Similar to a public blockchain in most aspects, 
permissioned blockchains tend cater more to the enterprise’s needs. The major difference 
between public and private classes of blockchains is who can access and participate in 
platform. A private blockchain restricts access to the ledger in a similar way that any 
network can require credentials, such as a username and password, to gain access. 69 A 
private blockchain can take two forms based on the needs it serves. It can either be 
completely private, operating solely within one company, or can be distributed across a 
larger network, connecting multiple companies, while still restricting access to the public.

	 37 
70 The only nodes serving a permissioned blockchain, whether fully private or semi-
private, are those who have access to the blockchain itself. In other words, no computers 
can lend their processing power towards operating the blockchain except for those within 
the private network. The ledger is still distributed across multiple nodes, which helps 
provide additional security, compared to a file or database stored on single computer, 
which is subject to attack by a lone hacker.  
The way by which transactions and new blocks are verified and added to the chain 
differs slightly as well. The public blockchain model, described in Chapter 3, validates 
transactions using what is known as a proof of work model. This proof of work consensus 
model is the ‘mining’ that specific nodes perform, or the validating transactions or blocks 
by solving the complex equation. The proof of work model performs well in public 
blockchains, but the nodes must receive some reward for the processing power or energy 
that they are contributing to verifying transactions. The energy costs of implementing a 
proof of work model to a private blockchain would be expensive, to say the least, as the 
mining nodes use an astonishing amount of power in their attempts to solve complex 
equations. In 2015, validating a single bitcoin transaction required the same amount of 
electricity as it would take to power one and a half American homes for a whole day. 71 
Furthermore, even if cost wasn’t an obstacle, the speed at which transactions are 
processed using a proof of work system may simply be too slow to be useful at the

enterprise level. The proof of work consensus model is the fundamental scalability 
problem for public blockchains that Buterin refers to in his 2016 blog post. 
Permissioned blockchains, however, tend to avoid proof of work as a method of 
establishing consensus in the ledger. Using proof of work would require running 
thousands of uncompensated mining nodes. Furthermore, the larger a proof of work 
based blockchain network becomes, the more mining nodes are required. 72 Instead, most 
private blockchains use a mechanism known as proof of stake to establish consensus. 
Rather than requiring a correct answer to an equation to determine which miner adds his 
or her block to the chain, the proof of stake consensus model simply decides which node 
creates the new block, based on a pre-determined attribute. 73 With cryptocurrency 
blockchains operating under the proof of stake model, the creator is generally determined 
based on total wealth, or stake, in the platform. This provides the incentive needed to 
maintain integrity, as a fraudulent platform would lead to a worthless currency. 
On non-cryptocurrency permissioned blockchains, proof of stake can operate 
through any matter that the programmer decides. A popular solution is to randomly select 
the creator of the next block. Other nodes in the network then either agree with the block 
proposed or oppose that addition and propose a new path via a fork. 74 Agreeing with a 
block that contains no fraudulent transactions grants the node reliability, while agreeing 
with a fraudulent block can result in termination from the network. This process

maintains the platform’s legitimacy, as no node is aware that their ‘proposal’ block was 
randomly selected, and thus cannot take advantage of the privilege. Nodes are punished 
(removed from the network) for trying to defraud the platform. 
Another added benefit of the proof of stake consensus model is that it operates 
with quicker speed. Blockchains using the proof of work consensus model tend to operate 
by processing “tens of transactions per second,” as opposed to permissioned proof of 
stake blockchains, which can process “around a few thousand transactions per second.” 75 
Furthermore, proof of stake blockchains don’t operate with anywhere close to the same 
energy costs as proof of work blockchains, due to the elimination of thousands of mining 
nodes continuously working on complex algorithms. 
To summarize a complicated nuance, the difference between a proof of work 
model and a proof of stake model is the way in which consensus is met. This means that 
the encryption aspect of blockchains, the way in which they are unalterable, distributed, 
and free from error, all hold, regardless of whether the blockchain is public, private, uses 
proof of work, or uses proof of stake.  Proof of stake systems are more cost efficient to 
the user, as they require less sophisticated computers and consume far less energy as a 
proof of work platform. 76 Proof of work systems, on the other hand, can only achieve the 
same cost efficiencies through the use of a public platform.

While providing benefits such as speed and scalability over a proof of work 
system, some blockchain purists argue that a proof of stake system is too centralized. 
This argument may hold some merit, as proof of stake does open the door to foul play 
where a corrupt institution could demands all of its nodes (if it is the sole controlling 
entity of the nodes on the network) verify a fraudulent block. Proper internal control 
oversight can reduce this risk. Furthermore, it isn’t yet viable for a company to launch a 
public or proof of work blockchain due to the challenges outlined above, and thus any 
ongoing and future initiatives will be based on a permissioned proof of stake blockchain.  
A closer look into J.P. Morgan’s IIN provides insight into how other blockchain 
systems, both current and future, operate within the financial sector. In an interview with 
ETHNews, Farooq explains that the bank’s innovation strategy doesn’t focus on trying to 
find instances to use blockchain. Instead, the innovation department “start(s) with the 
problem and then find(s) the appropriate technology.” Farooq continues by pointing out 
that in the case of improving the global payments system, blockchain is the “ideal 
technology,” but in other cases, blockchain isn’t the solution. 77 When global payments 
occur, there are often multiple banks involved in a single transaction from payer to payee. 
One cause of slow transaction times is the inefficiency of information sharing that occurs 
between banks. If a transaction going through a bank’s global payment system is flagged, 
due to entity involved, or the amount, timing, or frequency of the payment, a bank is 
required to gather more information on the transacting entity and the transaction itself. 
 Farooq compares the process to KYC protocol (although it differs as KYC is

The legacy processes in place result in a “back and forth …via emails and faxes and 
phones” to gather the necessary information to approve a transaction, which can be as 
little as a date of birth. The IIN eliminates the inefficient back and forth via a 
permissioned blockchain. Transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger. In the event 
that a transaction gets flagged, the bank that needs information can send an encrypted 
request over the IIN to the client’s main bank. That bank sends the information directly 
back to the bank that needs it, via encryption of course. As Farooq puts it, “Instead of 
multiple hops, you can reduce it to one hop… Instead of taking what could be several 
days… we can reduce this to a matter of minutes or hours.” 79 The way that blockchain 
achieves this is through its distributed aspect as well as its advanced encryption 
techniques. In the case of the IIN, it seems J.P. Morgan was not primarily attracted to 
blockchain for the fact that it cannot be altered and is thus immutable. The technology is 
instead mostly being used for its security and subjective transparency (within permitted 
parties), and the immutability of the network is an added bonus. 
Fortune magazine claims that the “most likely” extension of blockchain 
technology into the corporate world exists through financial firms, and points to “security 
clearance and settlements, cross-border payments, and insurance” as every day activities

that can be made more efficient through distributed ledger technology. It is hard to argue 
with Fortune magazine, based solely on the idea that the first blockchain was designed to 
process transactions and already supports (albeit a new, digital form of) currencies. Banks 
in particular seem to be at the forefront of testing blockchain technology. Apart from J.P. 
Morgan, Bank of America (in collaboration with Microsoft), HSBC, ING, U.S. Bank, 
Barclays, UBS, Credit Suisse, and Northern Trust are experimenting with blockchain, 
either through investment, internal development, or prototype. 80  
Visa, the largest payment processer in the world, saw the benefits that blockchain 
can offer to transaction based networks, and launched a pilot business-to-business 
payments service based on the blockchain, named B2B Connect, in November 2017. 81 
Unsurprisingly, both American Express and MasterCard have also filed patents related to 
their own blockchain networks. 82 The investment in blockchain technology amongst 
financial firms seems closely related to the fierce competition between industry rivals. 
Once one company makes the first step, others jump in with their own developments as 
well. The technology has the potential to alter payment processing in a way that missing 
out on the trend could negatively impact a firm’s bottom line within the decade, and thus 
companies operating in the space are spending money on blockchain, either by hiring 
blockchain consultants, investing in joint ventures, or acquiring smaller, blockchain-

technology focused firms.  
 Blockchain solutions for banks, credit card companies, and other payment 
processors such as PayPal are in development. Whether the solutions will provide enough 
value to justify the investments being made remains to be seen. Financial firms, however, 
only make up 15% (based on GICS, or Global Industry Classification Standard) of the 
both the S&P 500 and the S&P Total Market Index. 83 The remaining 85% of firms in 
both indices are comprised of the following sectors: Consumer Discretionary, Consumer 
Staples, Energy, Health Care Industrials, Information Technology, Materials, Real Estate, 
Telecommunication Services, and Utilities. 84 Although these sectors do not (directly, 
they outsource to third parties) take part in payment processing, blockchain technology 
still provides useful solutions to help simplify parts of their businesses. The pace at which 
companies are exploring what unique uses of blockchain may be beneficial to their 
specific operations has increased over the past year. 2017 saw 1,240 blockchain related 
patents filed across the world, a figure that more than doubled the 2016 numbers. 85 
 While this hints at further investment and development in distributed ledger 
technology, it is hard not to compare this patent frenzy to that of the internet boom and 
resulting tech stock bubble of the late 1990s. While the technology is promising and can 
alter the speed and security with which companies operate, remember that blockchain

should not be applied to every aspect of a business, as it does not provide enough value 
over legacy platforms to justify cost. This concept will be discussed further in Chapter 6. 
Firms that fail to fully understand blockchain or those that fail to allocate their money in 
a thoughtful manner toward the technology may find their investments fruitless and 
capital wasted. By fully understanding the use cases for blockchain within the financial 
industry, auditors can provide additional value to their clients that are in the process of 
implementing a blockchain-based system.

Chapter 5 – Client Implementation of Blockchain Technology – Non-Financials 
 Following two years of secret collaboration, International Business Machines 
Corporation (IBM) and Denmark-based shipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk (Maersk) 
announced to the public that the companies were forming a joint venture focused on 
improving global trade and more specifically, supply chain management, using 
blockchain. The announcement, which came on January 16, 2018, states that the New 
York City-based venture tentatively plans to go to market with a blockchain platform by 
the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, with firms such as General Motors and Procter and 
Gamble, as well as government customs offices in Singapore and Peru, reportedly 
interested.  86  
 The Wall Street Journal estimates that the paperwork and trade documents 
required using legacy global trade systems equates to a 20 % increase in an enterprise’s 
costs of supplies. 87 The complexity and volume of global trade has drastically outgrown 
older processing systems, with antiquated paper processes primarily serving as the cause 
of inefficiencies. The after-tax savings less cost of a platform that is better suited to 
handle this complexity and volume can have a direct impact on the bottom line, so the 
early interest of corporations seems justified. On a macro scale, the World Economic 
Forum estimated that eliminating inefficiencies platforms utilizing blockchain “could

increase GDP by nearly 5% and trade by 15%.” 88 Maersk states that the decision to use 
blockchain to improve supply chain management was an easy one. The blockchain-based 
solution will “create more efficient and secure platform for organizing global trade,” and 
DowDuPont has already piloted early versions.  
 Supply chains are often slowed by paperwork and middlemen, and companies can 
struggle to find answers regarding if their shipment is in transit, the cause of a delay, and 
when said delay is expected to be resolved. Delays can impact firms with well-
established supply chains at any time. Apple, for instance, was forced to delay the launch 
of its highly anticipated HomePod until after the 2017 holiday season due to struggles 
associated with its supply chain, losing potential revenue in the process. Any lost or 
misplaced trade documents or processing papers can grind a supply chain to a halt and 
leave a company unprepared to fill customer orders. IBM’s CEO Michael White stated 
that utilizing blockchain in supply chain management presents “an opportunity to 
increase efficiency and timeliness for cargo movement,” 89 and IBM’s General Manager 
of the Blockchain Unit, Marie Wieck, commented “even small improvements can have a 
substantial impact in global trade.” 90 As of March 2017, ten million of Maersk’s 
shipping containers are managed via the pilot blockchain solution.

 Similar to financial enterprises, firms looking to overhaul their supply chain 
systems must see a clear value-add proposition in order to make the investment, either 
through proprietary development or by purchasing a blockchain software service offered 
by a company such as IBM. While other small firms may focus on blockchain solutions 
to be offered as a service, in the same model as software-as-a-service (SaaS business 
model), I believe that larger firms such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Intuit, or Alphabet 
will control the blockchain-as-a-service market, due to prior client relationships as well 
as potential future acquisitions.  The value-add proposal that blockchain-as-a-service 
providers deliver through their supply chain solutions doesn’t end with cost savings 
through eliminating inefficiencies. Walmart is one of the few corporations that piloted 
IBM’s blockchain supply chain solution, and in doing so, realized other benefits 
alongside greater efficiency. In Walmart’s case, they were able to use the technology to 
greatly improve food safety measures as well as limit the potential cost of issues arising 
from food safety problems.  
 Walmart began implementing the blockchain solution into their grocery supply 
chain. By doing so, the company tracked the shipments of food that were eventually sold 
to customers, and was able to discern the suppliers, location of suppliers, shipment 
routes, port cities, warehouses, processing facilities, and packing houses that individual 
items had come in contact with. 91 Walmart had never experienced this level of 
transparency in regards to their grocery supply chain. In order to test the capabilities of 
the platform, Walmart’s Vice President of Food Safety, Frank Yiannas, derived an

experiment. Yiannis decided he wanted to trace a single package of sliced mangoes on 
sale at a local Walmart to its original supplier, with information on whom else it came 
into contact with during its journey from supplier to shelf. Yiannas was imaging that this 
particular package of sliced mangoes was contaminated, and had infected a customer 
with E. Coli. Product contamination is a major problem for any firm that sells food or 
beverage.  
 Nearly 28 million U.S. citizens suffer from foodborne illness every year, with 
3,000 of those infected dying as a result, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC). 92 This public health concern also impacts a company’s business; 
it has the potential for material outcomes on both a firm’s reputation as well as its bottom 
line. Failure to contain and eradicate foodborne illness quickly not only in costly recalls, 
but can also drive customers away from a brand. Chipotle is still recovering, both in 
reputation and sales growth, from the widespread E.coli outbreak that plagued the 
company in 2015 and 2016. Chipotle’s stock price fell more than 40% from its $800 high 
prior to the scandal, and to date has yet to fully recover, as customers swore the company 
out of their restaurant rotation because of Chipotle’s failure to identify and contain the 
problem. 93  
The package of sliced mangoes that Yiannas used to test Walmart’s  preparedness 
for a case of contamination illustrates the beauty of blockchain. Using the firm’s legacy 
supply chain management system, it took a total of “six days, 18 hours, and 16 minutes”

for employees to identify the mangoes supplier as well as other information about where 
the mangoes were cleaned, sliced, and packaged. The permissioned blockchain supply 
management solution that was provided by IBM, however, was able to solve the puzzle in 
a mere 2.2 seconds. 94 Walmart could then take steps to isolate the contamination and 
eradicate it, as well as pull all effected goods from the shelves within minutes of learning 
about the problem, rather than within days and weeks.  
In-depth transparency is just one of the benefits that a company stands to gain by 
implementing blockchain into their supply chain. Imagine a car manufacturer that can 
easily isolate which models on the road are operating with a faulty ignition switch that 
was produced on one specific day in one of their supplier’s factory in China. Instead of 
recalling tens of thousands of models and wasting both time and resources replacing 
adequate parts that are operating normally, the car manufacturer can recall solely the 
effected vehicles. Any company that may experience product quality issues due to a 
specific supplier stands to benefit from implementing blockchain into their supply chain 
management software system. Furthermore, firms can utilize the transparency provided 
through blockchain supply management systems in instances other than contamination or 
deficiency. Companies can provide specific product information to customers at time of 
purchase. Imagine purchasing a gallon of milk from a large grocery chain with the ability 
to know when and where the specific cow was milked. In many cases, consumers enjoy 
the additional information provided about the product, and firms that begin advertising 
specific data about their products may see a boost in consumer traffic.

Along with IBM, U.S. firms Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Chinese tech 
giants Baidu and Alibaba, currently offer supply chain solutions utilizing blockchain 
through the blockchain-as-a-service subscription model. 95 Each firm seems determined 
to gain share of the new market through different methods. Baidu, for instance, claims 
that its platforms are the most customizable. IBM, on the other hand, points to the “over 
400 enterprise clients” that are utilizing its blockchain technology, including the likes of 
Nestlé, VISA, Kroger, and Unilever. 96 Research firm International Data Corporation’s 
(IDC) Director for Blockchain Strategies, Bill Fearnely Jr., mentioned in a January 2018 
interview that, “supply chain is a very, very hot topic right now and it is only accelerating 
from here.” 97 Yet blockchain has the potential to alter other aspects of business as well. 
IBM commented in a recent white paper that it believes blockchain technology has the 
potential to disrupt general invoice and payment systems, as well as provide more data 
for marketing departments to use. 98 IBM’s online information hub currently lists 
insurance, retail and consumer goods, government, and healthcare as the potential 
industries that it believes its blockchain solution will disrupt on top of the banking and 
financial markets industry. 99

Deloitte and Amazon collaborated on a white paper that delivers an example of 
how blockchain can be used for in the healthcare space. On top of improving the paper-
intensive transaction processing required for delivering drugs to both pharmacies and 
other customers (hospitals, urgent cares, etc.), blockchain could serve as a solution to 
improving both patient control and collaboration, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration’s (FDA) approval processes (along with other foreign drug 
administrations’ processes) for new treatment, and proper authentic care delivery. The 
current software systems used to store medical records of individual patients lack proper 
security. The electronic medical records (EMRs) of specific patients are often too large to 
be securely transmitted (without proper encryption) as they carry massive amounts of 
important patient data such as “treatment and genomic information.” 100 Both the Bush 
and Obama administrations took steps toward both development and use of EMRs, yet 
today many healthcare facilities “are still not able to securely share data, even with other 
hospitals and clinics in their own healthcare group.” 101  
Implementing blockchain encryption will not only protect sensitive patient 
medical information, but it will also allow doctors to deliver enhanced treatment through 
collaborative transparency. Using legacy systems, when a patient visits a new medical 
institution, his prior medical history tends to be is inaccessible. In the event that medical 
history for individual patients is stored securely within a provider’s permissioned 
blockchain, a doctor at a separate institution could request access to the blockchain.

Exchange,” IDG Communications, Computerworld, January 11, 2017.

	 52 
Although the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 
would still protect sensitive patient information, a patient that waives protection could 
allow doctors, on a case-by-case basis, to (either temporarily or on an ongoing basis) 
securely access prior medical history. 102 Giving doctors knowledge of all prior injuries, 
surgeries, illnesses, diagnoses, allergies, and prescriptions in a protected manner allows 
for improved decision making when analyzing possible future treatments. This can be 
granted instantly through either collaborative permissioned blockchains or through 
granting access based on a doctor’s institution. Once access is grated, doctors will only be 
able to identify the records of their specific patient, and the rest of the data stored on the 
blockchain network would be unidentifiable unless the doctor were given access to learn 
the public identifying keys of other patients. 103  
The process of FDA drug approval is justifiably a lengthy and costly one, yet it 
still stands to benefit from blockchain-oriented software systems. Currently, the process 
contains four phases, starting with preclinical testing before continuing on to phases one 
through three. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America (PhRMA) 
recently published that, as of 2015, it takes an average of “at least ten years” and costs an 
estimated “$2.6 billion” for a new treatment to reach the patient. 104 While blockchain

likely won’t shorten this process by a quantity of years, it can reduce time and money 
spent on some of the administrative aspects of the development.  
Organization of data surrounding preclinical and clinical trials in a secure, 
condensed manner is where blockchain comes in. Clinical drug trials, along with 
participant data and outcome, can be stored and shared between pharmaceutical 
companies and the FDA through a permissioned blockchain. Furthermore, 
pharmaceutical companies will find it beneficial to have the security risk of storing 
clinical participant’s data lessened. Pharmaceuticals may find it easier to track a specific 
drug and possibility of approval through the data stored within the blockchain. Finally, 
blockchain-based systems allow for more data, either about trial participant, outcome, 
environment during administration, and other aspects to be stored within the drug’s 
‘account’ on the blockchain. The FDA will be better able to analyze and attest on the 
safety and efficiency of the drug in question due to more secure, trustworthy data from all 
phases of clinical drugs’ trials.  
Proper authentic care issues plague a drug’s parent company long after the 
research and developmental phases. Simplifying a complex matter, proper authentic care 
can be summarized as pharmaceutical companies struggling to properly trace and account 
for where drugs may be sold. In some cases, particularly those in countries with less 
developed drug administrations, drugs may be sold into the hands of those who plan to 
produce counterfeits of the drug and profit through bypassing patent protection. Factors 
tied to “lack of traceability and transparency” led to an estimated 30% of all drug sales in 
	 54 
developing countries being counterfeit. 105 Through the blockchain program outlined by 
Amazon, authentic identifiers can be “encoded on the blockchain to establish the drug’s 
footprint.” 106 This process allows for complete transparency regarding what hands the 
drug falls into through sales, thus reducing the possibility it may end up with parties 
planning to produce counterfeits. The information of drug location and intermediaries 
interacting with transport can help supplement government regulators in their attempts to 
crackdown on counterfeit drug sales, which directly benefits the pharmaceutical industry.  
The real estate industry, as well as governments involved in lease contracting, is 
already experiencing the positive impacts of blockchain. The Dutch city of Rotterdam is 
on the forefront of the change. In collaboration with Deloitte and the Cambridge 
Innovation Center, Rotterdam implemented a blockchain pilot project in December 2016 
aimed at recording “legally binding lease contracts,” and has since expanded the platform 
to monitoring the rental payments associated with the contracts. 107 Similar to many of 
the other potential applications, blockchain helps in this instance through the reduction of 
transaction times and costs, which currently are mostly paper based. Deloitte Real Estate 
Manager Jan Willem Santing provided details on other benefits of a blockchain-based 
platform, stating that “ by implementing blockchain applications in the real estate

industry… it enables decision makers to use data analysis for making future investment 
decisions on selling, buying, and constructing real estate.” 108 This aspect, both in 
Rotterdamn’s case and in other implementations of blockchain, cannot be understated. 
Not only does blockchain benefit the user through its immutability, transparency, 
security, speed, and encryption, among other aspects, but the secure condensed nature of 
data also leads to improved applications of data analytics. The lease agreements can’t be 
stored on any software platform either, as their contents need to be unaltered in order to 
settle any disputes. Blockchain helps fulfill this need.   
The past two chapters show that while nothing is certain, it appears that the use of 
blockchain by businesses in many industries will likely increase in the years to come. 
This means that at the very least, it is important for accountants and auditors, as well as 
business executives, to be familiar with the technology. It has been argued, due to aspects 
such as immutability and transparency, that blockchain could eliminate the need for the 
audit. Being familiar with a technology versus being replaced by a technology are vastly 
different outcomes.

Chapter 6: Blockchain and its Impact on Accounting Systems and the Auditor 
 In late November 2017, financial software firm Libra raised $7.8 million from 
private markets through a Series A round. The New York City-based startup mentioned 
in a press release that, “Libra’s vision is to be the premier provider of next generation 
accounting, audit, and tax software … for the blockchain.” 109 Libra is anticipating that 
the value proposal of incorporating blockchain into accounting systems is enough to 
justify firms making the switch. Articles on blockchain and accounting claim that the 
technology will cause disruption and change the role of the auditor in the future. In a 
PwC publication from 2017, Technology Audit Services Leader A. Michael Smith 
comments, “this technology has the potential to take those (audit) processes and controls 
to the next level,” and “with the right approach, companies can create a blockchain-based 
system that has less chance for human error.” 110  
 Other articles go so far to state that blockchain will eliminate the need for the 
audit altogether. A quote from a collaborative publication by the CPA Canada, the 
AICPA, Deloitte, and the University of Waterloo Centre for Information Integrity and 
Information Systems Assurance (UWCISA) helps summarizes these thoughts. “Some 
publications have hinted that blockchain technology might eliminate the need for a 
financial statement audit by a CPA auditor altogether. If all transactions are captured in

an immutable blockchain, then what is left for a CPA auditor to audit?” 111 As firms 
move their methods of transaction recording to blockchain-focused software, an 
immutable audit trail is produced. All of the transactions are verified through the network 
and cannot be altered (without at least alerting other users of the platform). The argument 
that the audit profession may become obsolete once all transactions are recorded on the 
blockchain is based on the notion that through completely traceable audit trails, software 
can be developed to fully automate the audit.  Nicolai Andersen, Partner at Deloitte 
Germany, points out, “Since all entries are distributed and cryptographically sealed, 
falsifying or destroying them to conceal activity is practically impossible.” 112  
 Nicolai continues by comparing transactions recorded on the blockchain to 
transactions that are “verified by a notary.” The argument states that these transactions no 
longer need to be checked or verified. If a customer has paid an outstanding bill, the bill 
is recorded as paid in the blockchain network, and cannot be altered in any other manner. 
Furthermore, the monetary amount of any outstanding accounts receivable, cash, or other 
material item cannot be altered by foul play. Any manipulation will break the blockchain 
and alert the network of fraudulent behavior.  Supposedly, there is no longer a need for an 
auditor to sample transactions (in order to establish reasonable assurance), as the 
transactions are already approved through consensus. Furthermore, the blockchain can

connect the accounting of a transaction to the transaction itself, so reconciliation becomes 
at the least less time consuming and at the most automated. 113  
 The argument that blockchain will eliminate the need for auditors, however, is 
shortsighted and lacks sufficient evidence. There are various reasons for why blockchain 
does not put the future of the audit profession, and the firms that supply these services, in 
jeopardy. Let’s begin with the role of an auditor. “Auditors … enhance trust in the 
information of the companies they audit and help a multi-trillion dollar capital markets 
system function with greater confidence.” 114 The argument that audits can be replaced by 
blockchain is based on the idea that the transactions themselves can be trusted. The trust 
that blockchain provides, however, is simply that the transaction has occurred. There is 
no information about the nature of the transaction, which may still be “unauthorized, 
fraudulent, or illegal.” 115 The aforementioned collaborative publication between CPA 
Canada and others mentions that the transactions recorded on a blockchain could “be 
executed between related parties, linked to a side agreement,” or incorrectly classified. 
 So while, to some extent, transaction occurrence may be trusted when recorded on 
the blockchain, there is still a need for auditors to inspect the transactions, for either

evidence of fraud or a classification error. 116 As Joseph Lubin, founder of blockchain 
consultancy ConsenSys, stated in a March 2016 interview, “Putting all this stuff on 
blockchain changes the nature of fraud.” 117 It does not, however, eliminate fraud 
completely. Fraud may still be present on the blockchain, as “lies encoded on the 
blockchain are still lies. They’re just immutable lies.” 118 This problem doesn’t persist in 
cyrptocurrency networks, because any transfer of bitcoin, for instance, cannot transfer 
hands without being published on the network. It is not possible for one party to pay 
another under the table with a cyrptocurrency (since the currency is solely electronic. For 
instance, I cannot hand anyone a bitcoin, I must transfer it to them through the network). 
Yet businesses that are using blockchain to record transactions, but still settling in 
currency off of the blockchain, can alter value of payment. Therefore, reconciliation 
between the blockchain-recorded transaction and actual payment is still needed for 
verification.  
 Another example that disproves the argument that auditors are no longer needed 
arises from the following. Proof that goods have been delivered and that there are no 
performance obligations outstanding cannot (currently) be discerned solely through 
analyzing transactions recorded on the blockchain. IBM is working on a solution to this 
problem, and at Think 2018 recently unveiled “the world’s smallest computer” which is

“smaller than a grain of salt” and can “be a data source for blockchain applications.” 119 
Until this computer of sorts is attached to all goods, from thousands of different 
companies, the problem of proof of delivery will still exist. Regardless of if this ever 
happens, auditors will still be needed to assess management’s valuations, classifications, 
and estimates of assets and liabilities, among other items.  
 It is important to note that while the technology has many use cases, it is unlikely 
that businesses will begin storing all of their transaction data on the blockchain within the 
next five years. Given the current blockchain environment, it is far too costly to 
implement and maintain these systems for all transactions. Vermont planned to 
implement blockchain technology for all of the registered property records, but “bailed 
on the plan after a year” due to its high cost. 120 Other reasons businesses may implement 
blockchain is to develop the concept of smart contracts. Smart contracts are not limited to 
the blockchain, but can be recorded on the platform for transparency reasons as well as 
other benefits provided by the technology.  
 Smart contracts are “computer programs that may execute under certain 
conditions.” 121 An example of a smart contract is an invoice that continuously checks to 
see if the goods purchased have been delivered. Once delivery is recorded in a system

(possibly a blockchain), the invoice will pay itself, transferring funds from one company 
to the other. The scope of these smart contracts can range from very simple, such as the 
example provided, to complex. These contracts will need auditing, but including them on 
the blockchain may lessen auditor work around confirmation. If they are tied into the 
blockchain, an auditor can, in theory, easily check the criteria under which the smart 
contract will execute, and reconcile it back to the transaction. However, the 
implementation of complex smart contracts may also increase time spent on auditing the 
contract criteria. For the purpose of this study, understanding the basic aspects of smart 
contracts, why they are appealing to companies, that they may be implemented on the 
blockchain, and the fact that they will still need to be audited, is enough. As with other 
areas of promising technology, smart contracts have the potential to streamline business 
workflow, but problems may arise, both for auditors and the businesses engaging in the 
contracts, if the programs do not run as intended. They will still need auditing. 
  I interviewed Will Bible, a Deloitte Partner who focuses on audit innovation, on 
February 16, and asked for his take on blockchain implementation. Bible stressed that in 
a majority of cases, especially those involving large corporations, it would be redundant 
to begin recording transactions on the blockchain. 122 The transaction processing and 
recording methods are often too engrained in businesses through legacy enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) and CRM systems to advocate moving them to blockchain. 
Essentially, the platforms are too sticky to justify switching costs. The systems are often 
tied to accounting systems, and the processes of monitoring and recording transactions 
operates relatively smoothly as is. Bible noted that he doesn’t see a rush for large

	 62 
corporations to redesign their legacy systems. 123 A majority of investment in blockchain-
based systems may only be recovered (depending on the business and systems in place) 
through cost savings on audit fees. Given the current environment, any transaction that a 
firm wishes to record on the blockchain would similarly be recorded elsewhere in their 
legacy systems, either through the accounting department or through an ERP system. The 
blockchain could be connected with these systems, but redundancy occurs from storing 
the transaction data twice, once on the blockchain and once in the other software system. 
A firm would have to completely replace transaction-tracking legacy systems with 
blockchain to eliminate this inefficiency, which, given the current cost discrepancy, 
appears unlikely.  
 Further solidifying this argument, Bible pointed out that firms do not design their 
systems to benefit the auditor. 124 Businesses have designed their internal software and 
data information systems to align with their own processes, business practices, and 
workflow. As auditing is a client service based profession, it instead falls on the auditing 
firm to adjust their systems in order to extract the transaction data and information 
needed to complete an audit. Bible closed the interview by stating that companies whose 
business model depends on blockchain may find it more reasonable to use the technology 
in their transaction records and accounting systems. 125 In these cases, it could be possible 
that an audit be conducted solely on data stored on the blockchain. Companies such as 
these are still in early stages, and even in these cases, Bible mentioned he would not be 
surprised if it were simply more cost efficient for them to use accounting software like

Intuit’s QuickBooks. 126 While the blockchain will not eliminate the audit, professionals 
will have to audit blockchain-based transactions as well as audit companies that are on 
the front line of blockchain implementation. 
 In order to opine over internal controls (as is required by SOX), auditors need to 
be familiar with the blockchain and how it operates. Reports suggest that the application 
of real-time auditing may be a possibility. “The concept behind real-time auditing is to 
inspect transactions closer and closer to the point of occurrence.” 127 Real-time auditing is 
beneficial to the firms providing services as “real-time, authentic data makes predictive 
analytics more valuable.” 128 More valuable predictive analytics correlate with higher 
quality audits, as deviations from informed predictive analytics can be investigated 
further. While a full real-time audit will not be achieved due to the likelihood that only a 
portion of transactions will be recorded on the blockchain, a part of the substantive 
procedures related to the blockchain-recorded transactions can be shifted to the present, 
rather than near the end of the quarter.  
 Blockchain promotes real-time auditing by allowing auditors access to the 
permissioned network. Auditors are then able to inspect and sample transactions as they 
occur. This also frees up time for auditors at year-end to devote their attention to more 
complex accounting matters involving valuation or classification, or to investigate 
transactions that have been flagged as unusual. The risk of fraud may be higher with

blockchain-related transactions, as perpetrators could see an opportunity given the 
supposed accuracy and security of blockchain. The information presented on the 
blockchain, however, is only as good as the people on the network.129 If there is a 
consensus across multiple parties to conclude that a transaction has occurred, it can be 
cryptographically entered onto the network and seem legitimate. Therefore, sampling of 
transactions along with other procedures still needs to occur, although the timing of the 
audit procedures can be much closer to transaction date.   
 Jeremy Dane, CCO of Libra, one of the companies that in my opinion best 
understands the impact blockchain will have on the auditing landscape, published an 
article in late 2016 titled, “Wait, Blockchains Need Audited?!?” Throughout the article, 
Dane denies claims that the audit will become automated or eliminated. Instead, Dane 
states that Libra’s goal is to develop software to help “change the timing of (auditor’s) 
service from post-transaction to real-time.” 130 Arguments have been put forth that the 
blockchain will reduce the size of audit teams through automation and thus lead to a 
reduction in audit costs. Besides a shift toward some real-time auditing, the technology 
also “allows organizations to synchronize audit trails between partners in a supply chain.” 
131 This is why the blockchain is often compared to both a ledger and a database, as it can 
serve as a source of the information needed to perform an audit. Until auditors no longer

need to receive confirmations from suppliers and customers it is questionable whether 
this aspect of the blockchain will save as much time as is often reported.  
 The claim that blockchain will result in cost savings is difficult to analyze. Unless 
a majority of transactions occur on the blockchain, the audit work of the future may look 
starkly similar to how it looks today. Furthermore, public accounting firms may find it 
difficult to cut costs through automation without sacrificing quality. While the Big Four 
firms are always seeking to improve margins over the long term, they may be more 
focused today on improving the quality of service. Jon Raphael, Chief Innovation Officer 
at Deloitte, took time out of a press conference during the 2017 Financial Executives 
International’s Current Financial Reporting Issues Conference in New York to emphasize 
this point. When questioned about how broad technology implementation in the audit 
may lead to cost savings, Raphael answered, “I think that audit quality is paramount … 
that’s number one, regardless of the fee. That’s what our intention is and what we’re 
always going to deliver.” 132 
 While access to real-time information through the blockchain may present a 
greater opportunity to apply audit analytics, substantive procedures will still need to be 
completed to achieve proper assurance. Reduction in lower-level audit staff may have 
unforeseen impacts down the line for the public accounting firms. The pool of future 
partners is spread, thinly albeit, throughout the current audit staff. Reducing staff 
numbers may alter the quality of future partners by limiting the size of that pool.

Regardless, I believe that, if hiring numbers trend lower in the coming years, it will be 
less because of firms implementing blockchain, and more because of other technological 
advancements, such as the increased use of audit analytics. 
 Challenges exist for auditors to adapt their processes to accommodate the 
blockchain. These involve extracting useful data from the blockchain for use in audit 
processes. In order for auditors to document their work on an engagement, the transaction 
data needs to be taken from the blockchain and imported into their own workbook 
software and other systems. For this reason, it is important for auditors to be engaged in 
discussions with their clients about plans to implement blockchain. It will help prevent 
unnecessary system inefficiencies if auditors can prepare in advance rather than rush to 
develop techniques during the audit. Other challenges that exist include how to assess the 
internal controls surrounding blockchain, and what stance regulators will take in regards 
to blockchain. Regulators will ultimately have the final say regarding the procedures that 
are needed to provide assurance over the blockchain.  
Until specific guidance is passed, it is up to the public accountants to implement 
what they believe are the proper procedures to provide assurance on a firm’s financials. 
To date, PwC, Deloitte, Ernst & Young (EY) and KPMG have all issued press releases 
indicating they have either successfully completed audits of the blockchain or offer 
blockchain auditing services to clients. A Wall Street Journal article from March 2018 
states that for transactions that “occur on the blockchain, PwC logs them and applies 
	 67 
controls and testing criteria.” 133 Deloitte’s blockchain focused team, named Rubix, 
“applied existing guidance and attestation standards to the permissioned blockchain,” 
during their successful blockchain audit in February 2017.134 Currently, it appears the Big 
Four are applying auditing standards for general transactions (not on the blockchain) to 
those recorded or completed on the blockchain. Conservatism around auditing the 
technology makes sense, and until regulators come out with specifications, it is unlikely 
the Big Four will implement any real-time auditing or other groundbreaking automation 
into the picture. 
Depending on the view that regulators take on blockchain, auditing of the 
technology may become more streamlined and efficient, and generate realized cost 
savings. “For example, if a significant class of transactions for an industry is recorded in 
a blockchain, it might be possible for a CPA auditor to develop software to continuously 
audit.” 135 These technologies likely need to be cleared by regulation first, however, 
before they can be properly implemented. The cost and time savings here would result 
from the elimination of “manual data extraction and audit preparation activities,” though 
it is important to remember that this would only occur for transactions that are recorded 
on the blockchain, not all transactions for an entity. Regardless, auditors will continue to

platform for the time being.  “The still-new technology faces a host of obstacles to 
adoption, PwC says—legal and compliance concerns within companies and other 
organizations, issues of corporate controls and risk management.” Until these concerns 
are addressed by regulation, the major benefits of blockchain, from an auditor’s 
standpoint, will be on hold.

Chapter 7: Regulators’ Response to the Blockchain 
 On December 5, 2017, PCAOB Board Member Jeanette M. Franzel was invited to 
present to attendees of the AICPA Conference on SEC and PCAOB Developments. 
Franzel’s speech was titled, “Update on PCAOB Efforts to Enhance Audit Quality,” and 
in it, she addressed the impact of technology on the accounting profession and the 
PCAOB’s recent research agenda on how the use of technology will affect financial 
reporting and auditing. Franzel mentioned that the research project was driven by the fact 
that, “Certain technologies, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger 
technologies, also known as blockchain or distributed database technology, have the 
potential to seriously disrupt financial reporting and auditing processes.” 136 Franzel 
continues, stating that the technological changes represent both threats and opportunities 
to auditors. Near the end of her speech, Franzel says, “the general question to be 
addressed by PCAOB's research project is whether there is a need for guidance, changes 
to PCAOB standards, or other regulatory actions in light of auditors' increased use of 
technology-based tools in the conduct of audits. Some areas of uncertainty have been 
identified where guidance may be needed to clarify how certain auditing standards 
apply.” 137 Franzel concludes by mentioning she anticipates the PCAOB will provide an

update on the matter during the Standing Advisory Group meeting scheduled for June 5th, 
2018.  
 While Franzel’s speech implies that guidance on blockchain may be coming soon, 
other statements suggest otherwise. Franzel spoke earlier in the year (October 2017) at 
the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy annual meeting in New York. 
During a panel Q&A-style session, Franzel stated that, with regards to blockchain, the 
PCAOB has “dedicated a fair amount of resources to this and we’ve got some staff really 
doing a deep dive on this.” 138 She continues, however, stating, “Our current emphasis is 
on data analytics and artificial intelligence. I think blockchain will come later. If I had to 
predict what we’re going to do (and again, I’m speaking for myself), I think we probably 
will lean toward guidance and there have been several areas where necessary guidance 
has been identified.” 139 So while it appears that the PCAOB has decided it needs to issue 
guidance on the blockchain, it will likely be some time before this is done. This can lead 
to setbacks in the planning and development of how exactly auditors will provide 
assurance on the blockchain. It is unlikely that the Big Four will pour money into 
developing any automated auditing solutions for the blockchain until they fully 
understand the PCAOB’s stance.

 The PCAOB has been criticized in the past for the time it takes to issue new 
guidance. In late 2014, SEC Chief Accountant James Schnurr commented that, “some of 
the most important projects … are simply moving too slowly.” 140 Schnurr has entered 
into discussions with former PCAOB Chairman James Doty about speeding up the 
process. Doty responded that the PCAOB “should issue new rules only after thoughtful 
assessment of the need to improve audit quality and evaluating the economic impact of 
any rule-making.” 141 In reality, both Doty and Schnurr are right. It is in the best interest 
of all participants for the PCAOB to operate swiftly when issuing new guidance. In most 
cases, the topics they are addressing are affecting businesses in the present. As chairman 
of the AICPA Kimberly Ellison-Taylor said, “there is an immediate need to identify 
standards and regulations surrounding the use of this technology.” 142 Yet it is vital for 
the PCAOB to be thorough and develop a fundamental understanding of the issue before 
turning their attention to the guidance aspect. 
 While CPAs, the Big Four, and other regulatory organizations can put pressure on 
the PCAOB to speed up their processes, they ultimately will be left waiting until the 
PCAOB feels confident in their research, and issues what they deem as appropriate

guidance. Barry Melancon, CEO of the AICPA, is quoted in a December 2017 article 
stating that CPAs need “to challenge the standards-setters to keep up, and to look at our 
methodology for auditing.” 143 Perhaps the PCAOB is struggling with understanding how 
to approach the “dozens of variants” of blockchain. As PwC reported, “If we looked at 20 
of our clients who are deploying blockchain, we would find that they all resulted in 
different use case scenarios.” 144  
The SEC has gone ahead and provided considerations on how auditors should 
proceed until the PCAOB issues official guidance. The SEC stated that auditors should 
“determine the nature of the audit procedures to perform based on the circumstances of 
the issuer and the assurance standards used.” 145 Amy Pawlicki, Vice President of 
Assurance & Advisory Innovation for the AICPA, noted that “auditors are already 
auditing transactions in the blockchain” using the SEC’s considerations. Until the 
PCAOB alters the guidance surrounding blockchain, however, the blockchain will have 
little impact on auditors, as they must treat the distributed ledger transactions as they 
would transactions on legacy systems. Perhaps a Blockchain Regulatory World Summit,

independent standards compliance assessor Schellman & Company, is what the PCAOB 
is waiting for to help outline its guidance. 146  
It is pivotal that auditors work with the PCAOB in their development of guidance. 
Doing so will not only help with implementation of the new standard or other guidance, 
but will set the tone for how the blockchain environment, both in terms of investment and 
eventual use, will look in the future. Jeanne Boillet, Global Assurance Innovation Leader 
at EY, notes that “current regulatory and legal frameworks don’t take into account the use 
of blockchain,” and that auditors will have to “work closely with regulators to either 
develop (blockchain) solutions that conform to the current frameworks or alter them to 
align with the new ways of working.” 147  
The SEC has been busy dealing with other issues arising from the blockchain 
revolution. Firms wishing to raise public capital while avoiding the need to issue an 
audited S-1 have found a loophole in the traditional financial system through what has 
been dubbed initial coin offerings (ICOs). An ICO allows a firm to raise capital through 
issuing digital tokens or coins. These coins are recorded on the blockchain and to date 
have been issued mostly by startup firms that are either engaged in blockchain 
development or that currently offer blockchain products. The digital tokens sold to 
investors “entitle … owners to future products or services developed by the company.”

148 Apart from the publicity that an ICO creates, these companies are using ICOs to avoid 
regulation while simultaneously raising capital. The SEC “has said that many of the deals 
are actually securities sales,” and thus should be under the regulation of investor-
protection laws. 149 Brad Garllinghouse, CEO of blockchain startup Ripple, agrees with 
the SEC’s rulings and believes that blockchain-focused firms need to cooperate with 
regulation and follow traditional capital raising methods.  He mentioned that “ICOs are 
taking advantage of grey areas in securities law” during a December 2017 interview. 
150The process that a company must undertake prior to a public offering, such as issuing 
an audited S-1, was developed in the interest of protecting potential investors. Auditors 
provide assurance over a company’s S-1 prior to stock being sold to investors. Bypassing 
this process may provide dubious companies with opportunities to defraud investors. The 
SEC has stepped in, and as of December 2017, has “sued two ICOs that it said committed 
fraud by allegedly taking investors’ money for tokens that didn’t exist or promising 
outlandish returns.” 151 Furthermore, the SEC seems set on preventing other firms from 
escaping regulation, as it “intervened to halt a $15 million ICO by Munchee., a restaurant 
app, saying the deal should have been registered as a securities offering.” 152 The

processes required before issuing stock are in place to allow auditors to serve their role to 
the investing public. Blockchain may get a bad reputation amongst investors if fraudulent 
ICOs are allowed to continue. The SEC has done well to limit the damage, “digging in on 
a case-by-case basis and trying to look at all of the token offerings.” 153  
Looking to the future, regulators such as the PCAOB and SEC need to act swiftly 
to address how both auditors and investors use and view blockchain. The timing of their 
actions will have tangible impacts on auditing firms’ and their clients’ blockchain 
investment decisions. On August 1st, Delaware (where more than two-thirds of Fortune 
500 companies are incorporated) passed a law that “permits companies … to keep their 
list of shareholders on a blockchain.” 154 This may be the first step of a broader shift 
towards keeping records and other secure information on the blockchain. Supposedly, 
Delaware is developing a platform, and drafting required legislation, that will allow 
companies to “do everything from file incorporation documents to register shares via a 
blockchain.” 155 Delaware states that this shift may result in “much quicker auditing and 
due diligence processes.” Until the PCAOB issues guidance, firms will invest millions 
into blockchain, as the technology still needs to be audited using outdated procedures. 156

Chapter 8: Conclusion 
 Blockchain is a fascinating technology that will alter some of the ways that 
businesses transact. Yet for all that blockchain offers in encryption, enhanced 
auditability, and information transparency, it is important to realize that given current 
cost constraints, blockchain is neither for every business nor every transaction. Even with 
widespread implementation, which is worth recalling is by no means certain, the 
blockchain will not eliminate the auditor. Some of the straightforward procedures, such 
as transaction verification, may be automated through advanced software. Furthermore, 
firms will begin auditing blockchain transactions closer to the transaction date. 
 Auditors will still need to assess the appropriateness of management’s valuations, 
classifications, and recognitions, among other complex matters. General Electric (GE) is 
currently facing a probe from regulators regarding the recognition of revenue resulting 
from “long-term service contracts for projects like power-plant repairs and jet-engine 
maintenance.” 157 The valuation of contract assets “relies in part on GE’s own estimates 
and assumptions.” Implementation of blockchain technology will not reduce the need for 
auditors to determine the reasonableness of GE’s estimates and assumptions. The 
impending probe was made public in January 2018, and since, a Wall Street Journal 
article reported that proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis, 
& Co. have urged shareholders to pressure the board to vote against retaining auditor 
KPMG due to “previously-undisclosed liabilities and accounting issues.” 158

Main, January 25, 2018.

Years by Proxy Advisers,” The Wall Street Journal, Business, April 6, 2018.

 So while blockchain will not wipe out auditors and will not immediately alter 
most of an auditors’ workflow, it does not mean that current and future public 
accountants should ignore the technology. EY Global Technology Leader Channing 
Flynn implied just this, stating that “waiting for the technology to take hold is too late. 
Now is the time to start defining the questions and influencing policy that will lead to 
answers.” 159 The reality of the matter is that at blockchain will impact some aspect of 
businesses’ operations by the end of the decade. Auditors will need, at a minimum, to 
have an idea of how the technology operates in order to properly assess internal controls 
and to understand the client’s business. This will lend itself to higher quality audits. 
Auditors and accountants also need to pay close attention to and work with regulation 
around the technology. This will guide how both auditors and their clients are able to use 
blockchain, and will have a direct impact on how influential distributed ledger 
technology will be. 
 The general viewpoint throughout the accounting profession, and within the audit 
community in particular, should be that blockchain technology provides more of an 
opportunity than a threat. It remains to be seen how the implementation of blockchain 
will impact size of audit teams. This question will remain unanswered until standards are 
updated and new regulation is issued, at which point the Big Four can properly invest in 
developing blockchain solutions. Ami Beers, Director at the AICPA, comments that 
blockchain “can reduce cost; it can transact faster cheaper. And it gives you an 
immutable record of all transactions that cannot be changed, so that’s automating the

audit trail…. We look at it as an opportunity to make audits more efficient in the future.” 
160 
 Auditors and accountants need to invest time and energy into understanding how 
exactly companies will implement blockchain. Perhaps the hype surrounding blockchain 
is blown a bit out of proportion. It will not eliminate the audit or the auditor. What it will 
do, however, is allow auditors “to spend more time exercising their professional 
judgement.” 161 In PCAOB board member Jeanette Franzel’s aforementioned 2017 
speech, Franzel comments, “the emergence and use of new technologies in the audit will 
require professional skepticism and critical thinking by auditors in new ways. These 
technology tools and approaches may also highlight the need for stronger skills in more 
subjective and qualitative areas.” 162  
 Having a proficient understanding of blockchain technology, amongst other 
technologies, will begin to shape the hiring tendencies of the Big Four. I interviewed EY 
Partner Mieke Velghe in February 2018 and asked for her opinion on the impact 
blockchain may have on EY’s recruiting strategies for its assurance practice. Velghe 
responded that it’s about “making sure we have that expertise inside the firm. Making 
sure we’re hiring people that understand these technologies. It’s very difficult to assess

audit risks if you don’t know how the technology by itself works.” 163 In my opinion, the 
largest need for skill development amongst future auditors is in computer science and 
statistical inference, as these aspects will become more prominently integrated into 
auditing procedures through blockchain. By improving in these areas, developing an in-
depth understanding of blockchain technology, and focusing on the new regulation that 
will be issued by the PCAOB and SEC, auditors can prepare themselves for any impact 
that blockchain will have in the future.

The Internet gave us a powerful way to share and access information. Blockchain now gives us a powerful way to share and access value.”
During a February 2017 AICPA roundtable, Chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance and previous Global Head of Trading Analytics at Thomson Reuters, Ron Quarantana spoke to the revolutionary scale of blockchain. Quaranta, viewed by many as an expert in financial technology, predicts that the adoption of blockchain, both by the Big Four accounting firms and their clients, will disrupt the accounting industry by greatly reducing the time and skill needed to perform a quality audit. Some, such as Thomson Reuters’ Jon Baron, even claim that blockchain may eliminate the need for financial statement audits altogether. To many, blockchain is synonymous with Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that, over the past three years, has returned 3,310%, compared to 35% and 36% returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), respectively. Blockchain, however, is much more than Bitcoin, with applications stretching further than cryptocurrency. Rather, it is a peer-to-peer hosted public ledger that does not require a central authority to support or verify transactions, and is unalterable in future periods. In this study, I propose to examine what blockchain technology means for the 887,000 people currently employed by the Big Four. More specifically, I seek to expand upon whether the potential adoption of blockchain in the coming years will reduce audit fees, impact audit quality, or perhaps do away with the audit completely","['text', 'Blockchain', 'Auditing', 'Audit', 'Accounting', 'Technology', 'Future', 'Accounting']",disabled

ABSTRACT Blockchain is considered one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Numerous
cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part of the overall efforts toward shaping
the urban future. However, the infancy stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the
knowledge we have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to narrow this
rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research
community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine
sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a
component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a
subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them
and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system
level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability
decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two classification methodologies
for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the
blockchain knowledge domain.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cities are facing tremendous pressures from challenges asso-
ciated with rapid urbanization. The United Nations estimates
that 4.2 billion or 55% of the worlds’ population lives in
urban areas in 2018 and a 25 billion or 13% will be added
by 2050 [1]. City growth gives rise to not only population
explosion, but also severe issues such as traffic congestion,
pollution, non-renewable resource depletion, and increas-
ing social inequality [2]–[4]. These urban problems do not
respect borders of the nations or limits between industrial
domains [5]. Great responsibilities on solving them lie at the
city level, where conflicts regarding economic, social and
environmental development are often managed. Some even
say that ‘‘Mayors rule the world’’ [6].
For the past decades, numerous urban sustainability and
smart cities frameworks have been proposed [7]–[10]. They
provide tools to help urban policy makers make decisions,
take actions, and assess the cities’ progress towards a more
sustainable future [11].
Recently, researchers started to advocate the notion of
‘‘blockchain cities’’ [5] as the next wave in transforming the
urban context to meet the urbanization challenges. In this
regard, blockchain may be compared to a General Purpose
Technology [12] that is ‘‘complementary to human and orga-
nizational capital and whose usage is shaped by political
choice and by the urban ecosystem of the citizens, technology
vendors and local authorities, depending on the city’s needs
and habits’’ [10]. Many believe that blockchain is poised to
play an important role in the sustainable development of the
global economy [13], improving people’s quality of life and
ultimately bringing fundamental changes to the world we
live [14]. A World Economic Forum report estimates that
10% of global GDP will be stored on blockchain technology
by year 2027 [15].
Blockchain features a decentralized shared database
that provides transparency and immutability of transac-
tion records. Initially implemented by the well-known
cryptocurrency Bitcoin [16], it later evolves to offer a

trust-free platform for execution of arbitrary business logic
through many alternative blockchain platforms, for instance,
Ethereum [17] and Hyperledger Fabric [18]. These continu-
ously evolving blockchain technologies are increasingly con-
sidered a disruptive force to virtually every sector of the
society [19]–[22].
Many cities around the world have reported blockchain-
related initiatives, such as those in Australia, China,
Denmark, United Arab Emirates, Estonia, Georgia, Ghana,
Honduras, Malta, Russia, Sweden, Singapore, Spain,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ukraine, United States
(US) [23]–[27]. Cities and states set up various goals and
employ many approaches in the race to lead the blockchain
wave. For example, Dubai is building a single software plat-
form through which city public sector can launch blockchain
projects, as part of the ambition to become paperless by
2020 [28]; in contrast, Illinois takes a more experimen-
tal approach, launching multiple separate blockchain pilots
across different industrial sectors including governance, edu-
cation, health-care and energy, each selecting their own
blockchain platform as appropriate [28]. Zug is developing
itself to be a ‘‘crypto valley’’ through establishing a crypto-
friendly business ecosystem [29]. New York City announced
plans to launch the Blockchain Resource Center as a hub for
the city’s blockchain industry and to convene both govern-
ment and citizen stakeholders in developing a regulatory envi-
ronment that stimulates the overall blockchain industry [30].
Despite all the ongoing blockchain efforts, many also
believe that our current understanding of blockchain is pre-
mature and there is a lack of knowledge on where blockchain
technology can provide mentionable societal effects [31].
Sometimes the field is even described as ‘‘an innovative tech-
nology searching for use cases’’ because it is largely unknown
how blockchain could be incorporated to existing digital
services, processes and infrastructures [22]. In a testimony
to the US congress, US Department of Homeland Security’s
Science and TechnologyDivision Director DouglasMaughan
also pointed out specific concerns in the blockchain space for
the asymmetries between knowledge and action [32]. Biased
use of the buzzword in fragmented or superficial ways will
lead to more confusion than clarity. Falling into the tendency
to believe that innovative technologies like blockchain can
automatically transform the ecosystem around us will actu-
ally hinder the achievement of the technology’s real potential.
Under this mixed backdrop, this paper attempts to advance
the understanding towards how blockchain can fit in the
next level of urban development initiatives, by combining
foundational frameworks on sustainable and smart cities
with blockchain domain knowledge accumulated by the
research community. Through helping city policy makers,
industrial practitioners and all stakeholders better understand
blockchain use cases in cities, we hope to facilitate decision
makers in planning of blockchain strategy and drive actions
in the most pertinent industrial domains that contribute to
meet the urban growth challenges. Our work also serves to
reinforce the notion that blockchain technology by itself will
not transform the city; instead the change requires a political
understanding of technologies, a process approach with focus
on all aspects of public values.
Our research employs a pragmatic methodology to provide
a comprehensive literature review on the blockchain use cases
studied in academic journals and conference proceedings.
Given the enormous number of papers about blockchain,
we confine our work to the portion of papers that focus on
concrete use cases and with extensive system coverage. Our
main contributions are in the following areas:
• We provide an application-oriented use case review
of 159 selected papers, and organize them based on a list
of 9 industrial sectors central to 16 major global urban
sustainability and smart city reference frameworks as
identified in [7]. Our review shows how blockchain-
enabled innovations are changing the urban systems and
the ramification of these changes for different sectors
of the society. We also illustrate how our application-
oriented review can be used to evaluate the blockchain
application efforts for urban sustainability goals.
• We dive deeper into a subset of 71 papers to exam-
ine more details about their design and implementa-
tion choices. To facilitate the analysis, we propose
a component-based general analysis framework for
blockchain use cases that covers both the external and
internal factors of the blockchain system. We further
show that the component-based analysis can help iden-
tify gaps in actual blockchain use cases versus common
blockchain applicability criteria.
• We propose two classification methods for blockchain
use cases, one role-based and the other business model
based. We also demonstrate how these taxonomies can
provide insights for cross-sector blockchain application
design and analysis.
The structure of this paper is as follows: we present back-
ground knowledge on blockchain technology in Section II
and introduce our research methodology in Section III.
Section IV provides related work. The next two sections,
Section V and Section VI contain our main application-
oriented review and components-based analysis of the
blockchain use cases, respectively. They are followed by
Section VII which conducts a further discussion on the anal-
ysis results. Lastly, Section VIII concludes the paper, sum-
marizes its contributions and limitations, and suggests future
work.
II. OVERVIEW OF BLOCKCHAIN
Table 1 lists three representative blockchain technologies and
their main characteristics, which will be elaborated below to
give an overview of the topic.
A. BITCOIN CRYPTO CURRENCY BLOCKCHAIN
The blockchain concept is known to originate from a paper
on Bitcoin [16] published in 2008 by someone in the name of
Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto currency
76788 VOLUME 6, 2018

TABLE 1. Representative blockchain technologies.
and remains the most important blockchain application today.
It is believed that the inventor created Bitcoin to offer an alter-
native to the central-bank controlled monetary system, which
many people consider as a cause of the global economic crisis
around 2008.
A typical blockchain consists of a peer-to-peer network of
computer nodes that maintain a decentralized shared database
of records. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, the records
contain transfer transactions of Bitcoin crypto currency
between participating parties. Each party in the transaction
has a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) private key and public
key pair. The hash value of the public key is used as the
party’s identity or transaction address. Transaction parties
sign the transactions using their private key, which could
later be verified by other parties using the signer’s public
key. The transactions are broadcast to all peer nodes in the
network. Using a distributed consensus mechanism, the peer
nodes agree on what transactions are valid and the sequence
of those transactions that take place. These transactions are
placed into a data structure called ‘‘block’’ and committed
to the shared database to form a linked chain, hence the
name ‘‘blockchain’’. Each block in the blockchain has its
own timestamp and a cryptographic hash that connects it to
the prior block. Blocks can only be appended, not deleted.
The outcome is a shared database with an ever-growing list
of records that are immutable and irreversible; tampering of
any block information can be detected by peer nodes on the
blockchain.
1) PROOF-OF-WORK DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS
Distributed consensus mechanism is critical for blockchain
since it determines which block can be accepted and inserted
to the chain. This is akin to agreeing on distributed power
allocation because the node authoring the accepted block
(hereafter referring to as the official validator) is able to
change the state of the database shared by every other peer.
In order to secure this process, the power allocation has to
be associated with some cost and resources to prevent abuse.
The solution employed by the original Bitcoin blockchain
is called proof-of-work, in which nodes have to compete
by calculating a cryptographically sophisticated puzzle. The
characteristics of this puzzle ensures three properties: a node
has to invest corresponding amount of computing power to
complete it; the next node to successfully solve the puzzle
is random; and a node’s claim on finding the answer of the
puzzle can be easily verified by any other peer nodes. One
additional issue is, however, malicious nodes controlled by an
attacker could also be randomly selected as official validator
as long as they follow the same process. Once chosen, a mali-
cious node could still try to inject blocks of false transaction
records into the blockchain. Therefore, there is a follow-up
implicit consensus step after a peer node receives the block
proposed by the official validator. In this step, the peer nodes
can verify the transactions in the received new block, and
if any anomaly is detected in it (such as inconsistency of
the linked hash values, or mismatched transaction signature
and identity), they can keep the prior state of the blockchain
without accepting the new block. Otherwise if everything
goes well, the node confirms the new block and accepts
the updated blockchain. The likelihood of a block being
rejected diminishes exponentially with the number of accep-
tance confirmations it receives from different nodes. After a
certain number (e.g., 6 in the case of Bitcoin) of confirma-
tions, the block is considered permanently committed to the
blockchain.
2) CRYPTO TOKEN ECONOMICS
In addition to using distributed consensus mechanism to pre-
vent nodes from misbehaving, the blockchain can also use
crypto token asset to proactively incentivize desired node
behavior. In particular, the official validator is rewarded some
crypto tokens for its efforts in validating and packaging the
new block of transactions whenever it introduces a valid
block that gets accepted into the blockchain. This rewarded
crypto token can be created (mined) when a new block is
inserted into the blockchain (the process is called crypto token
mining), or it can be paid by the initiators of the transactions
in the block as a service fee. If the official validator tries
to introduce a block with invalid transaction information,
however, that block could be rejected by peer nodes from the
blockchain. The official validator then lose the crypto token
rewards associated with that block.
In the Bitcoin blockchain, the corresponding crypto token
is Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s value is established upon its utility as a
currency paymentmethod and its expected appreciation of the
future values, leading to a liquidity market between the crypto
token and fiat currency. This essentially creates a crypto token
economic model around the Bitcoin.
B. FROM CRYPTO CURRENCY TO EVERYTHING
The notion of blockchain soon expands from crypto curren-
cies to general purpose business areas.

C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
1) ETHEREUM AND SMART CONTRACTS
Ethereum [17] represents the next major leap after Bitcoin in
the blockchain space with its full support for smart contracts.
A contract is a fundamental piece of our market economy
and defines relationships among both businesses and indi-
viduals. The smart contract concept is originally proposed
by Szabo in 1994, who states that ‘‘The general objectives
of smart contract design are to satisfy common contractual
conditions, minimize exceptions both malicious and acciden-
tal, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries [33]’’.
To achieve these objectives, smart contract clauses expressing
business logic can be encoded in computer programs and
automatically executed with computer-based systems. The
vending machine carries a primitive form of smart contracts
by implementing a simple transaction of accepting coins and
returning corresponding goods.
For generic smart contracts, the blockchain is arguably
a perfect infrastructure as it provides a transparent and
traceable platform that allows parties to perform trust-free
transactions with each other without intermediaries. In this
paradigm, smart contracts are computer programs written in
a language supported by the underlying blockchain platform.
The programs are automatically executed according to the
designated triggering conditions in the contracts. These con-
ditions can be outcomes of transactions or interactions with
other smart contracts. The conditions can also be triggered
by external events. Since there is no native way for smart
contracts to directly interact with external systems, Oracle
services act as the bridge to provide a single truth view of
the external system for smart contracts.
The critical characteristics of blockchain-based smart con-
tracts compared with traditional contracts can be summa-
rized in three aspects. First, smart contracts running on a
blockchain are entirely managed by computer code and not
subject to control of any central entity. Second, the only way
to modify a deployed smart contract is to create a new one
under the consent of all involved parties. The old one cannot
be simply retracted. Third, it is cost-effective to establish
multi-party agreements requiring multiple conditions, result-
ing in great flexibility.
Smart contract can also bemodeled as a state machine [34].
After its execution the states across network nodes will
be consistently updated; blockchain’s consensus process
achieves this update and therefore some people compare
blockchain as the operating system for smart contracts [35].
Ethereum is the most well-known blockchain platform for
running smart contracts. It has an integrated Turing-complete
computer language by design, whichmeans it can support any
kind of general purpose programs. Execution of the code is
through a virtual machine and costs ‘‘gas’’ fees paid through
its native Ether crypto token. The charge of gas fees is to
prevent the computer system from being abused and enter-
ing dead loop. In contrast, the original Bitcoin blockchain
offers very limited scripting capability and is only able to
support rudimentary smart contracts, if at all. But that could
be intentional by the Bitcoin designers since it is reasonable
for a crypto currency application not to allow arbitrary pro-
grammable manipulation in order to mitigate security risks.
2) GENERIC CRYPTO TOKEN SYSTEMS
As smart contracts widely open up the spectrum of possi-
ble blockchain applications, the meaning of crypto tokens
in blockchain also evolved from a digital currency to rep-
resenting any tradable asset, from fungible goods such
as movie tickets, loyalty points, company shares, to non-
fungible things such as software license. Use of these tokens
makes programming asset exchange possible and executing
the business logic easier. For that reason, blockchains such
as Ethereum provide standard mechanisms to facilitate token
issuance, distribution and exchange, including the ERC-
20 tokens [36] for fungible and the ERC721 token [37] for
non-fungible and indivisible assets.
The expanded role of crypto tokens comeswith appropriate
token economic models. The two common models are util-
ity and security. In the utility model, tokens provide utility
values. For example, the Ether token serves as the payment
method for transaction fees on the Ethereum platform at
the infrastructure level, and Bitcoin tokens can be used as a
payment method for assets exchange at the application level.
In the security model, crypto tokens function like securities.
At the infrastructure level, theymay entitle their holders to the
mining rights of the blockchain, or voting rights on the direc-
tions of the platform development, or profits sharing with the
platform (e.g., from transaction fees). At the application level,
crypto tokens held in a decentralized autonomous organiza-
tion can represent governance rights in the organization.
Regardless of the utility or security model, the crypto
token’s function as incentives is still carried over in many
blockchain applications. Besides providing infrastructure
level incentives to secure the network as in the original Bit-
coin blockchain, these incentives are also applied at the appli-
cation level, e.g., a use case promoting sustainability may
reward participants for their use of environmental friendly
transportation methods.
3) PROOF-OF-STAKE DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS
In the distributed consensus space, there have been a lot of
developments addressing a common complaint about Bit-
coin’s proof-of-work mechanism, specifically, it consumes
too much energy because of the intensive computational
requirements. A popular alternative proposed is called proof-
of-stake. It chooses the node to be the official validator based
on the proportional stake of the network value that each node
holds, and therefore eliminating the computational cost. But
the proof-of-stake mechanism has its own problems, notably
the ‘‘Nothing at stake’’ issue which in the event of conflicts
could prevent a blockchain from convergence and result in
forked chains; and the ‘‘Long-range attack’’ issue where the
longest fork of the chain may be replaced by a chain recon-
structed from the genesis block. There are various efforts
76790 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
trying to address these shortcomings. For example, the dele-
gated proof-of-stake approach lets nodes elect delegate nodes
to serve as designated validators for new blocks, and these
nodes can be out-voted if they do not behave properly. While
delegated proof-of-stake is more resilient to the problems
with the original proof-of-stake mechanism, it also reduces
the system’s degree of decentralization.
C. FROM PERMISSIONLESS TO PERMISSIONED
In the Bitcoin blockchain model, any node can join and
participate in the peer-to-peer network, so it is called a per-
missionless blockchain. It is similar to the Internet model,
where virtually any node can connect and become part of it.
The Ethereum blockchain also belongs to the permissionless
blockchain category. Afterwards, the blockchain community
introduced the permissioned blockchain model. The proposi-
tion for a permissioned blockchain comes from a different
mentality and is more suitable for an industrial consor-
tium or enterprise environment. It enables participants to be
authorized before they can join the network and be assigned
appropriate functional privileges in the network matching
their respective identities. If every participation and access
of the blockchain needs to be controlled, it is also called
a private blockchain. A permissioned blockchain contains a
logically centralized trusted identity management system that
issues cryptographic certificates to qualified participants, and
a distributed database under a decentralized administration,
providing improved transparency and auditability across the
involved parties than in traditional distributed databases.
1) BYZANTINE FAULT TOLERANCE DISTRIBUTED
CONSENSUS
The consensus mechanism in permissionless blockchains are
usually competitive in nature. That is because the nodes in
those blockchains do not trust each other, and having them
put up some stake (e.g., computer power, economic cost)
in order to participate in the consensus outcome protects
the security of the network. In a permissioned blockchain,
the official validators of new blocks are known. This opens up
a broad collection of distributed consensus protocol possibil-
ities. A popular family is based on state-machine replication
with byzantine fault tolerance [38], which has the capability
to function successfully in the presence of certain number
of malicious or faulty nodes. In a typical practical byzantine
fault tolerance environment, nodes are divided into clients
and validators. Validators manage public key infrastructure
identity and certificate authority. The clients send their trans-
actions to a primary validator, which in turn broadcast the
information to other validators. Those validators process the
transaction and send response back to the original client. The
client collects at least one third of the same results from all
the validators to confirm the transaction. This mechanism can
achieve a much higher performance, a throughput in the order
of tens of thousands of transactions per second compared to
7 transactions per second in the original Bitcoin blockchain.
Nevertheless, the scalability of state-machine replication with
practical byzantine fault tolerance has not been proven [34],
and it is typically suitable only for systems with a relatively
small number of nodes [20].
Hyperledger Fabric [18] is a well-known permissioned
blockchain and provides multiple algorithm options for
the consensus process, including byzantine fault tolerance
algorithms.
2) SMART CONTRACTS
In terms of smart contracts, a permissioned blockchain may
also provide full smart contract capabilities, such as the
Hyperledger Fabric blockchain or they may provide only
limited capabilities, such as the MultiChain platform [39].
3) CRYPTO TOKEN MODELS
In permissionless blockchains, the crypto token models cre-
ate opportunities for economic alignment, shared interest,
and coordination between distributed and trustless individ-
uals [35]. Token holders on the blockchain naturally have
a vested interest in the success of the specific crypto token
and its underlying blockchain infrastructure that supports its
utility or security value.
In contrast, permissioned blockchains have centralized
control on node participation. They generally do not need
the type of crypto tokens serving as incentives to sustain the
blockchain infrastructure, even though application-specific
tokens can still be applicable.
D. BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY
A peer-to-peer blockchain network entails important secu-
rity risks especially when it is permissionless where any-
one can join. Some of the most important vulnerabilities of
blockchains are the following:
Double spending: in a Bitcoin type of crypto currency
payment network, a malicious party may attempt to pay the
same units of crypto currency simultaneously to two different
parties. This is called a double-spending attack. In general,
the network needs to make sure that once one of those trans-
actions is accepted, the other one will be rejected in order to
prevent double spending.
Sybil attack [40]: a malicious party could create many
nodes all under his own control to increase his chance of being
selected as the official validator and control the blockchain.
This problem is why resources are required to participate in
the validator selection and crypto token incentives are offered
to encourage proper behavior.
51% attack: an attacker could compromise the blockchain
by trying to obtain overwhelming resources. In the case of
proof-of-work, owning 51% of the computing power would
control more than half of the block validator opportunity and
also significantly improve the success possibility of other
attacks such as double spending. A sufficiently large network
deters the 51% attack by the enormous amount of resources
required to launch it.
Denial-of-Service attack: a malicious node could refuse
to add a valid transaction into the blockchain, essentially
VOLUME 6, 2018 76791
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
denying service to the particular transaction party. This risk
is mitigated by blockchain’s de-centralized network archi-
tecture. Since the transaction information is broadcast to all
nodes, it is hopeful that at least some nodes will process it if
the transaction is valid.
III. METHODOLOGY
A. BLOCKCHAIN USE CASE CATEGORIES UNDER
SUSTAINABLE AND SMART CITY CONTEXT
Due to the infancy stage of the technology, strategic plan-
ning for blockchain applications in cities is still a largely
unknown field. Meanwhile, blockchain technology as a dig-
ital innovation is conceptually related to the key information
and communications technologies underlying smart cities.
We therefore turn to the existing smart cities and its well-
known predecessor, sustainable cities framework as refer-
ences. Those frameworks have become the de facto goals
for cities around the world for decades, providing a plausible
anchor point for organizing our research on blockchain for
cities. Smart cities are commonly assessed based on prior
experiences on sustainability and quality of life, with a sig-
nificant addition of modern technological components [41],
but there are important differences between sustainable and
smart city indicators [7].
In order to create a meaningful discussion of blockchain
for cities with both smartness and sustainability goals in
mind, we adopt the essential city sectors for sustainable
and smart cities identified by [7] as a result of its thorough
examination on 16 of the most well-established sets of assess-
ment frameworks, 8 on smart cities and 8 on sustainable
cities. These categories include ‘‘Governance and citizen
engagement’’, ‘‘Education, culture, science and innovation’’,
‘‘Well-being, health and safety’’, ‘‘Economy’’, ‘‘Transporta-
tion’’,‘‘Energy’’,‘‘Water and waste management’’, ‘‘Built
environment’’, ‘‘Natural environment’’, and ‘‘Information
and Communications Technology (ICT)’’. The only excep-
tion we made is the exclusion of the ICT sector, which is
not to undermine its importance, but is a trade-off from the
scope of this paper which focuses on blockchain technology
applications in urban sectors other than the digital technology
itself.
B. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
With the industrial sectors defined, we formulate the follow-
ing research questions for our review:
• What are the blockchain use cases studied by the
research community in the sectors central to smart and
sustainable cities?
• What could be a unified framework to examine those use
cases regardless of their sectors?
• How do we evaluate the impact of the use cases on urban
sustainability?
• How do we evaluate the blockchain applicability of the
found use cases?
• What appropriate taxonomies of blockchain applications
can be derived to facilitate cross-sector use case analy-
sis?
To answer the above research questions, we refer to best
practices for a systematic review [42]–[44] and follow a
standard protocol for selecting literature to be included in the
review.
C. DATA SOURCES
The sources of search include both the main major-focused
databases ACM, ASCE, IEEE, e-Government Research
Library (EGRLv13.5) [45] and multidisciplinary databases
JSTOR, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer, Web of Science,
Wiley. Since this particular study is interested in scientific
knowledge on the blockchain application for cities, we focus
on literature in academic journal and conference proceedings,
which helps to ensure quality [31], [43], [46].
D. SEARCH PROCESS
We posed search term hypothesis and conducted test search to
establish an overview of the topic as the foundation. Initially
we used a combination of keywords including blockchain
and city or urban, but found those search terms too lim-
ited. Blockchain application has been proposed on virtually
every aspects, many of them touching certain city sectors
but the papers do not necessarily state city or urban explic-
itly. Therefore, we eventually settled on finding all papers
only with the term blockchain, as in most of the related
work [47]–[49]. This process results an initial number
of 3827 papers. It is worth noting that this number is not
much different from the total number of papers a related
work [31] found back in January 2017 from a similar list of
sources, even though we would expect a number much larger
given the highly intensified attention to this topic through
2017 and 2018. This could be caused by the fact that [31] used
both blockchain and the non-concatenated word block chain
as search terms. During our test search, we found that the
non-concatenated term could produce large number of false
positives, basically papers referring to block chain notions
in scientific fields very different from the blockchain we are
concerned about. Even for a small number of papers where
they do refer to the blockchain of our discussion, they often
also include the concatenated version of the term blockchain
either in full paper body or cited references. So we choose
to use the blockchain term as with most of the other related
work.
E. SCREENING PROCESS
We then examined title, abstract and keywords, and when
unsure, the full text body of the retained papers to select
the ones that are relevant to our research questions. Given
the huge number of papers in question, we have to properly
confine our scope and at the same time avoid sacrificing our
research goals. Our scope limit is defines as follows:
76792 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
We select papers that present sufficient depth of sys-
tem design or prototype evaluations on concrete use cases
in the 9 sectors we articulated in Section III-A: ‘‘Gover-
nance and citizen engagement’’, ‘‘Education, Culture, Sci-
ence and Innovation’’, ‘‘Well-being, health and safety’’,
‘‘Economy’’, ‘‘Transportation’’,‘‘Energy’’,‘‘Water and waste
management’’, ‘‘Built environment’’, and ‘‘Natural environ-
ment’’. We explicitly excluded papers in the following cat-
egories: conceptual discussions of blockchain and its trends,
papers focusing on aspects that are more generic and agnostic
to sectors, such as improving blockchain technology itself,
ICT and identity management, and other technical papers
proposing algorithms without an emphasis on explicit use
cases in the sectors we identified. We also excluded cryp-
tocurrency related use cases as that has been the focus of
most of the prior reviews and also is more concerned at the
central government level. However, we do include cases that
use cryptocurrency payments as part of the mechanism if
they fit our other selection criteria. The above process leads
to a total number of 159 non-duplicated papers across all
the 9 sectors for our first part, application-oriented use case
review. For the second part of our review which dives deeper
into system component analysis, we further nail down to a
subset of papers that provide more details concerning our
component-based framework. That process renders 71 of the
159 papers across 8 of the 9 sectors.
IV. RELATED WORK
Reviews of blockchain research in the recent years show
that the majority of scholarly work has focused on improve-
ments and challenges of current protocols, primarily for
cryptocurrencies in general and for Bitcoin in particular
[14], [47], [50], [51]. Little is on research that delves into pur-
ported disruptive potential of blockchain [52].While research
on some areas especially cryptocurrencies and payments
are well developed, comprehensive understanding regarding
application and use cases is generally missing [31].
Table 2 compares our work with the related systematic lit-
erature review work we found. In addition to a more updated
list of papers examined, the focus of our work differs from all
of them. Our work explicitly excluded pure cryptocurrency
systems and instead investigates general purpose blockchain
use cases, while [47], [48], [51] are all primarily focused
on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency literature. Reference [53] is
not a general purpose blockchain use case review but par-
ticularly discussing the impact of blockchain characteristics
on service systems. Reference [49] is a bibliometric study
reporting the number of blockchain papers in the surveyed
set in four categories: Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Con-
tracts, E-governance, and Others, with brief explanation on
each category. Lastly, [31] proposes a conceptual frame-
work for blockchain research adapted from recognized social
media research agenda. It features an intersection of activities
between user and blockchain developers at different levels of
analysis, and serves to stimulate multidisciplinary research
approaches on blockchain. The component-based framework
proposed and followed in this paper, however, takes on a very
different perspective that geared toward cross-sector analysis
for system design and implementations.
There are much more related work that center on specific
domains with various levels of depth and may or may not
adopt a systematic literature review approach, for instance,
on finance and cryptocurrencies [54]–[56], governance [24],
education [57], energy [58], IoT [59], healthcare [60]. Our
work differs from them in that we stress a use case study
across all sectors in the smart and sustainable city context,
and apply the proposed component-based analysis to drive
cross-sector insights. To the authors’ knowledge, we are the
first to provide a systematic blockchain use case review with
this methodology.
V. APPLICATION-ORIENTED USE CASE REVIEW
BY SECTORS
The 159 papers selected for our application-oriented review
in all sectors are shown in Table 3. Even though one use case
could involve aspects from multiple sectors, we place each
use case into only one primary sector to facilitate the dis-
cussion. We will then relate use cases from various different
sectors in later sections.
A. GOVERNANCE AND CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT
Digital governance contributes to the crucial sustainable
development agenda [219], [220], for example, in reducing
corruption, lowering administrative costs, insuring document
integrity, connecting donors and disadvantaged groups like
refugees and displaced people [221], [222].
To look at how blockchain as a digital technology is
likely to have a significant impact on city governance, it is
helpful to start with the four ideal-typical conceptualizations
of smart city governance identified by [223]. They include:
(1) government of a smart city, (2) smart decision-making,
(3) smart administration and (4) smart urban collabora-
tion. These four models represent an increasing level of
progressiveness from more conservative to more radical.
The ‘‘governance of a smart city’’ model concerns about
setting up the right policy choice and effectively imple-
menting the initiatives under the traditional governmen-
tal structures. It is the most basic and common model.
The ‘‘smart decision-making’’ model entails restructuring of
the decision-making process. An example of this model is
urban decision-making leveraging big-data collected from
IoT sensor networks. This model involves a certain level
of transformation in the process but not at the govern-
ment organization itself. The ‘‘smart administration’’ model
requires using sophisticated Information Technology (IT)
to interconnect information, processes, institutions, and
physical infrastructure to better serve citizens and com-
munities [224]. It thus leads to re-structuring of existing
government organization to integrate traditional functions of
government and business [225]. Lastly, the ‘‘smart urban
collaboration’’ model is the most transformative which
requires transformation at both internal and external of

the government organizations. It emphasizes truly citizen-
centric operations and services based on collaboration across
departments and communities [226], a technology-enabled
community-based model of governance [227] and a pro-
active, open-minded governance structure where all actors
work together to maximize the urban sustainability and min-
imizes negative externalities [228].
It is important to note that active engagement of citi-
zens and stakeholders in collaborative urban governance is
hardly political in nature [223]. That is because collabora-
tive urban governance taps into the intelligence of all urban
actors to create public values by providing conditions to
motivate knowledge generation, exchange and innovation by
citizens [229]. This way, the citizens themselves become the
best regulators of cities [219]. Open data offers an example
of strengthening collective intelligence of city stakeholders to
derive innovations, even though at the same time governments
should carefully decide how and to which actors this data
is opened up [230] and how to protect the confidentiality,
privacy and intellectual property rights for data and model
development [225].
The blockchain use cases in the surveyed papers tend to
discuss solutions on the more progressive side of the digital
governance spectrum. In particular, using innovative IT to
transform existing processes and better serve citizens (the
‘‘smart administration’’ model) and collaborative urban gov-
ernance (the ‘‘smart urban collaboration’’ model).
1) INNOVATIVE IT TRANSFORMATION FOR EXISTING
PROCESSES
Under this category, blockchain-based systems have been
proposed to transform the government document sharing pro-
cess. Between the government and the public, [61] describes a
system that stamps a government decision on the blockchain
to keep an immutable and transparent record to be verified
anytime in the future; between government and businesses,
[62] designs a system for business to share information with
government organizations in a way that helps business both
ensure the confidentiality of the information and avoid liabil-
ity; between government agencies themselves, [63] presents
an inter-agency document sharing system, where the request-
ing agency first looks up a pre-constructed catalog to locate
the destination agency and then conducts a direct document
sharing exchange with it. The transaction is at the same
time recorded on the blockchain for robust and secure access
control.
There are also blockchain systems targeting at transform-
ing two of the most important government processes - one is
voting, which forms the government, and the other is taxation,
which finances the government. The goal of an E-voting sys-
tem is to achieve anonymity, privacy and transparency [64].
Anonymity ensures the non-traceability of the voter’s vote.
Privacy allows the transaction of the vote to stay hidden, and
transparency ensures the public that the voting mechanism
cannot not be tampered with. Design of blockchain systems
for voting are found in a number of literatures [64]–[69].
Some also produced prototypes [70]–[72]. However, an issue
with all these systems is that the authentication of voters at
the personal level has to be ensured outside the blockchain.
In the area of taxation, blockchain solutions enable tax
authorities to have more control over the tax system. Refer-
ence [73] describes a private blockchain that can be managed
by the tax authority to monitor value-added-tax invoices and
keep an immutable record on the taxable transactions, thus
preventing tax revenue losses. The system in [74] tackles a
different scenario by using the blockchain to track the divi-
dend paid to stakeholders, in order to overcome the problem
of duplicated tax refund due to forged dividend payment
claims.
2) CITIZEN-CENTRIC COLLABORATIVE URBAN GOVERNANCE
While the urban collaboration perspective is the dominance
of transformational ideas in literature on smart city gov-
ernance [223], an inherent issue is that the e-governance
models associated with smart city initiatives typically rely on
Internet-based online tools which are increasingly monopo-
lised by a few companies serving as de facto central author-
ities [231]. Lack of transparency and trust on a centralized
network infrastructure could be a key factor that hinders the
true realization of the citizen participatory governancemodel.
Researchers believe that blockchain has the ability to re-
decentralize the Internet [231], enable a decentralized deliv-
ery model that allows rethinking complex systems in a more
participatory manner [232], and become an important infras-
tructure for e-government [233]. Blockchain helps build soci-
etal trust with an intrinsic checks and balance systems and
promotes a society of dignity, recognition, and respect [234]
that could be fundamental to the most transformative collab-
orative governance model.
One project illustrating this vision is [5] which concen-
trates on the area of urban policy making. The authors
state that current urban codes such as policies, planning,
regulations and standards are not up to meeting the urban
sustainability challenges due to their top-down delivery
and implementation methods. Blockchain-based mechanism
makes it possible to truly deliver and execute urban codes
bottom-up. A blockchain system [5], [75]–[77] was proposed
as a connecting mechanism to create the people’s layer of the
VOLUME 6, 2018 76795
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
governance systems that connects urban technologies. In the
case of policies and codes, citizens submit their urban needs
to the blockchain, which will be prioritized by a blockchain
consensus mechanism for the authorities to draft policies.
These drafts will be ratified through the blockchain validation
capabilities. Further transform of these plans into physical
forms (e.g., construction of infrastructure projects) can be
approved via voting mechanisms on the blockchain as well.
The plans and regulations can also be standardized for repli-
cability and scalability purpose, using the same bottom-up
approach for citizen participatory standardization.
Another related blockchain project shows a citizen-
participatory decision support framework under the health-
care context [78]. It runs an agent-based simulation model
on the blockchain, incorporating rules from expert stakehold-
ers, open data and anonymized volunteer participants data.
The project illustrates how such a framework can be helpful
in an infectious disease spread scenario, through improving
transparent and ethical management of individual data and
promoting evidence-based collective decision making.
B. EDUCATION, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND INNOVATION
1) EDUCATION AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES
Blockchain systems have been proposed to help maintain an
immutable record of the educational process. There are pro-
posals that record creative works or ideas to establish schol-
arly reputation [79], create continuous log of the learner’s
activities across different learning organizations [80], enable
global higher educational institutions to award course credits
to students who completed courses [81], and allow issuance
and revocation of educational certificates [82]. Education and
other records can be inputs to a general personal archive
management system and used by companies and services for
verification [85].
A related topic is recording of broader learning activi-
ties such as volunteer services. Reference [83] describes a
blockchain based system for life-long volunteering. Unlike
other systems that focus on scheduling and allocation of tasks,
it fosters an open volunteeringmarketplace supporting intelli-
gent matchmaking, gamification, and goal-oriented personal
development. Blockchain serves to store the persistent dig-
ital footprints for volunteering activities, assessments and
acquired qualifications, and also gives data sovereignty to the
volunteers themselves. Reference [84] is another system that
discusses using blockchain to record volunteer service time
and activity information.
2) SCIENCE, INNOVATION AND IP PROTECTION
Scientific researchers are also using blockchains to solve
problems associated with the academic community. The use
cases cover the whole life cycle from research method-
ology, peer review, manuscript publishing to intellectual
property protection. First, at the experimentation stage,
to prevent experimental integrity from being damaged by neg-
ligence or intentional wrong-doings, [86] proposes a system
to record research datasets and results to blockchain and
release them when necessary, e.g., upon approval of multiple
specified signatories, thus providing an audit trail of research
data. Reference [87] suggests using adaptable blockchain-
based choreographies for collaborative, reproducible in silico
experiments towards both Robust Accountable Reproducible
Explained (RARE) research [235] and Findable Accessi-
ble Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) results. Second, at paper
authoring stage, [88] presents a blockchain platform that
preserves and measures author contributions based on the
edits that authors commit. Third, at the peer-review stage,
blockchain system can also stimulate a timely and sustainable
review process. As described in [89], a system can reward
cryptocurrency to reviewerswhen a quality review is accepted
by the editor. These rewarded currencies could later be used
to pay for publishing the reviewer’s own authored paper in
journals, forming a closed loop incentive mechanism. Forth,
at the publishing stage, [90] leverages prior work of seman-
tic web technologies to allow authors to collaborate on an
evolutionary version of the research progress, which could
be open for reviews or submitting to conferences or jour-
nals. This provides the possibility for a decentralized pub-
lishing system (in contrast to the existing system centered
on major publishers). By ensuring a single version of truth
throughout the paper life cycle, the system can solve the trust
issues among the different actors in the publishing ecosys-
tem, including authors, reviewers, publishers and relevant
personnels who use bibliometrics to evaluate performance.
Last but not least, on intellectual properties, [91] reports
a blockchain system that automatically creates a publicly
verifiable timestamp for each submitted manuscript, facili-
tating its origin time record protection. Use of blockchain
for intellectual property protection extends to software as
well. References [92] and [93] present design of a software
licensing validation system for publishers, enterprises and
end users. Using ownership of crypto-tokens to represent
software entitlement, the blockchain enables license valida-
tion, software updates, license transfers and related functions.
Reference [94] discusses a system for licensing of 3D printing
models. It links the model to license data on the blockchain
in order to secure the authenticity of printing data and prevent
its unauthorized use.
3) MEDIA, CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT
Intellectual property protection for digital media is also a
common blockchain application [95]. The system in [96]
proposes to register self-embedding watermarking processed
images on the blockchain in order to preserve transaction
trails and content modification histories, and provide tam-
per detection for digital image management and distribu-
tion. Reference [97] reports a system for multi-media rights
management, allowing the licensor to control permission of
particular licensee to play the designated videos. Blockchain
technology application transforms the roles of third party
intermediaries in the media industry, making artists’ careers
more sustainable by improved overall transparency of the
76796 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
value chain [98]. But there are also cautions on the feasibility
of blockchain in the copyright sphere [99]. Reference [100]
argues that using blockchain as a financialisation tool through
media rights enforcement is unlikely to empower artists but
instead will curtail the critical potential of the digital as a
mode of production and artistic expression.
Examples for blockchain in cultural and entertainment area
include [101] which implements a blockchain system that
can securely manage transfer, re-selling, validation of concert
event tickets to prevent ticket fraud, and [102], a decentralized
lottery system to ensure fairness, transparency and privacy of
the lottery process.
C. WELL-BEING, HEALTH AND SAFETY
Healthcare is a prominent area where blockchain could
found many use cases that help establish an infrastructure
to ensure transparency of medical data, analytical methods,
reproducibility of results and improved trust in translational
medical value chain [60]. As such, they have the potential
of significantly reducing the cost of developing new drugs,
diagnostic tools, and clinical regimes [236]. The following
main categories of use cases are found in the research papers.
1) CLINICAL TRIALS AND MEDICAL RECORDS
Blockchain systems have been proposed to improve the clin-
ical trials process, from keeping track of each steps, such as
patient consent and any revision of the clinical trial proto-
col [103], [104], to managing complex clinical trial data and
preventing them from unauthorized manipulation [105].
Many papers presented concepts and designs of systems
that target at enabling secure, interoperable, and efficient
access to medical records by patients, providers, and third
parties. They place emphasis on access control challenges
associated with sensitive data storage [106], preserving data
privacy and integrity [107], storage and retrieval [108] and
cross-domain medical image data sharing [109]. Blockchain
prototypes of such systems have been reported both for gen-
eral purpose medical records [110], [111] and for particular
medical areas such as oncology patient care [112]. In addi-
tion, [113] presents a system specifically for medical data
access control between cloud service providers. The effort
in [114] ensures data access accuracy for public reference
biomedical databases by providing query notary.
Some proposed systems also include collecting medical
data in mobile environment. The systems in [115] and [116]
generate health record data from patient’s smart devices and
register them to the blockchain network for tamper-resiliency.
The concept of applying blockchain in pervasive social net-
work based healthcare is explored in [117].
2) DRUG AND FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN
Medical supply chain may benefit from blockchain technol-
ogy to help protect public health. Such systems can trace
the origins of drugs by logging time series drug transaction
data generated by IoT sensors to a blockchain to prevent
counterfeits [118]. The recording of drug transactions among
manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, pharmacies, hospitals,
and consumers, can turn the drug supply chain from regulat-
ing (government audits) to surveillance (by every participants
collaboratively) [119]. Another system [120] focuses more
specifically on real-time tracking of all cannabis plants from
their production to final destination in order to undermine
their illegal markets.
There are also systems that tackle the transport aspect of
medical products. Medical products require specific quality
control and regulatory compliance such as assertion of tem-
perature and humidity during the transport process. [121]
built a system using IoT sensors to collect those transport
condition parameters and log the readings to a blockchain for
public verifiability. Blockchain is also a hot topic for tracing
of food and agricultural products [122], [123]. Researchers
have focused on secure data storage scheme for blockchain-
based agricultural product tracking systems [124], presented
customized blockchain for agricultural resource supply
chain [125], and discussed case study of blockchain agricul-
ture and food traceability in China [126].
3) INSURANCE
Improving the insurance sector is also what people believe
blockchain can be helpful. Reference [127] discusses apply-
ing blockchain to the insurance life cycle, from seeking a
quotation to binding a policy contract, to the claiming pro-
cess, which could help reduce fraudulent insurance claims.
Experimental prototypes have been created to offer fine-
grained insurance policy control [128].
There are specific subjects of insurance that received more
attention. Reference [129] implemented a micro-insurance
use case for managing and analyzing data in a pay-as-you-
go car insurance, which allows drivers who rarely use cars to
only pay insurance premium for particular trips they would
like to travel. Reference [130] built a blockchain-based pro-
totype for cyber insurance. The system aims to provide an
automated, real-time, and immutable feedback loop among
the involved parties, providing a secure distributed infrastruc-
ture for assessing cyber risks.
D. ECONOMY
While we do not consider pure cryptocurrency use cases in
this paper, nor do we discuss Initial Coin Offerings [237],
we list the following important areas we found in the surveyed
literature that blockchain is affecting the broader economy
domain.
1) COLLABORATIVE BUSINESS PROCESSES
AND SERVICE EXCHANGES
Blockchain has great potential in business process manage-
ment toward building a distributed, trustworthy infrastruc-
ture to promote inter-organizational processes [238]. Refer-
ence [131] describes a decentralized social manufacturing
platform where prosumers publish service demands and the
manufacturing community works to satisfy the demands.
Similarly, [132] presents a case on collaborative fulfillment
VOLUME 6, 2018 76797
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
of industrial product design. Another system is discussed
in [133] which provides a platform for software development
and automatic payments, incorporating trusted Oracles for
automatic software code verification.
Blockchain facilitated collaboration can be performed not
only by human, but also by autonomous agents. Refer-
ence [134] illustrates such a scenario of organizing a net-
work of unmanned aerial vehicles to make scheduled delivery
flights and report on the mission performance.
2) E-COMMERCE
Regarding the commerce market, a peer-to-peer blockchain-
based e-commerce platform is reported in [135] and used
by employees of a large multi-national company. Blockchain
efforts are also used to fight counterfeit goods in commerce.
Reference [136] describes the design of recording ownership
of products on blockchain. Reference [137] implemented a
blockchain-based prototype for product ownership manage-
ment for the post supply chain so that counterfeiters can be
detected by the consumer.
The data integrity feature of blockchain has been used for
other purposes in online commerce, specifically, [138] uses
it to prevent forged digital ads clicks for fraudulent service
commissions. The system enables user to link several ad
reports together in a form that resembles the architecture of
a blockchain. This blockchain, together with incorporated
user social behavior patterns, allows advertisers to identify
authentic ad reports.
Aside from online commerce, automated physical sales
systems such as vending machines could also leverage
blockchain technology. In the system described in [139],
automated sales systems record product quantities and sales
information on the blockchain, so users can always obtain the
current product information of the systems.
Another direction in the commerce market involves
machine-to-machine payments and human-machine hybrid
payments. The machine-to-machine payment system pre-
sented in [140] enables a smart cable connected with a smart
socket to pay for electricity using Bitcoins without any human
interaction. In order to alleviate the high Bitcoin transaction
fee problem, it uses a single-fee micro-payment protocol that
aggregates multiple smaller payments incrementally into one
larger transaction. A hybrid transaction interaction between
human and machine is reported in [141]. It proposes a con-
ceptual design of a blockchain system to ensure the integrity
and non-repudiation property of messages controlling a smart
door lock. The smart door lock verifies received control
messages for authenticity and records any door control trans-
actions on the blockchain. Reference [142] is another work
involving hybrid financial transactions between a robot and a
human for the robot to complete assigned tasks and have the
outcome asserted on the blockchain.
3) REPUTATION SYSTEMS
Reputation mechanism is important in a commerce market
and they can also benefit from blockchain technologies.
References [143] and [144] discussed the design of a
blockchain-based binary reputation system for file transfer
transactions, where the rating could be either 1 for pos-
itive or 0 for negative. A more general blockchain-based
reputation system for e-commerce applications is presented
in [145] which allows customers to leave text reviews. The
service providers need to earn and spend crypto tokens in
order to receive a review from a customer. The reviews
are recorded in the blockchain to ensure temper-resiliency
while eliminating third party intermediaries. Reference [146]
is another blockchain-based reputation system and it aims
at using a single protocol to achieve efficient, anonymity-
preserving, decentralized, and robustness against various
known attacks such as ballot-stuffing and Sybil attacks.
4) SHARING ECONOMY
Sharing economy can also be boosted by blockchain’s capa-
bility to promote trust-free transactions. Reference [147] is
a system for sharing any kind of everyday tangible object.
It enables peer users to rent devices (e.g., power tools) with-
out disclosure of any personal information. Another peer-
to-peer market prototype is reported for leftover foreign
currency exchange [148] that could help alleviate the chal-
lenges of bringing leftover foreign currency back into cir-
culation. Intangible resource sharing has also been studied.
Reference [149] presents the design of a blockchain system
for citizen broadband radio service spectrum sharing. The
system could significantly reduce operational costs, introduce
flexibility and scalability into spectrum regulation, and allow
new entrants to access local spectrum based on their specific
business needs.
To unleash the full potential of the sharing economy, some
people experimented a more social relations-based produc-
tion model, as exemplified by the Backfeed project [150].
It develops governance and economic models for decentral-
ized organizations to enable collaborative economy using
blockchain. In this framework, people contribute to a com-
mon effort, evaluate each other’s contribution and achieve
decentralized consensus on the produced value. Fair share
of the created value and rewards for the contributors are
presented through a crypto token based economy. The
blockchain maintains a permanent, transparent, and secure
infrastructure for the overall ecosystem.
E. TRANSPORTATION
1) VEHICLE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
Vehicle life cycle information is critical for the huge car
markets. Reference [151] presents a blockchain-based system
for recording and managing vehicle data to increase the trans-
parency, reduce odometer and other frauds.
2) GOODS TRANSPORTATION
In the goods transportation area, there are many discussions
on blockchain as a way to digitize the exchange of shipping
documentation, bill of lading and compliance [152], [153], all
76798 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
holds potential to cut costs in global trade. Reference [154]
presents a customized blockchain implementation that sup-
ports tamper-proof traceability of data and automates regu-
latory compliance checking. Reference [155] offers another
blockchain-based prototype for cargo tracing capability and
various supply chain management tasks. Some other work
emphasizes tracing goods of specific types and sectors, such
as dangerous goods [156], aircraft parts [157], or the marine
sector [158]. There are also efforts that combine blockchain
with different identification technologies such as Near
Field Communications (NFC) tags [159] or with Krakelee
fingerprint [160].
3) INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
Intelligent transportation systems use information and com-
munication technologies to improve efficiency in road trans-
port, traffic management and mobility management, as well
as for interfaces with other modes of transport [239].
While most intelligent transportation systems are central-
ized, blockchain has been proposed to help create a secured,
trusted and decentralized autonomous intelligent transporta-
tion ecosystem, allowing the control and management of both
physical and digital assets [161].
Reference [162] presents the concept of distributed trans-
port management system for vehicles to share their resources
and create a network in which they can produce value-added
services, such as automatic gas refill and ride-sharing. Online
taxi-hailing and ride-sharing is considered a prominent appli-
cation scenario in this area. Unlike other solutions like Uber
and Lyft, a blockchain-based solution allows better personal
privacy protection as the taxi software platform cannot obtain
the entire itinerary of the user; the user can also control access
to his travel data records [163].
Vehicle-to-Everything communications is a key compo-
nent in the proper functioning of an intelligent transporta-
tion system. Many efforts have been conducted on security
of these communications. Security credential management
systems [240] are created to issue certificates to trusted vehi-
cles and revoke certificates of misbehaving ones to ensure
message security and privacy. Reference [164] describes the
design of a decentralized alternative to existing security cre-
dential management systems by using blockchain technol-
ogy to remove the need for centralized trusting authority.
It improves the global revocation algorithm performance
through hierarchical consensus, and creates accountability for
misbehaving parties. The system in [165] tackles dynamic
key management for heterogeneous intelligent transportation
systems by leveraging the blockchain network to transport
vehicle security keys across different security domains. Ref-
erences [166] and [167] proposed blockchain-based reputa-
tion system in vehicular networks. Vehicles rate the received
messages based on observations of traffic environments and
store them on the blockchain. These ratings represent the
consensus of crowds on each vehicle’s reputation and allow
vehicles to assess the credibilities of received messages.
Other efforts, [168] and [169] also focus on secure inter-
vehicles communication mechanisms.
Reliability of the communications, such as privacy-
preserving incentive announcement network based on
blockchain is examined by [170]. Through an efficient anony-
mous vehicular announcement aggregation protocol, the sys-
tem helps improve the reliability of announcements in the
non-fully-trusted vehicular ad hoc network, without revealing
users’ privacy.
Software updates for smart vehicles is also important to
keep the system up-to-date and secure. Reference [171] pro-
poses blockchain-based security architecture to perform over-
the-air updates for smart vehicles remotely, or to securely
distribute the latest software to service centers for them to
be installed on a vehicle locally.
4) URBAN TRANSPORTATION SUSTAINABILITY
Reference [172] implemented a blockchain-based finan-
cial incentive system to encourage urban cycling. It allows
cyclists to collect their activity data and monetize their com-
muting habits through the blockchain, thus encouraging sus-
tainable transport in cities.
F. ENERGY
In the energy domain, electricity and the grid have been a
focus for blockchain related applications.
1) GRID SECURITY AND METER TRANSPARENCY
Reference [173] proposes a framework that harnesses
blockchain’s distributed features to enhance data security in
a network of smart meters. Signed meter reading messages
are broadcast to and validated by peers, and then recorded
to a private blockchain. Research also used blockchain to
provide a consumer-facing utility usage monitoring system
in order to help customers understand how the appliance
are consuming electricities and be sure that utilization data
cannot be artificially manipulated [174], [175].
2) PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY TRADING
Mass deployment of rooftop solar photovoltaic cells is
shifting electricity consumers to producers-consumers (pro-
sumers), much like citizen journalists in social media [241].
These prosumers seek to both reduce their power bills and
to sell their excess power to others, creating a new busi-
ness model on peer-to-peer energy trading transactions [176].
Such transactions improve resiliency in the grid and offer the
possibility of exchanging distributed energy at speed, scale
and security [177].
There are extensive research discussions on blockchain
enabling peer-to-peer energy trading with the smart grid and
micro grid [242]. Some research efforts focus on demand and
generation balance in the grid network. Reference [178] pro-
poses a decentralized optimal power flow model for schedul-
ing a mix of batteries, shapable loads (e.g., electric vehicles
with continuous charging levels), and deferrable loads (e.g.,
appliance and manufacturing equipments) on an electricity
VOLUME 6, 2018 76799
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
distribution network. The goal of that blockchain-based sys-
tem is to maximize social welfare by scheduling the con-
trollable loads to minimize generation cost while respecting
network constraints. Reference [179] presents a blockchain-
based energy system for automated negotiation, settlement
and payment, plus reward for system demand supply bal-
ancing support. Prosumers submit their demand request and
supply offers. The system determines whether those offers
are accepted (e.g., if demand is higher than supply then the
supply offers are accepted in order of lowest to highest). The
actual usage and supply of the users are measured. Those
who help the system resolve imbalance are rewarded and
those who make the system more imbalanced are penalized.
Reference [180] is a work focusing on efficient use of shared
energy resources to minimize external dependence. It pro-
vides a blockchain-based distributed controller. Through its
coordinated operation, the energy storage systems of house-
holds in local energy communities can achieve an increase in
efficiency and self-sufficiency. The system in [181] empha-
sizes the regulation of energy production and distribution, and
give specific attention on discouraging the production of non-
renewable energy. Reference [182] is a system that centers on
demand side management of the grid. The prototype in [183]
uses actual energy traces of UK building datasets to validate
a blockchain based decentralized management system.
Some other work examined different market mechanism
and agent behaviors in the peer-to-peer electricity trading
system. Reference [184] studies the double auction market,
which collects bids over a specified time interval and clears
the market at the end of bidding interval. It implements a
zero-intelligence agent bidding strategies where the agents
randomly quote within a uniform distribution without consid-
ering market transactions. Since micro grid transaction cycle
could be short due to uncertainty of renewable energy power
generation, the work in [185] evaluates a continuous double
auction, which matches buyers and sellers immediately upon
the detection of compatible bids. It also adopts adaptive
aggressiveness for agents, enabling them to adjust quote auto-
matically through learning mechanism according to market
price and price fluctuations. In addition, [191] implements
a blockchain-based platform extending the features of cryp-
tocurrency exchanges to provide a robo-advisor like system
to recommend the best selling strategy for prosumers in the
renewable energy market.
The overall peer-to-peer electricity trading framework has
been explored a lot. Reference [186] proposes a system
that targets at various typical industrial IoT scenarios, such
as micro grids, energy harvesting networks, and vehicle-
to-grids. A credit-based payment mechanism is included
to support fast and frequent energy trading, alleviating the
low throughput problem in typical blockchains. The trading
system presented by [187] connects energy producer smart
meters and local battery/AC main as a distributed energy
network. A controller middleware bridges communications
between the physical energy network and the blockchain.
Reference [189] discusses a machine-to-machine electricity
market in the specific context of the chemical industry. Ref-
erences [190] and [192] also present peer-to-peer electricity
trading architectures. Another work, [188] concentrates on
implementation details of a blockchain electricity trading
system. Research also shows that homeowners want to pre-
serve their privacy in using local sources of energy [193].
Therefore, privacy and anonymity is also a focus area of many
papers [194]–[197].
While most of the systems described in literature are
designs or research prototypes, the Brooklyn Microgrid,
a micro grid energy market in New York is an actual test bed
in the operation. In that system [198], the micro grid serves
as a backup that can be decoupled from the traditional grid in
case of power outage. The users’ electricity consumption and
generation data is logged in their blockchain accounts and
electricity transactions are conducted through blockchain-
based market mechanisms.
3) ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND GRID
Using blockchain for electric vehicle and grid is another
intensive area of investigation. Reference [199] discusses
a system targeting at guaranteeing the execution of energy
recharges for the autonomous electric vehicles refueling sce-
nario that meets the requirements of latency, security and
cost. Reference [200] is a blockchain-based design to enable
electric vehicles to autonomously select the most appropriate
charging stations among list of bids according to, e.g. the
planned route, car battery status, real-time traffic informa-
tion and drivers’ preferences. The protocol in [201] allows
electric vehicles to find the cheapest charging station within
a previously defined region and preserve the privacy of the
electric vehicle. Prototype systems for electric vehicle and
grid charging are presented in [202] and [203].
In addition, [204] discussed minimizing the power fluc-
tuation in the grid and reducing the overall charging cost
for electric vehicle users; [205] examined charging scenarios
involving mobile charger for electric vehicles. Peer-to-peer
electricity trading system directly between plug-in hybrid
electric vehicles is studied in [206].
G. BUILT ENVIRONMENT
The built environment and the Architecture, Engineering
and Construction (AEC) industry have also been covered in
blockchain application discussions. Trust, information shar-
ing, and process automation are of great value in construction
engineering [208]. Trust relations in the construction industry
concern about people from organizations such as clients,
contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers [209]. An ‘‘Evi-
dence of Trust’’ is especially important in the AEC indus-
try because it can scaffold the collaboration between the
involved parties, and true collaboration is critical for design
and construction [210]. The trust and many other core issues
in this industry are rooted from the distributed and complex
nature of construction projects. Solving these issues would
unlock capability and productivity of the AEC industry - just
as innovative socio-technical mechanisms of past centuries
76800 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
led to explosive advances in global trade and communica-
tion [211].
Nevertheless, blockchain applications in the built envi-
ronment and AEC fields are relatively less explored by the
research community. Even for the few papers we were able
to find, most of them are in the conceptual discussion and
design phase. Reference [208] proposes possible scenar-
ios for blockchain use in the construction industry which
includes notarization applications to eliminate the verifica-
tion time of construction documents authenticity, transac-
tion applications to facilitate automated procurement and
payment, and provenance applications to improve trans-
parency and traceability of construction supply chains. Ref-
erence [212] discusses more specifics on multi-party auto-
mated and performance-based payment upon construction
completion. The process could be integrated with Building
Information Modeling (BIM) and sensor-based remote mon-
itoring as well as visual data analytics. More on blockchain
integration with BIM is discussed in [213]. Taking a different
perspective, [214] explored using blockchain to enhance
access control in building operating systems that are designed
for energy efficiency, human comfort, and grid integration of
buildings. Leveraging a blockchain-based authorization syn-
dication platform, the authors built a prototype that extends
the building operating system beyond the single administra-
tive domain of a building, to enable democratized delegation
of authorization in multiple administrative domains without
centralized trust authority.
H. WATER AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
Related to water consumption efficiency, [207] proposes
a privacy-friendly blockchain-based gaming platform that
aims at engaging users in diminishing water or energy con-
sumption at their premises. Teams can compete with each
other or against unmanned adversary. Through collection of
secure commitments from the utility meters, the blockchain
mechanism allows the users to formally prove that they have
correctly reported their measurements without disclosing the
measurements themselves in order to preserve privacy.
I. NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Use cases found in natural environment include air quality
monitoring, sand resources management and carbon credit
trading. Reference [215] proposes a blockchain-based system
that encourages the constructive involvement of urban citi-
zens in monitoring environment quality to promote a greater
awareness of city health. Reference [216] suggests that sand
should be treated as a key resource on a par with clean air,
biodiversity, and other natural endowments. It describes a
blockchain-based approach to monitor the supply chain of
sand resources from mining to trading in order to prevent
illegal sand mining.
Blockchain technology and smart devices can also be used
to improve carbon emission compliance and trading. Ref-
erence [217] presents design of a blockchain-based emis-
sion trading system for the fashion apparel manufacturing
industry. The system aims at reducing the emissions for all
the key steps of clothing making and involves the authority,
the auditors, the firms as well as the related individuals.
Another blockchain-based emission trading proposal [218]
incorporates a reputation-based mechanism to encourage the
participants to adopt a long-term solution in emission reduc-
tion.
VI. COMPONENT-BASED BLOCKCHAIN
USE CASE ANALYSIS
In order to provide an anatomy of typical blockchain use
cases, we define a general analysis framework as shown
in Figure 1. At the top part are the writers and readers who
interact with the blockchain to update or view records. At the
center are the assets, which are the subjects of the blockchain
records. Depending on the use cases, three key properties
about the records have to be considered: transparency, pri-
vacy and anonymity. At the bottom part of the framework
stand three important pillars for the underlying blockchain
platform: distributed consensus mechanism for the database,
smart contracts for business logic, and crypto tokens used by
the infrastructure or applications. In terms of the relationship
among these components, the writers and readers on top are
external to the blockchain and the bottom pillars are internal
to the blockchain platform. The assets in the center are the
linkage between these two parts, as there could be both
off-chain and on-chain assets with appropriate mappings.
The transparency, privacy and anonymity requirements of
the assets come from the external use case properties but are
fulfilled by the internal blockchain infrastructure.
FIGURE 1. Component-based blockchain analysis framework.
A practical difficulty we face is that not all surveyed papers
explicitly discuss all aspects of the above framework in their
work. This is common because many of them may be focus-
ing on other specific aspects of the use case, or are at a design
phase where not all system decisions need to be made.
Therefore, we have to select papers that provide enough
information regarding the components of the framework. The
chosen subset of 71 papers is listed in Table 4. They represent
VOLUME 6, 2018 76801
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
TABLE 4. Paper list for component-based use case analysis.
all the prior sectors except the ‘‘Water and Waste Man-
agement’’ sector. Most of them present system prototype
implementations. Some of them do not have explicit imple-
mentations but still provide fair amount of details on the
system that allow us to deduce the components they use.
We include them to ensure a reasonable dataset size.
A. ASSETS
In the core of all blockchain applications is a distributed
database that keeps a tamper-resistant record for the associ-
ated assets. A key characteristic of the use cases we surveyed
is that they all involve off-chain assets. This is different
from pure cryptocurrency blockchain applications, which
may involve on-chain cryptocurrency assets only.
We produce a consolidated list of the off-chain assets
appeared in our studied set of use cases in Table 5. In this
table, we categorize the assets into digital or non-digital.
We consider digital assets to include both assets that are dig-
ital by origin such as software, digital media, and those that
could have a native digital representation, e.g., an electronic
version of a document or a lottery ticket. Non-digital assets
may be tangible (physical) or intangible, both need to be
digitalized before they can be brought on-chain.
For physical assets that are distinguishable from each other,
their commonly known unique digital identifier can serve
as their natural representation on the blockchain, such as
the EPC of goods [137], VIN of vehicles [151], RFID tag
of cargo [155], or ORCID of research authors [90]. Usu-
ally, digital representation of the assets include additional
attributes depending on the use case, such as the ownership
of products [137], the mileage number of vehicles [151],
the location and temperature conditions of the goods in trans-
portation [121], [155].
Non-distinguishable physical assets such as natural
resources (e.g., water and sand) can be digitalized with their
ownership and value attributes. For example, meter reading
for water consumptions [207] and sand mining demand
amount [216]. These values are also associated with the
identity that is responsible for those resources like the water
meter owner and the sand miner.
Intangible assets can also be digitalized through ownership
and values. Electricity is a key non-digital intangible asset
found in the energy sector. It is usually represented by digital
readings from smart meter devices (e.g., [173], [175], [186],
[187]), and the identity of the meter device links the electric-
ity asset to its owner.
Once assets become digital (either native or con-
verted), they still need to be brought on-chain through
human or machine based operators. However, there could
be an additional step before the asset is taken on-chain.
Blockchains are known to be notoriously unsuitable for stor-
ing large files directly. This is because the mechanism that
ensures the blockchain’s immutable and tamper-resistance
properties necessitates a lot of expensive cryptographic com-
putations for on-chain transactions. Even for very small trans-
action data size like that in the Bitcoin blockchain, the result-
ing throughput is much slower than that of comparable non-
blockchain platforms. Therefore, only certain small sized
digital assets may be recorded onto the blockchain directly,
for example an event ticket [101], lottery ticket [102], num-
ber of completed course credits [81] or a software model
license code [94]. For majority of the assets that require
larger space, e.g., medical images [113], government policy
document [61], the best practice is to store a cryptographic
hash of the original asset as its verified proof. The decision of
whether to store the asset in full or in hash format is dependent
on many practical factors such as what kind of blockchain
platform is used and what performance result is sought. For
the sake of brevity, we will not explicitly state whether the
asset is stored in full or in hash format in our discussion of
use cases for the rest of this paper.
B. WRITERS
In our analysis framework, the writers refer to parties who can
submit changes to the blockchain database. It is important to
note that the writers are external actors to the blockchain use
case. They can be separate from the actual blockchain nodes
that validate the transactions, reach consensus and commit
the transactions records onto the blockchain. In other words,
writers submit transactions that could update the blockchain
database, but it is up to the blockchain’s internal mechanisms
to accept those updates.
The records that writers submit to the blockchain describe
asset attributes. They can be static attributes, e.g., the author-
ship of a research manuscript [88], or dynamic values
resulting from continuous monitoring, e.g., DarkWeb status
reporting for Cyber security insurance [130]. An important
common category of records involve asset exchange transac-
tions, e.g., in commerce market [135], [137]. These records
are essentially a special case of dynamics asset ownership
attributes.
Permission to write and symmetry of writing privileges
among all writers are important factors that differentiate
the use cases. A use case could allow either public writing
76802 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
TABLE 5. Consolidated list of assets from the surveyed papers.
(anybody can write) or private writing (only an authorized
group of participants can write). Among the parties who can
write, they may or may not have the same level of writing
privilege.
Public writing are common for use cases targeting at
general public. In the economic sector, peer-to-peer market
of goods or services like the sharing economy for every-
day tools [147] or for leftover foreign currency [148] are
examples. Sharing of public research data in the educa-
tional sector is another example that is open for public
writing [86], [87], [89].
In most use cases of our studied list, writing is restricted for
authorized group of participants, either individuals or institu-
tions. Private writing arrangement is more common because
even use cases suitable for public writing might limit its
participants, e.g., an e-commerce market could be open only
for employees of a big company [135]. Many other cases are
naturally fit for private writing. In the case of government
sharing policy document with the public [61], the respective
government agencies are the only ones authorized to write the
respective documents to the blockchain. In a drug governance
supply chain [119], government agencies, drugmanufactures,
wholesalers and hospitals, authorized patients are allowed to
write drug related information to the blockchain. In an e-
voting [64] or environmental monitoring [215] case, writers
can be limited to citizens of the concerned region.
In addition to private versus public writing, it is helpful to
understand different types of writing privileges writers may
have. For example, in a peer-to-peer everyday tools sharing
market [148], even though the lender and the renters have
different roles, they are generally interchangeable because a
participant can act as either a lender or renter when necessary.
But in a product ownership registration and tracking sys-
tem [137], only the original manufacturers are allowed to reg-
ister the new product they produce, and the rest of the public
has instead the right to update the ownership attribute on the
record of that product. These roles are not exchangeable and
therefore the system involves asymmetric writing privileges.
C. READERS
The readers are the parties that can view records on the
blockchain database. Similar to the writing case, reading
of records on the blockchain could also be public or pri-
vate. Examples of public readability use cases are found in
the governance, educational, economy and other sectors, for
instance, government policy sharing [61], citizen participa-
tory collaborative decision-making [5], [78], public research
data sharing [86], [87], [89], sharing economy [147], [148].
Many blockchain use cases in various sectors enforce pri-
vate reading where only authorized parties can read. For
example, a certificate holder may show the certificate to
specific employers or schools when requested [82], patients
may release medical records for authorized personnels [110],
supply chain status of goods may be viewed by designated
partners [155].
D. ASSET RECORD REQUIREMENTS - TRANSPARENCY,
PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY
Transparency is a key value proposition of blockchain. How-
ever, use cases that involve off-chain assets often also require
privacy and anonymity. The privacy and anonymity mech-
anisms seen in the studied use cases fall into three broad
categories, PKI-based pseudo identity anonymity, content
VOLUME 6, 2018 76803
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
encryption, and dedicated privacy-preserving transaction
mechanisms.
1) PKI-BASED PSEUDO IDENTITY ANONYMITY
The use cases often rely on the PKI public key
based identities to provide pseudo-anonymity protection
of the transaction parties, including identities of vot-
ers in e-voting [70], value-added-tax payers [73], event
ticket holders [101], parties in the medical record shar-
ing platform [109], [110], e-commerce customers [135],
machine-to-machine electricity transactions parties [140],
product ownership registration parties [137], peer-to-peer
energy trading parties [186], [195], [206].
Traffic forensics and frequency analysis can yield patterns
that compromise the anonymity in PKI public key based
identity mechanism [110], [244], [245]. Therefore, additional
measures are taken to improve the anonymity. For example,
in an energy trading platform, the parties can generate new
messaging addresses every time a new trade negotiation is
initiated [197]. In an e-commerce rating system, in order
to ensure that the feedback review cannot be linked back
to the authoring customer, ratings are submitted only when
there are enough other customers that could obfuscate the
one actually submitting the review, and the system also
enforces a time lapse between the transaction and the review
submission [146].
2) ENCRYPTION FOR CONTENT PRIVACY
In the analyzed use cases, contents that are designated for
a particular party are often encrypted by the party’s public
keys, providing privacy and allowing only the right recipient
to see them. For example, the software licensing validation
platform [92], [93] encrypts the licensing related data com-
municated using the end user’s public key. The educational
certificates platform [82] uses the certificate holder’s pub-
lic key for encryption. In an intelligent transportation sys-
tem [165], vehicles crossing security domains encrypt the
messages using the public key of the destination domain’s
security manager. In an anonymous messaging system for
energy trading [197], a private person-to-person message
is encrypted with the destination party’s public key. Even
though the message is broadcast and received by multiple
parties, only the intended recipient can decrypt it.
Some of the surveyed systems also apply symmetric
key encryption to preserve content privacy, such as records
in a blockchain system that preserves author contributions
on paper editing [88] and records in a supply chain use
case [155].
3) DEDICATED PRIVACY-PRESERVING TRANSACTION
MECHANISMS
Dedicated privacy-preserving transaction mechanisms have
also been developed for blockchains and used by many use
cases.
One promising solution is called zero-knowledge proof,
which essentially allows a ‘‘prover’’ to prove that he has
knowledge of a secret statement to a ‘‘verifier’’, with-
out revealing the secret itself. When used in blockchain,
it ensures that during the interaction, a verifier learns noth-
ing about the transaction other than its validity. Therefore,
the identity and amount of the transaction can be hidden
from the nodes. The Zcash blockchain [246], rooted from
Zerocash [247], implements zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge
Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) and pro-
vides untraceable encryption that masks all transaction and
allows only parties with the correct ‘‘key’’ to reveal the
contents. However, the set of operations Zerocash allows
is limited. Hawk [248] extends Zerocash’s set of permitted
operations to allow private transactions for arbitrary busi-
ness logic. [102] is a blockchain-based lottery system that
uses the Hawk model for privacy protection. In addition,
the blockchain-based e-commerce reputation system in [146]
proposed a NIZKs (non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of
knowledge) algorithm as the basis for preserving e-commerce
reviewer’s anonymity.
Permissioned blockchains can also offer their own inte-
grated privacy mechanisms. For example, Hyperledger Fab-
ric defines a collection of peer nodes as a logical channel,
provides native per-channel based private transactions and
a data collection mechanism to keep data private between
participants of the same channel.
E. UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES
The bottom part of our framework in Figure 1 is the
blockchain infrastructure, highlighted by three of the key
components: distributed consensus, smart contract and crypto
token systems. We first take an overview look at the
blockchain platforms used by the surveyed set of use cases,
then examine these three respective components.
Among the 71 papers in the analyzed set, 43 of them
declared specific blockchain types. Among them, the top
four blockchains used are Ethereum (28), Hyperledger (9),
Bitcoin (5) and MultiChain (5). While we can by no means
claim this as an accurate quantitative assessment of the use
of blockchains in research prototypes, it at least sheds some
lights on the relative popularity of these well-known plat-
forms among the research community.
1) ETHEREUM
Ethereum seems to be the most predominant platform. This
is likely due to its status as the first established blockchain
platform supporting full fledged smart contracts. It’s use
cases span almost all sectors we looked at, including vot-
ing [71], taxation [74], and collaborative urban decision-
making [5], [78] in government sector; research paper author-
ing collaboration [90], digital media rights protection [102]
and lottery system [102] in education, culture, science and
innovation sector; clinical trial process improvement [105],
medical data sharing [110], [114], supply chain of drug [121]
and food [124] in well-being, health and safety sector;
collaborative business process [133], [134], product prove-
nance [137], automated sales systems [139], and sharing
76804 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
economies [147], [148] in the economy sector; sustainable
transportation [172] in the transportation sector; energy effi-
ciency and peer-to-peer energy market [178]–[180], [183],
[184], [187], [195], and electronic vehicle charging [204] in
the energy sector; and building operation management access
control [214] in the built environment sector. It should be
noted that while Ethereum is a permissionless blockchain,
most of the research prototypes are run on the test net or a
separate private Ethereum network due to their early stage
nature.
2) HYPERLEDGER FABRIC
Hyperledger Fabric is a blockchain platform not only fully
supports smart contracts but also provides built-in features
particularly suitable for enterprise applications. It is one of
the top two popular blockchain platforms we found in the lit-
erature set. It supports use cases including school information
hub [243], event ticket system [101] in education, culture,
science and innovation sector; medical data sharing [115],
[116] and insurance process improvement [128]–[130] in
well-being, health and safety sector; supply chain manage-
ment [155] and vehicle-to-grid payment [203] in transporta-
tion sector. One reason the number of Hyperledger Fabric use
cases is less than that of Ethereum in our surveyed literature
is possibly because we have seen a lot of peer-to-peer market
cases in our list, especially in the energy and economy sectors.
Most of those cases used Ethereum since it has native crypto
token payment support and is intended for the public, while
Hyperledger Fabric does not integrate crypto token currency
and is more for enterprise applications.
3) BITCOIN
The Bitcoin blockchain is commonly considered as only for
cryptocurrency and not suitable for general purpose applica-
tions. This is mostly because its very limited scripting capa-
bility cannot support generic business logic. However, being
the oldest and largest public blockchain network, it offers a
secure and robust payment system that surpasses any other
blockchains. So it is still one of the four popular blockchain
platforms employed by researchers even in our study of
non-cryptocurrency use cases. They appeared in publication
from 2015 through 2018. The use cases include those that
require limited business logic but place security as the fore-
most consideration, such as in e-voting [70], timestamping of
research manuscripts [91], preservation of government doc-
umentation [61]. Other cases emphasize payment as the key
proposition, such as electricity trading in micro grids [185],
machine-to-machine micropayment [140], and electric vehi-
cle charging payment [202].
4) MULTICHAIN
Interestingly, MultiChain [39] appears to be as popular as
the Bitcoin platform found in our paper dataset. MultiChain
is a permissioned blockchain. Compared to the other popu-
lar permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric, MultiChain
only provides very limited functionalities in implementing
business logic, but it comes with its own crypto token cur-
rency. MultiChain was used by [73] to implement a value-
added-tax system. The tax authority has control over who
can join the blockchain and the system’s crypto token is used
to track tax amount. MultiChain also has another important
feature called stream - which is suitable for recording time
series key-value pairs. The stream feature, along with its
other characteristics such as crypto token currency, makes
MultiChain a frequent choice for those peer-to-peer markets
that prefer a controlled set of participants. These applica-
tions often use the stream feature to publish offers and bids
for the market, and the internal crypto token as currency
for payment of asset transactions. Majority of the Multi-
Chain use cases we found fall into this category. Among
them the most popular ones are in energy domain, includ-
ing electricity trading between producers and consumers
in the chemical industry [189], or between devices on the
smart grid to regulate supply and demand [182] and between
household electricity prosumers [188]. In addition, Multi-
Chain was chosen in the natural environment sector use
case on trading carbon credits [218] and in a service trading
market [132].
5) OTHER BLOCKCHAINS
A few other types of blockchains are also found in the
research prototypes. Quorum [249] (which is based on an
Ethereum core) is used by electronic health records shar-
ing system [107] and vehicle life-cycle data sharing [151]
because of its integrated support for private transactions.
The ARK [250] blockchain was selected to record higher
education course credits records [81] due to its flexibility in
the number of programming languages its client implementa-
tions support. Reference [88] presents a system that measures
research paper author contributions using the NEM [251]
smart asset platform which is another blockchain that provide
flexible business logic capability.
F. CONSENSUS MECHANISMS
The consensus mechanisms are fundamental to the dis-
tributed database and often connected with the cho-
sen blockchain platform. Among our studied dataset,
the main types of consensus mechanisms used are proof-
of-work, proof-of-stake and byzantine fault tolerance style
ones.
1) PROOF-OF-WORK
Proof-of-work is the most adopted consensus mechanism,
represented in at least half of the cases we studied. This
includes all the 5 Bitcoin and 28 Ethereum blockchain use
cases since proof-of-work is their default baked-in consen-
sus mechanism. An additional 3 use cases also used proof-
of-work even though the name of the specific blockchain
is not mentioned, including for electricity meter reading
security [173], an energy trading market involving industrial
IoT and the grid [186], and peer-to-peer electricity trading
between electric vehicles [206].
VOLUME 6, 2018 76805
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
2) PROOF-OF-STAKE
In comparison, the number of cases using proof-of-stake is
actually very small. A cross-cloud domain medical image
sharing system [109] employs proof-of-stake to give more
weights in the consensus process to providers who host more
medical images. A peer-to-peer energy trading system in
a micro grid [185] chooses proof-of-stake because it con-
sume less energy than proof-of-work. The educational course
credit recording system [81] uses a delegated proof-of-stake
consensus system through the ARK blockchain platform it
adopted.
It should be noted, however, Ethereum is in transition to
proof-of-stake [252]. Many Ethereum-based use cases advo-
cated moving away from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake,
especially those energy trading blockchain use cases focusing
on energy efficiency [179], [183]. Therefore, if we consider
Ethereum to be proof-of-stake, the number of of proof-of-
stake cases will be 31 and easily surpasses the remaining
8 proof-of-work cases.
3) BYZANTINE FAULT TOLERANCE
At least 17 of the use cases can be identified to support byzan-
tine fault tolerance style consensus including the 9 Hyper-
ledger Fabric cases. The 5 MultiChain-based use cases are
also under this category because MultiChain’s consensus are
in spirit similar to practical byzantine fault tolerance. Another
two use cases, one on micro grid peer-to-peer electricity trad-
ing [198] and the other on pharma supply chain tracing [118],
use Tendermint [253] which is also based on byzantine fault
tolerance. Quorum supports byzantine fault tolerance style
consensus as well. Therefore the two Quorum-based projects
for electronic health record sharing [107] and vehicle life-
cycle data sharing [151] also belong to this category. Yet
another work that used a byzantine fault tolerance based
consensus is a customized blockchain for secure peer-to-peer
sharing of documents among government agencies [63].
4) PROOF-OF-IMPORTANCE
The proof-of-importance consensus mechanism grants token
mining privileges according to the user’s importance. This
importance is determined by taking into consideration not
only the number of crypto tokens the user holds, but also the
number of transactions a user made and with whom those
transactions are made. Inclusion of transactions encourages
the user to use the crypto tokens instead of merely holding
them. A research manuscript editing record system [88] is
based on the NEM blockchain platform that uses proof-of-
importance consensus.
G. SMART CONTRACTS
Smart contracts are instrumental in implementing the
blockchain use case business logic. The original Bit-
coin blockchain was not designed for smart contracts
but is still capable of limited scripting functions. Newer
blockchains such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric
provide full-fledged programming capability for all kinds of
possibilities. In order to better understand the use of smart
contract, it is helpful to categorize the use cases based on
the business logic. However, we found that in most use
cases the functionalities are intricately intertwined, making
it extremely hard to come up with a reasonably small list
of mutually exclusive categories. We therefore propose a
taxonomy of a small number of functional models that simul-
taneously consider their interactions. They are short-named:
‘‘Immutable Records, Access Control, Collective Decisions,
and Peer-to-Peer Markets’’, as shown in Figure 2. It should
be noted that Immutable Records is the foundation category
that applies to all other categories, while any of the other
categories could intersect with each other as well.
FIGURE 2. Business Model based Blockchain Use Case Classification.
1) IMMUTABLE RECORDS
Keeping immutable records is a fundamental utility provided
by the blockchain technology. If the use case’s chief value
proposition is on data resiliency, smart contract function-
alities may not be needed at all or could be achieved via
very limited programming capabilities. In the studied set
of use cases, we have seen these examples like preserving
immutable records of public government documents [61],
votes in e-voting [70] and timestamps of research manuscript
submission [91].
2) ACCESS CONTROL
If the system needs to provide more advanced business
logic in addition to tamper-resistant records, smart contracts
become important. Access control is among the most com-
mon functionalities seen in the analyzed use cases. Access
control is applicable to both the writers and readers and it con-
trols who can write, what they can write, as well as who can
read and what they can read. For example, in the education
sector, student’s educational certificates [82] and completed
course credits [81] should be accessed by employers and other
76806 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
parties authorized by the respective students. School infor-
mation about a region [243] can be accessed by related gov-
ernment agencies to facilitate educational resource planning.
In the health domain, access control needs to be enforced
for clinical trial agreements [105] and electronic medical
records [107], [109], [110], [113]–[117]. Access control is
also a common requirement in economy, transportation, and
energy industries, such as for enrollment of manufactur-
ers, claiming product ownership, recording product transfer
from origin to post-supply chain [137], pharma supply chain
compliance monitoring [121], tracing general goods supply
chain record [155], monitoring smart meter readings [173],
[175]. Even in the built environment sector, blockchain-based
mechanism is proposed to enable decentralized access control
among different building operating parties [214].
3) COLLECTIVE DECISIONS
Besides access control, generic business logic combining
with participatory behavior can drive a new level of collective
decision-making process. There are many examples seen in
our studied set of use cases. A voting application [71] is
able to assign voter eligibility, collect vote and manage the
voting outcome. Insurance systems can monitor related asset
and behavior status collectively to decide on the insurance
policies and fulfill fine-grained insurance claims [128], [130].
In an energy domain application, [180] uses smart contract
to optimize operation of the total available energy storage
systems in order to achieve efficient use of shared resources
and minimize external energy dependence. The governance
domain also sees citizen participatory decision making use
cases empowered by smart contracts. The system in [5] allows
citizens to submit urban policy proposals, vote for urban
planning decisions, select candidates to implement specific
projects and reward them for performance. Reference [78]
uses expert rules, open data and volunteer participants data
to derive public health related collective decisions.
4) PEER-TO-PEER MARKETS
The original Bitcoin blockchain’s primary utility is pay-
ment and digital asset exchange. Those functionalities are
very popular in a large number of blockchain use cases.
While basic form of blockchain payment does not require
smart contracts, more sophisticated use cases for market-
making applications may place access control for transac-
tion parties, deploy specific market mechanisms, incorpo-
rate automated interaction with Oracles that will all benefit
from various levels of smart contracts. For example, smart
contracts can be used to implement a software develop-
ment service trading market providing full functionalities
including posting project requirements, submitting solutions,
interacting with external Oracle for quality checking, and
making payments [133]. Smart contracts can also enable a
delivery service ordering system operated by autonomous
unmanned aerial vehicle agents [134]. In peer-to-peer energy
trading markets, smart contracts can be used to implement
double auction market mechanism [184], enable automatic
negotiation, settlement and payments [179], facilitate power
flow estimation, optimization and control [178], [183].
H. CRYPTO TOKEN SYSTEMS
The predominant crypto token system model in the use cases
we studied is the utility model. An example of infrastructure
level crypto token usage is [110], which is an Ethereum
prototype that allows patients, doctors and authorized third
parties to share medical data with permission management.
The Ethereum’s native Ether tokens are required for medi-
cal providers to perform their activities such as posting and
updating records, accepting viewing permissions. Patients
who wish to share their medical information also need to
spend Ether or have the destination party fund them.
Use case specific application level utility tokens are very
common. For example, we have seen crypto tokens used
to represent tax credits in order to track actual amount of
value-added-tax that should be imposed [73], to trace divi-
dend paid in order to prevent frauds in dividend-based tax
refunds [74], to transfer software entitlement [92], [93] and
to document higher education course credits that students
have completed [81]. There are also ways to reuse Bitcoin
as application specific tokens, as in the colored coin method
used by [185] for energy trading. It labels certain Bitcoins as
issuance of energy token or transfer of energy token by setting
their serial numbers to specify a special transaction type.
Payment is another popular token utility at the application
level. Reference [140] is a system that enables Bitcoin-based
micro-payment for a smart cable connected with a smart
socket to pay for electricity. Reference [202] describes a
system for Bitcoin payment between electric vehicles and
the grid, leveraging the lightening network [254] scalability
solution for Bitcoin blockchain. Other than using Bitcoin,
there are also many use cases leveraging application-specific
crypto token for payments, e.g., [134] presents a scenario of
autonomous agents performing collaborative services which
uses the blockchain application’s internal crypto token for
payments. Many energy tradingmarkets also define their own
crypto tokens for payments [184], [187]–[189], [197], [206].
Token incentives appear like payments, but they are also
used to promote desired behaviors. Application level incen-
tives are found in the studied use cases where they often play
a crucial role in sustaining the business logic. For example,
a product ownership management system for the post supply
chain as in [137] can only be useful if sufficiently large num-
ber of users all register their products after every transaction.
The system thus provides a crypto token incentive mech-
anism to encourage product owners’ registration behavior.
Similarly, the system in [172] use crypto token incentives to
encourage urban citizens to engage in greener transportation
methods such as cycling. In energy supply demand systems
such as [183] and [179], crypto tokens are used to reward
those parties who adhere to desired energy consumption pro-
files and help bring the system towards energy balance.
It is important to note that while some popular permis-
sioned blockchain platforms like Hyperledger Fabric are not
VOLUME 6, 2018 76807
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
integrated with baked in crypto token payment systems, there
could be use cases built on them that still require payment
utilities. An example is the vehicle-to-grid payment system
in [203]. It solves the payment problem by designing a spe-
cific type of transaction structure and keeping all historical
transactions in the blockchain database for verification, thus
effectively creating a payment utility in the system.
VII. DISCUSSIONS
The results of our blockchain use case study, both the
application-oriented review part, and the component-based
analysis part, provide the basis for answering further ques-
tions in many dimensions, including the last three questions
we posed in Section III-B.
A. BLOCKCHAIN USE CASES AND URBAN
SUSTAINABILITY GOALS
Our application-oriented review can provide us some initial
evaluation on city sustainability targets. We look at four
dimensions of sustainability as shown in Figure 3.
FIGURE 3. Four Dimensions of Sustainability.
Social, economic, and environmental constitute the triple
bottom line on sustainability development introduced by the
United Nations [255]. We can clearly see that all these three
areas of sustainability are represented in various degrees in
the use cases we surveyed.
The social domain focuses on people. In this respect,
the well-being, health and safety area (Section V-C) is a
heavily examined sector focusing especially on electronic
health records, drug and food safety related use cases. Edu-
cation and culture (Section V-B) is well represented mainly
in improving the learning system and educational resource
planning, as well as solving transparency problems in certain
cultural entertainment programs. In contrast, the number of
systems addressing the built environment (Section V-G) is
relative few, and there is a lack of social diversity centered
cases.
In the economic domain, we see a large of number of
cases focusing on transforming commerce, sharing economy,
collaborative business and other related aspects to improve
prosperity (Section V-D). There are also efforts centered
on enhancing the collaborative scientific research process
to stimulate more innovations (Section V-B). Applications
in transportation (Section V-E) such as the advancement of
global goods supply chain and intelligent transportation sys-
tems, are bringing significant impact to both businesses and
consumers in many other sectors of the society, potentially
contributing to economic boost as well.
The environmental domain applications have concentrated
on the green energy sector (Section V-F), manifested by
numerous use cases concerning electricity prosumers, micro
grid and electric vehicles, as well as peer-to-peer energy
trading and supply demand balances. Air quality, carbon
emission, sand mining have also been covered (Section V-I).
However, there is in general fewer discussions onmany topics
in this domain such as on materials, water and land, waste
management and climate resilience.
Last but not least, the governmental domain is spe-
cial and has been considered a determine factor for the
social, economic and environmental improvements [256].
It is also regarded as one of four pillars of sustainability
[257], [258]. Our discussion on the governance and citizen
engagement sector (Section V-A) illustrates that blockchain
use in this domain is very much inline with and even pro-
vides crucial compliments to existing initiatives in meet-
ing challenges for a truly citizen-empowered collaborative
governance infrastructure.
It is worth pointing out that earlier work [7] shows exist-
ing smart city frameworks tend to focus significantly on
social sustainability, reasonably on economic sustainabil-
ity, but greatly under-represent environmental sustainability.
In contrast, existing urban sustainability frameworks gener-
ally cover the environmental and social dimensions evenly,
but almost ignores the aspect of economic sustainability.
Therefore, when we are considering blockchain initiatives
for cities, it will be helpful to adopt a balanced perspective
that incorporates all the social, economic, environmental as
well as the governance aspects (in cases where the technolo-
gies are applicable), and we hope our preliminary assess-
ments can help the establishment of a starting point on such
efforts.
B. BLOCKCHAIN USE CASE APPLICABILITY
1) ASSESSMENTS WITH BLOCKCHAIN APPLICABILITY
DECISION TREES
There exist well-known decision trees providing a list of
questions about the assets, the writers and the readers to help
evaluate the applicability of blockchain technologies for spe-
cific use cases [19], [20], [259]–[261]. They provide different
levels of details but are inline at the core in determining
whether and when a permissionless, permissioned or private
blockchain should be chosen respectively.
The component-based analysis of our study provides an
avenue to assess how the rules of these decision trees have
been applied by the community. Interestingly, it is not hard to
find reported use cases which may not be fully ‘‘qualified’’
for blockchain adoption or at least be inconsistent with the
recommendations of some existing decision tree rules.
76808 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
Example 1: According to the first criteria of [261], if the
answer to ‘‘Are you trying to remove intermediaries or bro-
kers’’ is no, then blockchain should not be used. In a use case
for blockchain-based government decision preservation [61],
government agencies create the documents and can directly
share it with the public. So there is no third party intermediary
involved and it seems not qualified for blockchain use. But
in reality, this use case leverages the blockchain’s immutable
record capability as the key value proposition, not necessarily
for removing intermediaries. A McKinsey report [262] also
states that ‘‘Blockchain does not need to be a disintermediator
to generate value’’.
Example 2: Based on [259], when other criteria of
blockchain applicability pass and if the writers are all known
but not trusted, a permissioned blockchain is recommended.
In the same government document preservation use case [61],
the writers are known as designated government agencies.
If they are considered all trusted, then a blockchain should
not be used. If they are not considered all trusted, then the
rule would recommend a permissioned blockchain, but [61]
uses the permissionless Bitcoin blockchain. This is possible
presumably because appropriate off-chain mechanism can be
used to recognize records written by the authorized parties.
In this particular case, it could be based on government
agencies’ publicly released blockchain identity.
Example 3: In qualified blockchain use cases where the
writers are not trusted and functionality control is needed,
the recommendation would be to use a permissioned or pri-
vate blockchain [261]. Then a product ownership tracking
system [137] where many different writers require differ-
ent levels of writing privileges would be more appropri-
ate to use a permissioned blockchain. However, [137] uses
the permissionless Ethereum blockchain and enforces the
required control functionalities through its smart contracts
capabilities. A similar point could be made on the reading
side of the blockchain database. Specifically, it is natural for
blockchain use cases with public readability requirements to
adopt a permissionless blockchain. But for those use cases
that require private readabilities, they do not necessarily entail
a permissioned or private blockchain because they too may
be implemented on a permissionless blockchain with appro-
priate smart contract mechanisms or may simply hide the
information from public reading through encryption.
By highlighting the above inconsistencies between the
reported use cases and the well-known decision rules, our
goal is not to make judgements over right or wrong because
both sides hold their merits. Instead we want to stress the
significance for more systematic analysis, which we also
attempted through our component-based framework review,
to help reduce ambiguities in the terminologies and advance
the overall knowledge in this infancy stage technology.
2) THE PHYSICAL-CYBER-CHAIN INTERFACE PROBLEM
While the three examples outlined in the previous
Section VII-B.1 are relatively straightforward illustration of
possible inconsistency between the rules and the actual cases.
There are many more subtleties when it comes to the topic of
physical assets mapping.
According to the second decision rule in [261], if the
answer to ‘‘Are you working with digital assets (versus phys-
ical assets)?’’ is no, blockchain should not be used. However,
supply chain management systems deal with physical assets
and yet they are among the most frequently reported use cases
we found in the list of literature (e.g., [118]–[126], [136],
[157]). In all these cases the physical assets are digitalized
to be brought on-chain. But this physical and digital inter-
face process has security risks. Reference [259] explicitly
questioned the suitability of blockchain use in supply chain
management unless the interface between the digital and
physical world can be secured. In fact, this problem is not just
for physical assets; it applies to all off-chain assets. As the
assets part of our component-based analysis (Section VI-A)
has shown, all the use cases on our list involve off-chain
assets, which makes all of them vulnerable to this problem.
A closer look at the off-chain asset interface problem can
reveal two sub-interfaces, both have security implications.
One handles digitalization of physical assets (when appli-
cable) which we call the physical-cyber interface; the other
deals with actually placing the digital asset on-chain, which
we call the cyber-chain interface. A security breach at the
physical-cyber interface could be a tampered smart meter
reporting a false electricity value, and a security violation
at the cyber-chain interface could be a human knowingly
or unintentionally uploading a wrong version of the digital
document onto the chain. In both cases, the blockchain on
its own is not able to detect the errors because those security
problems happen off-chain. In other words, the blockchain
onlymaintains an immutable record of whatever is committed
on the chain, but it does not guarantee the correct association
of on-chain and off-chain assets, or what happened to the
assets before they were brought on-chain.
From an asset point of view, the only perfect asset for
blockchains are indigenous on-chain assets that do not have to
worry about the physical-cyber-chain interface. Those assets
are commonly seen in the cryptocurrency space with the
original Bitcoin being a great example. The original Bitcoins
are minted on the chain, without tying to external assets,
and have their entire history recorded on the blockchain.
However, if the Bitcoins are used as a payment for some
off-chain asset, they could still be associated with off-chain
assets.
In certain circumstances, stakeholders can to some extent
contribute to detecting off-chain asset mapping anomaly. For
example, in a voting system [71], since the voters know what
their respective votes are, they can check and ensure that the
records of their own votes on the blockchain are consistent
with what they intend to submit. Similarly, in an event ticket
system [101], the ticket holders may be able to compare
the ticket information they have and the actual ticket infor-
mation record on the blockchain, therefore detecting mis-
match between the two. In majority of other cases, however,
stakeholder assistance can be very difficult, if not impossible.
VOLUME 6, 2018 76809
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
For instance, if we are working with an electronic health
records access control system [107] and somehow the health
records provider submits wrong measurement value, or if we
are dealing with an electricity system [173] and the meter
device submits false data because of tampering, it is hard for
the corresponding receiving party to notice the difference.
In summary, off-chain asset mapping and the physical-
cyber-chain interface problem is universal in non cryptocur-
rency blockchain use cases. To deal with it, we should first
try to avoid the interface whenever possible, e.g., the native
digital form of the asset should always be preferred over
a physical form (when applicable) in order to avoid the
physical-cyber interface. For the cyber-chain interface that
cannot be circumvented, we should carefully design the sys-
tem to be resilient to possible risks. Stakeholder-assisted
solution may apply to some cases, but most of the other
cases require more sophisticated methodologies. It is worth
noting that this off-chain asset mapping interface security
issue is commonly treated as out of scope in the blockchain
literature. We believe this is an important area that needs
more substantive investigation for the justification of many
blockchain applications.
C. CROSS-SECTOR BLOCKCHAIN USE
CASE CLASSIFICATION
An explicit goal of our work is to enable a review of the
blockchain use cases with a horizontal perspective, i.e., com-
pare use cases across different industries and potentially ben-
efit from how they are used in distinct contexts to inspiremore
innovative and versatile solutions.
One way to facilitate cross-sector use case analysis is to
classify them into certain common categories, regardless of
their sectors. A universally accepted blockchain use case tax-
onomy does not exist, but related efforts are available. McK-
insey stresses six categories of blockchain applications [262]:
‘‘Static Registry, Identity, Smart Contracts, Dynamic registry,
Payments infrastructure and Other’’. This is helpful in the
broad sense, though applying it to each specific use case is
not always straightforward. For example, in its classification,
land title, food safety and origin are considered static registry;
while drug supply chain is considered dynamic registry. How-
ever, land title can be transferred and food can go through
supply chain as well, so it is hard to draw the line between
static and dynamic registry. We also found that smart contract
is used or can be added in virtually all blockchain applications
(only limited by the capability of the underlying blockchain
infrastructure), so it is more natural to be considered a com-
ponent of the system rather than a separate category by
itself. Payment infrastructure is similarly a component that
can be used by different types of blockchain applications.
Even though the classification method does offer an ‘‘Other’’
category, it may defeat the purpose of classification if we
place vast majority of use cases into ‘‘Others’’. In a related
effort, Gartner highlights four types of blockchain applica-
tions [263]: ‘‘Record Keeper, Efficiency Play, Digital Asset
Market and Blockchain Disruptor’’ (Digital Asset Market
FIGURE 4. Role-based Blockchain Classification.
is also considered a special case of Blockchain Disruptor).
This classification combines the role blockchain plays and
the business model it enables.
Inspired by these existing efforts, we propose two separate
classification methods for blockchain use cases, one role-
based and the other business model based.
For the role-based classification, we emphasize three broad
types of roles that blockchain plays, as shown in Figure 4.
First, the improver role is for those processes that are already
conducted peer-to-peer without an intermediary. But use of
blockchain makes the process more trustworthy and efficient.
This is where we believe blockchain can create value without
being a dis-intermediator and well answers the dilemma dis-
cussed in example 1 of Section VII-B.1. Second, the trans-
former role boosts process efficiency of existing intermedi-
ated processes by obsoleting the existing intermediary. Third,
unlike the improver and transformer roles which are seen
in existing business processes, the enabler role is found in
newly emerged peer-to-peer business processes made possi-
ble by blockchains. It should be noted that merely stating a
blockchain usage area does not allow one to deduce the partic-
ular role that blockchain plays in that use case. Different ways
of blockchain usage may be applied to the same context and
result in improvement, transformation or enablement. As an
example, we can consider a blockchain use case that manage
car life-cycle information similar to [151]. If we just use
blockchain to keep an immutable record of some car attributes
like ownership or maintenance, that is an improver case; if
we use the blockchain to conduct used car buying and selling
transactions directly between two peer parties, that becomes
a transformer case because it removes the transaction inter-
mediary in the traditional process; if we further extend the
blockchain use to enable innovative insurance or other ser-
vices, that could make it an enabler case.
Since business logic in blockchain applications are deter-
mined by smart contracts, we have introduced our business
model based classification earlier when we analyzed smart
contracts usage of the use cases in Figure 2 of Section VI-G.
The four intersected categories, ‘‘Immutable Records, Access
Control, Collective Decisions, and Peer-to-Peer Markets’’
are meant to stimulate insights across sectors. In particular,
76810 VOLUME 6, 2018
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
when we design a specific solution within a given context,
our references do not have to be only prior use cases in
the same sector, but could be those with the same business
model category from very different sectors. Let us take the
Access Control category (Section VI-G.2) as an example.
Use cases in this category span entirely different sectors in
education, economy, healthcare, transportation, energy, built
environment and so on. While common access control mech-
anisms define a list of absolute permissions for entities, a built
environment use case [214] adopts an interesting and different
approach. It uses delegated permissions system which relates
the permissions of entities among each other, through a graph
of ‘‘delegation of trust’’. The result is a system in which all
entities with a permission on a resource are equally capable
of delegating their permissions to other entities. It can be
imagined that this type of mechanisms can be applied to
other scenarios that require dynamic and equal delegation
of access, and those scenarios can be in sectors totally dif-
ferent from the built environment. It is this type of cross-
sector knowledge sharing that we hope our work could help
cultivate.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Blockchain is potentially a disruptive force in the next wave
of urban development initiatives, along with decades of sus-
tainable and smart cities efforts. Many cities around the
world have already started their race for the blockchain future
through regulatory actions and comprehensive pilot projects
in both public and private domains. However, there is great
concern about the infancy stage of the blockchain technology
and the paucity of understanding on how it can be applicable
to future cities. This work is an effort to narrow this gap by
leveraging the collective knowledge from use cases reported
by the scientific research community.
A. CONTRIBUTIONS
Our main contributions are summarized below:
1) Following a systematic literature review methodology,
we first examined 159 blockchain literature from aca-
demic journals and conference proceedings that cover
concrete use cases and systems. They were structured
and discussed within 9 industrial sectors that are well
recognized as essential to sustainable and smart cities.
We found that some of the sectors, like natural environ-
ment, water and waste management, built environment
in general receive less attention than other sectors such
as energy, transportation, economy, healthcare, educa-
tion, and governance. Regardless of the sector, there is a
common list of challenges that blockchain applications
face, such as infrastructure performance and scalability,
standardization and interoperability, asset data security
and privacy, smart contract security, as well as legal and
regulatory issues.
2) We proposed a component-based analysis framework
to facilitate a common understanding for blockchain
use cases. A subset of 71 papers were studied regard-
ing their associated assets, writers, readers, and the
underlying blockchain infrastructure with the dis-
tributed consensus algorithms, smart contracts and
crypto tokens systems. Among the surveyed literature,
we found Ethereum andHyperledger Fabric are not sur-
prisingly the top two most frequently used blockchain
platforms, with Ethereum having an edge especially
on many peer-to-peer market-based applications. It is
interesting to see both Bitcoin and MultiChain are
also among the top four platforms used. On the dis-
tributed consensus aspect, proof-of-work and byzantine
fault tolerance are the two most used mechanisms.
But proof-of-stake usage could easily surpass proof-
of-work if Ethereum finished its transition to proof-
of-stake. In addition, the utility crypto token model
is widely used in many applications for representing
application-specific assets, making payments and giv-
ing incentives.
3) The implication of blockchain use cases towards
the urban sustainability goals was discussed. Our
application-oriented use case review demonstrates that
all four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic,
environmental and governmental are represented in
the surveyed literature. In the governmental domain,
blockchain-empowered citizen participatory collabora-
tive urban governance model is even considered the
exact answer to overcome key problems of existing
solutions. Meanwhile, more efforts on certain areas of
the environmental domain could contribute to a more
balanced blockchain treatment on sustainability.
4) We investigated the relationship between well-known
blockchain applicability decision trees and actual sys-
tem prototypes reported by the research community.
Specifically, we explained the inconsistencies found
between the two and highlighted why component-
based system analysis like ours can be beneficial.
In addition, we discussed the physical-cyber-chain
problem that is suffered by all the use cases surveyed
and advocated its importance.
5) To facilitate cross-sector analysis, we offered two
methods for classifying blockchain use cases. The
role-based approach groups use cases into blockchain
as ‘‘Improver, Transformer and Enabler’’. The busi-
ness model based approach delineates three inter-
sected categories: ‘‘Access Control, Collective Deci-
sions, Peer-to-peer Markets’’, and the fourth category
called ‘‘Immutable Records’’ that is the foundation to
all the other three.We elaborated how these taxonomies
compare with existing ones from the industry, and illus-
trated how they can help bring cross-sector insights for
blockchain use case analysis.
B. LIMITATIONS
The contributions of this paper need to be considered in light
of its limitations. Due to the enormous amount of literature
VOLUME 6, 2018 76811
C. Shen, F. Pena-Mora: Blockchain for Cities—A Systematic Literature Review
on blockchain, we have to confine our scope of review only
to papers focusing on concrete use cases, with sufficient
system level coverage and in the explicitly specified sectors.
We also acknowledge that the manual screening process of
filtering thousands of papers down to under 200 and the sector
placement of each use case inevitably introduces subjectiv-
ity. As a result, even high quality papers could have been
excluded. Yet to the extent possible, we tried our best to select
the sufficiently comprehensive and relevant set of papers to
support our analysis.
C. FUTURE WORK
There are a number of directions this work can be taken
further. First, for the application-oriented use case review,
it will be interesting to assemble more blockchain use cases
that are actually in operation in the industry (some of them
have been reported in the literature, but others might not).
This would allow a comparison between the use cases in
operation and those at early research prototype stage, and
help identify how the research and industry could bene-
fit from each other through a tighter interaction. Second,
the current connection of our application level review with
the sustainable and smart cities frameworks is at the macro
sector level. Future work can look into the more micro level
associations between blockchain use cases and specific urban
sustainability and smart city framework indicators. These
analysis can then pave way to a possible future standardized
assessment framework of ‘‘blockchain for cities’’ which can
become guiding principles for urban policy makers. Third,
another way to extend this work is to dive deeper verti-
cally into the elaborated use cases: for example, leveraging
both the component-based framework and the classification
mechanisms to come up with lists of system design refer-
ences at the component or more finer-grained level for each
type of use cases in any sector, maximizing the knowledge
sharing for blockchain industrial professionals among all
disciplines.

Banking with Blockchain-ed Big Data
August 8, 2018
Abstract
Blockchain is disrupting the banking industry and contributing to the increased big data
in banking. However, there exists a gap in research and development into blockchain-ed big
data in banking from an academic perspective, and this gap is expected to have a significant
negative impact on the adoption and development of blockchain technology for banking. In
hope of motivating more active engagement by academics, researchers and bankers alike, we
present the most comprehensive review of the impact of blockchain in banking to date by
summarising the opportunities and challenges from a bankers perspective. In addition, we
also discuss the impact that big data from blockchain will have on banking data analytics in
future and show the increasing importance of filtering and signal extraction for the banking
industry. Whilst there is evidence of selected banks adopting blockchain technology in iso-
lation or small groups, we find the need for extensive research and development into several
aspects of banking with blockchain to overcome the challenges which are currently hindering
its adoption in banking across the globe.
Keywords: Blockchain; Big Data; Banking; Opportunities; Challenges; Signal Extraction.
1 Introduction
Since its emergence, big data has successfully disrupted several industries from banking (Hassani
et al., 2018) to policing (Hassani et al., 2016) whilst having a significant impact on the future of
data analytics, see for example, Hassani and Silva (2015). However, technology is back to the
forefront in the financial services industry with blockchain taking charge of disruption and big
data banking innovations (Iskandar, 2017) with the World Economic Forum (2015) estimating
that 10% of GDP will be stored on blockchains or blockchain-related technology by 2025. In
fact, blockchain is expected to totally revamp the financial system along the lines of what the
internet did to media (Ito et al., 2017) and today, almost every global bank is experimenting with
blockchain technology, hoping for cost savings and operational efficiencies (Kocianski, 2018).
The existing relationship between the banking industry and blockchain is complex because
beyond the numerous opportunities for streamlining traditional banking processes, blockchain
is viewed as a threat to established models (Lang, 2017a). For example, Ikeda and Hamid
(2018) proposed the peer to peer monetized economy system for barter on a global scale without
the requirements of third party nor money. However, as blockchain can provide bankers with
unalterable data with consensus verification and real-time access (Smith, 2018a), it is undoubt-
edly the future of banking. For Lang (2017b), the certainty offered by blockchains is a good
enough reason for banks to switch over from its traditional approaches to business transactions,
and given that payments represent a huge segment of banking, the industry is primed for dis-
ruption (Lund, 2017). For Mason (2017), the less expensive nature and speed of transactions
1
via blockchain will be the primary reasons for its revolution in the banking industry, whilst the
Citigroup (2018) identifies cost savings as the main value of blockchains in the immediate future.
The origins of blockchain technology dates back to the invention of Bitcoin as a response to
the financial crisis in 2008 (Nakamoto, 2008). As as the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions
(the public ledger is freely accessible via https://www.blockchain.com/explorer), this main
technological innovation called blockchain is expected to prove to be more significant than bitcoin
itself (Swan, 2015). As a simple example, Figure 1 below presents a graphical view of how
blockchain technology can facilitate a transaction between two parties. As Fedak (2018) asserts,
blockchain not only makes big data even bigger, but also contributes by making big data more
secure and valuable, as blockchain-ed big data is structured and ready for big data analytics. For
banks in particular, blockchain has the potential to save costs through reduced transaction and
processing costs, but competition is also likely to increase as new fintech startups emerge given
the opportunity to start a bank with lower costs (Iskandar, 2017). Furthermore, technological
innovation (fintech) has a positive relationship with bank’s profitability according to a research
by Rega (2017) which considered 38 European Banks. Thus, embracing blockchains is the way
forward for the banking industry in terms of increasing the competitiveness with fintechs, and
enabling the ability to use the technology to create new business models (Kocianski, 2018).
Figure 1: Anatomy of a Typical Blockchain Transaction by Sachs Insights (Tandulwadikar,
2016).
To this end, there is evidence of increasing interest from the global banking industry to-
wards the adoption of blockchain (Cook, 2018a). For example, the French investment bank
BNP Paribas was testing blockchain technology on its currency funds and for order processing
(Allison, 2015) whilst UBS, Bank of Montreal (BMO), CaixaBank, Commerzbank, Erste Group
and IBM are currently working on ‘Batavia’ - a global trade finance platform based on blockchain
for streamlining the transfer of money and goods through greater efficiency and transparency
(Keller, 2018). Meanwhile, HSBC recently executed a live trade finance transaction for interna-
tional food and agriculture conglomerate Cargill using R3s Corda scalable blockchain platform
(HSBC, 2018). With the greater adoption of blockchain included in China’s 2016 5-year plan,
over 12 public banks have adopted blockchains to facilitate various transactions (Cook, 2018a).
In fact, the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) completed loan granting of 300,000 USD using
blockchain technology (Rud, 2018). Bank Hapoalim in Israel is exploring integrating blockchain
technology into their user-information database whilst the Bank of America has filed for patents
on 50 blockchain-patents (Cook, 2018a; Leighton, 2018). The National Bank of Dubai is adopt-
2
ing blockchain technology within its check-issuance system (Smith, 2018b), and over 60 Japanese
banks representing 80% of the Japanese banking industry have partnered with Ripple (which
is competing to replace SWIFT) to allow for relatively fast international monetary-transactions
(Cook, 2018a). In UK, the Santander Bank implemented Ripples xCurrent protocol to allow for
international payments of between £10 - £10,000 whilst the Bank of England has a proposal for
facilitating payments and money transfers by integrating Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)
systems with blockchain technology (Cook, 2018). According to Leighton (2018), Goldman Sachs
too is using its internal funds to trade Bitcoin futures on behalf of its clients. Interestingly, even
in countries like Zimbabwe where the ownership of cryptocurrencies is illegal, the Reserve Bank
of Zimbabwe is said to be considering the implementation of blockchain (Cook, 2018a).
The above examples give the reader an indication with regard to the ongoing disruption by
blockchain technology in banking. However, as Carson et al. (2018) states, the banking industry
is not yet ready to fully exploit what blockchain technology has to offer, and this is partly
because banks fail to appreciate blockchain as an enabling technology (Citigroup, 2018). In
hope of encouraging more research and development into blockchain technology in banking from
both academic researchers and bankers alike, this paper aims to provide the most comprehensive
review of the opportunities and challenges for the adoption of blockchain in banking. In brief, the
opportunities presented via blockchain include, for example, cost savings, security, transparency,
traceability, accuracy and data integrity (Lowry, 2017). The consideration of challenges are
equally important as there are several hurdles to overcome before blockchain can truly transform
banking (Marr, 2017). It is noteworthy that Peters and Panayi (2016) presented a systematic
discussion on the benefits of blockchain technology in a banking setting, and that Cocco et al.
(2017) looked into the opportunities and challenges of implementing blockchain across banking
with a focus on cost savings and energy efficiency. In contrast, our paper evaluates the overall
opportunities (briefly noted above) and the related challenges from the banking industry’s view
point by relying on both industry and academic research into the subject. Also, to the best of
our knowledge, this paper is the first and most comprehensive review of blockchain in banking to
date, covering both industry and academic research into the subject area with over 100 articles
and publications being reviewed and summarised for the reader.
As this review is being undertaken, the banking industry is making significant strides into
the blockchain. Bank-based blockchain projects are expected to transform the financial services
industry and IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric project, the Utility Settlement Coin, and R3s
blockchain consortium are few such examples (Harsono, 2018). The forex settlement giant CLS
has partnered with IBM in creating a blockchain app store for banks which is now in its final
testing stages and is expected to standardize global forex markets and reduce costs (Partz,
2018a; Allison, 2018). However, there is also evidence of resistance towards the adoption of
blockchain in banking. For example, whilst Visa is exploring the possibilities with distributed
ledger technologies, its Chief Executive Officer stated that they do not currently see the potential
for blockchain in its core business (Kulkarni, 2018). Other banks are opting to embrace the cloud
at the expense of blockchain technology for the time being (Noto, 2018). Given the alternating
views, it is interesting to consider Deloitte’s (2017) four scenarios (Figure 2) on how blockchain
could develop in future along what Deloitte considers to be two key variables: “trust in the
established system” and “overcoming technical hurdles”.

Figure 2: The future of blockchain according to Deloitte (2017).
In the next section we present the reader with details on the blockhain-ed opportunities
in banking and follow this up by identifying the existing challenges. Thereafter, we consider
a discussion around blockchain-ed big data and show the importance of filtering and signal
extraction for banking big data beyond the blockchain age. Finally, we present some concise
conclusions for the future of blockchain in banking.
2 Blockchain-ed Opportunities in Banking
2.1 A Better Way to Know Your Customer (KYC)
Verifying the authenticity of consumer identities is a frequent and important task for banks ow-
ing to anti money laundering regulations (Sarnitz and Maier, 2017). Given the ever increasing
problems of terrorism, KYC is a crucial aspect related to the prevention of criminal use of bank-
ing funds and services in the form of money laundering and terrorism (Marr, 2017). However,
KYC also represents a significant cost for banks with Thomson Reuters (2016) estimating that
financial institutions spend between 60 million - 500 million USD per annum to keep up with
KYC. Therefore, the current KYC processes are not only expensive, but also inefficient and
feeds towards poor customer experience for banks (Walker, 2018). In addition, 4th EU Money
Laundering Directive requires consumer data to be monitored and constantly updated (Wolos,
2017) whilst the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires strict internal controls
pertaining to consumer security (Walker, 2018).
As such, blockchain technology, if implemented correctly for KYC can be extremely useful.
This is because, the use of blockchain technology can do away with the need for filling out endless
KYC questionnaires when opening a bank account (Sarnitz and Maier, 2017). An example of a
blockchain based KYC process in banking is demonstrated via Figure 3.
4
Figure 3: An example of a blockchain based KYC process (Persistent Systems, 2018).
As Lang (2017a) states, blockchain can enable banks to share customer information across
their company securely and thereby simplify the administrative process by reducing unnecessary
duplication of information and requests. Blockchain helps cut down on duplication as it can allow
the independent verification of one client by one bank to be accessed by other banks (Marr,
2017). Standardized sharing of customer account opening information using blockchain creates
a single non-editable KYC record further demonstrating compliance with regulations (Walker,
2018). To this end, recently, several banks completed a KYC app test on the R3 blockchain
platform (Partz, 2018b) whilst a major Polish bank, PKO BP started using a blockchain-based
document management system earlier this year (Biggs, 2018). Yet another emerging trend is the
increasing importance of inclusivity across sectors. Blockchain technology could also be a means
of enhancing inclusivity in banking as consumers who do not have a credit score can create
a verifiable, decentralised, self-sovereign digital identity and thereby gain access to banking
services (Garcia, 2018a). As Luu (2017) asserts, efforts to KYC are more important today than
ever before as decentralization of cryptocurrencies opens it up to the risk of money laundering
and terrorism financing.
2.2 Improved Transaction Speeds
You thought digital payments were fast? The use of blockchain technology can enable banks
to speed up the time to settlement through the certainty it provides by enabling individuals
and corporations to transact directly and view the same ledger of transactions updated through
consensus and made immutable through cryptography (Lang, 2017a). In fact, Tapscott and
Tapscott (2016) notes that settlement times can be cut down to minutes or seconds via blockchain
technology whilst Ho (2016) alerts us of the possibility of processing bank transaction 24/7.
Decentralising via blockchain speeds transactions further as it can enable buyers and sellers
to deal forex in real time in addition to doing away with the need for intermediaries for processing
transactions (Hillsberg, 2018). Moreover, traditional banking practices and local banking stan-
dards dictate various necessities for financing which results in significant delays in completing a
single transaction (Lowry, 2017). Blockchain allows trade partners to interact with greater trust
by using a shared version of the truth about transactions in real-time and thereby increasing
efficiency with regard to access to funding and saving time throughout the trade process (Smith
2018a; Lang 2017a).
Companies like Ripple (https://ripple.com/) are completing cross-border payments today
5
in seconds (Sarwar, 2018) but SWIFT is competing rapidly without blockchain technology by
showing that nearly 50% of gpi payments are credited to end beneficiaries within 30 minutes,
and almost 100% of payments within 24 hours (Wass, 2018). As the average transaction rates
have reached 1000 to 2000 transactions per second (TPS) for blockchain technologies, Miyamae
et al.(2018) proposed a more efficient application programming interface between containers and
achieved a transaction rate improvement by 86%. Asian banks are also exploiting blockchain
with banks in India turning to blockchain to speed up internal trade deals (Satija and Antony,
2018). Furthermore, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial from Tokyo is to launch a 10 million transactions
per second blockchain payment platform in 2020 (Asia Times, 2018) whilst more recently, Taka-
hashi (2018) noted that Liqueneqs blockchain bank payments scales to millions of transactions
per second for both commercial and consumer purposes.
However, not all authors agree that blockchain will be the answer to improved transaction
speeds. For example, Marr (2018) highlights that the complex, encryption based and distributed
nature of blockchain transactions can take a considerable amount of time to process when com-
pared to traditional payment systems, and therefore requires more advances in engineering and
processing speeds which leads to several challenges which are considered later on.
2.3 Enhanced Security
Security is of paramount importance to the banking industry. As Tapscott and Tapscott (2017)
stated, 45% of financial intermediaries are experiencing economic crimes in comparison to the
20% and 27% for the professional services and technology sectors. Therefore, applying blockchain
for extra sense of security is a critical component of the future digital banking model (Maiya,
2018). Blockchain can offer enhanced security for banking data as historical information cannot
be altered and the new information which is added in real-time is essentially shared by multiple
entities and thus making it difficult to manipulate the data (Garcia, 2018b; Harsono 2018). As
Patel (2018) points out, any alterations to data within a block can be tracked and monitored
to prevent fraud and misuse and more importantly blockchain technology allows for real-time
communication and updating on potential scams (Patel, 2018).
Blockchain is also affecting the antecedents of trust including confidence, integrity, reliabil-
ity, responsibility and predictability (Beck, 2018). The transparency in blockchain’s distributed
ledger is also useful as it would enable regulators to easily scrutinize financial actions (Tap-
scott and Tapscott, 2016). As a trust network, consumer data stored via blockchain can only
be accessed by trusted sources in addition to the data security attainable via the encryption
capabilities of blockchain (Patel, 2018). Blockchain can also achieve simultaneous security and
privacy by enabling confidentiality through “public key infrastructure” and by maintaining the
size of a ledger (Schou-Zibell and Phair, 2018).
Since the 2008 financial crisis, there has been a surge in the importance of risk management
and the development of risk management capability (Silva et al., 2013). Furthermore, loan asset
integrity is identified as a major problem leading to the 2008 financial crisis (Moore, 2018).
To this end, the adoption of blockchain in banking can enable low risk credit transactions.
For example,the Global Debt Registry (https://www.globaldebtregistry.com/) is evaluating
the use of blockchains to ensure the integrity of loan assets and protect pledged assets on the
network from errors or misrepresentation in the future (Moore, 2018). Assets can be placed
on the decentralized ledger which will generate an immutable record of each asset, enabling all
participants in the lending ecosystem to trust and be certain they are looking at the same loan
data (Moore, 2018; Tapscott and Tapscott, 2016).
Fraud reduction is another form of enhanced security offered by blockchain technology.
6
Risk.net (2017) recognised fraud as one of the top operational risks in 2017 whilst PwC (2014)
notes that 45% of financial intermediaries suffer from economic crimes each year. The centralised
nature of banking systems make it more vulnerable to cyber attacks as it has one point of failure,
unlike with blockchains which are less susceptible to fraud as each block contains a timestamp
and holds batches of individual transactions with a link to a previous block (Marr, 2017). In
India, there is an interest in evaluating whether blockchain technology can be a means of stop-
ping bank frauds (D’souza, 2018). As Mauri (2017a) asserts, the distributed, immutable and
permissioned nature of blockchain will help prevent fraud. In fact, Chiles Santiago Exchange
plans to use blockchain to technology to reduce errors and possible fraud in its short selling
system for securities lending (Mauri, 2017b). In addition, the UAE’s Emirates Islamic was the
first Islamic bank to adopt blockchain technology to issue new cheque books as a means of fraud
prevention (Lyon, 2017) whilst the Bank of Thailand too is considering blockchains as a means
of fraud reduction (Yakubowski, 2018). The recent Facebook data scandal has heightened the
case for data privacy and blockchain can support this process as data can only be shared or sold
with the consent of the individual (Garcia, 2018a). Technology giants such as Microsoft (2008)
are also researching into developing ‘Corda’ an enterprise-grade ledger that enables banks to
limit who sees what information and selectively share data with only relevant parties as a means
of reducing the risk of fraud. They also envision their efforts can lead to reducing many other
forms of banking risks in future.
Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that whilst many authors harp on the immutable nature
of blockchains, Schou-Zibell and Phair (2018) note that blockchains are technically prone to
modification. As such, the challenges pertaining to the security aspect of blockchain are dis-
cussed further in what follows. Nevertheless, security expert Frank Abagnale is of the view that
blockchain is the future of secure information processing and data settlement (Marinova, 2018)
and English (2018) notes that while blockchain is not immune to all forms of cyber risk, its
unique structure provides security capabilities not present in other legacy technologies. This is
because, the distributed nature and computing power required to make changes renders modi-
fication nearly impossible. In fact, altering a blockchain requires control of more than 51% of
computers in the same distributed ledger and alteration of all of the transactional records within
10 minutes for Bitcoin (Schou-Zibell and Phair, 2018). Those interested in more insights into
how blockchain is impacting the security landscape in banking are referred to Gupta (2017).
2.4 Cost Reductions
Economics will always play an influential role in the adoption of technology, and its no different
when it comes to blockchain technology. The banking sector will have to consider a cost/benefit
analysis to determine the feasibility of implementing blockchain. First and foremost, the en-
hanced trust made possible by blockchain can reduce friction that comprises all kinds of direct
and indirect costs and efforts due to the lack of trust, and bring certainty via transaction logic
instantiated as code (Beck, 2018). MacDonald et al. (2016) summarized that the permission-less
and non-territorial features of blockchain can significantly reduce the institutional exit costs. In
brief, Accenture (2017) concluded that blockchain can result in dramatic costs savings for bank-
ing along the lines of 8 billion USD whilst a 2016 Goldman Sachs report (as cited by Garcia
(2018b)) suggests that blockchain technology could save financial institutions between 11 and 12
billion USD per annum via reductions to the number of mistakes that result in fees and higher
operating costs. According to Santander, blockchain-based solutions could generate cost savings
of up to 20 billion USD per annum (Meola, 2017).
In addition, settlement periods resulting from traditional banking processes cost the financial
7
industry between 65-80 billion USD per annum and blockchain has the potential to reduce or
even eliminate settlement times (Harsono, 2018). Further cost reductions are made possible by
doing away with the need for intermediaries (Marr, 2017) and their associated charges when
completing bank transactions in a world where global enterprises could pay up to 25USD for an
international transaction (Hillsberg, 2018). The ability to share information openly across banks
via the blockchain system would also significantly reduce administrative costs for compliance
departments (Marr, 2017). Those interested in a more detailed discussion on cost savings from
blockchain for banking are referred to Cocco et al. (2017), and Nguyen (2016) for an outlook
from the sustainable development perspective. Below, some practical examples of cost reductions
made possibly by blockchain are presented.
IBM’s blockchain app store (LedgerConnect) is a sound example of how blockchain can
help reduce back-end costs for banks by providing financial companies access to seven vetted
blockchain vendors enabling banks to streamline their trading processes and back-end opera-
tions by establishing one set of records (Garcia, 2018b). There is also evidence that the ICICI
Bank and Emirates NBD are researching into the use of blockchain technology for reducing
transactional costs (Higgins, 2016). Furthermore, banks can reduce infrastructure costs by 30%
using blockchain technology, which translates into savings of 8-12 billion USD annually (Ngo,
2017). Finally, the Central Bank of India estimates cost reductions between 15-20 billion USD
by 2022 via the use of blockchain for interbank transactions (Richter, 2018). Banks can also seek
to integrate fintechs as service providers and this will prevent costly interaction efforts (Drasch
et al., 2018). Therefore, it is evident that significant cost reductions are attainable through
the adoption of blockchain technology, however, the challenges around investments required for
setting up the systems are discussed later on.
2.5 Smart Contracts
Contracts are complex and time consuming affairs in the financial world. Blockchains can be used
to create smart contracts by programming and storing a computer code that can be executed
to create contracts or authorise financial transactions once two or more parties enter their keys
and meet a certain set criteria (Marr, 2017). Figure 4 below summarises the process underlying
smart contracts. The Accenture Technology Vision (2018) report found 60% of all surveyed
executives believing that blockchain and smart contracts would be critical over the next three
decades.
Figure 4: Smart contracts simplified (Institute of International Finance, 2016).
There is evidence of the banking sector already exploiting smart contracts. For example, Gat-
8
teschi et al.(2018) has systematically analyzed the implementations of blockchain based smart
contracts in insurance and finance. Furthermore, a smart contract for travel insurance and au-
tomatically issuing refunding was developed based on the Ethereum blockchain by Bertani et al.
(2017) whilst the Commonwealth Bank of Australia exploited smart contracts with blockchain
technology to monitor and track the shipment of 17 tonnes of almonds (Mittal, 2018). However,
as Sarnitz and Maier (2017) argue, smart contracts could make the role of banks in contract
management redundant in future. Thus, banks must look into ways in which it can exploit smart
contracts and the related technology to its benefit and one such option would be to become the
provider of the said facility. Those interested in more details around blockchains and smart
contracts are referred to Alharby and van Moorsel (2017).
2.6 More Transactions with More Transparency
As it stands, there is considerable disagreement within the banking industry with regard to the
transaction capacity of blockchain technology. As a result, this issue is both an opportunity
and challenge (discussed later on). Currently, Visa’s transaction capacity is at 20,000 TPS,
but research and development into Ethereum’s Plasma multi-child-chain solution blockchain
technology has the potential to enable 1 million TPS (Cook, 2018a). In addition, Japans Mit-
subishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) is also competing with Ethereum by researching into a
blockchain-based financial-transaction solution capable of conducting over 1 million TPS (Cook,
2018a). More recently, the South Africa Reserve Bank used blockchain technology to settle the
country’s typical 70,000 daily payment transactions within two hours (average settlement rate
of 1-2 seconds per transaction) while preserving full anonymity (Zhao, 2018a).
Transparency is an increasingly important consideration along side the increase in transaction
capacities. Whilst the traditional banking system is extremely secretive, blockchain technology
presents means of making the entire banking process more transparent and secure as it locks
records and then enables users to access the full historical data with possibilities of giving
authorised parties only access to shared transaction ledgers (Hillsberg, 2018). Moreover, any
changes made to public blockchains are publicly viewable by all parties (Ho, 2016). In fact,
as Tapscott and Tapscott (2016) asserts, blockchain technology can lower or even eliminate
the need for trust in transactions and make auditing transparent and real-time. It is also
promising for automating financial reporting (Collomb and Sok, 2016) and the transparent
nature of blockchain allows banks and regulators to communicate in real-time and enables swift
action when compliance violations take place (Patel, 2018).
3 Blockchain-ed Challenges in Banking
3.1 Costs and Standardization Requirements
Developing a blockchain enabled system is a high cost affair, and if the banking industry is
to make the most of the system, then it should be standardized across banks (Walker, 2018).
For example, for KYC information to be usefully shared across the banking industry, a common
policy on identification and verification of consumers is mandatory (Walker, 2018). As Clarence-
Smith (2018) asserts, KYC blockchain-based registries are unlikely to get buy-in from all banks
because of their wariness about relying completely on third party verifications of data.
As it stands, each bitcoin transaction costs about 0.20 USD and can only store 80 bytes of
data (Bauerle, 2018). The lack of harmonized industry standards (Schou-Zibell and Phair, 2018),
unless addressed, will be a major hindrance to the adoption and development of blockchain in
9
banking. Bech and Garratt (2017) proposed the money flower taxonomy of money, where the
central bank creates its own cryptocurrency. To this end, the Bank of Canada is validating the
implementation of a digital currency CAD-coin for the use of interbank transfers (Iansiti and
Lakhani, 2017).
Another concern is the energy cost required to power blockchain algorithms. If we take
Bitcoin as an example, Galeon (2017) pointed out that the energy required to mine bitcoin is
equivalent to more energy than what 159 countries consume in a year. In fact, if cryptocurrencies
were to grow to 5% of global money supply, it is estimated that the processing would require
10% of the energy consumed by China (Caplen, 2018). Moreover, as a result of electricity costs,
the single transaction cost for Bitcoin can vary between 75-160 USD (Bloomberg, 2018).
The cost of storage is yet another growing concern for blockchain technology in banking
with some estimating that the long-term storage cost per gigabyte for a Bitcoin node will exceed
22 million USD or more (Bloomberg, 2018). There is also a cost in terms of lost revenue for
banks. This is because blockchain technology threatens the livelihood of middlemen and banks
make huge profits playing this role (Marr, 2018). However, to support the wide adoption of
blockchain, e-identity validation services will be crucial, for which, the banks may still be able
to take significant role as a trusted organization (Buitenhek, 2016). Therefore, the question
remains as to whether the cost reductions from adopting blockchain technology can in fact
outweigh the operating costs of maintaining same.
3.2 Currency Stability
Bankers are not open to the use of bitcoin as a currency (Hillsberg, 2018). One major concern
for the adoption of blockchain payments in banking is the stability of the underlying currency,
especially as the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile (Luu, 2017). Currency stability
is crucial for ensuring that neither the buyer nor the seller loses out in trade due to price
fluctuations (Lund, 2018).
Instead of regular crytocurrencies, Lund (2018) suggests a ‘stable coin’ which is basically a
digital token that will have low price volatility as a result of being pegged to some underlying
fiat currency, thereby acting as a store of value, a medium of exchange and unit of accounting
for blockchain payments. An example of a stable coin is Stronghold USD (Corradino, 2018)
which is backed by USD deposits and is currently undergoing research and development at IBM
as a credible token for blockchain payments (Lund, 2018). Another example is the digital coin
called utility settlement coin backed by six of the world’s largest banks with the aim of allowing
financial groups to pay each other or to buy securities without waiting for traditional money
transfers to be completed (Arnold, 2017; Harsono, 2018).
3.3 Security
The security element features as both an opportunity and challenge for the adoption of blockchain
in banking. It is no secret that banking requires high security. Historically, banks had to only
be concerned with protecting their safes and deposits in high street banks. The move to online
banking saw the emergence of a new security threat from hackers around the globe, thus cre-
ating a job market for cyber security and increased costs for banks. In the recent past, cyber
attacks have resulted in losses of 100 million USD in the banking sector and therefore, banks
are cautious with regard to letting its financial data sit outside their secure firewall (Hillsberg,
2018).
As a security measure, miners can verify daily records in the blockchain, but given that trans-
actions are irreversible, manual data entry errors can prove extremely problematic (Hillsberg,
10
2018). Satoshi Nakamoto highlighted the ‘51% attack’ which means if half of the computers
working as nodes to service the network tell a lie, the lie will become the truth (Bauerle, 2018).
Data privacy too remains a concern within blockchain technology as transactions can be seen
throughout network nodes which produce meta data leading to pattern recognition (Schou-Zibell
and Phair, 2018). However, “self-sovereign identity” which allows consumers to control personal
information and have better control over with whom they share it is an emerging solution to
the privacy concerns (Schou-Zibell and Phair, 2018). Also, it is noteworthy that blockchains are
more secure than a centralised system in many ways (Schou-Zibell and Phair, 2018).
Another security challenge posed by blockchain is anonymity. As blockchain technology al-
lows for anonymity, such untraceable transactions would threaten the banking sector and the
regulator as it increases the difficulty to tax and can also aid criminals with money laundering
(Cook, 2018a). For retaining privacy to its maximum extent, there are cryptographic techniques
like zero knowledge proofs, which allows the block verification and transaction correctness with-
out providing visibility into the details of the transactions (Eyal, 2017). As a possible solution,
more countries are moving towards crypto and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) legislation (Cook,
2018b; Cook 2018a).
3.4 Legislation & Regulations
In an early review by Guo and Liang (2016), the authors addressed the significance of es-
tablishing a regulatory sandbox, so that the implementation and operation of blockchain will
have a restricted scope and still maintain sufficient space for innovation. Red tapes associated
with Central Bank rules and bank secrecy regulations are adversely impacting the adoption of
blockchain in banking with government intervention likely to be blocked further by lobbyists
battling against this disruption (Hillsberg, 2018). The General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) and other privacy laws too hinder the full exploitation of blockchain technology in
banking. A recent report suggests that regulators are now working with banks to develop more
blockchain friendly regulatory frameworks (Kocianski, 2018) whilst other authors are urging
Central Banks to start adapting to blockchain technology (Thew, 2018). However, as Iansiti
and Lakhani (2017) stated, every party of monetary transactions will be required to adopt it,
which challenges the government and institutions that have been overseeing and managing these
transactions for a long time.
3.5 Scalability
It is agreed that as it stands, blockchain has very limited transaction capacity (Caplen, 2018). In
fact, limited scalability is one of the serious concerns underlying blockchain technology (Schou-
Zibell and Phair, 2018). Bitcoin was built to be decentralized and secure at the expense of
scalability (Tomaino, 2018). This is formally referred to as the “scalability trilemma” in which
only two of three properties decentralization, security or scalability can be attained (Schou-
Zibell and Phair, 2018). Therefore, more research and development is required for enhancing
the scalability of the blockchain technology to process more transactions than Visa for a start.
There is also disagreement between the actual scalability of blockchains as Thew (2018)
states, currently, the bitcoin blockchain can only process 7 TPS whilst Caplen (2018) states
bitcoin can process only 3-4 TPS in relation to Visa’s 4500 transactions per second. Furthermore,
some Central Banks like De Nederlandsche Bank is of the view that distributed ledger technology
is not suitable for existing financial payment infrastructure owing to scalability restrictions for
large volumes of transactions (Zhao, 2018b). Therefore, the scalability issues, when coupled with
11
the energy concerns, suggests that blockchain is more suited to wholesale banking solutions than
the mass market (Caplen, 2018).
4 Discussion
The big data trend keeps getting bigger and blockchain will further add to increasing the size of
big data in banking, as well as influencing the exchanging or trading platform for big data (Chen
and Xue, 2017). Therefore, any blockchains used in the banking sector will need the software
and infrastructure to handle big data as never seen before (Marr, 2017). Whilst blockchains are
likely to result in more structured big data, the analysis would have to overcome significant issues
pertaining to increased signal and noise ratios which are already a problem in pre-blockchain
era big data (Hassani and Silva, 2015).
This in turn means that investments into research and development of denoising and signal
extraction in big data is likely to be a worthwhile investment for the banking sector. As an
example, we consider the number of Bitcoin transactions added to the mempool per second
(https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transactions-per-second) as a proxy for banking
blockchain transactions in future. This is a reasonable assumption given that the entire globe
could be transacting on blockchain in future should the banking industry exploit the opportuni-
ties and overcome the aforementioned challenges. The proxy time series captures data for 1680
seconds from 26th July 2018 to 2nd August 2018 and is represented via the first time series
in Figure 5. Here, we rely on a filtering and forecasting technique called Singular Spectrum
Analysis (see, Hassani and Silva (2018), Silva et al. (2018) and Hassani et al. (2017), and
references there in for recent examples of applications) to denoise and extract signals underlying
Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain. Note that in Figure 5, SSA(L,r) refers to the Singular
Spectrum Analysis (SSA) choices of window length L and number of eigenvalues r used to filter
and reconstruct the Bitcoin transaction data.
As evident, the original time series is considerably noisy with outliers affecting the distri-
bution over time such that the true signal is hidden from the naked eye. We apply SSA to
denoise the series and initially extract a smoothed signal (trend and periodic fluctuations) from
the raw transaction data. Note how the SSA(480,1-4) decomposition and reconstruction en-
ables the reader to clearly see the underlying trend patterns and periodic fluctuations in bitcoin
transactions every second. It is noteworthy that the outliers visible in the raw time series are
no longer part of the filtered transaction series. This in turn allows for better decision making
and planning as the banking system will be able to identify the times and periods corresponding
peaks and troughs in blockchain transactions and thereby achieve more efficient programming of
systems and energy-related resource allocations to ensure no outages or slowdowns occur during
transaction peaks whilst allowing for better energy allocations during the less busy periods. In
the bottom half of Figure 3, through the SSA(480,1-13) graph, we include further signals to
the initially filtered smooth series to provide a better indication of the actual bitcoin trans-
action movements each second and the final graph, SSA(480,14-480) shows the noise that was
extracted using SSA. It is evident that the outliers are now filtered out as noise, thereby reducing
the random elements in the data and enabling far more accurate decision making. Moreover,
such denoising efforts would also help banks to improve the forecasts of future movements in
blockchain transactions as the random elements (noise) are reduced, thereby enabling forecasting
models to produce a better fit to the data.

5 Conclusions
Following the disruption in banking as a result of big data, blockchain has taken control of the
process and it is not only creating several opportunities, but also threatening existing business
models in banking. For some, blockchain is as revolutionary as the internet, whilst for other it
is overhyped (Caplen, 2018) or seen as a threat to traditional banking operations. This paper
begins by briefly summarising the evolution of blockchain in banking and our research uncovers a
lack of academic interest in this subject area, in comparison to the interest shown by researchers
in other sectors. In hope of encouraging more research and development into blockchain-ed big
data in banking, we review over 100 articles (mainly industry related and few academic) and
present the opportunities and challenges related to the adoption of blockchain in banking, from
a bankers point of view.
We find enhancements to KYC processes, transaction speeds, and security, and cost reduc-
tions, smart contracts, transparency and the potential to increase the number of transactions
a bank can process as the key opportunities. In contrast, we also find setup and operating
costs, standardization requirements, stability of the currency, security (which is interestingly
both an opportunity and challenge in some aspects), legislations and regulations, and scalabil-
ity to be the key challenges faced by banks looking into adopting blockchain technology in the
modern age. Whilst majority of these challenges could be overcome through extensive research
and development, the lack of academic research based interest in this subject area is of con-
cern. It is expected that this review can act as a means of easily identifying existing research
gaps for blockchain-ed big data in banking and thereby motivate more academics, researchers
and bankers to delve into this subject area and find solutions to the challenges at hand whilst
improving upon the existing opportunities.
As part of the discussion element, we also consider the importance of filtering and signal
extraction techniques to the banking sector in future. Using real data as an example, we illustrate
how the banking sector could benefit from knowledge and research into filtering and signal
extraction in big data as it seeks to adopt blockchain technology and expand its operations.
13
In conclusion, it is clear that there is a lack of consensus within the industry with regard
to the feasibility and usefulness of blockchain in banking. However, the opportunities presented
can easily outweigh the challenges the moment the industry reaches agreement on how best to
move forward and the regulator recognizes the benefits this disruption can have on banking
around the globe. Big data is here to stay, and so is blockchain technology. In an age where
innovation determines survival in a highly competitive and volatile market, banks must choose
whether they will innovate and bank with blockchain-ed big data or risk being left behind and
lose the competitive edge in a rapidly progressing technological environment.

However, there exists a gap in research and development into blockchain-ed big data in banking from an academic perspective, and this gap is expected to have a significant negative impact on the adoption and development of blockchain technology for banking. In hope of motivating more active engagement by academics, researchers and bankers alike, we present the most comprehensive review of the impact of blockchain in banking to date by summarizing the opportunities and challenges from a bankers perspective. In addition, we also discuss the impact that big data from blockchain will have on banking data analytics in future and show the increasing importance of filtering and signal extraction for the banking industry. Whilst there is evidence of selected banks adopting blockchain technology in isolation or small groups, we find the need for extensive research and development into several aspects of banking with blockchain to overcome the challenges which are currently hindering its adoption in banking across the globe","['Article', 'PeerReviewed', 'Artificial Intelligence']",disabled

POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE

Abstract 
In today’s debate about the disruptive effect of blockchain, audit and control professions are not in the 
spotlight while blockchain technology exhibits very interesting properties in those contexts 
(transparency, immutability, traceability and integration of rules and procedures in the technology 
itself). Combined with current technical developments, process and service innovation, applications 
such as smart contracts and publicly-held registers, have the potential to significantly change audit and 
control activities. In this context, we conducted a study based on the grounded theory to understand 
how auditors in Switzerland anticipate the impact of blockchain on their daily activities. Based on the 
findings, three hypotheses have emerged. First, the potential disruptive effect of the technology on the 
profession is not fully anticipated, and smaller auditing firms are not tooling up to face the changes to 
come. Second, the profession will go through a paradigm shift in two ways: become more IT than 
accounting oriented and become more forward than backward-looking. Lastly, the profile of the 
auditors will change.

The Potential Impact of Blockchain on Audit Practice 
 
    The disruptive effect of Blockchain is now widely recognized in the financial sector, while the level 
of awareness in other sectors and their professions remains low. Elimination of intermediary activities 
(disintermediation) or transformations of these activities are expected to occur in all sectors of the 
economy (Von Gunten and Mainelli, 2014; Schatsky and Muraskin, 2015; Swan, 2015). This is 
particularly well illustrated in the audit and control professions. Indeed, current technical 
developments, process and service innovation, applications such as smart contracts and publicly-held 
registers, combined have the potential to radically change audit and control activities. The 
transparency, traceability, immutability and integration of rules and procedures embedded into the 
technology itself may enrich processes and information production in such a way that control and audit 
procedures may be changed significantly, or even become obsolete in some cases. At the same time, 
it offers opportunities for auditors to redesign best practices, update rules and procedures, define new 
standards of the profession that could be encoded within transactions or even innovate with new value- 
added services. 
   
    While the “disruptive” potential of blockchain has been extensively debated, scientific studies about 
the impact on business processes and professional practices remain scarce (Weber, et al., 2016) and 
the development of business models remain primarily associated to the financial sector (e.g. for the 
first semester of 2018 the global investment in fintech companies – across venture capital, private 
equity and mergers and acquisitions - hits $57.9 billion which is well above 2017’s total investment 
results (KPMG, 2018)). Thus, the academic and professional literature mainly presents two kinds of 
contributions about blockchain:  
i) advantages and pitfalls of blockchain technology both from a technical and business perspective; 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE

and  
ii) business applications mainly focusing on cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and traceability at 
large. 
  
In this context, compliance, control, and audit activities have been neglected in the academic and 
scientific community in analyzing their developments or proposing new business processes and 
services.  
 
    The purpose of this study is to explore the perception of financial auditors and Information Systems 
(IS) auditors working in audit firms of different size in Switzerland on how the use of blockchain 
technology could impact practices in the audit profession. 
 
    The innovative point of this study can be tied to the focus on the audit profession and more 
specifically on the view of professionals in practice regarding the potential impacts of blockchain 
technology on their daily work and profession as this sector is currently under-researched despite the 
significant disruptive potential.   
 
    The next section reviews the literature and related work. Section two describes the research 
methodology. The research results and discussion are presented in section three. Section four 
concludes the paper with current and future work. 
 
I. LITERATURE REVIEW 
    Blockchain technology is a distributed data structure, or ledger, in which transactions are recorded 
in append-only mode and verified through consensus algorithms (Erbguth and Morin, 2016). In other 
words, it is “a distributed general ledger recording that a transaction happened, when it happened and 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
5 
 
that it happened correctly, without exposing any confidential details about the subject or the parties’ 
involved” and consists of a software protocol of its own (Kehoe, et al., 2015). These systems keep 
records of ownership and transaction timestamps, eliminating the possibility of digital copying and, 
thus, double-spending (Farell, 2015; Tsilidou and Foroglou, 2015; Lee Kuo Chuen, Guo and Wang, 
2016).  
    
    Blockchain technology also offers users the feature to make transactions irrevocable (immutability) 
thus increasing accuracy and trustworthiness of records (Lemieux, 2016; Wespra, 2016) while at the 
same time simplifying back office processes. Blockchain makes it possible to tie a set of rules or 
procedures to specific transactions to standardize process activities. The features of this technology, in 
particular its transparency and distributed consensus approach (Silverberg, et al., 2015) are expected 
to fundamentally change current business models, practices, and professions to achieve a “sharing 
economy and distributed trust” according to the World Economic Forum (Brechlbuhl, 2015).  
 
    From a conceptual perspective, blockchain technology provides a series of features, which can 
revolutionize some of the existing architectures in the digital business world. This transparent 
distributed database records each network’s user intervention and allows encoding rules and 
procedures within the platform at the transaction level. It allows business enterprises to create and run 
applications as well as conduct business without a central authority or server as a control point (Trusted 
Third Parties). In this regard, blockchain technology helps businesses craft applications and conduct 
transactions, which can be self-executing and autonomous at the same time (DuPont and Maurer, 
2015). The autonomous, decentralized and secured capabilities characterizing blockchain technology 
can help in redefining the foundational patterns of business applications (Schatsky and Muraskin, 
2015; Swan, 2015; Mahajan et al., 2018). The trusted third parties could even become useless and be 
replaced by blockchain based distributed trust (Swan, 2015, Pitter 2018, The Economist 2015) which

could lead to the transformation or elimination of intermediary activities (disintermediation) in several 
sectors such as finance, art, health, and literacy (Swan, 2015), personal insurance (Von Gunten and 
Mainelli, 2014), corporate audits and accounting (Schatsky and Muraskin, 2015; Smith 2018). 
 
    In today’s business ecosystem, financial auditors are the trusted professionals who guarantee the 
existence of transactions, attest of their evidence, accuracy, and completeness as well as the 
presentation of related information in financial statements (Hayes et al., 2014). In order to fulfill these 
objectives, the auditors need a good understanding of the client business, IT infrastructure and IT 
systems relevant to financial reporting and controls in place. In order to do so, the International 
Standards on Auditing (IAS) allows them to team up with IS auditors to gather and interpret evidence 
(Axelsen, et al., 2017; IAS 220, 2009).  
 
    More specifically, IS auditors collect and examine data from database, software programs and 
information management systems to ensure that they allow to safeguard assets, maintain data integrity, 
achieve organizational objectives, and consume resources effectively (Axelsen et al., 2017). In other 
words, IS auditors evaluate the design and effectiveness of an organization’s IT systems and internal 
controls against policies and regulations.  
 
    Audit and control functions have been mainly established to provide assurance to shareholders, 
regulators, governments and other stakeholders. All types of audits (financial, operational, compliance, 
governance, etc.) share the same characteristics and consist of systematic processes “of objectively 
obtaining and evaluating evidence regarding assertions about economic actions and events to ascertain 
the degree of correspondence between these assertions and established criteria and communicating the 
results to interested users.” (Hayes et al., 2014). An audit ultimately aims at providing trust among its 
intended public. For example, the purpose of a financial audit is to enhance the degree of confidence 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
7 
 
of financial statements readers (IFAC 2400 revised, 2012). Spoke M., a senior consultant at Deloitte 
Canada, stresses that an audit is an opinion provided on the financial statements of companies based 
on pre-determined accounting guidelines.  
 
    However, after scandals such as Enron in 2001 among the most notable, the global audit industry 
has lost its principal asset; public trust (Spoke, 2015). This is highlighted by the literature which shows 
that trust in audit has been undermined due to scandals and is still in a recovery process within the 
public (Mueller, Carter and Whittle, 2015; Fearnley, Beattie and Brandt 2005; Zabihollah, 2004).  
 
    As a response to rebuild this trust, new regulations as well as accounting and auditing standards 
have been imposed, adding complexity, and increasing the cost of control activities and reporting for 
companies. Today, blockchain technology allows business enterprises to make digital interactions or 
record transactions in a way that is transparent, secure, auditable, efficient, and highly resistant to 
interruptions (Schatsky and Muraskin, 2015). Those features could not only decrease the accounting, 
auditing and compliance costs but also transform and facilitate the work of auditors (Spoke, 2015). It 
is clear that such technology can enable more efficient access to data and completion of financial audit. 
Indeed, the fact that any asset or document can be codified and referenced or encapsulated by a ledger 
entry helps simplify the work of auditors and accounting professionals (Schatsky and Muraskin, 2015), 
and reduce the manual work (Drane, 2016) while at the same time help to ensure complete transaction 
traceability.  
 
    Large international audit firms themselves foresee that the cost and time necessary to conduct an 
audit would decline considerably (Allison, 2015; Tysiac, 2017). It seems therefore reasonable to expect 
a significant increase in the commoditization of financial audit services (Anderson, 2017) and a 
decrease of audit costs. Those firms, and more particularly the Big Four (the four largest audit firms 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
8 
 
being Deloitte, EY (Ernst & Young), KPMG, and PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) are currently 
working on blockchain technology (Allison, 2015): EY, for example, announced the launch of EY Ops 
Chain, a set of applications and services to help firms leverage blockchain technology to enhance 
operation and drive growth (Alarcon, 2018). KPMG LLP and Microsoft reported a partnership to 
create a series of innovation workspaces and other initiatives dedicated to developing use cases and 
applications of blockchain technology (Alarcon, 2018). Deloitte declared a blockchain team of 800 
professionals in 20 countries (Alarcon, 2018) with the EMEA blockchain lab based in Dublin, and in 
particular, the Rubix Project being an example of work performed on interoperability, scalability, 
performance and security in the audit field (Keogh, 2017; Spoke, 2015). And PwC also created its 
global Blockchain team and set up a Blockchain Experience Lab that works in co-creation with 
industry experts. 
 
    Blockchain is also expected to reduce reliance on auditing for testing financial transactions 
providing an “automated third-party verification” (Spoke, 2015). This could ultimately lead to the 
elimination of control and audit activities or at the least to a profound redefinition of those professions. 
For example, access could be granted to auditors and regulators, providing a “single source of the 
truth” (Roberts, 2017) and allow for real time audit (MacManus, 2017).. Another example is the 
confirmation process that could be eliminated from the auditors’ review process; especially 
confirmation of outstanding receivable and payable balances. Indeed, once data has been uploaded and 
approved by the blockchain, confirmation of transactional information and details are broadcasted to 
the entire network, providing real time verification of the transfer of funds from one counterparty to 
another, making the auditor’s confirmation no longer necessary (Smith, 2018; Borthick, 2017).   
 
    However, even though blockchain technology offers many different features and seems to be 
secured, there are several existing challenges that need to be addressed. One major issue is 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE

interoperability. Interoperability is defined by the Francophone Association of Free Software Users as 
“a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with 
other products or systems, present or future, in either implementation or access, without any 
restrictions”. As of today, even though multiple blockchain projects have been set up and some of them 
are even well established, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are still interoperability issues among 
blockchain infrastructures. Moreover, the compatibility issue of blockchain with enterprise 
information systems (e.g., ERP) which often include a variety of functional modules such as 
accounting, controlling, procurement, logistics, warehousing, manufacturing, project management, 
quality management, etc. are currently being addressed by several ERP vendors and technology 
companies (Kacina, et al., 2017). These systems are widely used across all industries nowadays. Lastly, 
blockchain’s benefits are best realized when different industry participants come together to create a 
shared platform which increases interoperability challenges at two levels (PwC, 2018), first at the 
technical level as each participant’s systems need to be compatible with the shared blockchain and 
second at the blockchain governance level as each participant needs to agree on the shared network 
rules.  
    Another key issue is the blockchain scalability. Scalability is the ability for a system to continue to 
function well when it changes in size or volume - typically, to a larger size or volume (Rouse, 2006). 
In the blockchain context the scalability issue arises when the number of participants increases over 
time. Scalability has several components: latency, which is the “time for a transaction to confirm” 
(Croman, 2016). As of today, latency takes at least 10 minutes with the blockchain Bitcoin, and 14 
seconds for Ethereum which is significantly more than current payment processing systems is. 
Moreover, 13 % of transactions on public blockchains exceed 20 minutes, and 25 percent can exceed 
an hour (Kanaracus, 2016; Harris, 2018).  
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
10 
 
    Size and storage are other important scalability components that need to be worked on. Indeed, by 
design, the ledger of a blockchain contains all the transactions since the genesis block. Thus, as the 
number of users and transactions grow, the size of the ledger also grows. 
    Bandwidth is also important as transactions need to be relayed through the network prior to being 
validated through consensus algorithm. Indeed, when the number of users increases and consequently 
the number of transaction increases, a better network connectivity is necessary. Good network 
connectivity and large storage capacity require effective record management leading to centralization, 
increased costs (Harris, 2018), and more energy consumption.  
    The last component of scalability is throughput referring to the maximal rate at which the network 
can work properly (i.e. transmit, receive and validate transactions). Because of the design of the 
blockchain infrastructure, the number of transactions being transmitted, received and validated over 
the network is small in regard to other existing, centralized, infrastructures. With Bitcoin, for example, 
the maximal rate is of approximately 7 transactions per second. This issue mainly concerns public 
blockchains and is already managed for private blockchains for which some infrastructures can already 
handle thousands of transactions per second.  
  
    There are other important types of risks. For example, credentials can be compromised or stolen, 
and there are concerns that it might be vulnerable to programming errors (such as in the Decentralized 
Autonomous Organization or DAO platform, which lost $50 million in 2016) or systems weaknesses 
(such as the vulnerabilies behind the scandal of the Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, in 2014). This is also 
true for smart contracts. They are stand-alone programs that, once started, automatically execute pre-
defined conditions encoded within the blockchain. They work just like any conditional statement of 
the ""if - then"" type (if such a condition is satisfied, then such a consequence runs). No form or human 
intervention is needed to process those transactions. A study recently revealed that 3% of all smart 
contracts are fatally flawed (Nikolic et al., 2018). Another analysis performed by a blockchain security

11 
 
company showed that among projects that have collectively raised $1 billion, more than one quarter 
of them had critical vulnerabilities (De Havilland, 2018).   
 
    In addition to these technical challenges, the biggest barrier to blockchain adoption today as reported 
by PwC and Deloitte in their reports (PwC, 2018; Deloitte, 2018) is the regulatory uncertainty. Indeed, 
even though many territories have begun studying and discussing the issues (PwC, 2018), particularly 
as they relate to financial services, the regulatory environment remains unsettled. Overall, there are 
currently insufficient standards and controls in place to ensure that the systems are functioning as 
intended (Alarcon, 2018). For example, in the European Union it is unclear how any blockchain project 
can meet the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy standards (PwC, 2018).  
 
    Blockchain impact on audit and control professions remains an under-researched area. In a context 
where blockchain developments flourish, our general hypothesis is that blockchain technologies have 
the potential to significantly disrupt and transform the audit and control work.  
 
II. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
    This section describes the methods used in developing the research, collecting and analyzing data.     
The grounded theory approach was used for this research. Strauss and Corbin have defined grounded 
theory as “theory that was derived from data, systematically gathered and analyzed through the 
research process”, and Charmaz and Bryant as a method of qualitative inquiry in which researchers 
develop inductive theoretical analyses from their collected data. Grounded theory was the selected 
research approach as it stresses the importance of allowing theoretical ideas to emerge from data 
(Bryman, 2016) and provides a methodological framework to develop “emergent” theories that 
particularly fit exploratory studies such as this one where theoretical concepts have not yet been 
developed. Research based on grounded theory “involves using multiple stages of data collection and 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
12 
 
the refinement and interrelationship of categories of information” (Creswell, 2014). The initial phase 
of the study consisted in semi-structured interviews analyzed using a research software for qualitative 
data analysis, ATLAS.ti, allowing the formulation of the hypotheses presented in this paper. Those 
hypotheses are to be tested in the next research phase in order to generate a theory on the impact of 
blockchain on the audit and control profession.  
 
    A guide for semi-structured interview was developed and consisted in 17 questions classified in 5 
categories: Global knowledge, Business Processes, Audit Work, Opportunities and Challenges, and 
Last Questions; to explore each interviewee’s observation on blockchain and its potential impact on 
the audit profession. This approach allowed each participant to discuss in depth their understanding 
and concerns on the technology, as well as the foreseen changes in their profession in relation to the 
deployment of blockchain technology. The interview guide is reported in Appendix A – Interview 
Guide.   
 
    On average interviews lasted 50 minutes. Interviews happened either in French or in English 
depending on interviewees’ proficiency. Based on the interviewees’ request answers were either 
recorded or transcribed through notes in preparation for analysis and coding within ATLAS.ti.  
    The sample selection was based on the theoretical sampling process where two researchers jointly 
collected, coded and analyzed the data in order to identify major categories. Theoretical saturation 
where nothing new emerged was reached after 32 interviews of Financial and IS auditors from 23 audit 
firms with different level of responsibility ranging from manager to partner, all located in Switzerland, 
except one auditor who was covering the Swiss market from Paris at the time of the interview. There 
were two occasions where two auditors were interviewed at the same time, therefore a total of 34 
auditors were interviewed from December 2016 to November 2017.

    The anonymized list of interviewees including the interviewee job title, expertise, whether or not 
the interviewee works for one of the Big Four, the date of the interview, and the way the interview was 
conducted is presented in Appendix B – Interview Details.   
Table 1 below presents the categorization of the population:

    The analysis of the data was performed by two researchers. Each of them defined the codes as the 
interviews were performed. They then compared their codes and agreed on their definition. Thus, sixty-
nine codes were created and categorized into twelve code groups. The codes and their definitions as 
well as the code groups are provided in Appendix C – Codes.   
    Subsequently, one of the researchers coded the interview transcripts using the qualitative data 
analysis and research software, ATLAS.ti. Once theoretical saturation was reached, the two 
researchers, as a result of initial coding, were able to carry out focus coding; they worked jointly to 
identify the most significant initial codes to classify the data into more elaborate categories, which 
resulted into twelve potential impacts. Then, one of the researchers identified the interviewees whose 
responses supported each one of the identified potential impacts. And for each potential impact, the 
percentage of auditors who agreed with it was calculated. The results of the analysis and the related 
percentage computation are presented in Appendix D – Categories.

    Findings show that 94% of the interviewees regardless of their function (financial or IS) think that 
the audit activity will change in the mid-term. More specifically 62% anticipate the function to be more 
and more IT oriented. Indeed, they think that the scope of the audit will not be primarily to ensure that 
financial statements are free from material misstatement as it is the case today but rather to focus on

IS audit which has been defined by Weber as “the process of collecting and evaluating evidences to 
determine whether a computer system safeguards assets, maintains data integrity, allows 
organizational goals to be achieved effectively and uses resources efficiently” (Weber, 1999). As 
controls can be embedded into the technology, some auditors think that audit and accountancy firms 
will have to ensure that the technology is properly deployed and set-up and that automated controls 
are proper. As such, some of the interviewees hypothesized that auditors will be primarily “IT engineer 
auditors” with specific IT skills such as programming and not financial auditors as it is the case today, 
some even mentioned “blockchain auditors” whose function will be to certify blockchain.  
 
    53% of the interviewees anticipate that auditing firms will hire more IS auditors in the very near 
future instead of financial auditors. More importantly they expect that auditing firms will hire new 
profiles such as analytics specialists, data scientists and statisticians. This is reinforced by the fact that 
today, in most cases, when the IT environment is not complex, even though financial auditors are not 
IT experts and have no training in IS audit, they perform themselves IS audit work by following a 
predetermined audit program to complete this part of the engagement (Axelsen et al., 2017) as 
confirmed by the interviewees. However, blockchain technology is complex and not well understood 
by most financial auditors and even by many IS auditors as demonstrated by the answers obtained. 
None of them has had hands-on experience with it and none of them knows how to audit such a 
technology. Besides, they usually mention blockchain and other technologies such as data analytics, 
process automation, digitalization, robotization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) together, regardless of each 
technology characteristics and its potential impacts on the profession even though they are different. 
We noticed that  the two major auditing standards bodies, the International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (IAASB), and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) do not 
dissociates technologies from one another and have both set up working groups to investigate “new 
technologies”, which include among other data analytics and blockchain.  
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
16 
 
    The interviewees also highlight the fact that there is currently no blockchain-specific auditing 
standard and report a lack of personal experience with this technology, suggesting the need for the 
audit firms to integrate new skills.  However, as demonstrated by Bagranoff and Vendrzyk, the value 
of the IS auditor role in the audit is often poorly communicated and indirect (Axelsen et al., 2017), and 
in practice as reported by Janvrin, the level of engagement between financial and IS auditors is low 
whereas IT environments are increasingly more sophisticated and complex (Axelsen et al., 2017). As 
the scope of the audit is expected to shift, and as audit firms are expected to hire people with a wider 
range of skills, better interaction and better communication among financial and IS auditors, and other 
specialists will be necessary for the audits to be as efficient, effective and of higher quality as 
anticipated by the use of new technologies.   
 
    At the same time, 38% of the interviewees foresee that the traditional auditing workload will 
decrease. Indeed, some of the tedious and labor-intensive processes traditionally associated with an 
audit (Raphae, 2017), especially the ones that do not require experience and technical knowledge such 
as data collection, data cleansing and sorting, and tick and tie activities will be eliminated or 
automatized (Martindale, 2016; Smith, 2018). 56% hypothesize that the use of blockchain coupled 
with the use of other new technologies such as workflow automation, digitalization, data mining, 
robotization, and the use of artificial intelligence will increase audit efficiency and effectiveness, thus 
leaving more time for auditors to use their professional judgment, experience, knowledge of an 
industry and of competitors performance to get a better understanding of their clients and therefore 
provide deeper analysis on business issues, controls, and risks. This trend appears to be in line with 
the literature that foresees efficiency gains as a result of the use of new technologies in auditing 
(Raphae, 2017; Sheehan, 2017; Smith 2018). Thus 65% of the interviewees think that auditors will 
therefore be able to focus on value added activities and provide better insights to their audit clients 
based on their professional judgment. This is aligned with current literature explaining that the 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
17 
 
traditional role of data verification responsibilities will change and evolve over time, but the need for 
data interpretation and integration into strategy are positioned to grow and change moving forward 
(Smith, 2018).  
 
    Some auditors also predict that they will be able to perform real time audit, as also mentioned in the 
literature. Indeed, if operational and financial information is uploaded into the blockchain network on 
a continuous basis, and if auditors have continuous access to the blockchain used by their clients, then 
they will be able to analyze this information in a real time manner (Banham 2017). Real time review 
will also contribute to providing better insights to audit clients, thus not only increasing the value of 
the audit but also bringing audit quality to a new level as exceptions will be detected earlier and 
corrected by clients on a timely basis.  
 
    Findings have some other implications for the audit firms. Indeed ‘the future is characterized by 
unparalleled organizational and informational complexity, with corporate and business reporting 
evolving rapidly’ (Axelsen, et al., 2017). If the auditors and the audit firms are to keep up with these 
changes and the IT current development, accounting firms should think about what the audit of the 
future will look like and whether their audit teams have the required skills (MacManus, 2017). As of 
today, the Big Four have already invested in the use of new technologies such as data analytics 
software, and AI programs and started proof-of-concept projects on blockchain. All interviewees are 
anticipating a “people challenge” at two levels. First, auditors need to stay up to date on new auditing 
and accounting standards and latest developments, and more importantly increase their IS skills. 
Indeed 82% of the interviewees think that auditors, financial and IS, in place and in training need 
deeper IT skills. To address those requirements, the Big Four continuously invest to ‘re-train’ and ‘re-
skill’ their employees and keep them informed on “hot topics”. However, it seems that smaller auditing 
firms are not investing as much as larger auditing firm in training their employees on new technologies 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE

including blockchain and therefore are not as prepared for the changes to come as our study shows. 
Indeed 83% of the audit firms surveyed that are not among the Big Four have not started investigating 
the subject matter. They are in a “wait and see” mode and hope that they will be able to catch up with 
any new developments when time comes, but this might be too late. The second challenge comes from 
the fact that the tedious and manual audit processes and tests that are currently performed by junior 
auditors will be automated, therefore, auditing firms will not need as many juniors as they need today. 
Instead they will need more specialists and more experienced professionals who will be able to use 
their professional judgment to solve complex problem, analyze data, identify control improvements 
and provide value-added insights to their clients. This will affect the audit pyramidal organization and 
the way auditing firms manage their workforce careers, which is partially based on a high turnover 
rate especially at the junior and senior auditor positions.  
 
    Lastly as reported by 85% of the interviewees, the auditing standards will have to be updated to 
include more IT related guidance. Indeed, as of today there is no auditing standard describing how to 
perform an audit on blockchain. The extent and the pace to which international rules will be modified 
in relation to the growth of blockchain use and other new technologies such as data analytics and AI 
remain unknown at this stage. We can say that the IAASB initiated an awareness process that can be 
illustrated both with the presentation of blockchain done by Chuck Landes, Chair of the IAASB 
Innovation Working Group, and the feedback statement by the Data Analytics Working Group 
(DAWG) on ‘Exploring the growing use of the technology in the audit, with a focus on data analytics’. 
The feedback statement reports that the respondents to their request for input from the audit 
professionals emphasized the need for the IAASB to ‘reflect the digital era in application guidance’ 
and recommended that the DAWG members ‘consider other technologies whose impact on auditing 
deserves further consideration such as blockchain technology’(IASB, 2018). Also, the PCAOB 
announced in December 2017 the plan to form a new task force on data and technology to explore 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
19 
 
whether there is a need for guidance, changes to PCAOB standards, or other regulatory actions in light 
of the increased use of data analytics and of other new and emerging technology-based tools (PCAOB, 
2018).  
 
    To the best of our knowledge, the Swiss transmitter of the National Auditing Standards, 
EXPERTsuisse, has not yet set up such a working group to assess the impact of blockchain on the 
audit profession. In the meantime, Swiss financial auditors already face the challenge to audit 
companies active on blockchain or companies that have implemented blockchain platforms to run 
some of their business processes. This situation requires them to use their professional judgement when 
auditing standards are silent or not adequate. The evolution of norms or the development of new 
standards may follow and draw on the evolution of this professional practice.  
 
    Over all, the findings suggest that the profession is at a turning point and three major hypotheses 
have emerged:  
 
H.1: The potential disruptive effect of the technology on the profession is not fully anticipated and 
smaller auditing firms are not tooling up to face the changes to come.      
    The impact of blockchain on the audit profession would be different if audit clients adopt it as part 
of their business process, or if it is used by auditing firms as an audit tool.  
    Even though both venues are possible, none of the auditors interviewed, even the auditors working 
for the Big Four mentioned blockchain as a possible audit tool on its own. All of them only considered 
the potential impacts blockchain would have on their profession if it is used by their clients, how this 
would have an effect on the relationship with their clients, how they would access clients’ data, and 
how they would audit the new system in place. Furthermore, on the one hand, the Big Four have 
launched projects, training programs, and communicate actively on blockchain technology, which 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
20 
 
allows their auditors to better understand the technology, provide support to and advise their clients. 
Those companies, at the strategic level, are developing the knowledge and the resources to not only 
anticipate but also influence the deployment and usage of blockchain by their clients, and the audit of 
the technology by audit professionals.  On the other hand, smaller auditing firms have not started to 
invest and to investigate the technology, as they do not have the financial and human capacity. They 
also believe that their client type (smaller firms) will not embrace the technology at the same pace as 
larger firms and therefore they can wait to develop their capacities and capabilities. However, as 
blockchain offer many interesting characteristics and as the technology is based on “shared and 
distributed” features, we can anticipate that once it will start to root into the business ecosystem, its 
adoption will most probably be rapid and general. Indeed, PwC recently reported that in the 15 
countries where they surveyed leaders, 84% of them explain that their company is already engaged 
into a project related to blockchain (PwC 2018). Another survey from Deloitte led in 7 countries 
reported that 41% of the 1053 senior executives working in companies with annual revenues over $500 
million think that their company will adopt the technology within the next 12 months (Deloitte, 2018). 
We can thus infer that most smaller audit firms as they do not have sufficient current knowledge and 
understanding of the technology are not anticipating the impact of the technology on their profession 
and sooner than later might not be able to answer their clients’ emerging needs on the technology.  
 
H.2: The profession will change its paradigm to become more IT oriented and more forward-looking.  
    First, blockchain allows controls to be embedded into the technology, therefore some processes and 
transactions will be automated. Moreover, records of all transactions will be instantly available to the 
auditors and will be automatically validated by the technology itself. We can then induce that the main 
focus of the auditors will not be to guarantee the existence of transactions, attest of their evidence, 
accuracy, and completeness as those checks are going to be performed by the technology itself but to 
attest that blockchain is working as intended. IS auditors will have to not only understand the 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
21 
 
technology but also the underlying code, they will have to assess the related risks and the emerging 
issues that could affect their clients. Indeed, as demonstrated by Kinney, businesses place a great 
reliance upon IS as part of their business strategy and operations (Axelsen, et al., 2017), which will be 
reinforced by the use of blockchain. The change in the profession paradigm will also be accelerated 
by the fact that not only the audit clients but also the audit firms use more and more different kinds of 
technologies to perform their audit work. For example, KPMG has partnered with IBM Watson to 
begin automating and streamlining audit and tax processes (Smith, 2018), other type of artificial 
intelligence systems can also be used to reconcile data, while drones can help with inventory counts.  
   
    Second, audit has always been a “back-looking” activity whose purpose is to obtain reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements of an audited entity are free from material misstatement (ISA 
200, 2011) to provide an audit opinion for an ended period (ISA 705, 2011). Thanks to the use of 
blockchain and data-driven analysis, auditors will be able to provide new insights to their clients. We 
can then construe that the profession will move from checking past data to providing new types of 
analysis and therefore become “forward-looking”. Even though none of the 34 auditors interviewed 
already provides forward-looking information to their audit clients, we expect this move to happen 
sooner than later. Indeed, audit clients will probably urge their auditors to provide them with advisory 
as it would bring them additional value. However, auditors are currently restricted in the type of 
services they can provide to their audit clients for independence reasons, which might represent an 
ethical challenge that the profession will have to tackle. 
 
H.3: Profile of Auditors will change.  
    The hypothesis 2 suggests that the audit paradigm will change as it will be more IT and advisory 
driven. Even though today’s financial auditors and IS auditors are well educated - indeed many 
financial auditors are also CPAs, IS auditors CISA and both financial and IS auditors have graduated 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
22 
 
with a bachelor or a master’s degree - we can induce that to address the changes brought by the 
paradigm shift, profile of auditors will have to change in several ways. 
 
    As demonstrated by Curtis, Dowling and Leech, technologies at the auditees are increasingly more 
sophisticated (Axelsen, et al., 2017), and blockchain with its technical features such as asymmetric 
cryptography and distributed systems, is a good example of a sophisticated technology. If the role of 
auditors is less and less to audit the financial data but to audit the blockchain and certify that it is 
properly implemented, then auditors will have to be able to thoroughly understand those features. They 
will have to widen their technical skillset to master coding, hashing, cryptography and also work on 
their soft skills. Indeed, if auditees use smart contracts that execute automatically  predefined 
conditions within the blockchain (if such condition is satisfied then such consequence runs), auditors 
will have to first understand the underlying code and second will have to be able to communicate 
clearly with lawyers to ensure that those contracts are legally valid. Moreover, the literature review 
shows that the audit profession will also be impacted by the use of other technologies such as data 
analytics (Tysiac, 2017; Anderson, 2017; MacManus, 2017; Raphae, 2017; and Sheehan, 2017; IASB, 
2018) which is confirmed by the interviewees. Indeed, all the auditors interviewed who work for a Big 
Four mentioned that they already use data analytics as an audit tool, which is, however, not yet the 
case in smaller CPA firms, as only a few interviewees working for this type of firm already use it.  
Therefore, audit firms will have to hire data scientists or train their auditors in order to drill down large 
volumes of data. Those data scientists will team up with experienced auditors or field specialists (tax, 
finance, valuation) to interpret data and provide the insights and advice auditees will expect to receive 
from their auditors. As such audit firms will need more experienced professionals instead of juniors 
and, instead of hiring juniors who gain experience over the years and climb the hierarchy, will directly 
hire experienced people. Today auditors leave audit firms to work in the industry, in the future the 
other way around might prove to be true. Professionals might leave the industry and work for audit

23 
 
firms directly as managers or directors, which will deeply impact audit firms’ organizational chart.   
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
    Indeed, blockchain is sometimes compared to automation and data analytics that will require 
transforming how audits are performed (Raphae, 2017). Blockchain technology has the potential not 
only to make the accounting and auditing rules change, but also to impact the nature of the accounting 
and auditing profession. Some top executives highlight the fact that blockchain is a better ledger 
because it allows adding entries to a ledger and to have multiple ledgers crosschecking against each 
other (Martindale, 2016). In addition, it provides a third validation point that did not exist before, 
where auditors have previously stepped in and may not have to do so anymore in a near future 
(Martindale, 2016). Finally, a major opportunity resides in the fact that blockchain could facilitate the 
audit and control work by encoding rules directly in specific processes. But, a major challenge exists 
in terms of potential redefinition of audit and control activities based on the properties of blockchain 
technology (transparency, traceability, security, persistency and immutability of transactions). 
 
    The question of the nature and scope of audit work in the case of blockchain use has been raised and 
not fully answered yet. Some emphasize the growing need of digital technology profiles (Raphae, 
2017) while others emphasize the move towards less numerous but more value-added activities 
(MacManus, 2017) which is confirmed by our study. 
 
    More importantly, blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to cause the greatest 
level of disruption for the audit profession. While this potential disruption may be years away, some 
commentators have suggested that the potential impact on the auditing profession could be as 
significant as the impact of the internet on industries such as travel or retail (Sheehan, 2017). And yet, 
our research results highlight the fact that auditors in practice do not completely foresee the radical 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
24 
 
changes that blockchain technology could bring, potentially far more important compared to evolution 
of companies towards automation and increased use of data analytics.  
 
    In that sense, the audit profession could in fact be facing a paradigm change. Legal obligations to 
perform audits of financial statements may become useless once blockchain technologies will be 
mature enough and have proved their scalability. Automated and certified audits will be on blockchain 
and financial statements information accessible to stakeholders in real time. While auditors are 
foreseen to become blockchain technology experts and certifiers, it is unclear whether they will encode 
the rules in blockchain themselves or work together with accounting, internal control, risk management 
and compliances experts. Will the work be limited to assessing whether or not blockchain is working 
correctly (MacManus, 2017), or go beyond that? Is the audit profession about to change its paradigm 
to move from being back-looking to forward-looking? Will it change its perspective and be more 
future-oriented? How will this move toward less independence be perceived by investors, especially 
as trust in the profession has not fully recovered yet? 
 
    We believe that because blockchain technology and the development of auditing and control 
standards are not envisioned in an integrated way, the potential impact of blockchain on audit and 
control professions has not yet been systematically and thoroughly assessed.  
 
    We think that the results of this study can be of interest to the profession and to the organizations 
that are in charge of training auditors. Indeed, the use of blockchain and other “new technologies” will 
require very different skillsets. Such skills will be more IT oriented and at the same time will require 
a strong business and accounting technicity; a mix of skills that is rare among the profession as well 
as in the current academic and professional training.  
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE 
 
25 
 
    This study also contributes to both blockchain and auditing scientific literature because it describes 
and explores the financial and IS auditors’ perceptions regarding the impact of blockchain technology 
on their profession. It also provides accounting and auditing firms as well as auditing continuing 
education institutions with insights on the required future skillset of auditors and the evolution of their 
scope of work.  
 
    Finally, we stress the limited nature of our study, whose purpose was to serve as an initial 
exploration of the impacts of blockchain on the auditing profession. We should insist on the fact that 
these research hypotheses need to be validated in subsequent research. Indeed, we started in March 
2018 a three-year Swiss National Science Foundation research project on this specific topic covering 
both the management and the technical dimensions of the research question.

2. Interview goals 
We will collect and validate key information based on semi-structured interviews and expert discussion 
groups. We will use a pre-defined grid to integrate the results of both interviews and group discussions. 
This will allow us to obtain individual perspectives as well as collective expert views. 
3. Confidentiality guaranteed 
We treat the answers received confidentially. This implies that when we share data with third parties 
(for example for publication) it is never possible to trace data back to the firm or to the interviewee.  
4. On our side, analysis and report will be available. 
At the end of the study we will organize a presentation to share the results with the interviewees.  
5. Further contact could be possible if needed

can also be used by auditors to access client's data. 
Mix all technologies 
Auditors consider all new technologies (blockchain, 
big data, IA, etc.) as a bulk. Do not dissociate each 
technology with its own specificities and potential 
usage / impact by / on the audit profession. 
Dissociate 
technologies 
Auditor does not mix all technologies together and is 
aware that each technology has its own specificities 
(IA, BC, BD) and could impact or be used differently 
his / her profession. 
Usage and 
Capabilities 
What is possible to do with blockchain technology.  
Adoption of 
Blockchain 
Cost Benefit Analysis 
Before deploying a blockchain, companies will 
ensure that the cost benefit analysis is positive.  
Evangelization 
Blockchain adoption: averse to change: 
evangelization of Blockchain is necessary. 
By Audit Client 
Blockchain is adopted by the audit client (auditee). 
Auditors will access it to perform their audit (get data) 
and will have to audit the system itself.  
By Audit Firm 
Blockchain is adopted by the audit firm and will be 
used as an audit tool.  
Wide Adoption Large adoption is necessary. 
Future Skills 
Data Interpretation 
Future auditors will need to be able to make meaning 
of data (cartography of data, data analysis, big 
data....). 
Field Expertise 
How the use of blockchain will impact the auditors' 
required skills.  
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BLOCKCHAIN ON AUDIT PRACTICE

Code Groups Code Definition 
IT The future skills needed by the auditors are IT based.  
Statistics and Math 
Auditors will need more statistics and mathematical 
skills.  
Reporting 
Data Quality 
The use of blockchain will impact the quality of 
financial data before the audit takes place.  
No Impact The use of blockchain will not impact the reporting 
process.  
Quicker The reporting process will be quicker.  
Real Time 
Access to financial reports will be real time. Data in 
the financial reports will be real time data.  
Reporting 
Automation 
The reporting process will be automatized 
Audit Practice 
Expand Limits 
The use of blockchain will allow auditors to analyze 
more data and therefore to better understand and 
analyze their client’s business.  
No Change 
The use of blockchain will not impact the audit 
practice.  
Optimization 
The use of blockchain by CPA firms will impact the 
audit practice: reduce length of audit work, 
performance gain, efficiency gain, reduce audit costs.  
Simplification Audit will be easier to perform / simplified.  
Scope 
Shift of audit scope from accounting to IT (audit of 
blockchain and its embedded rules e.g. integrated 
internal controls). 
Tests Automation More and more audit tests will be automated.  
Traditional Tests 
Impact on traditional audit tests: substantive, sample, 
audit figures, transactions, etc. 
Use of Technology 
Auditors will use more and more new technology to 
perform audit (Blockchain, drone, etc...). 
Accounting 
Department  
Number of 
Employees 
The use of blockchain will impact how many persons 
work in an accounting departments in the industry.  
Task Automation 
 
 
 
More and more accounting tasks (especially low 
skills ones) will be automated.

22 interviewees work in a CPA firm that is not a Big Four, which represent 18 different CPA firms (meaning that 2 interviewees at least work for 
the same firm). Among those 18 CPA firms, 15 have not started any project on blockchain, which represents 83% of the CPA firms that are not 
Big Four

In this context, we conducted a study based on the grounded theory to understand how auditors in Switzerland anticipate the impacts of Blockchain on their daily activities. Based on the findings, three hypotheses have emerged. First, the potential disruptive effect of the technology on the profession is not anticipated, particularly by smaller audit firms. Second, the profession might go through a paradigm shift in two ways: become more IT than accounting oriented and become more forward than backward-looking. Lastly, the profile of the auditors will change","['Audit', 'Financial Auditors', 'IS Auditors', 'Blockchain', 'Technology', 'Audit', 'Financial Auditors', 'IS Auditors', 'Blockchain', 'Technology']",disabled
