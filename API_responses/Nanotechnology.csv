          INTRODUCTION 
           Beginning in mili (10-3), then micro (10-6) and now nano (10-9). The “small” is 
becoming smaller and smaller. This is an evidence in a lot of domains and with great 
impact in our lives as it happens with this technology, which maybe paradoxically has the 
greatest one. In short, “small is beautiful”. Briefly, of course, pico (10-12), then femto (10-
15) will arrive. However, for now, stand in nano world. 
            Nanotechnology - extremely small technology at the nanometre scale - involves 
multidisciplinary scientific knowledge and discusses matters related to the use of 
materials, mechanisms, devices and systems at a nanometer scale. Nowadays there are a 
lot of fields in which nanotechnology is applied and it is expected that it can create an 
enormous field for innovations and to be part in many fields of science developments. 
Particularly, it is expected that this developments happen in various applications on the 
 1 
biomedical area, such as drug delivery, molecular imaging, biomarkers, biosensors 
(biomedical sensors wirelessly located on/in the human body; nanobiomedical data 
transmitter) and many other fields of application.  
                 It is commonly accepted that the first steps towards the construction of the 
concept of technology were given by the scientist Richard P. Feynman. His first speech 
on this subjects was held at the American Physical Society on 1959, where peculiarly he 
did not use the term “nanotechnology”. Indeed this word was first used by Professor 
Norio Taniguchi (1974) to describe the fabrication at a scale of 1 nm.  
             The idea that nanotechnology has just a technological impact by itself in human 
activities and life and health must be analyzed, considering the strong impact on the 
economic activities in which the technologies are applied. In biomedical area for 
example, the considerable impact on pharmaceutical and biomedical companies is quite 
notorious. 
             Considering the whole discussion involved, it is pertinent to consider that rather 
important ethical questions are raised in this field. This discussion is important to define 
some borders, in view of the human and technical limitations, for the indescribable 
context of the problem.  In this perspective of the discussion of the ethical issues, human 
values must not be neglected. In the nanotechnology area, particularly in the biomedical 
field, some questions are posed primarily on the impact on the human values and human 
condition, risks for human health derived from neglecting human behavior, for example, 
and on the borders of science. The possible violation of the basic principles of natural life 
and individuals’ position concerning life borders, health and life, and its contextualization 
may be well understood. 
              In this work, some ideas are presented on nanotechnology, specifically about the 
concept and the reporting ideas involving nanotechnology. The discussion about the 
concepts is not the main objective of the present study. It is to show the importance of 
this technology, some of its applications and the exposure to different borders and 
significant risks in several areas behind the enormous fields of opportunities and 
 2 
challenges. Those risks may represent a problem but the challenges represent an open 
field to get significant progress. 
                 The work is composed of the following parts: 
         1. Nanotechnology- a brief approach; 
                  2. Nanopanels – a success of nanotechnology in industry;  
                  3. Nanoelectronics – improving the life standard; 
                  4. Nanotechnology in medicine-friendly efficient healthcare; 
                  5. Ethics and nanotechnology; 
                  6. Concluding Remarks.  
                  In section 1, nanotechnology is discussed in a general way. In section 2 
nanotechnology and the applications in industry area, then in the electronics area (section 
3), and in the medicine area (section 4) are presented and some discussion is proposed in 
order to define the boundaries for the advances on these areas. In the following section, 
nanotechnology is discussed in terms of ethics and in terms of the borders that 
nanotechnology applications must satisfy. In the last section, some final and concluding 
notes are presented, highlighting the results of the analysis. Important considerations are 
made about the close connection between ethics and the nanotechnology and the effects 
over the society and values. Finally, some future directions for the research are suggested. 
Some of this work is in (Ferreira et al, 2017). 
 
                  NANOTECHNOLOGY- A BRIEF APPROACH 
                  In the 20th century fifties, the discovery of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
carried new perspectives to medicine and new hopes to mankind. The revolutionary 
discovery of DNA allowed advances on new fields of science. Since then, research 
brought many other significant discoveries which borders are completely unknown. 
 3 
                   The 20th century saw huge changes in the face of Earth with so many and so 
great discoveries that were totally impossible before. From the innovations that made 
possible to fly using heavy aircrafts, to use antibiotics for medical care, the arrival and 
enormous development of electronics, or whatever many other discoveries that 
revolutionized totally the humans life. The existence got a completely different sense. 
Newly, the introduction of the computer and the advances in electronics have contributed 
to life at another level of existence. The radio, television, cars, telephone, airplane, 
computers and internet services were products that have become available to the current 
life.  
                    As can be easily seen and perceived every day, science has been facing 
important advances in many fields in the last decades and recently great new advances 
have been made. Now a new history may be in progression in the current century. 
Technology at a nanoscale has arrived and a completely new world is already there, with 
significant and continuous discoveries. 
                  Feynman, cited in Freitas (2005), proposed the use of machine tools to make 
smaller machine tools, these to be used in turn to make still smaller machine tools, and so 
on all the way down to the atomic level. Feynman was clearly aware of the potential 
medical applications of the new technology he was proposing. 
                 These smaller machine tools would come to be transformed in nanomachine 
tools, nanodevices, and nanorobots, which could ultimately be used to develop a wide 
range of atomically precise microscopic instrumentation and manufacturing tools, that is, 
nanotechnology.  
                   This new technology, nanotechnology, which is an expression that comes 
from the Greek word “nano” (“dwarf”, in English), is applied on a molecular level in 
engineering or manufacturing, for example.  
                   The most common definition of nanotechnology is that of manipulation, 
observation and measurement at a scale of less than 100 nanometer.  
 4 
                   The term nanotechnology refers to several distinct classes of technology, each 
one with its own set of capabilities, potential applications and risks. The terms in this 
field that are specifically used for the different technologies may vary. However, it is 
important to be aware of the fundamental meaning of each one and the important 
dissimilarities between them. 
                    Besides, nanotechnology is inherently multidisciplinary, depending on 
analytical techniques and methodologies of a set of disciplines including chemistry, 
physics, electrical engineering, material science and molecular biology, worked on the 
basis of many scientific fields in the area of lithography, nanomachines or nanorobots, for 
example.  
                  In the nanotechnology ambit it is possible to construct devices which can scan 
and manipulate objects at an almost atomic scale (see Kubik et al, 2005). Dealing 
nanotechnology with materials, devices, and their applications, in areas such as 
engineered materials, electronics, computers, sensors, actuators, and machines, at the 
nano length-scale, the advances brought an enormous impact on those areas. Medicine, 
engineering of materials or electronics are nowadays confronted with progress but also 
with an ethical discussion. Considering these nano-meter length scales, numerous 
disciplines and new technologies are going together to develop new processes and 
combinations. 
                    Since the nineties, the progresses were very relevant (see for example, 
Srivastava and Atluri, 2002). The discoveries of atomically precise materials are very 
significant, particularly the advances in: 
                      1. medicine, for example, in the implantation of nano-robots; 
                      2. the scanning probe and manipulation techniques to image and manipulate  
                          atomic and molecular configurations in real materials; 
3. the conceptualization and demonstration of individual electronic and 
logic devices with atomic or molecular level materials;  
 5 
4. the self-assembly of materials to be able to put together larger 
functional or integrated systems; 
5. computational nanotechnology, i.e., physics, and chemistry, based 
modeling and simulation of possible nanomaterials, devices and 
applications. 
6. agriculture (for pest control)  
                     The possibilities are endless on these and many other fields. 
                     One of the fields developed in nanotechnologies is the area of nanorobotics, 
which involves devices as nanobots, nanoids, nanites, nanomachines or nanomites. These 
concepts have been used to describe this kind of devices, today much under research and 
development. Nanorobotics refers to the nanotechnology engineering discipline of 
designing and building nanorobots, with devices that are ranging in size from 0.1 to 10 
micrometers and are constructed of nanoscale or molecular components.  
                    The invention of nanorobot hardware architecture for medical defense should 
provide the basis for advanced ‘computational nanomechatronics: a pathway for control 
and manufacturing nanorobots’ (Cavalcanti, 2009).  
                   From the many nanorobots applications, it is very interesting to observe the 
following case. In 2002, in a paper published in Nature,  researchers of New York 
University have presented a major step in building a robust, controllable machine from 
DNA, by demonstrating a robust sequence-dependent rotary DNA device operating in a 
four-step cycle. The authors (Yan et al, 2002) show that DNA strands control and fuel 
this device cycle by inducing the interconversion between two robust topological motifs, 
paranemic crossover (PX) DNA and its topoisomer JX DNA in which one strand end is 
rotated relative to the other by 180°. The authors say that they expect that a wide range of 
analogous yet distinct rotary devices can be created by changing the control strands and 
the device sequences to which they bind. 
 6 
                   Constructed from synthetic DNA molecules, the device improves upon 
previously developed nano-scale DNA devices. The researchers say that the new device 
may help to build the foundation for the development of sophisticated machines at a 
molecular scale, ultimately evolving to the development of nano-robots that might 
someday build new molecules, computer circuits or fight infectious diseases (see Yan et 
al, 2002).  
                  Controlled mechanical movement in molecular-scale devices has been 
realized in a variety of systems, by exploiting conformational changes triggered by 
changes in redox potential or temperature, reversible binding of small molecules or ions, 
or irradiation.  
                “The incorporation of such devices into arrays could in principle lead to 
complex structural states suitable for nanorobotic applications, provided that individual 
devices can be addressed separately. But because the triggers commonly used tend to act 
equally on all the devices that are present, they will need to be localized very tightly. This 
could be readily achieved with devices that are controlled individually by separate and 
device-specific reagents. A trigger mechanism that allows such specific control is the 
reversible binding of DNA strands, thereby 'fuelling' conformational changes in a DNA 
machine” (Yan et al, 2002).  
                This new robust sequence-dependent rotary DNA device operating in a four-
step cycle represents an improvement upon the initial prototype system that used this 
mechanism but generated by-products. That initial prototype system was announced in 
1999 by Prof. Seeman that consisted in a machine constructed from DNA molecules, 
which had two rigid arms that could rotated from fixed positions by adding a chemical to 
the solution. The problem was that this chemical affected all molecules within a structure 
uniformly. A big advance now is the fact that the movement can be manipulated within 
molecule pairs without affecting others within a larger structure, what is got by inserting 
DNA set and fuel strands into individual molecule pairs. 
              In biological research, particularly in the area of molecular biology and working 
nucleic acid molecules, many other achievements have been recently made. Moreover, 
 7 
many progresses have been made in the area of molecular biology applications. In this 
field, many techniques have been successfully implemented in many scientific fields, 
such as in the diagnostics area or in biology, biotechnology or medical science. For 
example, “the introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) resulted in improving old 
and designing new laboratory devices for PCR amplification and analysis of amplified 
DNA fragments. In parallel to these efforts, the nature of DNA molecules and their 
construction have attracted many researchers. In addition, some studies concerning 
mimicking living systems, as well as developing and constructing artificial nanodevices, 
such as biomolecular sensors and artificial cells, have been conducted” (Kubik et al, 
2005).  
               In this century, the development of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) diagnostics are being made considering a large set of 
approaches using new techniques and technologies, many of them associated to DNA 
developments, being particularly supported by nanotechnology solutions, which have 
been already successfully introduced. These achievements take part in the fundamental 
development of many areas of diagnostics and science, including the health care, 
medicine or pharmaceutical industry (Kubik et al, 2005). 
               There are great scientific revolutions in human history and as seen before, 
nanotechnology is certainly one of them, which opens up unimaginable possibilities in 
various fields of human reality and in various fields for application in the industry. 
 
               NANOPANELS - A SUCCESS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY IN INDUSTRY 
                 Owing to the more and more importance of nanopanels, for instance in the 
future this technology may be applied to telemedicine with important consequence, they 
will be dominant in this section.                  
                 Nanotechnology will allow to manufacture products of higher quality at lower 
cost, a range of possibilities to produce new means of production and new kinds of 
resources and factors. This is a manufacturing system that can reproduce more 
 8 
manufacturing systems in a quick cheap and clean way. In only a few weeks, power 
would pass from a few to a huge number of nanofactories. It is a kind of revolutionary 
technology, manufacturing powerful, but also with many potential risks, in spite of the 
benefits it has (see Euroresidentes, 2011, p. 01). 
                 Developed countries estime to allocate a sum of around USD 5.5 billion to this 
subject.  
                  An important example of successful application of nanotechnology in Brazil is 
Empresa Brasileira de Agropecuária (Embrapa). One of its most remarkable products is 
the ""electronic tongue"", a device that combines chemical sensors with nanometer-thick 
with a computer program that detects flavors and aromas and serve to quality control 
and certification of wines, juices, coffees among many other products.               
                  The agitation of the industrial model is directly related to the use of 
nanotechnology in the various branches of economic activities. Follows an outline for the 
manufacture of electric power, which generically McKibben considered itself as a 
country's economy (see McKibben et al, 2009, p. 24). 
                 Indeed, the use of nanotechnology in the industry production processes is a 
reality. It can be noted, for example, in the particular case of the production of electric 
energy through the photovoltaic panels use. The emphasis is placed on the competitive 
advantage associated to the use of nanotechnology versus the solar energy production for 
companies in this market segment. 
                  The American firm ""Nanosolar"", which studies are sponsored by major 
companies like Google or IBM, or resulting from the allocation of benefits offered by the 
Department of Energy, is leading the competition for energy production resulting from 
nanotechnology. The company has named this technology as ""nano-photovoltaic panels"". 
                   The photovoltaic solar energy is obtained converting light into electricity: the 
so-called ""photovoltaic effect"" (see Becquerel, 1839). 
 9 
                    The photovoltaic cell works when light reaches the photovoltaic panel, 
exciting energetically electrons, making them circulate freely from atom to atom, forming 
the electric current. 
                    The photovoltaic cell is a practical application of photoelectric effect. The 
photovoltaic cell that turns the light into electricity will continue to generate electric 
power according to the level of radiation received. So, see Nascimento (2004, p. 02), ""the 
photovoltaic cell ... maintains a flow of electrons established in an electrical circuit as 
long as there is light on it"".                                         
                  Note that the energy produced with the classic solar panels is much more 
expensive than the energy produced in either thermoelectric power plants or dams. If 
instead nano-photovoltaic panels are used, although, more expensive, the price is already 
comparable with the price of the energy produced in either thermoelectric power plants or 
dams (see Ferreira et al, 2014). 
                  Companies need to be dynamic in the development of innovations and thus 
creating competitive advantages. Through their production processes, they can create 
economic value, and consequently generate their viability in the market in which they 
operate. For McDonough III (2009, p. 04) ""in the current buoyant economy, 
organizations must continually reinvent what they are and what they do [...]"". 
                    The competition is part of a dynamic and evolutionary operation of the 
nowadays economy. There are enormous changes in the economic space in which these 
companies operate, whether they are changes in products, in processes, in sources of raw 
materials, in forms of productive organization, or in their own markets (see Schumpeter, 
Brazilian version, 1982, p. 65). 
                   Conferring to McAfee and Brynjolfsson (2008, p. 78) ""the result is that an 
innovator with a better way of doing things can grow at unprecedented speeds and 
dominate the industry"". 
                   At the same time, it is interesting to note that nanotechnology is a technology 
that may use a minor quantity of natural resources than other technologies. Probably, a 
 10 
company gets additional benefits and has a lower cost and additionally gets better results 
for operating inputs.               
                   To Nogami and Passos (1999, p. 03), from the harsh reality of scarcity arises 
the necessity of choice. Since it is not possible to produce everything that it is felt as 
needed, mechanisms must be created to show somehow to the societies the path to decide 
what goods are effectively to produce and what needs have to be met. 
                  All the means or methods of production indicate different combinations of 
forces and inputs. Production methods vary according the way such combinations occur. 
Every concrete act of production incorporates a kind of combination. A company can 
itself be considered a combination, and even may be the conditions of production of the 
whole economic system (see Schumpeter, 1982, p. 16). 
                 Roughly speaking, being photovoltaics already an innovation in itself, when it 
is combined with nanotechnology, its power of subversion, which can also be interpreted 
as its ability to break paradigms in the energy industry, takes the form of a powerful 
competitive weapon for the production units. 
                Given this context, nanotechnology combined with the production of solar 
energy becomes interesting for the production units, whether they are public or private. 
               Describing the way a nanopanel is manufactured, begin to note that first it is 
necessary to produce the semiconductor’s nanoparticles. Then, aluminum sheets are 
placed in a press in order to extremely thick them. And a thin layer of semiconducting ink 
is painted on the aluminum substrate. In a next stage, another press put layers of 
cadmium sulfide and sulfur, and zinc oxide (CdS and ZnO). Finally, the sheet is devided 
in sheets of solar cells. These nano-panels can be produced outdoors (Ferreira et al, 
2014). 
               This technology is very interesting, reaching good results either in terms of 
costs when compared with other solar panels and also in terms of performance even 
considering public energy. Those costs have coming to be considerably reduced. 
 11 
               In Brazil a strong trend of increasing costs to the production of hydroelectric 
power is observed. The comparison of the hydroelectric energy produced in Brazil and 
other countries like Canada, for example, shows the importance of the development of 
alternative energies. In Brazil, the behavior of the total cost of producing energy used to 
be well above inflation in the country for a long period. Recently, Brazil took the 
advantage of using photovoltaic energy through the use of nano-panels. It may be noted 
in fact that this is one of the reasons that qualify the use of photovoltaic energy as a 
generator of competitive advantage in the market. The company which owns such 
technology may experience a reduction on its variable costs, compared with solar 
photovoltaic panels (silicon). Nano-panels allow also to perceive a competitive advantage 
in environmental conservation terms, when compared with the energy provided by public 
network (Ferreira et al, 2014). 
                 In short: nanotechnology strongly implements the transformation of traditional 
models. This transformation may be in the way goods and services are produced, or in the 
way the production is conducted and made. Also in terms of nanomedicine, it is 
expectable that nanopanels may have interesting applications, for instance, in clothing or 
skin for energy supplying. 
                 NANOELECTRONICS-IMPROVING THE LIFE STANDARD 
                   It is commonly accepted that electronic devices are essential in the support of 
nowadays life. And there is a great fundamental hope in nanotechnology to improve the 
capabilities of electronic components, namely in what concerns the reducing their 
dimensions, weight and power consumption. 
                    Indeed, being the electronic components traditionally of very short 
dimensions and very low weight, the reducing of these quantities to the nanoscale level 
makes possible to conceive electronic devices with much more qualities, since then it is 
possible to incorporate there much more components and even so to reduce the size and 
weight of the device. 
                     As for the reducing of power consumption, only to emphasize that this is 
crucial in these times in which the energy shortage becomes an increasingly dramatic 
problem, nothing being too much in the efforts to achieve that the human activity 
happens to follow with an increasingly lower consumption of energy, attempting to reach 
a situation close to the one of no wastes 
 12 
                    Also to refer that the nanotechnology developments may also contribute to 
the improvement of human creativity allowing to conceive new kinds of electronic 
components, to be used either in classical electronic devices or in modern ones.  
                    All this in order to improve the humanity life standard both in work and 
leisure. When speaking about the applications of nanotechnology to electronics it is usual 
to designate it as nanoelectronics, being the emergence of this word a sign of the huge 
importance of nanotechnology in electronics. 
                    Nanoelectronics holds some answers for how it is possible to increase the 
capabilities of electronics devices and simultaneously reduce their weight and power 
consumption, making its operation more and more convenient and cheaper. Many of the 
nanoelectronics areas under development are devoted to the following topics: 
                    -Everybody is aware of the enormous and surprising properties that 
electronic device screens currently have. Practically everything is remote from the touch 
of a finger, and moreover on devices as small as mobile phones. It seems that this 
situation will become overwhelmingly dominant for all electronics, and for example for 
televisions is already there. And also for the medical monitors used in medicine. This will 
ensure greater speed and precision in the most varied procedures. Improving display 
screens on electronics devices is precisely a nanoelectronics area under development. 
This involves reducing power consumption while decreasing the weight and thickness of 
the screens and above all to develop new properties for the screens that, for example, 
allow the touch command. 
                    -Everyone is amazed at how much information can be stored nowadays in 
such small spaces. It can even be said in microspaces. But everything indicates that much 
greater fears are to come in this matter. Increasing the density of memory chips is a target 
for many scientists working in the nanoelectronics area. Researchers believe that it is 
possible to develop a kind of memory chip with a projected density of at least one 
terabyte (1012 byte) of memory per square inch. 
                    - The development of the first transistors was an effective step in 
miniaturizing the circuits Today, reducing (much more) the size of transistors used in 
integrated circuits is still an objective and a nanoelectronics objective. One researcher 
believes it may be possible to ""put the power of all of today's present computers in the 
palm of your hand"". It seems that it is an enormous exaggeration but who knows the 
future?  
                    An enumeration of applications under development, falling in the topics 
described above may be seen in reference 50. 
                 NANOTECHNOLOGY IN MEDICINE- FRIENDLY EFFICIENT 
HEALTHCARE 
                    Nanotechnology is giving continuous steps towards new developments in research 
and applications. It will be expanded to many areas of life and sciences, particularly in medicine, 
 13 
where the diagnosis, drug deliveries’ systems in the body or the treatment of diseases are 
particularly important. 
                      Applications of nanotechnology for treatment, diagnosis, monitoring, and control of 
biological systems were recently referred to as ""nanomedicine"" by the Institutes of Health (see 
Moghimi et al, 2005).  
                      The origin of the concept of nanomedicine is related to the idea that nanorobots and 
related machines could be designed, manufactured, and introduced into the human body to 
execute cellular repairs at the molecular level. Nowadays, nanomedicine has multiplied in many 
directions, understanding the idea that the ability to structure materials and devices at the 
molecular scale can bring enormous immediate benefits in the research and practice of medicine 
(see Freitas, 2005). 
                       The use of instrumentation techniques inside the human body for ‘medical 
nanorobotics for diabetes control’, ‘nanorobotics for brain aneurysm’, ‘nanorobots for treatment 
of patients with artery occlusion', ‘nanorobots for laparoscopic cancer surgery’, has been 
established and now only requires further industrial implementation and commercialization. 
Aspects such as integrating and using ‘nanorobotic architecture for medical target identification’ 
can effectively contribute to the advance of several medical issues, thus improving biomedical 
engineering. Upcoming and current available technologies should be used to achieve a fully 
functional ‘medical nanorobot architecture based on nanobioelectronics’ (Cavalcanti, 2009). 
                         According to (Moghimi et al, 2005), the application of nanotechnology to medical 
activities, according to the idea inherent to the concept of nanomedicine, involves the 
identification of precise targets (cells and receptors) related to specific clinical conditions and the 
choice of the appropriate nanocarriers to achieve the required responses while minimizing the 
side effects. They say yet that “mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and 
cancers (tumor cells, as well as tumor neovasculature) are key targets”.  
                           In (Moghimi et al, 2005) also it is shown how important are, nowadays, 
nanotechnology and nanoscience approaches to particle design and formulation. The authors 
highlight that they begin to expand the market for many drugs and are forming the basis for a 
highly profitable niche within the industry. Their article highlight rational approaches in design 
and surface engineering of nanoscale vehicles and entities for site-specific drug delivery and 
medical imaging after parenteral administration.  
 14 
                            Among the most relevant fields of nanotechnology use one is the development 
of artificial tissues, organs and cells. The implantation of encapsulated cells is being planned for 
the treatment of diabetes, liver failure and kidney failure. And also for the use of encapsulated 
genetically engineered cells for gene therapy. Artificial cells uses are very relevant for drug 
delivery and other applications in biotechnology, chemical engineering and medicine (see Kubik 
et al, 2005). New researches are being directed to discover new techniques which may contribute 
for the artificial growth of organs and tissues on nanopatterned scaffolds, aiming to obtain 
internal tissues implants. The studies on the creation of nanostructures that can interact with and 
replace natural biological materials give raise to many opportunities and hope for medical 
treatments.  
                             Some of the medical areas in which nanomaterials have successful utilization 
are precisely the medical diagnosis, the proper and efficient delivery of pharmaceuticals or the 
development of artificial cells.  
                         As seen above, many advances in nanomedicine have been worked. Their use in 
valuable medical diagnostics or clinical therapeutics brings significant results. In Freitas (2005) 
many examples of applications are presented, for instance, single-virus detectors, 
tectodendrimers, nanoshells, fullerene-based pharmaceuticals, or immunoisolation, gated 
nanosieves.  
                          Particularly, it is interesting to show the case of the advances on DNA 
sequencing and the consequent benefits. An ultrafast DNA sequencing has been made possible. 
Branton’s team at Harvard University used an electric field to drive a variety of RNA and DNA 
polymers through the central nanopore of an a-hemolysin protein channel mounted in a lipid 
bilayer similar to the outer membrane of a living cell. Branton first showed that the nanopore 
could rapidly discriminate between pyrimidine and purine segments along a single RNA molecule 
and later demonstrated discrimination between DNA chains of similar length and composition 
differing only in base pair sequence (Freitas, 2005). 
                         A colossal increase has been got recently in the understanding of the way basic 
biological processes happen at a molecular level (see for example the very particular case of the 
human genome sequence). The importance of these developments continues to grow very fast and 
so the focus on the essential molecular mechanisms underlying the normal functioning of cells, 
tissues and organisms themselves. Molecular medicine, by itself, exploits molecular and cellular 
 15 
biology advances to characterize how normal cellular processes fail or are subverted in disease. 
Nanotechnology has an important role in this matter. 
                         According to Freitas, cited by Kubik (2005), there are three important molecular 
technologies: 
                          - Nanoscale-structured materials and devices are promising for advanced 
diagnostics and biosensors, targeted drug delivery and smart drugs, and immunoisolation 
therapies. 
                         - Biotechnology offers the benefits of molecular medicine via genomics, 
proteomics, and artificial engineered microbes. 
                         - Molecular machine systems and medical nanorobots will allow instant pathogen 
diagnosis and extermination, chromosome replacement and individual cell surgery in vivo, and 
the efficient augmentation and improvement of natural physiological function.  
                         Operating in the human body, nanorobots can monitor levels of different 
compounds and store information in an internal memory. The use of nanodevices may permit to 
reduce the intrusiveness, increasing the patient comfort and to give a greater fidelity on results, 
once the target tissue can be examined in its active state in the actual host environment. 
                       Nanorobots may be used to rapidly examine a given tissue location, surveying its 
biochemistry, biomechanics, and histometric characteristics in greater detail (see Kubik et al, 
2005).  If, or when this happen, this will help in better disease diagnosing. 
                       In general, nanotechnology works the engineering of molecularly precise structures 
and molecular machines; and nanomedicine makes the application of nanotechnology to 
medicine, considering also the use of medical nanorobotics. Medical nanorobots can offer 
targeted treatments to individual organs, tissues, cells and even intracellular components. They 
can get involved in biological processes at the molecular level.  
                      It is clear at this moment that nanotechnology will continue to offer very effective 
solutions in many medical areas, allowing new treatments, giving more efficiency to the classic 
treatments, with much less suffering for the patients.    Nanomedicine may even give answers at 
the level of the control of human aging. This world is a completely new open world, with very 
large potentialities at diverse scales and dimensions, very particularly in the area of telemedicine. 
 16 
It is very interesting to understand that the extent of telemedicine and telehealth success will 
depend on how well the heath care system exploits the capabilities of advanced information 
technology. This technology can extend the reach of medical facilities and resources, promoting 
efficiency, productivity, accuracy in clinical decision making, coordination and integration 
(Ackerman et al, 2002). 
                  ETHICS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY 
                      Computers have brought the ability to type and made handwriting more and more 
superfluous, even obsolete. Mobiles and their miniaturization brought the ability to generally 
communicate anywhere to anybody, making more and more useless the traditional phones. 
Nanotechnology, because of its negligible dimension of devices, will spread the use of devices 
that now are nuisance. For instance, the pacemaker that now is used like a “last resource”, maybe 
soon will be used in a much larger scale if it will be possible to design one at a nanoscale. 
                      However ethical questions rise with the development of nanotechnology. What are 
the borders for this kind of progress? Until where we must go? What are the implications in a 
later phase of development of these technologies? 
                       Global discussion has begun about this theme since the beginning of the 
discoveries about this subject. Legal, ethical and social implications are irreversible and the 
discussion is usually asked to be hard.  
                       Vanessa Nurock, cited in Bensaude-Vincent (2010), questions the standard view of 
an ethics for nanotechnology. She argues that none of the current trends in the discipline of ethics 
would qualify for application to nanotechnology. Then considering that neurotechnology – a 
rapidly growing field at the intersection between nano and biotechnology – can affect moral 
capacities of the brain, she suggests that ethics itself may be affected by nanotechnology. And she 
leaves open the question of a co-construction of ethics and bionanotechnology. 
                         Freitas (2005) says that the society should be “able to muster the collective 
financial and moral courage to allow such extraordinarily powerful medicine to be deployed for 
human betterment, with due regard to essential ethical considerations”. 
                         At EU, there are some important concerns and discussion about the development 
of the integration of human beings and artificial (software/hardware) entities. A funded project in 
 17 
this area (ETHICBOTS) was created to promote and to coordinate a multidisciplinary group of 
researchers into artificial intelligence, robotics, anthropology, moral philosophy, philosophy of 
science, psychology, and cognitive science, with the common purpose of identifying and 
analyzing techno-ethical issues concerned precisely with the integration of human beings and 
artificial (software/hardware) entities. 
                           Next generations, in the perspective of the utilization of nanomaterials, will have 
many benefits in all these chapters (health, economic, environmental, etc). By using this kind of 
advanced technology, with many more applications and much friendlier using, the conditions this 
technology offers will be very environmental friendly as well, as already seen.  
                           Actually, there are irreversible and long-term impact consequences for future 
generations and for the environment. However, there are risks, as well. But in truth there are 
incredible potential advantages. And the discussion is all over the place. The borders are, of 
course, evident and there has to be an achieved balance between the path found to the new 
dimension of knowledge and the contours the problem has. The rub of the question is exactly in 
what measure criticisms may have into account the potential of the technology. 
                           So, despite the high feasibility for the economy and the environment, there are 
some considerations regarding the ethical, human dignity and moral borders on nanotechnology 
that should be taken into account.  
                           It is interesting to go to the definition of human dignity and its relationship to 
moral made in the “opinion of the European Group on ethics in science and new technologies to 
the European Commission”, 2005, when discussing the ethical aspects of information and 
communication technologies (ICT) implants in the human body. The group makes allusion to 
the EU’s draft Treaty that Establishes a Constitution for Europe, stating that “Human dignity is 
inviolable. It must be respected and protected” (Article II-61), and goes on to explain that “the 
dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis 
of fundamental rights” (Declaration concerning the explanations relating to the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights). This group says yet that this explanation does not strictly define human 
dignity and that many writers have attempted to fill this gap. One such attempt
 
suggests that 
human dignity is defined as follows: “the exalted moral status which every being of human origin 
uniquely possesses. Human dignity is a given reality, intrinsic to human substance, and not 
contingent upon any functional capacities which vary in degree. (…) The possession of human 
 18 
dignity carries certain immutable moral obligations. These include, concerning the treatment of 
all other human beings, the duty to preserve life, liberty, and the security of persons, and 
concerning animals and nature, responsibilities of stewardship.” 
                          The introduction of new devices to go further above the natural capabilities of the 
human being brings lots of concerns to scientific community. Desires, challenges but also 
concerns are always present… What are the consequences? To human beings, to life it, to other 
living beings, to environment, to biodiversity, to progress, to the civilization as a whole... 
                            Which are the consequences about the limit for the human being as human? Are 
humans creating a new being? Are we prepared to get different, biologically and to become 
another thing? Are humans creating further ""nano-digital devices"" between humans that have 
access to these advanced technologies and humans that have not access? This discussion is 
recognized but probably the ethical discussion has not been enough promoted. 
                            In the long term, which are the consequences that nanotechnology has in the 
environment? It is possible to predict that less damage in nature can be done if nanomaterials are 
considered instead large equipments are used. Besides, once the need of inputs to produce these 
devices is lesser, probably there is an additional advantage on this perspective for nature 
preservation. But what is the reverse of the medal? 
                              Really, the implications and directions of nanotechnology need further 
discussion. The consequences of avoiding the discussion may be severe for public, considering 
rejection or fear of the effects. Is there a need for a regulatory authority? Which kind of 
mechanisms are needed to interfere in the nanotechnologies developments area? 
                             In truth, it may be possible in general to consider 5 topics for discussion (see 
Mnyusiwalla et al, 2003) about ethics in this subject. They are equity, privacy, security, 
environment and metaphysical when discussing the relationship human-machine. About each one 
of them some considerations may be made. So, assuming these topics, it may be said the 
following, without going until the limit of the analysis: 
                               - Equity: the classical problem of developed and developing countries may 
assure a new topic for discussion. In fact, technology and development are closely related. Some 
important subjects that developing countries are worried with are poverty reduction, the problems 
of energy, water and health and somehow biodiversity as well. Nanotechnology would help these 
 19 
countries to better conditions of population health and way of life. But it is costly to implement 
any project in this area and as often there are no financial resources to do that, consequently these 
countries will be the less benefited with these advances. The main problem happens with the 
access to the benefits of technology considering the poorest and the richest people in any country. 
Who may reach the advances of science and benefit from them? Anyway, it is true that poor, 
whatever they are, may benefit from these advances. It may depend on the will of politicians and 
on the investments of some of these countries, for example. A consequence would be lower needs 
for energy and a cleaner energy production as well as other environmental benefits, a safer drug 
delivery, the improvement on health through for example better prevention, diagnosis and 
treatment. 
                             - Privacy: at this level, it is possible to consider the enormous innovations 
which can be reached, by improving surveillance devices or other devices that restrict human 
privacy. An individual may be facing situations of “invisible” microphones and cameras. This is a 
real problem if privacy is intended to be assured. Wireless monitoring provides healthcare 
providers and patients to be mobile and being able to exchange data when needed. But there is the 
reverse of the medal: privacy violation? It is true that wireless communication and new 
physiological sensors bring enormous implications in e-health. One point needed is about the 
necessary discussion about privacy and security. 
                              - Security: certainly new powered weapons will be available very soon, as far 
as “invisible” microphones and cameras will be available. Will this ensure new ways of security 
or will be added to a potential “arsenal of bio-terrorism and techno-terrorism or even nano-
terrorism?” (see Mnyusiwalla et al, 2003). Mnyusiwalla et al, 2003 also ask “who will regulate 
the direction of research in defensive and offensive military NT [nanotechnology]? How much 
transparency will be necessary in government and private NT initiatives to avoid misuses? There 
are also very interesting legal questions involving monitoring, ownership, and control of invisible 
objects”. 
                               - Environment: new materials (fullerenes, carbon nanotubes) are now 
available. No one knows what will be the precise effects when this kind of nanomaterials goes 
into the environment (and also the effects to health). What are the dangers? Where are they put in 
the end of their mechanical lives? Will some medical devices be kept inside human body? What 
are the consequences? Or will be given another destiny to them? Is possible to predict any kind of 
effects caused to the environment? Jacobstein (2006) refers that it is important to make an 
 20 
analysis on the risks associated to passive compounds in the less than 100 nanometer size range. 
There is the possibility, for example, of being introduced inadvertently in human bodies. There is 
in fact the concern with their ability to be inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or to pass through 
biological compartment barriers such as the blood brain barrier. This kind of dangers pose a real 
range of potential health and environmental risks that are associated to their potential toxicity or 
mutagenicity in their interactions with biological systems. While the range of effects vary, most 
of the risks may be addressed by advanced industrial hygiene and environmental health practices 
and techniques that seek to characterize the specific risks, exposure patterns, and control methods 
and enforce them through a combination of practitioner education, industry self-regulation, 
monitoring and government regulation. This is an important emerging field in the environmental 
and health sciences, since most of the existing legislation on environmental, safety, and health 
risks may cover particulates, but do not take the change in physical and biological properties at 
the nanoscale into account. It is reasonable to assume that passive nanoscale particle risks, 
although potentially serious if not addressed, will be characterized and addressed systematically 
under new versions or extensions to existing occupational, industrial hygiene, environmental, and 
medical regulations. 
                         - Metaphysical: the incorporation of implants in human body, this is, the 
incorporation of artificial materials or machines into human systems may conduct to a concern 
around the human values and principles; will a human being be more than a human being? The 
borders are unknown. What kind of being and what kind of consequences. How this process may 
be controlled and accessed? One of the main issues is the ""autonomy"" of nano-bots, if they are 
able or not to move and to take decisions autonomously. Are they able to communicate each other 
and with the external environment? How can human beings ensure to ""retire"" them at the end of 
their ""missions""? This is a very demanding question. The modification made on human bodies 
and living systems may create new realities. This is already a very real concern on the society, 
being in general the society often very skeptic about developments in this area. Catherine Larrère, 
cited in Bensaude-Vincent (2010), discusses “the recent trends in nanoethics which anchor ethics 
in metaphysics or theology by emphasizing the emergence of new relations of men to nature and 
to God. It is defended that the moral issue raised by the project of enhancing human performances 
does not really lie in going beyond the boundary of human knowledge and condition. It is more a 
question of the moral choice underlying this new form of hubris”.  
                           Nano-bots, or in general the ""convergence"" of bio-nano-info-neuro technologies, 
requires a new contract between science and society; society should not be seen as an 
 21 
afterthought only for making technology assessments, for social acceptability, etc.. However, they 
should be really involved in the process; ""converging technologies"" - like syn-bio - should not be 
developed ""inside the walls"" of research labs only by highly specialized scientists, such 
challenges should be introduced requiring a cross-disciplinary approach, where project teams 
include anthropologists, sociologist, philosophers, and ethicists ... with a ""precautionary 
principle"" in mind... 
                              Researchers in ethicbots project in EU, which was finished in 2008,  worked in 
order to identify techno-ethical case-studies on the basis of a state-of-the-art survey in emerging 
technologies for the integration of human and artificial entities; to identify and analyze techno-
ethical issues concerned with the integration of human beings and artificial entities, by means of 
case-studies analysis; to establish a techno-ethically aware community of researchers, by 
promoting workshops, dissemination, training activities, as well as by the construction of an 
internet knowledge-base, on the subject of techno-ethical issues emerging from current 
investigations on the interaction between biological and artificial (software/hardware) entities; to 
generate inputs to EU for techno-ethical monitoring, warning, and opinion generation (see 
Capurro et al, 2005-2008). 
                           Rodotà & Capurro (2005) show the limitations on ICT implants in the human 
body as deriving from an analysis of the principles contained in various legal instruments. They 
say that they should be assessed further by having regard to general principles and rules 
concerning the autonomy of individuals, which takes the shape of freedom to choose how to use 
one’s body, “I am the ruler of my own body”, freedom of choice as regards one’s health, freedom 
from external controls and influence. 
 
                       CONCLUDING REMARKS 
                          The use of nanomaterials brought many benefits to mankind. Considering that 
nanotechnology is the ability to work at the atomic, molecular and supramolecular levels (on a 
scale of approximately 1 – 100 nm), the enormous possibilities to work nanomaterials can be 
easily understood. The creation and the use of these material structures, devices and systems with 
fundamentally new properties and functions result from their small structure, with applications in 
several areas, such as bioprocessing in industries; molecular medicine (considering physical, 
chemical, biological and medical techniques used to describe molecular structures and 
 22 
mechanisms, often referred as personalized medicine); analyzing the health effect of 
nanostructures in the environment; improving food and agricultural systems; or improving human 
performance at many fields, considering the different branches of science and the applications at 
many dimensions and scales. 
                                  Nanotechnology supplies the tools and the technology allowing that 
researches lead to the transformation of biological systems, as far as biology provides models and 
bio-assembled components to nanotechnology. 
                                 Nanoscales, used in biosystems, contribute to enhance very innovative and 
promising results in medical area. Improvements in the telemedicine and on health may be 
expected with new systems operation and new nanotechniques.  
                                However, ethical as far as legal and social implications are posed. This 
discussion is as old as the issue is itself but the boundaries are very large, large enough to find out 
the difficulties on finding definitive answers to this discussion.  
                                Ethical, legal and social implications in this context show the importance of 
nanotechnology to the society and the consequences that the development of nanotechnology will 
have to mankind in the future. 
                             The irreversibility and long-term impact of these new developments enforce to 
have on mind that it is necessary to take into account also the rights of future generations and the 
planet (like Hans Jonas' ""Principle of responsibility”). 
                              In fact, the future is there and came loudly. The innovations are going fast and 
although the endemic crisis, economic but also social and politic, will bring some restrictions to 
the investments in the area of health and research in many countries, new developments in this 
area will prevail and many discoveries will be made. Innovations are growing and development is 
there, as much as the will to go faster in many domains of scientific investigation. The research 
on this subject gets new results everyday and new challenges have to be faced. Some work is 
going on this way and it is intended, after the conclusion of this paper, to analyze some data in 
order to study the impact of the crisis on nanotechnology and on applications to medicine and 
industry. The crisis may bring some restrictions, but challenges have to be faced and a new 
beginning is there. Ethics concerning nanodevices and the borders of human beings considering 
nanotechnology in general and applied to medicine also need a new research to be developed 
 23 
next. This debate of the borders of the human being regarding the application of nanotechnology 
may be also enlarged in order to have a study of the impact into telemedicine and e-health.

Nanotechnology and the Gray Goo
Scenario: Narratives of Doom?

Introduction 
1 Researchers in science and technology often oppose science-fiction and science facts,
implying that science-fiction is only a figment of the novelist’s imagination and certainly
not part of “real science”. However, the inclusion of the word “science” in science-fiction
suggests otherwise (Thévenon, this volume). There seems to be widespread agreement
that  science-fiction  novels,  in  particular,  can  shed  light  on  the  future  societal
consequences  of  present  scientific  or  technological  choices,  for  example  the  rise  of
internet, linked to the power of big corporations (cyberpunk fiction) or the impact of
human activities  on finite  environmental  resources  (the  new wave).  The aim of  this
article is to address the question of whether science-fiction novels can be considered part
of scientific discourse, in the same way as popularized science and even research articles,
and whether the scenario concept, which is routinely used by big companies to adapt
their management policies to a range of future plausible situations, can shed light on the
scientific and political stakes linked to this question. To begin with, we set out to answer
these questions through the example of “gray goo” narratives in nanotechnology. We
first define nanotechnology as a specialized domain, scenarios as business tools and gray
goo  as  an  embodied  metaphor.  We  then  go  on  to  analyze  three  stages  in  gray  goo
narratives: a mere intimation in Drexler’s Engines of Creation (1986), a local outburst in
Crichton’s Prey (2002) and the end of the world as we know it in Bear’s Blood Music (1985).
Finally, we explore the functions of gray goo from environmental, political, and symbolic
points of view.

1. Terminology issues
2 In order to understand what is  at  stake behind gray goo narratives,  as well  as  their
relationship with specialized discourse, we first need to define the gray goo concept, both
in  reference  to  nanotechnology  and  from  the  point  of  view  of  its  economic  and
environmental impact, i.e. as a scenario for the future.
 
1.1 Nanotechnology: definition, main applications, stakeholders
3 Nanotechnology comes from the Greek νᾶνος, meaning “dwarf”, and concerns the study
and application of  the infinitely  small.  It  is  defined by the National  Nanotechnology
Initiative (NNI), a federal agency in charge of coordinating research and development
(R&D) in this field, as
the understanding and control of matter at dimensions between approximately 1
and  100  nanometers,  where  unique  phenomena  enable  novel  applications.
Encompassing  nanoscale  science,  engineering,  and  technology,  nanotechnology
involves imaging,  measuring,  modelling,  and manipulating matter at  this length
scale (NNI, 2010: 1).
4 This definition is based on a specific range of values (1 to 100 billionth of meters, the size
of  atoms  and  molecules),  highlighting  the  specificity  of  the  nanoscale,  where  the
influence of the laws of physics fades and quantum effects are felt more strongly. Colors
may change, as well as material properties. Nanogold, for example, becomes red. Carbon
nanotubes, made of the same carbon atoms as graphite—the material used in pencils—are
six times as strong as steel and can conduct electricity. 
5 The study of nanotechnology is not based on particular objects or methods, but on size
only  (the  scale  from 1  to  100 nanometers),  and  so  encompasses  most  scientific  and
technical fields at that scale, ranging from physics to chemistry, engineering, computer
science,  and  biotechnology.  Its  applications,  therefore,  range  across  many  fields,
including miniaturized computer chips,  new materials (such as carbon nanotubes),  or
nanovectors  able  to  carry  therapeutic  molecules  to  the  cells  they  are  targeting  in
medicine (NNI, 2013). 
6 Although the term “nanotechnology” was coined in Japan1 in 1974, the United States has
played an instrumental role in the development of this new domain since the beginning.
According to most historians of science, the birthplace of nanotechnology was in 1959 at
Caltech, with Feynman’s famous speech entitled “There’s plenty of space at the bottom”.
In this talk, he envisioned miniaturizing motors, computers, and even factories, down to
the molecular scale, or, conversely, manipulating atoms one by one. Almost thirty years
later,  the  term “nanotechnology”  was  popularized by Drexler  in  his  essay  Engines  of
Creation, the Coming Era of Nanotechnology (1986). Then, at the dawn of the new millennium,
President Clinton made nanotechnology a priority in federal research policy by launching
the NNI, a body in charge of coordinating all the research funded by federal agencies on
nanotechnology and promoting R&D in this domain.2
7 Because  of  its  wide  range  of  applications,  nanotechnology  involves  a  multiplicity  of
stakeholders  in  the  United  States.  Most  universities  and  federal  laboratories  have
research teams working at  the nanoscale,  mainly in the perspective of  technological
innovation. Academic communities have numerous links with industries, hospitals, and

businesses, with the aim to mass produce and commercialize the innovative products
they are inventing. They are often in touch with law firms to develop patents and deal
with unfair competition. The general public is also involved in nanotechnology issues:
tax-payers and electors have their word to say in the funding of research projects and the
purchase of the end-products, as nanoparticles and materials are now contained in a fair
number of everyday goods, from food to car tires or babies’ bottles.3 They may also have
legitimate questions about health and environment safety issues. Nanotechnology can
therefore also be understood in the framework of Latourian networks defined as blends
between nature and culture, linking science and society together (Latour, 1991). 
8 Nanosilver, and the debates its uses have sparked in the US, is a clear illustration of the
way this nanotechnology network works.  Nanosilver is  a biocide,  regularly used as a
disinfectant in dressings or antibacterial surfaces, but also sometimes found in clothes
and even babies’ bottles. The companies affiliated to the Silver Institute see no need for
recognizing nanosilver as a special  substance.  According to them, it  causes the same
environmental  problems  as  the  slightly  bigger  colloidal  silver  particles4 which  are
harmful for living organisms when they are released in the environment. However, the
International Center for Technology Assessment (ICTA) does not see things in the same
way  and  in 2007,  they  asked  the  Environment  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  to  classify
nanosilver as a pesticide on legal grounds: the patents filed for nanosilver are proof that
they have specific properties which may be harmful for the environment (Laurent, 2010:
95–100). 
9 The example of nanosilver clearly shows that the development of nanotechnology has
societal consequences which cannot be overlooked. Nanotoxicity is the most immediate
issue, but medium and long term stakes also involve threats to individual freedom, the
enhancement of humankind through nanoprostheses and the brain-computer interface,
or even the replacement of  human beings by (nano)robots.  Forecasting the future of
nanotechnology is a difficult task for several reasons: first, existing nanotoxicity surveys
sometimes yield conflicting results, and common procedures for assessing the toxicity of
nanoparticles  and  materials  are  still  in  the  process  of  being  developed,  so  the
precautionary principle is difficult to apply in this context. Secondly, the development of
nanotechnology in electronics and computer science is leading to the emergence of what
the mathematician John Von Neumann named “complex systems”,  i.e.  systems which
cannot  be  simplified.  One  of  the  main  characteristics  of  such  systems  is  that  their
evolution cannot be predicted before they are implemented (Dupuy, 2007). Finally, the
consequences of nanotechnology on human societies depend on people’s responses as
much as on science and engineering. The risk of nanodevices spying on our private lives
is linked to the question of whom the data thus gathered belong to and who has access to
them. It is therefore a political and legal problem as much as a technical one. In these
conditions, scenarios seem one of the most efficient ways of dealing with the threats
linked to nanotechnology and imagining the future in order to prevent the worst (idem). 
 
1.2 Scenarios 
10 The term scenario, originally a written summary of events and characters in a film, is also
used to depict a predictable sequence of events in the future. They are routinely used in
economics  and  finance.  Companies  and  businesses  use  scenarios  to  understand
uncertainties,  identify  factors  of  risk  and develop a  range of  strategies  dealing with
Nanotechnology and the Gray Goo Scenario: Narratives of Doom?

different situations. Scenarios have also been used in the field of nanotechnology. In 2006,
for  example,  the  Centre  for  Responsible  Nanotechnology  published NanoTomorrows,  a
series  of  “professional-quality  scenarios  of  a  near-future world in which exponential
general-purpose molecular manufacturing becomes a reality” (CRNano, 2006).
11 The usefulness of scenarios, however, should not hide the theoretical and practical limits
of  this  risk-management  tool.  Because  they  are  based  on  what  Dupuy  (2007)  calls
“occurring time” (there is  only one past  and present,  but  a  multiplicity  of  plausible
futures),  scenarios  cater  mostly  for  the plausible  trends of  the future.  As  such,  they
cannot adequately deal with “black swans” (Taleb, 2007), i.e. highly improbable events
which  cannot  be  predicted  and  yet  have  a  very  high  impact,  for  instance  9/11  or
Fukushima.  Science fiction novels  can act  as  a  useful  alternative  to  scenarios  in  the
perspective of black swans, because they are based on “projected time” rather than on
“occurring time” (Dupuy, 2007). From that point of view, the future (the science fiction
universe) is conditioned by the present (the work of fiction). However, writers have a
message to convey and hope that their readers will react to their visions of the future,
triggering societal changes (for the present in which they live). The examples of gray goo
analyzed in this article will be loosely called “scenarios”, first because it is the usual way
of referring to gray goo in the context of nanotechnology, and then on account of the
diversity of the situations described: they range from local outbursts of out-of-control
nanoparticles to global “ecophagy”, a term coined by nanoscientist Robert Freitas (2000),
to describe situations when whole ecosystems are consumed by nanorobots gone awry.
 
1.3 Gray goo 
12 The gray goo nightmare is a typical example of a black swan. Initially, an informal word
meaning a wet,  sticky and unpleasant substance, it refers to a dystopian narrative in
which  nanorobots  escape  from  their  laboratories  and  start  reproducing  in  an
uncontrollable  manner.  When  compared  to  its  Latin  synonym  “ecophagy”,  which
describes a state of the world, it clearly stands out as an embodied metaphor, a bodily
expression of disgust. Because gray goo refers to unknown substances entering human
bodies and destroying them, it  can also be interpreted as  a  figure of  abjectness,  the
mirror image of bodily fluids being disposed of in daily life (Kristeva, 1983; Milburn, 2008:
119–122).
13 The grounding of the gray goo scare in bodily experience, perceived through our five
senses,  allows  science  fiction  writers  to  portray  feelings  ranging  from  surprise  to
amazement and bewilderment,  from apprehension to fear and horror,  as we will  see
below. This strategy of persuasion through the depiction of affects, which has been the
hallmark of pathos since classical rhetoric, can be applied to a wide range of situations. In
this respect, science fiction fans have developed a rainbow typology of “goo” in which
colors  match  corresponding  functions  for  nanorobots.  Blue  goo  alludes  to  “police”
nanorobots, able to fight and defeat gray goo (that is,  if  they do not turn into rogue
elements…). Green goo refers to the ability to use DNA as a computer code and merge
nanotechnology with life sciences, thus leading to the possibility of hybrid genetically
modified organisms (GMOs) reproducing in an unpredictable way. Khaki or red goo point
to nanoweapons built  to destroy everything in the enemy’s territory (Phoenix,  2002).
These color variations on the gray goo theme have, of course, proved to be a source of

inspiration for nanotechnology theorists and fiction writers, as we will see in the second
part of this article.
 
2. Gray goo narratives as scenarios
14 Gray goo is a concept inspired by science fiction, such as, for instance Bear’s Blood Music
(1985), later popularized by Drexler in Engines of Creation (1986: 172–173) as a dystopic
narrative exemplifying the dangers of nanotechnology research. Subsequently, the
launching of the NNI prompted ethical concerns, voiced in fiction by Crichton’s best-
selling book Prey (2002). These three works of fiction have been essentially chosen on
grounds of their popularity and the related supposition that they thus echo certain public
preoccupations: Blood Music received both Nebula (1983) and Hugo (1984) awards for best
novelette,  before  being  expanded into  a  science  fiction book.  Engines  of  Creation was
translated into Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Spanish and Russian. Prey remained
15 weeks on the best-selling list of the New York Times in the autumn 2002, when it was
first published (Ball, 2003).
 
2.1 Projections for the future: Drexler’s Engines of Creation 
15 In Drexler’s  view,  the plausibility of  the gray goo scenario is  based on an encounter
between  bottom-up  manufacturing  and  human  error.  Whereas  traditional  top-down
manufacturing uses bulk material to produce objects, bottom-up manufacturing, on the
contrary, puts objects together, atom by atom, through the use of molecular assemblers.
In order to work fast enough, these nanorobots must be able to replicate themselves,
which induces exponential growth:
Imagine such a replicator floating in a bottle of chemicals, making copies of itself
[…].The  first  replicator  assembles  a  copy  in  one  thousand  seconds,  the  two
replicators assemble two more in the next one thousand seconds, the four build
another four and the eight build another eight. At the end of ten hours, there are […
]  over  68  billion.  In  […]  less  than two days,  they would outweigh the Earth;  in
another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the other planets
combined—if the bottle of chemicals hadn’t run dry long before (Drexler, 1986: 59). 
16 If  the assemblers  are  accidentally  or  purposely  designed to  feed on common carbon
atoms, they can potentially destroy all organic material, including all living organisms:
“Plants” with “leaves” no more efficient than today’s solar cells could out-compete
real plants,  crowding the biosphere with an inedible foliage. Tough, omnivorous
“bacteria” could out-compete real bacteria: they could spread like blowing pollen,
replicate swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to dust in a matter of days. […] Among
the cognoscenti of nanotechnology, this threat has become known as the gray goo
problem (idem: 172).
17 At the time he wrote Engines of Creation, Drexler therefore considered the gray goo theme
as a hypothetical “black swan” that nevertheless needed to be taken seriously because the
risks involved were so high: “The gray goo threat makes one thing perfectly clear: we
cannot afford certain kinds of accidents with replicating assemblers.” (idem: 173)
18 This narrative (which takes up only two pages of the book) was therefore mostly used as
an example of the possible dangers of nanotechnology. It clearly shows Drexler’s plea in
favor of assessing the benefits but also the hazards of molecular assembly and is followed
by various suggestions of  action plans for  prevention purposes (setting up “shields”,

using building material that cannot easily be found in nature, etc.).  From this ethical
viewpoint,  gray  goo  is  an argument  rather  than  a  story,  a  compelling  reason  for
exercising foresight rather than a narrative. However, Drexler himself was aware that
molecular assembly (and gray goo as its dark shadow) could also be used as a source of
inspiration for fiction, as he acknowledges in his blog:
Soon  after  the 1986  publication  of  Engines  of  Creation,  Stanley  Schmidt—the
influential editor of Analog Science Fiction and Fact Magazine—advised his stable of
writers to read the book and write about the ideas, which at the time constituted
the  working  definition  of  “nanotechnology”.  Quickly,  then,  advanced
nanotechnology came to be seen through the lens of fiction (2009: 3).
 
2.2 Wake-up call: Crichton’s Prey
19 One of the most popular novels portraying the world of nanotechnology is Prey (2002). In
his preface, Crichton, as a well-known novelist interested in the medical and high tech
fields, defines his purpose as the development of a fictitious scenario. He first reminds his
readers that evolution in nature is synonymous with constant interactions we cannot
fully understand, let alone master:
If we could comprehend the real meaning of evolution, then we would envision a
world in which every living plant, insect and animal species is changing at every
instant  […]  This  restless  and perpetual  change […]  implies  a  world in which all
human actions necessarily have uncertain effects (Crichton, 2002, ix–x).
20 Crichton then goes on to warn us that the nano-bio-info-cogno (NBIC) convergence will
lead to the development of self-replicating artificial entities: 
Sometime in  the  twenty-first  century,  our  self-deluded  recklessness  will  collide
with  our  growing  technological  power.  One area  where  this  will  occur  is  the
meeting-point of nanotechnology, biotechnology and computer technology. What
all three have in common is the ability to release self-replicating entities into the
environment (idem: xi).
21 Finally, he clearly refers to the encounter between these self-replicators and the natural
environment as the main thread of his scenario:
We may hope that by the time [artificial organisms] emerge, we will have settled
upon international controls for self-reproducing technologies. […] But of course it
is always possible that we will not establish controls. Or that someone will manage
to create artificial, self-reproducing organisms far sooner than anyone expected. If
so, it is difficult to anticipate what the consequences might be. That is the subject of
the present novel (idem: xv).
22 In  Prey,  Crichton’s  scenario  is  based on the  encounter  of  three  different  spaces:  the
Californian home of a couple with three children, in which the novel starts and ends
(exemplifying the possible implications of self-replicator mismanagement on society at
large); Silicon Valley offices (which symbolize corporate drive for profits at the expense
of  safety);  and,  finally,  an  R&D  laboratory  in  the  Nevada  desert  where  swarms
(nanoparticles acting together to solve problems, thanks to distributed intelligence) of
self-replicating nanorobots are being produced. These three spaces are blended together
through  the  narrator-hero,  Jack  Forman,  an  unemployed  Silicon  Valley  computer
scientist turned into a stay-at-home father and husband, who is suddenly called to the
Nevada laboratory for a job as a consultant. 
23 The plot focuses on the R&D facility in the middle of the desert where most of the action
takes  place,  and  which  is  designed  according  to  a  convergence  between  molecular

assembly,  biotechnology  and  computer  science.  The  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the
Nevada laboratory is made clear through the layout of technical equipment it contains:
what the narrator first sees as an octopus is in fact “a massively parallel assembly-line”
(Crichton, 2002: 181) using bacteria to produce precursor molecules before self-assembly
into nanorobots endowed with AI. Accordingly, the resident research team comprises not
only  computer  scientists  and  engineers,  but  also  a  field  biologist,  and  even  a  child
psychologist.
24 The development of the scenario is mostly guided by Crichton’s technical knowledge,
translated in the paratext as a five page bibliography. In the first part of the novel, the
plot is based on a genetic algorithm5 mimicking the behavior of predators with their prey.
In a case of  dramatic irony,  the narrator-hero has to fight swarms of nanorobots he
himself has contributed to producing since he is the creator of the PRED-PREY algorithm
they are modelled on. In the second part of the scenario, once the wild swarms have been
eradicated,  Crichton draws his  inspiration from cholera,  a  disease able to adapt  into
milder, non-lethal forms (Ewald, 1994; Crichton, 2002: 449–450), to invent a more benign
type of nanoswarms which invade human bodies and co-evolve with them symbiotically.
25 In Prey, the spread of the self-replicating nanoparticles is stopped by the narrator-hero,
Jack Forman, helped by the field biologist. Together they manage to blast all the wild
swarms  with  thermite  and  develop  a  virus  able  to  kill  the  bacteria  building  the
nanorobots. The narrator’s victory over gray goo is clear right from the beginning, since
the first and last pages of the book are devoted to the same night. Consequently, the
whole novel is built on a flashback effect, an internal analepsis—the interruption of a
chronological sequence of events by narration of earlier events—allowing the hero to
recall the main events of his last week: “Sitting here in the dark, it’s hard to believe that a
week ago my biggest problem was finding a job. It seems almost laughable now” (idem: 2).
The initial spread and final defeat of gray goo are also greatly enhanced by locating the
R&D lab in a desert, an environment where things can take place without any outside
witnesses.
26 Prey is therefore a novel in which suspense is skillfully interwoven with didactic segments
on  nanotechnological  developments  and  the  narrator’s comments  on  corporate
recklessness  to  voice  Crichton’s  ethical  concerns  about  techno  hazards.  Because  the
narrative remains within the bounds of a realistic fiction and makes no mention of gray
goo by name, the plot is restricted to the containment and defeat of nanotech hazards. In
order to go beyond these limits towards a full-scale scenario of ecophagy, we need to
move towards science fiction. 
 
2.3 Science fiction novels: Bear’s Blood Music
27 Bear’s Blood Music (1985), is the earliest published record of a whole-scale development of
gray goo in fiction. The “notes and acknowledgment” page following the novel clearly
presents it as a plausible “black swan”. Bear begins by thanking a handful of real life
researchers  for  their  help,  thus  anchoring  his  fiction  in  “real”  science:  “My sincere
appreciation  to  Andrew Edward  Dyson,  PhD.,  John  Graves,  PhD.,  Dr  Richard  Dutton,
Monte Wetzel, and Dr Percy Russell for access to their laboratories and their valuable
time and help” (idem: 288). He then proceeds to mix fact and fiction in his main character,
Virgil Ulam (a genetic engineer who injects lymphocytes turned into biocomputers into
his own blood, thus triggering a gray goo catastrophe) to jump into “real life”: “While

dropping by a San Diego convention on Hybridoma and Scale-Up research,  I  spotted
Vergil I. Ulam’s red Volvo sports car in the hotel parking lot. At the moment, he’s a young
graduate student looking for part-time employment.” (ibid.) Readers are thus invited to
interpret the whole novel as the narration of a plausible future of the world, in other
words, a scenario. This a posteriori interpretation has been carefully prepared, from the
prologue to the epilogue,  by infusing the overall  structure of  the plot with scientific
analogies and metaphors.
28 In  Blood  Music,  the  plot  is  structured by a  far-fetched analogy with the cell  division
process in biology due to different parts of the book being given the names of the various
stages of mitosis, a process where a single cell divides into two identical cells (Fries, 2011).
The prologue of the novel (idem.:  5), which draws the reader’s attention to “little live
things—microbes, bacteria, the peasants of nature” is called “interphase”, alluding to the
length of time elapsing between two successive cell divisions. First comes the prophase
(during which the cell membrane disappears and chromosomes start forming), which is
mirrored in the novel by the spread of the genetically modified cells inside Ulam’s body (
idem: 6–60). The next stage, the metaphase, refers to the time when all the chromosomes
line up in the equatorial plane of the cell, separating into similar halves. It corresponds to
the onset of the gray goo scare in the novel, when the cells turn into nanocomputers and
escape from bodily confinement to invade the whole of North America within a few days,
destroying all living organisms on the way. (idem:  61–128). Then comes the anaphase,
during which two equal groups of chromosomes separate and move toward the opposite
poles of the cell. This is echoed in the novel through the transformation of the American
continent by an entirely new civilization, in which the “noocytes’ (or cells of the mind)
enter ever more deeply into their molecular constituents and finally delve into quantum
mechanics (idem: 129–268). Finally, during the final telophase stage, when two complete
cells separate from each other, the noocytes spread to the whole of planet Earth and even
break free from the laws of physics (idem:  269–287). They then embark on a star trek
voyage within their Thought Universe, or “Noosphere”, leaving behind them an empty
planet Earth and reshaping the universe on their way:
The Earth, for the space of a long, trembling sigh, held together in the maelstrom.
When its time came, the cities, towns and villages—the homes and huts and tents—
were as empty as shed cocoons. The Noosphere shook loose its wings. When the
wings touched, the stars themselves danced, celebrated, became burning flakes of
snow (idem: 284).
29 This unlikely analogy between mitosis and the formation of the Noosphere, which guides
the development of  the plot,  seems far removed from the current state-of-the-art  in
science and technology. In Blood Music, however, its plausibility is strengthened by the use
of  theory-constitutive  metaphors  (Boyd,  1993;  Resche,  2012),  in  particular  DNA  as  a
computer or linguistic code (Temmerman, 2000; Nehrlich & Dingwall, 2003; Fries, 2016).
The genetically modified lymphocytes have initially been endowed with computer-like
capabilities. This appears as plausible because genes are only part of the DNA, so that the
remaining sequences (sometimes called “junk DNA”) could be altered by Ulam and used
as a computer code, without bringing any changes to the genetic material of the cells. The
lymphocytes were thus endowed with AI so that “they would continue learning, adding
new segments to the revised portions of their DNA” (Bear, 1985: 17). This provides an
essential clue to the plausibility of gray goo, because it explains how information stored
in lymphocytes could spread to other kinds of human cells, all prokaryotic cells, and even
simple  eukaryotic  cells  such  as  bacteria.  In  Blood  Music,  however,  DNA  is  mostly

considered as a linguistic code.  This metaphor,  which can be inferred from standard
biological terms such as DNA TRANSCRIPTION into RNA , or RNA TRANSLATION into PROTEINS ,
also allows Bear to imagine that noocytes are able to communicate with human beings in
simple, but very comprehensible English, generally to gather more information on the
human  world.  The  noocytes  are  also  willing,  occasionally,  to  answer  human  beings’
questions about the way they are organized and function, which gives the readers an
insider’s view of the Noosphere.
30 Blood Music ultimately gives a full scale account of gray goo, leading to the creation of a
brand-new Universe.  It  is also a good example of cyberpunk science fiction,  which is
situated in  the present  or  the  near  future,  and where the novum (the extraordinary
invention which makes the science fiction world possible) is inspired by the current state-
of-the-art  in  science  and  technology,  including  theory-constitutive  metaphors.  This
skillful blend between realism and imagination infuses the novel with the flavor of a
parable. 
 
3. Functions of the gray goo threat
31 On the whole, gray goo, whether only sketched in speculative writing on science and
technology, or more developed in fiction, appears as a scare scenario used to voice ethical
questions about the thoughtless development of emerging technologies. These concerns
can be divided into three main areas: health and environmental issues, economic and
political stakes, and gender-related questions.
 
3.1 Environmental wake-up call: use of the gray goo scare by
environmentalists 
32 Only a few months after the publication of Prey, a report entitled From Genomes to Atoms:
The Big Down; Atomtech: Technologies Converging at the Nanoscale was released by ETC (Action
group  on  Erosion,  Technology  and  Concentration),  a  Canadian  watchdog  organization.
Following Drexler’s scenario and Crichton’s lead, this report presents gray goo as a major
environmental hazard:
What  if  nanobots  start  building  chairs  and don’t  stop?  The  self-replicating  and
assembly processes could go haywire until the world is annihilated by nanobots or
their products. Gray goo refers to the obliteration of life that could result from the
accidental and uncontrollable spread of self-replicating assemblers (ETC, 2003: 30).
33 In order to bring this point home, ETC uses the three types of argument outlined in
classical rhetoric: ethos, logos, and pathos. The appeal to pathos and emotions can be seen
in the fact that they use both colors and cultural references in their typology of “goo”
(ETC, 2003: 35). Gray goo is aptly named a “sorcerer’s apprentice” scenario, in reference
to Goethe’s ballad, which later inspired Dukas’s music (1894) and the Disney film Fantasia
(1940 & 2000) in which a young lad uses one of his absent master’s spells to bring a broom
to life and orders it to fill a cauldron with water for him, but then finds himself unable to
stop the broom… “Blue goo” (the color of police uniforms), alludes to the rising power of
AI to the point that they could control the Earth: “super machines evolve to manage
complex human and environmental systems and (eventually) either take over the world
or fall into the hands of an omnipotent corporate elite” (ibid.). This is named the “Brave
New World” scenario in reference to Aldous Huxley’s  novel  (1932),  depicting a  caste
Nanotechnology and the Gray Goo Scenario: Narratives of Doom?

society in which most of humanity has become enslaved to a ruling elite. Finally, “green
goo”  refers  to  the  Earth’s  invasion  by  genetically-engineered  bacteria conceived  as
nanomachines: “Scientists combine biological organisms and mechanical machines for
industrial uses […] the emboldened bacteriophage becomes the omniphage.” (ibid.) This
last  scenario is  called “Toys’r  us”,  the name of  well-known chain of  toy stores,  thus
implying that scientists are “playing” at the nanoscale and will no more be able to control
the  possible  consequences  of  their  “games”  on  the  environment  than the  sorcerer’s
apprentice.
34 However, a quick look at the contents of the The Big Down report shows that the three-goo
theory could easily be interpreted as part of logos as well as pathos. It comes as the end
point of a four step process: first, nanoparticles, followed by the self-assembly of atoms
and molecules into supra-molecular forms; then molecular manufacturing (from single
atoms to whole objects); and finally, the convergence of biology and material sciences at
the nanoscale, leading to the “goo” scenarios (ETC, 2003: 20-37). This logical sequencing
makes gray goo look inescapable, all the more so as it is framed in a larger historical
perspective, in which, from the Renaissance onwards, technological progress has fostered
inequality: 
Economists see technological advancement to be the rising tide allowing benefits
and abundance to “trickle down” from those first enriched eventually to all. History
suggests  otherwise.  From  Europe’s  Renaissance  to  America’s  “IT”  revolution,
humanity has been marched through a succession of industrial revolutions that—in
their early generations—have further dis-empowered and disabled marginal groups
(idem: 9).
35 ETC systematically refer to history in their report in order to give weight to their analysis
of the risks linked to nanotechnology in view of past precedents, thus creating a public
image of reliability and seriousness. This ethos-forming effort is also apparent through
the numerous endnotes.  The bibliographical  references they contain refer to a broad
range of writers, including key nanotechnologists such as Feynman, Drexler, and Smalley.
The Big Down ends with references to useful internet sites and a glossary. In the light of
this well-documented work, the gray goo threat appears more plausible and serious, thus
adding weight to ETC’s call for a moratorium: 
Given the concerns raised over  nanoparticle  contamination in living organisms,
ETC  Group  proposes  that  governments  declare  an  immediate  moratorium  on
commercial  production  of  new  nanomaterials  and  launch  a  transparent  global
process for evaluating the socioeconomic, health and environmental implications of
the technology (idem: 72).
36 For Crichton as well  as  the ETC group,  the gray goo scare seems therefore to be an
extreme example of a heedless development of molecular assembly. Prey and The Big Down
are proof that, thanks to its vivid imagery, blended with a linear conception of scientific
“progress”, and to the support of pioneer figures such as Drexler,  gray goo has been
successfully used by environmentally-sensitive stakeholders to attract public attention to
the risks and hazards linked to nanotechnology.6 
 
3.2 Scarecrow syndrome: economic and political stakes
37 From an economic  point  of  view,  nanotechnology holds  the promise  of  innumerable
benefits,  especially  in terms of  creating both start-ups and jobs,  increasing company

10
profits,  and maintaining the US technological  edge. In a first  report on the NNI,  the
National Research Council stated that:
With  potential  applications  in  virtually  every  existing  industry  and  new
applications  yet  to  be discovered,  there is  no doubt  that  nanoscale  science and
technology will  emerge as  an important  driver  of  economic growth in  the first
years of the new millennium (NRC, 2002: 23).
38 The threat of a moratorium, therefore, needed to be taken seriously. Molecular assembly,
and the gray goo scare it could lead to, were quickly identified by business and scientific
circles alike as the main cause of this threat, and it became urgent to separate current
research  on  nanoparticles  and  nanosystems  from  “revolutionary”  nanotechnology.
Leading nanoscientists  vehemently  questioned the feasibility  of  gray goo in  an open
public  debate  (Smalley,  2001:  76–77;  Whitesides,  2001:  78–83).  Lobbies  such  as  the
NanoBusiness Alliance succeeded in excluding molecular manufacturing from funding in
the 2003  Twenty-First  Century  Nanotechnology  Research  and  Development  Act,  ostensibly
because “There was no interest in the legitimate scientific community—and ultimately
Congress—for playing with Drexler’s futuristic sci-fi notions” (Mark Modzelewski of the
NanoBusiness Alliance, quoted in Rawstern, 2003). In response to these attacks, Drexler
officially denied any usefulness to the gray goo concept in Nanotechnology journal:
Nanotechnology-based fabrication can be thoroughly non-biological and inherently
safe: such systems need have no ability to move about, use natural resources, or
undergo  incremental  mutation.  Moreover,  self-replication  is  unnecessary:  the
development  and  use  of  highly  productive  systems  of  nanomachinery
(nanofactories) need not involve the construction of autonomous self-replicating
nanomachines (Phoenix & Drexler, 2004: 869).
39 In spite of this refutation, a “nanotechnology and gray goo” query on the Google search
engine shows that a number of academic sites continued to refer to gray goo even after
Drexler’s  dismissal  of  the  concept  in 2004  (Fries,  2016:  153–159).  Rice  University,  for
instance, has included gray goo in its early history of nanotechnology, explaining both
Drexler’s scenario and later criticism by Smalley:
Primarily,  Drexler  warns  of  the  gray  goo,  an  amalgamation  of  self-replicating
nanobots that would consume everything in the universe in order to survive. […]
Some scientists have criticized Drexler’s visions as impossible and harmful. Richard
Smalley  has  led this  movement  against  Drexler’s  almost  sensationalist  vision of
molecular manufacturing. […] Furthermore, he also chastises Drexler for his gray
goo scenario, saying, “you and the people around you have scared our children”
(Fanfair, Desai & Kelty, 2005).
40 The persistent  thrashing  of  gray  goo in  academic  circles  even after  Drexler’s  public
change of opinion in 2004 begs the question of why this dead horse should be flogged.
From a rhetorical point of view, Milburn suggests that gray goo may have been used as a
prototypical  process,  highlighting  and  subsuming  all  the  risks  linked  with
nanotechnology, in other words, a metonymy for nanohazards (2008: 114–129). Exposing
gray  goo as  unrealistic  fiction allowed nanoscientists  to  set  aside  public  fears  about
nanotechnology,  and thus proceed with their research undisturbed.  A clear sign that
Milburn’s analysis may well be right is that Drexler himself paid a high price for his
popularization  of  gray  goo.  He  found himself  evicted  from the  “legitimate  scientific
community” and the more he protested, the more he was ostracized. He eventually had to
leave the Foresight Institute he had co-founded and move to Oxford due to the position of
scapegoat he found himself in:
Nanotechnology and the Gray Goo Scenario: Narratives of Doom?
ILCEA, 31 | 2018
11
Sacrificing Drexler prevents disintegration of the legitimate scientific community
over issues of molecular self-assembly and self-replication; it localizes any larger
problem of nanodanger to the fantasies of one man and enables the social field to
come together  and  pretend  as  if  there  were  no  uncertainty  as  to  its  ability  to
ultimately control matter (Milburn, 2008: 125).
41 It therefore looks as if gray goo itself played the part of a scapegoat in the first years of
the NNI, allowing scientific, business and political circles to condensate all the hazards
linked to nanotechnology into this scare scenario. Thereafter it was a relatively easy task
to  expose  it  as  mere  fiction,  and  so  down-play  all  the  other  risks  linked  to
nanotechnology,  thus  persuading  the  public  that  leaving  nanorisk  assessment  to
academic experts was far more preferable. This can explain why environmental watchdog
organizations were not the only stakeholders involved in referring to gray goo and how
this scare scenario spread from environmental concerns to economic and political issues.
It  does not account,  however for the reason why the gray goo concept caught on so
quickly, a question we address by delving into the highly metaphoric nature of gray goo
and its symbolic character.
 
3.3 Gray goo as the reverse of mastery: gender imbued symbolism
42 Drexler’s grand design of molecular manufacturing, bringing peace, economic prosperity
and, ultimately, immortality, is founded on the ability to manipulate Nature at the atomic
and molecular level. In other words, he presents nanotechnologists as master-builders:
“Because assemblers will let us place atoms in almost any reasonable arrangement […],
they will let us build almost anything that the laws of Nature allow to exist” (1986: 14).
This  can be interpreted as  a  demiurgic  posture on the part  of  nanotechnologists,  as
Bensaude-Vincent has pointed out: “the artisan, like Plato’s demiurgos, builds up a world
by imposing his own rules and rationality on a passive matter. Technology is a matter of
control.” (2004: 78) 
43 In contrast, gray goo appears as a total lack of control, the ultimate failure of mastery.
For Milburn (2008), this dichotomy is deeply rooted in gender differences. He sees the
ability to move atoms one by one thanks to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope as
linked to a symbolic patriarchal phallus,  and “goo” as the wet fertility of a woman’s
womb.  The main characters  in Prey embody this  perception.  The hero-narrator,  who
finally manages to destroy all the nanoswarms, sums up this mission in terms of his own
name: Jack Forman, i.e., literally, for man. His wife Julia, on the other hand, is doubly
responsible for the onset of the gray goo threat:  as company Vice-President, she was
originally  responsible  for  setting the nanoswarms free in the wild.  She subsequently
tames one of them, ending up in a monstrously symbiotic relationship with nanoparticles
in turn colonizing her.
44 Crichton’s patriarchal interpretation of “goo” in Prey looks very different from Bear’s
postmodernist version. In Blood Music, the noocytes create an entirely new civilization,
tinted with what could look like stereotypical feminine values: collaboration supersedes
competition, all  personal memories are encoded and preserved before bodies collapse
into puddles  of  goo,  and a  myriad of  possible  new choices  become possible  in post-
biological life, as one of the characters discovers in a conversation with the noocytes: 
— I have lost far too many illusions.
What would you wish to revise There are options.
— I don’t understand.
Nanotechnology and the Gray Goo Scenario: Narratives of Doom?
ILCEA, 31 | 2018
12
?
— If you mean go back, I don’t see how.
It is all possible here, in the Thought Universe. Simulations. Reconstructions
from your memory.
— I could live out another life?
When there is time.
(Bear, 1985: 242)
45 The end of the novel is reminiscent of spiritual overtones.  The Thought Universe,  or
Noosphere,  is  a  concept  inspired  from  Teilhard  de  Chardin,  a  French  scientist  and
philosopher.  Another  such  reference  concerns  the  burning  flakes  announcing  the
takeover of planet Earth by the noocytes falling inside a wardrobe, an open allusion to
C.S. Lewis’s Narnia stories (idem, 282). Finally, the epilogue is entitled “Interphase”, just as
the prologue, implying that the departure of the Noosphere from planet Earth is a pause
before a new beginning, rather than an ending of the world as we know it.
46 This cursory analysis of the symbolic value of gray goo in Prey and Blood Music clearly
shows that it is linked to philosophical, as well as environmental and political questions.
Even if most academic and business circles seem to have dropped their scapegoat strategy
by now, the gray goo scenario remains an effective way of denouncing human hubris with
respect to mastering Nature. 
 
Conclusion 
47 To conclude, we would like to sum up the initial question underlying our research on the
relationship between scientific discourse and science-fiction. The analysis of gray goo
narratives has shown that scenarios bridge the gap between societal  issues linked to
science and technology, on the one hand, and science-fiction on the other, as they open
the door  to  prospective  thinking on emerging science and innovations.  In  Engines  of
Creation, gray goo is sketched as a “black swan”, a low-probability but high-impact event
—e.g.  a  reactor  melt  down  in  a  nuclear  power  station—that  calls  for  preemption
measures. In Prey, the gray goo narrative is embodied in human characters and cultures,
as  well  as  inspired  by  specialized  content.  It  exemplifies  Crichton’s  message  that
emerging  technology  trends  should  be  more  closely  monitored  in  order  to  prevent
possible  risks,  but  evokes  no  real  protection  other  than  human  integrity  and
resourcefulness. In Blood Music, Bear imagines what the full-scale impact of gray goo could
be like through the depiction of  an entirely new civilization.  However,  he makes no
mention of  prevention since one of  the main points  of  his  narrative  is  to  show the
Noosphere as better than our current world, barely masking a parable for our hic et nunc.
These three science fiction novels can therefore, to varying degrees, be considered as
scenarios exploring the future development of emerging techniques and their societal
consequences, providing evidence that if fictional narratives on emerging technologies
are peripheral, they are nevertheless a vital part of scientific discourse since they allow
us to explore the societal consequences of possible technological choices, 
48 Moreover, the various links created between specialized discourse and its “beyond” offer
insights  into  the  ambiguous  relationship  between  science  and  science  fiction.
Nanotechnologists,  the  same  as  other  researchers  in  emerging  fields,  need  official
recognition  both  in  terms  of  publications  in  specialized  journals  as  well  as  jobs  in
academic institutions. In order to reach those aims, they have to keep science fiction at

bay, dismissing both Drexler’s molecular assemblers and the gray goo threat as figments
of imagination. At the same time, they still need to refer to “revolutionary” molecular
nanotechnology to gain funding for their experiments, as stain-free glass and transparent
sunscreens are hardly as likely to attract the same attention as the prospect of mastery at
the  nanoscale.  In  this  respect,  gray  goo,  through  the  symbolic,  environmental,  and
political roles it plays in society, is not so much a narrative of doom as a catalyzer of
ambiguity.

development of emerging techniques and its consequences for society, while at the same time
highlighting  the  ambiguous  relationship  between  science  and  science  fiction  in  innovative
technologies.

ABSTRACT 
Nanotechnology  represents  a  new  frontier  in  food  science  with  a  great  potential  for many  food  sectors.  Several 
studies have examined public’s benefits  and  risks perception of nanotechnology, but  the  literature on  the  factors 
influencing the public’s attitudes toward nanotechnology is rather limited. We investigate the willingness to buy for 
nanotechnology  foods,  and  the  role  of  risks  and  benefits  perceptions.  We  use  a  structured  questionnaire  was 
submitted  to  consumers  and  Principal  Component  Analysis,  followed  by  Structural  Equation  Model,  were 
performed. We estimate  the consumer willing  to buy nanotechnology  food  for    four nanotechnology applications, 
and conclude on a positive role of trust in institutions on willingness to buy food with nanotech applications, and on 
the  (relatively  lower)  importance  on  consumers'  attitudes  toward  health  and  innovations.  Policy  implications  are 
also provided.

1  Introduction 
Innovations in the food industry are numerous, and growing in number, and the development and application of 
agrifood  technologies  play  a  key  role  to  foster  a  sustainable  growth of  agricultural  production  (Frewer,  2017). 
Among  them,  nanotechnology  represents  a  new  frontier  in  food  science with  a  great  potential  for many  food 
sectors.  For  instance,  nanotechnology  may  help  improving  sensory  characteristics,  health  and  food  safety 
(Graveland‐Bikker and de Kruif 2006; Takhistov, and McClemeents 2006). Due to the novelty of the introduction 
of nanotechnology in the food industry, few studies have analyzed the interaction between this new technology 
with human population and the environment. In particular, the potential hazards of nanotechnology applications 
are quite unknown, and the benefits that may be provided are not sufficiently understood. A number of studies 
have  examined,  or  reported,the  public’s  benefits  and  risks  perceptions  of  nanotechnology  as  well  as  public 
attitudes  toward nanotechnology  in  the US and  in  Europe  (e.g.,  Bainbridge,  2002; Cobb and Macoubrie,  2004; 
Gaskell et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Scheufele and Lewenstein, 2005; Nerlich et al., 2007; Kjølberg, 2009; Frewer 
et al., 2014; Giles et al., 2015; Santeramo et al., 2018). Recent studies are worth mention. In particular, Souza et 
al.  (2016)  reviewed  applications  of  nanoparticles  in  food  packaging  and  emphasized  the  great  potential  of 
nanotechnologies to  improve food packaging, and the absolute necessity to  increase the research on this  field. 
Moreover,  O’Callaghan  et  al.  (2016)  analyzed  consumers  attitudes  toward  smart  packaging  that  include 
nanotechnologies: they found a positive attitude toward the use of nanotechnology to extend the shelf life, but 
argue that a  large heterogeneity  in consumers’ attitude  is due to the type of technology adopted. Such a  large 
heterogeneity calls for further research.  
Limited research has been conducted on consumer’s attitudes in Italy and limited knowledge exist on the factors 
influencing  the  public’s  attitudes  toward  nanotechnology.  In  addition,  the  vast  majority  of  studies  has 
investigated  the  differences  of  consumers’  attitudes  toward  two  different  types  of  innovations:  outside  and 
inside nanotechnologies  applications  (Santeramo,  2018). Most  of  potential  nanotechnology  applications  in  the 
food  sector  are  still  at  the  early  stage  of  product  development,  and  only  a  limited  number  of  “nano‐outside” 
applications  are  already  commercially  available  in  some  countries  (Handford  et  al.,  2014;  Ranjan  et  al.,  2014; 
Pathakoti  et  al.,  2017;  Basu  et  al.,  2017),  even  though  it  is  really  difficult  to  make  a  complete  inventory  of 
nanotechnology food applications already commercialized in the global market. 
Given  the  scant  attention  that  has  been  devoted  to  analyzing  consumers’  attitudes  toward  nano‐inside 
applications, our research is specifically focused on these aspects. In particular, we investigate the willingness to 
buy  for  nanotechnology  foods,  and  analyze  how  perceived  risks  and  perceived  benefits  influence  stated 
preferences  for  different  nanotech  products.  Our  contribution  is  twofold:  we  deepen  on  four  “inside” 
nanotechnology  applications  in  the  food  sector  and  conclude  on  a  positive  role  of  trust  in  institutions  on 
willingness  to  buy  food  with  nanotech  applications,  and  on  the  (relatively  lower)  importance  on  consumers' 
attitudes toward health and innovations; furthermore we deepen on implications for policymakers.  
Increasing consumers'  awareness of  the benefits and of  risks  in applying nanotechnology  is an  important goal. 
Communicating  in the right way the potential risks, and thus avoid exacerbating the perceptions of risks  is also 
very important. Regulations, public education and a clear communication program should be strengthened.  
2  Nanotechnologies in the food industry: an overview of current knowledge 
Nanotechnology is one of the most promising advancement in food science and technology with the potential to 
drive the future development of the global food sector (Casolani et al., 2015; Santeramo et al., 2018; Sodano et 
al.,  2016a.  2016b). Nanotechnology  focuses on  the use of  engineered materials  and  structures with nanoscale 
dimensions, usually in the range of 1‐100 nanometres (one‐billionth of a metre). This small size, in combination 
with  the  chemical  composition  and  surface  structure,  gives  engineered  nanoparticles  its  unique  features  and 
makes  them  suitable  for  many  applications.  In  particular,  a  number  of  engineered  nanoparticles  have  been 
already developed  for a  variety of applications  in  the  food sector and  they are expected  to provide a  range of 
important benefits including sensory improvements, increased absorption of nutrients, stabilization of bioactive 
compounds,  extended  product  shelf‐life,  quality  and  safety monitoring(Dasgupta  et  al.,  2015;  Handford  et  al., 
2014;  Pathakoti  et  al.,  2017;  Ranjan  et  al.,  2014;  Rossi  et  al.,  2014).  Two main  types  of  nanotechnology  food 
applications  are  distinguished:  “nano‐inside”  applications  when  nanoparticles  are  incorporated  into  the  food 
product, and “nano‐outside” applications when nanoparticles are  incorporated  into  the  food contact materials 
like packaging (Handford et al., 2014; Pathakoti et al., 2017). 
The most  important  factor  that  limits  the  diffusion  of  nanotechnology  applications  in  the  food market  is  the 
relatively  limited  knowledge  of  the  potential  risks  for  human  health  and  environment.  More  precisely,  while 
toxicology studies are providing increasing evidence that engineered nanoparticles may have adverse effects on 
human healthand environment (He et al., 2014; León‐Silva et al., 2016; McShan et al., 2014; Nikodinovska et al., 
2015),  the  knowledge  on  the  implications  for  humans  and  the  environment  due  to  repeated  exposure  to 
Rosaria Viscecchia et al. / Int. J. Food System Dynamics 9 (4), 2018, 321‐330 
323 
engineered nanoparticles is still limited (Pathakoti et al., 2017; Ranjan et al., 2014). In addition, because toxicity 
is specific for different nanoparticles, a safety and environmental assessment must be performed on a case‐by‐
case  basis  (Handford  et  al.,  2014).  Recent  evidence  do  not  allow  to  build  a  sound  science‐based  regulatory 
framework, and  thus  there are  currently no  specific  regulations on nanotechnology  food applications either  in 
EU, USA  or  elsewhere  (Coles &  Frewer;  2013; Magnuson  et  al.,  2013).  In  addition,  there  is  a  lack  of  universal 
guidelines  specifically  developed  for  the  safety  and  environmental  assessment  of  nanotechnology  food 
applications, even thoughexperts from around the globe are working in bringing an international dimension and 
harmonization  to  “nanometrology”  and  standardization  of  approaches  (Magnuson  et  al.,  2013;  Schoonjans  & 
Chaudhry,  2017).  However,  the  current  lack  of  a  clear  governance  framework  and  consequent  regulatory 
uncertainty  makes  it  difficult  for  developers  and  manufacturers  to  know  what,  if  any,  regulations  should  be 
complied with, and what risk assessments, if any, are appropriate. 
Another  potential  barrier  to  the  commercialization  of  food  nanotechnology  products  is  related  to  public 
concerns  about  the  use  of  such  novel  and  unfamiliar  technology  with  consequent  uncertainty  of  consumers’ 
acceptance.  Several  studies  have  been  carried  out  in  different  countries  (Bieberstein  et  al.,  2013;  Chen  et  al., 
2013; Cook & Fairweather, 2007; Farshchi et al., 2011; Matin et al., 2012; Schnettler et al., 2013; Stampfli et al., 
2010) to investigate public awareness and attitude toward food nanotechnologies. Results of these studies show 
that  public  knowledge  on  food  nanotechnology  is  quite  limited,  and  attitude  varies  across  individuals.  As 
expected,  the  attitudes  towards  nanotechnology  food  applications  are  influenced  by  the  associated  perceived 
benefits and perceived risks (Chen et al., 2013; Siegrist et al., 2008; Stampfli et al., 2010). Consumers’ perception 
of  risks  and  benefits  is,  in  turn,  mainly  determined  by  the  general  attitude  toward  new  technologies 
(neophobia/neophilia), nanotechnology knowledge, and social  trust  (i.e.  trust  in scientists,  regulatory agencies, 
food  industry  and  retail)  (Chen  et  al.,  2013;  Cook  and  Fairweather,  2007;  Matin  et  al.,  2012;  Stampfli  et  al., 
2010). Specifically, positive attitude toward new technology  (neophilia), deep knowledge on nanotechnologies, 
and higher social trust tend to increase consumers’ perceived benefits and to reduce consumers’ perceived risks 
of nanotechnology applications. Finally, consumers’ acceptance of food nanotechnologies varies across different 
applications: it tends to be greater for “nano‐outside” applications as that the lack of ingestion is perceived as a 
minor exposure to potential hazards (Siegrist et al., 2008; Stampfli et al., 2010). 
The successful introduction of nanotechnology applications into the food market is strictly related, on one hand, 
to the graduality of the process that should follow the advancement of toxicology research and the consequent 
construction of  a  sound  science‐based  regulatory  framework,  and, on  the other hand,  to  the  increasing public 
knowledge, the awareness and the trust.All these aspects must be bear  in mind in order to avoid the excess of 
precaution  that  has  severely  limited  the  introduction  and  diffusion  of GMOs  in  Europe  (Lofstedt,  2014;  Tosun 
and  Shikano,  2016).  In  particular,  it  is  necessary  to  deepen  the  understanding  of  objective  risks  and  objective 
benefits derived from the introduction of nanotechnologies applications in the food industry. On the other hand, 
a careful comprehension of beliefs and subjective perceptions is a crucial step in order to guide the development 
of such an infant (fastly‐growing) technology. We pose specific questions: to what extent consumers’ perceived 
benefits  and  perceived  risks  influence  their  willingness  to  buy?  How  perceptions  are  influenced  by  general 
attitudes? Our research speaks in this direction and provides concrete answers to the above raised questions.  
3  Materials and methods 
3.1   Data 
In  order  to  understand  how  consumers’  willingness  to  buy  foods  with  nanotechnologies  applications  is 
influenced by individuals’ attitudes, we collected a rich set of information. The survey has involved a large set of 
respondents  in  order  to  cover  the  entire  Italian  territory:  the  size  of  the  survey  allows  us  to  rely  on  a 
representative sample and conclude on the willingness to buy food with nanotech applications. 
Data  have  been  collected  through  a  1033  questionnaire  administered  in May  and  June  2015  to more  the  one 
thousand potential consumers. The investigation has been designed so to understand the attitudes toward new 
technologies applied to food production, the general attention to health in food choices, the perception of risks 
and benefits and the willingness to buy food products that include nanotechnologies and, more specifically, that 
include  nano‐nutrients,  nano‐ingredients,  nutraceutical  nano‐ingredients  and  nano‐protectors.  In  addition,  the 
questionnaire  includes  questions  on  trust  in  institutions  and  socio‐demographic  characteristics.  Descriptive 
statistics of the sample are provided in table 1. In addition, we show statistics (averages) on perceived benefits, 
perceived risks and willingness to buy in table 2.

3.2  Survey design 
Participants  received  some  general  information  (as  specified  in  the  present  section)  about  nanotechnology  as 
well as specific information about four different food applications. In fact, prior collection of questionnaires, we 
informed respondents that nanotechnologies  involve the production and application of microscopic particles of 
variable  size  ranging  between  1  and  100  nanometers1.  Furthermore,  we  informed  potential  respondents  that 
nanotechnology  applications  are  of  great  interest  and  that  numerous  applications  have  been  already 
                                                 
1It is worth recalling that 1 nanometer is 1 millionth of a meter, or one thousandth of a millimeter.

implemented  in  different  fields. We  argued  that  the  potential  applications  of  nanotechnology  involve  various 
industries  including  electronics,  the  pharmaceutical,  cosmetic,  food  and  agriculture.  Despite  the  increasing 
expansion of this innovative technologies and the wide range of applications to the food sector, we are far from 
reaching a consensus on the possible health risks related to the consumption of food products that incorporates 
nano‐particles.  Their  attitudes  toward  innovation, health  and  institutionshave been measured using a 7‐points 
Likert scale. As already described, we focus on different innovations due to the use of nanotechnologies: nano‐
nutrients,  nano‐ingredients,  nutraceutical  nano‐ingredients  and  nano‐protectors.  As  for  the  first  category  we 
need  to  point  that  some  nanotechnology  offers  the  possibility  to  artificially  synthesize  proteins,  vitamins  and 
other nutrients in forms that are more easily assimilated by the body and that are more stable to common food 
treatments (e.g. cooking or storage). Using these enriched foods  it  is possible to easily satisfy the requirements 
of a balanced diet (without the need of varying the diet and consuming unwelcome foods, as well as expensive in 
order to acquire specific nutrients).  
The nano‐ingredients (artificially synthesized) are added to foods in order to confer particular flavors to the food 
product or to give a particular consistency. An example is the addition of ingredients to get creamy ice cream or 
warm cookies without using fats or using much lower quantities of nano‐emulsions. Other nano‐substances can 
mask unpleasant odors and thus improve substantially the organoleptic characteristics. 
The nutraceutical nano‐ingredients may help  improving  the quantities of  specific  substances  such as Omega 3, 
lycopene,  beta‐carotene,  and  certain  antioxidants.  These  substances  can  provide  specific  health  benefits  (e.g. 
prevention  of  occurrence  of  certain  diseases),  but  are  naturally  present  in  foods  in  very  small  quantities.  In 
addition,  these  substances  are  usually  not  easily  assimilated  by  the  body  and,  in  other  cases,  they  are  very 
unstable  and  therefore  they  are  deteriorated  by  common  food  treatments  such  as  cooking  and  long 
conservation.  The  nanotechnology  offers  the  possibility  to  artificially  synthesize  these  substances  and  provide 
them in form that are either easily assimilated by the body and more resistant to common food treatments. The 
nanoprotectors offer the possibility to artificially synthesize substances capable of hindering the development of 
microorganisms that are primarily responsible for food spoilage (mold, bacteria, etc.). By adding nanoprotectors 
it may be greatly extended the retention period of foods, ensuring edibility and healthiness. 
3.3  Model 
The theoretical model adopted is a simultaneous equations model, also known as Path model, able to elicit how 
willingness to buy is (directly and indirectly) influenced by perception of benefits and risks, as well as by general 
attitudes.  In  particular,  we  postulate  that  perceived  benefits  and  perceived  risks  influence  willingness  to  buy 
“nanotechnology  food”  (Siegrest  2006,  Siegrest  et  al,  2007),  with  a  complex mechanism  that may  depend  on 
consumers’  attitudes  toward  innovation,  health  and  institutions.  As  such,  the  model  includes  variables  that 
proxy consumers’ attitudes toward trust in science, trust in food industry and retail, attitude toward technology, 
preference for healthy food, preference for organic products and preference for food supplements.  
Analytically,  the  approach  consists  in  a  two‐stage  regression model.  In  the  first  stage  (equation  1) we  regress 
perceived benefits  (PB) and perceived risks  (PR) on their potential determinants  (attitude towards  innovations, 
N, attitude toward health issues, H, and trust in institutions, I) and on control factors (CF), such as knowledge of 
nanotech, type of job, class of income, and presence of household members under the age of 14. In the second 
stage (equation 2) we quantify the effects of estimated perceived benefits and perceived risks on the willingness 
to buy (WTB) of food with nanotechnologies applications:  
1)  First Stage 
2)      Second Stage 
More  specifically,  we  use  a  linear  specification  in  order  to  quantify  the  impact  of  attitudes  on  perceptions 
(perceived  benefit  and  perceived  risks).  The  following  equation  show  the  linear  specification  for  perceived 
benefit,  but  it  would  be  essentially  identical  for  the  equation  of  perceived  risks,  exception  made  for  the 
dependent variable:  
3)   
where the coefficients ( ,  , and  ) quantify the  impact (i.e. the marginal change  induced by the  independent 
variable,  that  is   of attitudes on perceived benefits, and    is an  i.i.d. error  term, 
assumed  to  be  normally  distributed  with  zero  mean.  The  second  stage  is  estimated  by  using  the  following 
specification:

where    and    represent,  respectively,  the estimated perceived benefits  and perceived  risk  from  the  first 
stage,  and    is  an  i.i.d.  error  term,  assumed  to  be  normally  distributed  with  zero  mean.  Analytically,    is 
obtained as follows (and   is obtained in an identical way, exception made for the dependent variable and the 
estimated coefficients):  
5)  
4  Results and discussion 
Our results are derived through a model of simultaneous equations which has been estimated using a two‐stage 
regressions  technique.  The  first  stage  provides  insights  on  the  effects  that  attitudes  play  on  perceptions  of 
benefits and risks, while the second stage assesses how those perceptions  impact the decision of buying or not 
food with nanotechnologies’ applications.  
The  estimates  (Table  3)  show  that  perceived  benefits  and  perceived  risks  are  differently  influenced  by 
consumers’ attitudes. First, knowledge of nanotechnologies is only crucial in determining perception of benefits, 
whereas no effect is found for the perception of risks. Second, the attitudes toward innovations play an opposite 
role:  a  positive  attitude  towards  new  technologies  increase  the  perception  of  benefits,  and  decrease  the 
perception of  risks. Differently,  the attention  toward health  issues  influence  risks and benefits perception  in a 
similar fashion. Lastly, trust in institutions is also a key variable: the higher the trust in institutions the higher the 
perceived benefits and the lower the perceived risks. We found no major influence of control factors such as the 
type  of  occupation,  and  the  presence  of  household  members  under  the  age  of  14.  Instead,  we  found  that 
consumers in higher income classes tend to have a lower perception of risks associated with nanotechnologies.  
The  second‐stage  regression  reveals  interesting  findings.  First,  in  all  cases  we  found  perceived  benefits  to  be 
positively  associated with  a  higher willingness  to  buy  food with  nanothecnologies  applications,  and  perceived 
risks to be negatively associated with a  lower willingness to buy food with nanothecnologies applications. Also, 
in all cases these correlations are statistically significant at the 1% level of significance. 
In  addition,  we  found  that  informed  consumers  (i.e.  those who  have  deeper  knowledge  of  nanotechnologies) 
have higher perceptions of benefits, but not of risks; richer consumers (i.e. those who belong to higher classes of 
income)  have  lower  perceptions  of  risks,  but  not  of  benefits.  Taken  together  the  findings  suggest  that 
innovations  in  the  food  industry  face  a  “knowledge‐wealth  paradox”:  both  knowledge  and  wealth  indirectly 
increase  the  willingness  to  buy,  but  the  functioning  mechanisms  are  opposite.  Building  knowledge  allows  to 
communicate and comprehend the benefits of innovations, whereas wealth tends to decrease the perceptions of 
risks favoring the willingness to buy foods with nanotechnologies applications.  
Lastly,  it  is worth  noting  that  the  effects  of  benefits  and  risks  perceptions  are  heterogeneous  across  different 
types  of  nano‐inside  applications. However,  in  all  cases  the  impact  of  perception  of  benefits  is  up  to  twice  as 
large  as  that  of  perception  of  risks:  a  sign  that  the  boldness  of  trying  innovative  foods  dominates  the  fear  of 
avoiding  them.  Among  nano‐inside  applications,  nano‐nutrients  are  those  for  which  such  a  difference  is  the 
largest,  whereas  for  nano‐ingredients  and  nano‐protectors  the  differences  are  the  lowest.  In  general  we  can 
conclude that our findings are in favor of the use of nanotechnologies in food industry. 
5  Conclusions  
In  this  study willingness  to  buy  nanotechnology  food  and  the  perceived  risk  and  perceived  benefit  associated 
with  these products were  analysed by presenting  four  nanotechnology  applications  in  the  food  sector:  people 
are  still  unfamiliar with  nanotechnology  and  acceptance  of  products  varied  among  different  applications.  Our 
quantitative  analysis,  via  a  path  model,  revealed  that  perceived  benefits  explain  a  large  part  of  variance  in 
willingness to buy. In line with the vast majority of studies on consumers’ attitudes (e.g. Santeramo et al., 2017a, 
2017b;  Giampietri  etl  al,  2017)  in  addition,  trust  in  science  and  technology  help  explaining  consumers' 
perceptions of risks and benefits  for nanotechnology applications. The higher consumers'  trust  in science,  food 
industry and retail channels, the higher their perception of benefits with respect to the risks of nanotechnologies 
(Sodano  et  al.  2016).  Our  findings  compare  with  previous  studies,  which  also  showed  different  effects  of 
perceived  benefits  and  perceived  risks  for  the  acceptance  of  nanothech  application  in  the  food  industry.  In 
particular,  Frewer  et  al.  (2015)  state  that  “[…]  people  differentiate  nanotechnology  applications  based  on  the 
extent to which they perceive them to be beneficial, useful, necessary and important. The benefits may be offset 
by perceived risks focusing on fear and ethical concerns.” Our results are in the opposite direction.

In particular,  trust  in science and  institutions and attitudes  towards new technologies show a significant effect 
on  perceived  benefits  and  perceived  risks;  attention  to  health  is  correlated with  perceived  risks  but  not with 
perceived benefits. This result is of particular interest as it may initiate a virtuous mechanism. In fact, as recently 
shown by  Kim  at  al.  (2014)  “benefit  perceptions  positively  affect  public  support  for  nanotechnology”,  and may 
therefore act as a catalyst for the diffusion of innovations in the nanotech‐food industry.

The  Path  analysis  showed  that  perceived  benefits  explain  a  large  part  of  variance  in  willingness  to  buy  and 
showed that  trust  in science and technology was  the strongest variable  in explaining the variance of perceived 
risk and perceived benefit of nanotechnology applications. The more consumers trust science, the food industry 
and retail, the higher they perceive the benefits and the lower they perceive the risks. These findings are in line 
with other studies, which also showed that perceived benefits are more  important than perceived risks for the 
acceptance of this food technology (e.g. Sodano et al., 2016). 
A major contribution of our study is the identification of the “knowledge‐wealth paradox”. Again, we found that 
both  knowledge  and wealth  indirectly  increase  the willingness  to  buy  but while  building  knowledge  allows  to 
communicate  and  comprehend  the  benefits  of  innovations,  increasing  wealth  (or  targeting  high  income  class 
consumers)  tends  to  decrease  the  perceptions  of  risks  favoring  the  willingness  to  buy  foods  with 
nanotechnologies  applications.  In  addition,  we  prove  that,  at  least  for  innovations  such  as  nano‐inside 
applications, the boldness of trying innovative foods dominates the fear of avoiding them. 
Few limitations of the study should be pointed: our study cannot generalize the findings to other countries, as no 
comparison was made. Indeed, to the extent that our large dataset capture the essence of the Italian population, 
the  validity  of  our  findings may be  extended  to  countries with  populations  that  share  common  characteristics 
with the Italian consumers.  
How to increase the public’s perceived benefits and decrease its perceived risks of applying nanotechnology is an 
important  task  for  government,  other  authorities  concerned,  and  the  manufacturers.  Increasing  the  use  of 
nanotechnologies  in  the  food  industry may prove effective  to boost  the uptake of calories and proteins, which 
tend  to be  income‐inelastic  (Santeramo and Shabnam, 2015;  Shabnam et  al.,  2016),  as well  as  to  increase  the 
intake  of  micronutrients  to  decrease  the  (negative)  impacts  of  food  insecurity  and  low  access  to  food 
(Santeramo,  2015a,  2015b).  Regulations,  public  education  and  clear  communication  programs  could  be  public 
methods to better comprehend this new technology. To the extent that no conclusive recommendations may be 
provided  with  the  current  state  of  knowledge,  exploring  these  issues  represent  not  only  a  promising  area  of 
research, but a pressing question calling for immediate answers.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Historically, technology is a key driver changing society. Human beings achieved the 
Protestant Reformation with printing technology and developed the steam engine during the 
industrial revolution. Furthermore, society is currently experiencing the digital revolution 
through telecommunication technology. As such, the social paradigm has changed along with 
the development of technologies.  
From the beginning of the 21st century, technology accelerated social change. The 
internet fundamentally changed the way human beings communicated and biotechnology 
provided the most diversified food supplies historically. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) 
and robotics rapidly improved economic productivity and new therapy for previously 
incurable diseases has developed using stem cells. However, telecommunication technology 
has infringed on privacy and gene modification technology has exposed human beings to 
unprecedented potential risks. Although technology's impact is debated, it is undisputed that 
technology has impacted no era more than the current era. Therefore, it is very critical to 
identify the process by which modern society recognizes and accepts technology.   
Intrinsically, technology is a specialized field with high-level complexity. Furthermore, 
it is also a political issue triggering unending disputes on its potential benefits and risks. 
Accordingly, the public needs an interpreter to help the public understand technology's 
complexities and to provide a public sphere for the political discussion necessary to help the 
public accept it. Media plays a role as this interpreter in modern society. Fundamentally, the 
public gets its information on technology through media. Media filters scientific discoveries 
for the audience so they can easily understand and suggests the standards for how to judge 
technologies. Thus social acceptance of technology changes with how media presents it.  
２ 
 
Regarding the social acceptance of technologies, the media frame has applied to science 
communication. It has been extensively supported that the way media frames technology in 
science communication reconstructs it and it is linked to its social acceptance. Therefore, this 
study investigated how the frames the media gives nanotechnology helps identify role media 
plays related to nanotechnology's social acceptance.  
Nanotechnology generates nanomaterial with a new molecular structure because it 
controls its characteristics on the nanometer level. It modifies or even creates all human being 
made artificial materials because it can control the basic properties of specific material. Such 
characteristics present significant benefits to society at large. For example, nanotechnology 
has treated a variety of incurable diseases and has innovatively extended human beings' life 
expectancy. Nanotechnology also improves manufacturing competitiveness and creates new 
products. However, nanotechnology has risks as well as potential benefits. Nanomaterials are 
extremely tiny and can accumulate in a body without biologically decomposing. Furthermore, 
they cause varied toxicities and induce new environmental pollution. In Society, it is possible 
that nanotechnology aggravates inequality and infringes on human rights.  
Due to this duality, nanotechnology has emerged as a socially important issue. Like 
nuclear power and genetically modified organisms in the past, nanotechnology also triggers 
conflicting discourse related to its social acceptance. However, the public doesn’t sufficiently 
understand it due to its high-level specialty and complexity. Accordingly, its representation in 
the media certainly drives public opinion and social acceptance.  
With respect to the media representation of nanotechnology, this study established three 
main goals: 1) identification of the media frame of nanotechnology; 2) identification of the 
cultural effects on the media frame of nanotechnology; 3) verification of a new approach to 
determine the media frame.

First of all, this study analyzed how the nanotechnology's media frame emerged. Science 
communication focuses on the process by which the public accepts nanotechnology. 
According to information-processing cognitive models, the public does not use all available 
information to decide on scientific issues such as nanotechnology that require significant 
cognitive effort for an in-depth understanding. Rather, the public relies on heuristic or 
cognitive shortcuts to form an opinion about a topic that they know little or nothing about. 
More specifically, as the public has little or no direct experience with nanotechnology, news 
coverage provides a key heuristic to the public (Nisbet & Lewenstein, 2002; Popkin, 1994).  
In particular, the public judges nanotechnology based on its media frame. In accordance 
with the Heuristic/Framing model, public attitudes and opinions on nanotechnology are 
influenced by the media and how media represents it (Scheufele & Lewenstein, 2005). The 
media functions as the key heuristics for the public and has become the most important tool 
to understanding nanotechnology's social acceptance.  
In the 2000s, many researchers investigated the media frame of nanotechnology. Their 
studies pointed out that media described mainly the scientific findings and economic benefits 
of nanotechnology and emphasized its positive aspects. Even though diverse countries 
implement nanotechnology globally through a variety of initiatives and policies, existing 
studies focused only on news coverage in Europe and North America. And those studies were 
merely restricted to one country or regions speaking the same language. Moreover, a few 
studies were conducted since 2010 when various countries' regulations drew attention to the 
discussion of nanotechnology's potential risks. Consequently, this study identified media 
frames of nanotechnology and compared differences by country and time period. 
Second, this study examined cultural effects on media frame of nanotechnology. Key to 
the media frame is how the news reconstructs issues. Then, the media frame studies were 
４ 
 
divided into elements affecting having effect the news representation process and how 
approach this representation effects the audience’s perception. For this, this study focused on 
elements affecting the process of the news representation, i.e., frame building.  
A variety of factors influence frame building. While previous studies focused on the 
microlevel effect of factors like with journalists and media organization on frame building, 
there are almost no studies on macrolevel factors including philosophy, culture, or moral 
values. In particular, although some researchers recognized culture as a key factor affecting 
media framing, no empirical study has examined it.   
Cultural effects on the media frame were not studied sufficiently because it was difficult 
to measure the relationship between them. While culture directly effects the media frame on 
the macrolevel, it also has an indirect effect on media organizations and journalists. 
Accordingly, it is necessary to establish a theoretical concept to empirically identify the 
cultural factors that have a composite and duplicated effect on frame building.  
Thus, this study focused on the salience of the media frame through cultural resonance. 
A specific factor present in the media frame and its sequential linear order is implemented as 
the media frame salience varies by each the factor's characteristics. Accordingly, to identify 
the factors having a composite effect on the media frame, for example culture, it is necessary 
to investigate the process by which the media frame is salient depending on cultural 
resonance as well as the presence of the media frame itself. However, existing studies 
focused on identifying the presence of frames by analyzing and comparing frame contents 
country by country. These approaches, however, can’t empirically identify the scope of the 
cultural effect on the media frame and ignore the salience of media frame cultural resonance 
causes.  
Cultural resonance occurs when the frame coincides with a specific value in culture. The 
５ 
 
frame containing the cultural value appears more frequently in news coverage. In addition, 
since culture has persistent characteristics, it is reflected through resonance with the frame 
over the long term rather than a change of frame influenced by a microlevel factor. Thus, the 
stronger the resonance between culture and the media frame is, the more significant the 
salience of the media frame is.  
To empirically investigate cultural effects on media frames, this study analyzed the 
salience of media frame influenced by cultural resonance. Thus, this study adopted Hofstede's 
cultural dimension model (Hofstede, 1980, 1991, 2001; Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov, 
2010). The model provides the scale to quantitatively measure cultural effects. The model 
comprising a value-based set is remarkably efficient at measuring the cultural resonance 
created between cultural values and media frames. Consequently, this study expanded the 
theoretical scope of framing studies by empirically verifying that culture had an effect on the 
media frame of nanotechnology.  
Lastly, this study examined a new approach to eliminate the methodological limits of 
media frame, largely discussing two aspects. The methodological issues on media frame were 
discussed largely in two aspects. One limit is reliability and validity because of unclear 
standards on extracting the media frame. Existing studies generally identified the frames by 
in-depth analyses of news articles and established a coding book consisting of frames. Then, 
coders using the coding book conducted an empirical content analysis to classify a media 
frame. However, many studies failed to suggest clear standards for determining the media 
frame because researchers defined such standards randomly. Furthermore, since researchers’ 
recognition varies by the issues' complexity, the media frame categories and quantities 
identified in news articles also varied.  
The other limit is that emerging frames are not easily identified. The unique frame of a 
６ 
 
researcher, i.e., the coder frame, is identified depending on the researcher's recognition of the 
issue in the content analysis. When the media frame is determined on a specific issue, it is 
difficult to identify other media frames because of the researcher’s schema. Moreover, 
researchers have the tendency to stereotype articles into the frame category which they 
identify. 
Consequently, this study adopted a new approach using frame elements to identify the 
frame and maximizing the independence from researchers’ influence. It facilitates identifying 
new frames based on the combination of frame elements. Matthes and Kohring (2008), who 
suggested this approach, explained that some elements of frame definitions are grouped 
systematically in a specific way, and are formed by a pattern identified in the text. According 
to their assumptions, “a frame consists of several frame elements, and each frame element 
consists of several content analytical variables” and “every frame is characterized by a 
specific pattern of variable” that “signify [that] single frame elements are grouped together by 
hierarchical cluster analysis” (Matthes & Kohring, 2008, p.264).  
This approach posits that frames, as patterns of frame elements combinations, are not 
coded directly with a single variable but with combined frame elements. Therefore, a frame 
with several content analytical variables can achieve higher reliability and validity than a 
frame with single variable because frames are not subjectively determined but empirically 
suggested by an inductive clustering. And this approach has also another advantage in that 
frame coding is conducted against a coder’s schema or bias because a coder does not code 
frame but codes variables (Matthes & Kohring, 2008).  
This approach improves in-depth understanding on existing measurements by defining 
the frame elements. It also eliminates the methodological ambiguity of existing studies to 
identify media frames by determining such frames empirically, not subjectively. However, the 
７ 
 
approach is not standardized because it has only been applied to very few studies. Thus, this 
study applied it to examine the complicated nanotechnology issue. In addition, this study 
examined the methodological efficiency of the new approach by analyzing news coverage in 
various countries over long time period.

2. MEDIA FRAME AND CULTURE 
 
2.1. Salience of Media Frame 
 
2.1.1. Media frame 
The researchers who investigate news with a constructive perspective have considered 
news production as a social reconstruction and posited that news did not reflect reality as it 
was but represented it based on frames built through experience depending on the media 
environment (Gitlin, 1980; Tuchman, 1978). Thus, journalists and media institutions selected 
amorphous events and assigned a certain feature. Through this approach, news is the social 
reconstruction of reality by which events are selected, emphasized, and excluded.  
Lippman (1922), who viewed news as the manipulation of symbols, pointed out that the 
society we meet through media is not the objective reality which we can directly see but is 
comprised of the images produced in our head. Boorstin (1961), using the concepts of 
""pseudo-environment"" and ""pseudo-event,"" explained that reality depicted through media was 
like an intentional counterfeit. Berger and Luckmann (1966) distinguished objective and 
subjective reality by explaining that reality was socially constructed, and also explained the 
knowledge-sociology had to analyze the process by which reality occurred. Adoni and Mane 
(1984) also described three kinds of reality: objective reality, which we experience as reality; 
symbolic reality, which is constructed in the form of symbolic expression on objective reality 
such as media content; subjective reality, which an individual constructs as a result of taking 
in objective and symbolic reality.  
Frame means that which the media uses to construct reality. Frame allows media to 
assign meaning to a specific event or issue in a certain way in the process of constructing 
９ 
 
reality. Tuchman adopted the concept of frame related to the media constructing social reality 
by defining news as the window into the world and insisting that people recognize the world 
through that window. Accordingly, frame is useful to analyze a specific discourse the news 
constructs. Frame study doesn’t recognize news coverage as objective stimulation unlike 
traditional contents analysis, but as the construction of a symbolic device structured to 
interact with each agent (e.g. journalist, audience, and source). Thus, it suggests the 
possibility of unifying the whole process of news production and consumption (Pan & 
Kosicki, 1993). Moreover, as Entman (1993) pointed out, content analysis, by classifying and 
integrating text into negative and positive terms and drawing conclusions based on the 
dominant meaning, didn’t examine the salience of text elements, and didn’t catch the 
relationship between the most salient message frame and the audience schema. But to the 
contrary, frame can be a useful method to analyze news construction and content that actually 
influences the audience.  
The above concept of frame that media studies have adopted was originally proposed by 
Goffman (1974). Goffman analyzed human behavior using theatrical metaphor. He thought 
that frame was a principle of systemization dominating human beings' subjective interference 
of social events, and the structure invisibly dominating human beings' daily life. His ideas 
significantly influenced sociologists who had focused on the approach by which the media 
strengthened a society's dominant ideology.  
Meanwhile, Gitlin focused on how reality was constructed, by looking at the process by 
which the media frame produces news on events on the ideological aspects. He indicated that 
the media frame is a continuing pattern related to representation, interpretation, suggestion, 
selection, emphasis, and exclusion of reality, and media itself and journalists should 
conventionally use such frame devices for manipulating discourse.  
１０ 
 
In addition to a sociological insight, the psychology field also used the frame concept in 
focusing on the effect of news article style on the audience's interpretation. Iyengar (1991) 
defined framing as the subtle change in expressing or suggesting several judgments and 
selections, and framing effects as the change in decision making such a subtle change causes. 
The research on to the change in discourse and public opinion produced by media indicated 
that media discourse was socially and culturally constructed (Iyengar & Simon, 1993). 
Gamson and Modigliani (1989) explained media discourse as a series of symbolic devices, 
which assigned meaning to issues using a concept ""package"" such as frame. They viewed 
certain devices including metaphor, example, catchphrase, description, and visual images as 
applying to the media discourse. 
Furthermore, Entman indicated that framing was accompanied by selection and salience. 
Framing selects some aspects of reality and highlights them, making them salient in 
communication texts. The audience thus pays greater attention to and remembers specific 
information through the above approach. Entman defined that the event describing the frame 
above related to the reconstruction of social reality was a specific issue, and performs the 
function of interpreting the causes and results of that issue, making ethical assessment and 
proposing a way to solve it. 
As discussed above, researchers have defined media frames using different concepts and 
terms. However, they have generally agreed that media frame is the characteristics of news 
messages influencing the audience’s understanding using a specific method and is a way to 
manipulate a story by combining a variety of message factors on the story's substantive 
aspects. 
 
2.1.2. Frame Building 
１１ 
 
Scheufele (1999) studied two frame types. One frame was a ""between-level"" type 
defining media frame on the macrolevel and the audience frame on the microlevel. The other 
was a ""within-level"" type that conceptualized the media and audience frames as dependent 
and independent variables, respectively (Figure 2.1.). 
This study focused on the media frame as a dependent variable and dealt with factors 
affecting frame building. Most existing frame studies merely focused on identifying the 
frame by content analysis. So, it was meaningful to identify the frame building process. 
 
 
Figure 2.1. Frame building in the frame process model1 
 
Frame building used media frame as a dependent variable and was defined as the 
process related to the factors affecting the creation and change of the media frame applied by 
journalists. Frame building adopting Cobb end Elder's (1972) Agenda-Setting Model focused 
on how the individual journalist's features or the media system's organizational or structural 
factors had an effect on news coverage framing. In this respect, frame building is similar to 
                                           
1 Scheufele (1999) 
１２ 
 
agenda building. However, agenda building is related to an issue itself, but frame building 
focuses on different levels or aspects of the same issue. In other words, frame building means 
the macromechanism related to the message's construction rather than media effects. 
Actors including interest groups, policy makers, and journalists are interested in the 
media agenda, and frame affects both a specific issue's news coverage quantity and 
characteristic. Scheufele classified the factor types having an effect on the frame building by 
combining the existing studies on the factors affecting news content. He found varied factors 
affecting news coverage construction including news practices, gatekeepers, ownership 
structure, ideology, and culture.  
Many other studies also identified the factors affecting news coverage, and in particular, 
some studies systematically classified the factors on the microlevel and macrolevel (Alger, 
1989; Bennett, 1993; Gans, 1979; Graber, 1989; Schudson, 1989; Shoemaker & Reese, 1996). 
Gans found a correlation between various kinds of factors intervening in news production. He 
identified the detailed factors affecting the reporting process in news coverage including 
types of news values, the journalist's individual values, and the correlation between the 
journalist's individual belief and media organization. Shoemaker and Reese also systemized 
and classified the news production process into individual aspects, including journalists, 
media routines, and internal and extramedia organization levels, and ideology level. They 
also created a model on the effect of those levels on message.  
Based on the above classification, Scheufele classified three factors having effects on 
frame building: journalist level, media organization level, and extramedia level. The factors 
related to the journalist level affecting frame building process means the internal factors and 
professional norms of journalists, including personalities, background, experience, political 
tendency, value, belief, and roles (Gans, 1979; Shoemaker & Reese, 1996). Gans suggested 
１３ 
 
ethnocentrism, altruistic democracy, responsible capitalism, small town pastoralism, 
individualism, moderatism, and social order as individual values and beliefs which American 
journalists had that could influence news coverage. The individual's belief, value, and 
political ideology of journalists could be factors influencing how he/she deals with issues. 
The progressive or conservative political attitude of journalists formed the political beliefs 
and values of journalists on a variety of political issues in the US, which could have effects 
on frame building (McLeod & Detenber, 1999).  
A number of studies identified the factors on the media organizational level having 
effect on news (Blumler & Kavanagh, 1999; Scheufele, 1999; Shoemaker & Reese, 1996). 
Shoemaker and Reese suggested production routines at the media organization level, and 
political, economic, and social value and properties of an organization as the factors affecting 
news. Their suggestions were in line with the Scheufele's factors on the media level. They 
specified gate-keeping, source, news value, and news construction approach as the production 
routines affecting news. Scheufele, however, included media norms including objectivity and 
news value in examining the journalist level. Meanwhile, the Scheufele's factors relating to 
the media organization level include economic profit, political tendency, social property, and 
structure of an organization. 
Next, researchers found competition among media organizations, pressure from 
advertising clients, administrative regulations or governmental intervention, politicians, a 
variety of interest groups, sources, cultural norms, and the ethical values of a society as 
external factors affecting news coverage (Alger, 1989; Shoemaker & Reese, 1996; Tuchman, 
1978). In particular, political pressure can affect the selection and collection of news relating 
reporting on political issues or governmental-related events. In this case, the media frame can 
１４ 
 
vary depending on the relationship between political pressure and a media organization's 
political tendency (Alger, 1989).  
The effect according to different news providers, in other words, source, is also an 
important factor affecting news (Bennett, 1990; Manning, 2001; Shoemaker & Reese, 1996; 
Tuchman, 1978). Bennett insisted that pressure from external sources including politicians 
and political groups, were standard in the conventional news production process, and thus 
news became individualized, polarized, and segmented. He identified the influence from the 
media organization itself, the influence from colleagues, and news source influence among 
the reasons causing the above events. Shoemaker and Reese pointed out that a news source 
could activate or inhibit information expansion consistent with its own interest and a news 
source's journalist selection could manipulate news content. Shoemaker and Reese definitely 
emphasized the effect of news source on news coverage because journalists could not include 
what they don’t know in their news article. 
Ethical values, cultural norms, and political and economic values affect the news content 
(Hartley, 1982; Shoemaker & Reese, 1996; Tuchman, 1978). Consistent with Tuchman, since 
news emphasizes that its function is to maintain status quo rather than to pursue innovation or 
change, it is framed to justify existing institutional practice and type. Shoemaker and Reese 
explained ideological influence by postulating that ideology wasn’t directly assigned to news, 
but constructed by institutional, vocational and cultural practices configuring media. 
Moreover, they indicated that media emphasized ideology on the macrolevel including ethical 
values and cultural norms because of its pressure on social roles. Gamson and Modiglini 
(1989) described that cultural resonance and sponsorship as well as employment regulations 
and journalists' practices contribute to the formation of media discourse. In addition, other 
researchers discussed the effect of political culture and social norms on news (Henry, 1981; 
１５ 
 
Rachlin, 1998), and emphasized the roles of ideology, political tendency, and national interest 
on international media frames (Akhavan-Majid & Ramaprasad, 2000; Chang, Wang, & Chen, 
1998; Pan, Lee, Chan, & So, 1999; Yang, 2003). 
While a number of researchers have examined the exogenous and endogenous factors 
affecting news coverage, there is no evidence secured by a systematic and empirical approach 
investigating how a variety of factors affect the structural characteristics of news with respect 
to their framing aspects.  
 
2.1.3. Presence and Salience 
As discussed above, frame building is the process that creates a media frame influenced 
by exogenous and endogenous factors. Accordingly, the presence of a media frame resulting 
from frame building shows frame building's influence.  
According to Entman, frame is a result as a process of selection and salience, and to 
frame is “to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient” (Entman, 
1993, p.52). This means that it is necessary to identify how the selection and salience of 
factors having effect on media frame differentiate. 
The media frame thus is classified by the factors affecting frame building (presence) or 
by what kinds of characteristics of the factors affecting frame building help the frame be 
revealed more saliently (salience). Stated differently, the question is what factors does the 
media select in frame building and then, which perspectives of the media-selected factor are 
more salient with media frame.  
The conceptual classification above was discussed in frame setting; i.e., the process to 
identify the media frame's effect on the audience frame. Like the relationship between frame 
building and agenda building, frame setting is fundamentally based on the same process as 
１６ 
 
agenda setting. However, while agenda setting focuses on an issue's salience, frame setting 
relates to the issue property's salience (McComb, Llamas, Lopez-Escobar, & Rey, 1997). In 
frame setting, the audience frame becomes salient through the influence of the media frame. 
In other words, the correlation between two variables is positive because the change of the 
media frame as the independent variable affects on the salience of the audience frame, as the 
dependent variable. 
The factors theoretically having effects on the media frame relate to its presence, and 
then the presence varies depending on the characteristic of factor. Since it is the process by 
which media input selects a specific factor and its characteristics that are salient, both 
concepts have a sequential linear order relationship. However, both concepts must be 
examined independently because they have different effects on frame building. For frame 
presence, factors having effects on frame building or their characteristic are included in the 
media frame. Meanwhile, frame salience is the characteristics of factors affecting frame 
building that resonate in a specific direction related to the media frame. 
Such concept is more meaningful for macrolevel factors like culture. Macrolevel factors 
generally affect media frame building. They also influence media frame building indirectly 
through the microlevel factors including journalists or media organizations. Since macrolevel 
complexity can’t be properly reflected only by verifying the presence of the media frame, this 
study will investigate the difference of effects according to factors' characteristics on the 
macrolevel. 
Certain studies on political communication examined the process related to frame 
building on two levels (Hänggli, 2012; Tresch, 2009). Those studies investigated, among the 
factors having effect on frame building, the difference in media frame depending on the 
power of political actors. Hänggli distinguished frame presence and the frame salience in her 
１７ 
 
study on how strategic political actors shape news coverage. She insisted the power of the 
media input factor influenced the media frame. She found that media was substantially 
interested in more powerful media input in general. Hänggli named it the ""power bias 
hypothesis"". The power bias hypothesis means that the frame of a powerful actor is more 
applicable to news articles than that of a weak actor. This occurs because news media “tend[s] 
to index the range of voices and viewpoints in both news and editorials according to the range 
of views expressed in mainstream government debate about a given topic"" (Bennett, 1990, 
p.106). 
Similarly, Tresch (2009) classified the presence and the prominence (referred to as 
salience in this study) of media. In accordance with her study on why news media covered 
some parliamentarians more frequently than others, senators participating in the discussion on 
proposed legislative bills had the opportunity to be covered even though their activities were 
not regularly covered in news articles. In particular, the senators' party leaders drew among 
more attention from the media and were mentioned as very prominent politicians. This meant 
that the media frame's presence and salience have different effect on frame building. 
This conceptual distinction between the presence and salience of the media frame in 
frame building may contribute to frame studies significantly since they have not yet been 
distinguished.   
 
2.2. Cultural Resonance 
 
2.2.1. Culture in News Coverage  
In general, culture ""consists of pattern, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior 
acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human 
１８ 
 
groups, including their embodiments in artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of 
traditional (i.e., historically derived and selected) ideas and especially their attached values; 
culture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as productions of action, on the other as 
conditioning elements of further action"" (Kroeber & Kluckhohn, 1952, p.181). 
In regard to the social system and interactions between actors, culture is ""relatively 
enduring personality characteristics and patterns that are model among the adult members of 
the society"" (Inkeles & Levinson, 1969, p.17). And it is the ""complex whole which includes 
knowledge, beliefs, art, morals, law, customs, and any other capabilities and habits acquired 
by man as member of society"" (De Mooji & Keegar, 1991, p.74), and ""collective 
programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one group or category of 
people from another"" (Hofstede, 1991, p.260). Moreover, culture is ""the shared beliefs and 
understandings, mediated by and constituted by symbols and language, of a group or society"" 
(Zald, 1996, p.262), and ""the integrated system of learned patterns of behaviors, ideas, and 
products characteristics of a society"" (Hiebert, 1976, p.25). Consequently, culture is a 
society's value system and contains shared values among members in the society.  
News coverage studies discussed culture under two perspectives. One was journalists' 
news selection and culture as news value (Galtung & Ruge, 1973). For example, other 
countries' international news was covered more frequently in countries having a similar 
cultural background. News coverage on the countries accounting for a higher immigration 
ratio had more opportunity to be covered (Burrowes, 1974; Hester, 1971). Moreover, the 
journalists in a conflict-oriented culture thought that conflict issues had greater news value 
(Peterson, 1981). The findings indicated that culture affected journalists' news selection.  
Another study type examined the cultural narrative contained in news coverage. Hoggart 
(1976) explained that the most important filter on how news is constructed is the cultural air 
１９ 
 
we breathe, our society's entire ideological atmosphere of our society, which tells us which 
things can be said and which others had best not be said, and explained that cultural air is 
determined by the context where its system was generated. Pearce (1981) found in analyzing 
the news coverage in England related to homosexuality, that news dealt with homosexuality 
only on its the conventional and ethical aspects because homosexuality was considered 
unethical in England at that time. Similarly the study on news coverage of racial conflict in 
England found that the “British cultural tradition contains elements derogatory to foreigners, 
particularly blacks. The media operate within the culture and are obliged to use cultural 
symbols” (Hartmann & Husband, 1973, p.274). Gans, who examined the relationship 
between American cultural narrative and journalism, explained that the cultural values of 
ethnocentrism, altruistic democracy, responsible capitalism, small-town pastoralism, 
individualism, and moderatism are the core of American news coverage.   
 
2.2.2. Culture and Media frame 
As discussed in chapter 2.1.1., the frame is the structural representation of social reality. 
Therefore, a systematic deduction and description is needed on the relationship between the 
frame and its social and cultural context. In particular, since culture is the key factor 
comprising meaning, understanding, and knowledge of the external world, the repertoire of 
the frame shared in culture plays an important role in news production. Goffman (1981) 
suggested that ""frames are a central part of a culture and are institutionalized in various ways"" 
(p.63). Entman also stated that ""the culture is the stock of commonly invoked frames"" and 
""culture might be defined as the empirically demonstrable set of common frames exhibited in 
the discourse and thinking of the most people in a social grouping"" (p.53). Gamson and his 
colleagues explained that the frame was constructed by a framing device, potentially rational 
２０ 
 
devices, and the culture presenting the extensive meaning package (Gamson & Lasch, 1983; 
Gamson & Modigliani, 1989). 
Although media studies have conceptually recognized that culture affects the frame, the 
relationship between culture and frame is still obscure. When media constructs social reality 
through a frame, it is difficult to identify how culture intervenes in the process, and the 
cultural effect on the frame can’t be identified.  
The existing studies on the relationship between media frame and culture up to now 
focused mainly on comparing countries on a single issue (Akhavan-Majid & Ramaprasad, 
1998; Brossard, Shanahan, & McComas, 2004; De Vreese, Peter, & Semetko, 2001; 
Dimitrova & Strömbäck, 2012; Yu & Kim, 2002). For example, De Vreese, Peter, and 
Semetko pointed out that the media frames for the economic consequences on the 
introduction of the Euro varied between England, Denmark, and the Netherlands because of 
the cultural differences of journalists in those countries. In other words, emphasis on the 
economic consequences of introducing the Euro translated the economic implications of the 
relevant issue. However, in the culture of journalists in England, journalists themselves were 
very cautious in translating a specific issue (Köcher, 1986). This explained the insufficient 
economic consequence frame in the news in England.  
Dimitrova and Strömbäck (2012) explained that cultural differences in both countries 
caused the difference in the media frame of TV news coverage in the US and Sweden. They 
insisted that the commercialization level of the TV market in both countries influenced such 
cultural differences. That is, they emphasized the importance of commercialization as a factor 
in the media frame. The above study results showed the effect of culture on frame building, 
but were limited in that they didn’t classify the factors on the microlevel (including 
journalist-media organization) and the cultural factors on the macrolevel.  
２１ 
 
The studies factors on the macrolevel also didn’t also define the effect of culture. In 
accordance with the comparison of the news coverage on the September 11 attack in diverse 
countries (Yu & Kim, 2001), both Korea and the US covered the attack with an aspect of 
""good and evil"" based on US government perspective. The frames justifying the US attack on 
Afghanistan were dominant. On the contrary, China described the September 11 attack with a 
neutral perspective and showed more frames emphasizing the sacrifice of Afghans due to the 
US attack. This suggested that ideology had a more significant effect on media frame than 
cultural values (see, Korea and China) depending on the issues. On this aspect, the factors on 
the macrolevel need to be controlled to identify the cultural effect on media frames. 
Except for comparing news coverage, the influence of culture on media frames was not 
investigated because of an insufficient discussion on how to adopt the cultural factors.  
As discussed above, culture can be defined by various meanings and a variety of cultural 
types have been used as variables in the studies to measure the influence of culture. 
Communication studies also apply the cultural factor in various ways as a variable. Indeed, 
risk communication studies frequently adopted two kinds of societal controls and 
incorporation within bounded social groups, and were constrained by externally imposed 
rules as the variables (Douglas, 1992). Advertising and PR studies mainly used a variety of 
cultural dimensions as the variable (Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov, 2010; House, Hanges, 
Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004; Schwartz, 1999). In addition, semiotics and international 
communication studies frequently used the difference of contextual meaning among cultures 
as variable (Hall, 1976). 
Most cultural variables have a methodological limit in empirically assessing the cultural 
effects, except for cultural dimensions. In accordance with Scheufele's (1999) model, culture 
has a direct effect on the media frame as the cultural input and simultaneously as an indirect 
２２ 
 
impact through other media input. Furthermore, the media frame is a cultural result and is 
represented by the media frame at the same time. It is difficult to empirically identify the 
causality on the frame due to such overlapping and complicated cultural characteristics. 
 
2.2.3. Media Frame with Cultural Resonance 
Media content contains culture in frame building. However, since the cultural effect on 
the media frame is complicated and overlapping due to its characteristics, it can’t be 
examined by claiming that culture is only contained in the presence of the media frame. To 
identify the cultural effect on media frames, it is necessary to pay attention to the frame 
salience having a differential effect on a specific frame, as well as a frame presence. To this 
end, this study focused on the resonance between the media frame and culture to empirically 
measure the relationship between them.  
Resonance is a physical concept meaning the amplification occurring when natural 
frequencies of two objects respond to each other. All objects generally have unique vibrations. 
When an external force with the same vibration is applied to the unique vibration of an object, 
even a small force can deliver a broad amplitude of vibration or energy.  
In communication studies the outstanding case is the resonance effect presented by 
cultivation theory (Gerbner, Gross, Morgan, & Signorielli, 1980; Morgan, Leggett, & 
Shanahan, 1999; Shanahan & Morgan, 1997; Signorielli & Morgan, 1990; Woo & Doninick, 
2003). When the audience is in an environment providing them more opportunity to directly 
experience thinking that TV contents are similar to their situations or to confirm their pre-
existing information, a synergy effect is made and the cultural cultivation effect of TV will be 
more powerful. It’s a kind of resonance effect.  
２３ 
 
Benford and Snow (2000) applied resonance to a framing study for the first time. They 
pointed out that resonance is “relevant to the issue of the effectiveness or mobilizing potency 
of proffered framings,” and considered “why some framings seem to be effective or resonant 
while others do not.” Since then, several researchers mentioned the resonance of frame in a 
conceptual approach (Buijs, Arts, Elands, & Lengkeek, 2011; Entman, 1993; Ferree, 2003; 
Gamson, 1992; Gamson & Modigliani, 1989). In particular, they focused on cultural 
resonance. These studies described that when the frame is effectively constructed, it resonates 
with what is applied as a social value, and the roles of culture, the core element in the social 
value system, will be emphasized. 
Cultural resonance occurs when ""a certain frame is congruent with specific items within 
a culture or subculture"" (Buijs, Arts, Elands, & Lengkeek, 2011, p.330) and increases “the 
appeal of a frame by making it appear natural and familiar"" (Gamson, 1992, p.135). 
Therefore, cultural resonance is “an interaction of a certain package of ideas with the variable 
structure of an institutionally anchored discourse” (Ferree, 2003, p.310) 
Gamson and Modigliani (1989) explained the intrinsic advantage because a specific 
frame resonates with the main cultural theme in a specific country. The frame with a key 
cultural theme is more frequently found in the media content. Since the cultural theme of a 
specific country continuously exists, Gamson and Modigliani postulated that culture 
resonates with frame building as the process, rather than the description of the change of 
frame. 
Snow and Benford (1988) also stated that specific frames ""resonate with cultural 
narrations, that is, with the stories, myths, and folk tales that are part and parcel of one's 
cultural heritage"" (p.201). 
２４ 
 
However, there are various opinions on the cultural resonance of frame. In particular, 
there is the dispute on when culture resonates in the frame process. Some studies insisted that 
cultural resonance was a kind of frame building and thus, the results of cultural resonance had 
an effect on the salience of frame. It was also pointed out that cultural resonance contributed 
to frame setting as well as frame building (Gamson & Modigliani, 1989; Snow & Benford, 
1988). Meanwhile, Entman thought that culture had a greater effect on frame setting. In other 
words, he described that words and images constructing a frame accelerated the audience's 
support or rejection of a relevant issue. Such an ability to accelerate the audience's position 
on an issue could be measured by cultural resonance. The frames resonating the culture make 
themselves noticeable, understandable, memorable, and emotionally charged. However, both 
views on cultural resonance agree that the stronger the resonance between frame and culture 
is, the stronger the corresponding effect is. 
To measure the cultural resonance related to frame, Benford and Snow (2000) suggested 
three dimensions of frame salience to identify the resonance: centrality, commensurability, 
and narrative fidelity. Centrality concerns how essential the values related to frame are. The 
researchers assumed that the more the values related to frame were centralized in the social 
system around a specific issue, the more salient the frame was likely to be. Commensurability 
describes the correspondence of daily experience to events or issues where framing occurs. 
By specifying the correspondence of the societal value system, cultural narratives, myths, 
major assumptions, and inherent ideologies as narrative fidelity, Benford and Snow (2000) 
assumed that the higher narrative fidelity of a specific frame might induce a greater frame 
salience. 
Cultural resonance was until now discussed in the media frame mainly by qualitative 
analysis on narrative fidelity until now. For example, Entman (2004) pointed out Bush 
２５ 
 
administration framed the September 11 by repeating the words ""evil"" and ""war"", and that 
those words resonated culturally on a very broad scale in the media frame and the American 
media. Gamson and Modigliani (1989) explained that the ""progress frame"" benefited from 
resonance with the main cultural theme of technical advancement. Accordingly, they 
concluded there was no disagreement in American society on emphasizing a technical 
approach to solving a problem. 
Qualitative analysis is meaningful in that it showed the resonance between the media 
frame and culture. However, its limit is that general cultural factors were not applied to the 
media frame. For resonance of a specific culture to a media frame, the relationship between 
them cannot be accurately identified based on seeing that frame as the result of culture and 
culture as the representation of frame at the same time. Accordingly, it is necessary to 
empirically examine the salience of the media frame resonating with general cultural factors.

3. CULTURAL DIMENSIONS 
 
3.1. Models of Cultural Dimensions 
 
3.1.1. Value and Cultural Dimensions 
The common definition of culture is that culture is based on shared values. Generally, 
value is the “relationships among abstract categories that are characterized strong affective 
components and imply a preference for a certain type of action” (Straub, Loch, Evaristo, 
Karahanna, & Strite, 2002, p.14) and the “enduring belief that a specific mode of conduct or 
end-state of existence is personally or socially preferable to an opposite or converse mode of 
conduct or end-state of existence” (Rokeach, 1973, p.5). 
Early cultural studies suggested that value was the core of culture. Parson and Shils 
(1951) suggested value orientation as the key factor that constitutes culture, and Kroeber 
(1952) insisted that culture embodies values, which may be formulated or felt by the society. 
Kluckhohn (1951) explained that “the essential core of culture consists of traditional ideals 
and especially their attached values” (p.86).     
Homeostasis ensures that cultural studies mainly use shared values. People acquire a 
value in the early stages of life, mainly from family or peer groups, and from schools in later 
stages. Such social institutions teach the standards of what is right and proper for members in 
a society and norms on what is appropriate in various situations. Once learned, a value is 
integrated into the individual's value system according to the relative priority of each value. 
Then, the cultural value hardly changes and becomes significantly stable (Schwartz, 1999; 
Straub, Loch, Evaristo, Karahanna, & Strite, 2002; Williams, 1970).   
In the Onion Model of Culture presented by Hofstede (1980), culture is classified into 
２７ 
 
symbol, hero, ritual, and value. While the symbolic level of culture can diversely change, the 
value comprising the society changes very slowly as being the core of the culture and the 
most stable level in this model. Under this perspective, comparative studies on culture 
generally identified and described culture as the values shared in a group (Geertz, 1973; 
Murdock, 1965; Triandis, 1972).   
Values influence the national culture. The national value system hardly changes as the 
characteristic of a country, much like that country's geographical location or climate. It is 
needless to say that a national boundary doesn’t coincide with the boundaries of the group 
having the shared cultural values. However, strong integration pressure does act, due to 
diverse factors in a country, including a single main language, common education, military, 
or national symbols or events having emotional appeal. Through such pressure, a country has 
internal homogeneity, and people in that country share cultural values (Hofstede, 1980).   
Cultural dimension was used to categorize the comparison of a country and a group on 
the basis of values. Cultural dimension is a system that conceptualizes cultural diversity by 
relevancy, and classifies and defines the cultural factors affecting people in a specific group 
(Kim, 2004). Cultural dimension can be categorized into various types depending on the 
standards used. A number of researchers developed an individual cultural dimension that 
could be applied to their own fields. For example, Hall (1976) classified cultural dimension 
by communication, time, and space, Gray (1988) by an accounting system, Inglehart (1997) 
by attitude and belief, and Bond et al. (2004) by social belief.  
However, most studies adopted a model based on values functioning as the core of 
culture. Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck (1961), Hofstede (1980), Schwartz (1994), Trompenaars 
and Hampden-Turner (1997), and the GLOBE Project by House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorman, 
and Gupta (2004) suggested a value-based cultural dimension model for comparing countries. 
２８ 
 
The studies determined that the value-based cultural dimension model could be generally 
applied as the main approach to explain differentiated characteristics or homogeneous 
phenomenon among countries.  
 
3.1.2. A Variety of Models 
Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck (1961) clearly classified and presented cultural dimension for 
the first time. Their basic concept started from the assumption that people confronted the 
general questions in five dimensions. The researchers proposed that value orientation answers 
those questions and insisted that a specific society preferred a solution reflecting the cultural 
values of that society according to five general questions (Table 3.1.). In other words, the 
preferred value orientation varies for diverse cultures for solving general questions human 
beings face.  
 
Table 3.1. Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck’s cultural dimensions 
Cultural Dimension Value Orientation 
relationship with nature mastery harmony subjugation 
human nature good neutral evil 
relationship with people individualistic collateral lineal 
human activities being becoming doing 
relationship with time past present future 
  
The five general questions are presented below. The first asks what the relationship is 
between humanity and its natural environment. Its value orientation is classified into a value 
of viewing nature as the object of control or domination, a value by which human beings and 
nature co-exist to maintain balance and harmony between them, and a value by which human 
beings submit to nature because they can’t overcome it. The second question asks what the 
２９ 
 
human nature is. Its value orientation is that human beings are classified into naturally being 
good, bad, or a mixture of good and bad depending on the culture. The third question asks 
how individuals should relate with one another. Its value orientation is classified into 
collectivism emphasizing a group more than any other social object, individualism 
emphasizing the roles and importance of individuals, and authoritarianism submitting 
individuals to their superiors in a strict hierarchical system. The fourth question asks what 
humans' prime behavioral motivation is. Its value orientation is classified into ""being"" in 
which human beings, events, or thoughts are naturally generated and exist and so trying to 
escape from them and emphasizing the present is the way to be most faithful to the desires of 
this moment (Adler & Jelinek, 1986), ""doing"" emphasizing activity and action as the 
representative value symbolizing American culture, and ""becoming"" emphasizing the activity 
to develop all aspects required for the self and emphasizing development and growth. The 
final question asks what aspect of time we should primarily focus on. Its value orientation is 
classified into the ""past"" with the strong belief of the importance of past events, the ""present"" 
seeking life's pleasure at this moment, and the ""future"" expecting a better future than the 
present with the emphasis on the days to come (Kluckhohn & Strodtbeck, 1961).   
Schwartz (1992, 1994, 1999) classified the cultural dimensions into individual and 
national levels. First, he identified two cultural dimensions on individual level; ""openness to 
change versus conservation"" and ""self-enhancement versus self-transcendence."" And then, he 
eventually classified seven cultural dimensions on a national level through studying 38 
countries from 1988 to 1992 on the basis of the cultural dimension on the individual level 
(Table 3.2.). Three cultural dimensions corresponding to ""openness to change versus 
conservation"" were included at the individual level. ""Conservatism"" is the cultural value 
pursuing the maintenance of the status quo, etiquette, and protection of traditional order 
３０ 
 
comprising social values of close and harmonious relationships among people. ""Intellectual 
autonomy"" and ""affective autonomy"" are the values standing against conservatism. 
""Intellectual autonomy"" means the independent freedom value promoting individual interest 
and desire. And ""affective autonomy"" is the value promoting pleasure and delight. According 
to Schwartz (1992, 1994, 1999), Israel, Malaysia, and Bulgaria are included in conservative 
cultures whereas France, Switzerland, and Germany are included in the autonomous culture.  
 
Table 3.2. Schwartz’s cultural dimensions 
Individual level National level 
conservation conservatism 
openness to change intellectual autonomy 
affective autonomy 
self-enhancement hierarchy 
mastery 
self-transcendence egalitarian commitment 
harmony 
 
Four other cultural dimensions correspond to ""self-enhancement versus self-
transcendence."" Of them, the cultural dimensions on the national level included in ""self-
enhancement"" include ""hierarchy"" and ""mastery."" ""Hierarchy"" is related to the power value of 
trying to keep a constant distance between individuals and emphasizes the legitimacy of 
unfair allocation of roles, power, and resources through hierarchical structuralization. 
""Mastery,"" the concept meaning progressive domination in a society through self-assertion, 
emphasizes a positive effort to change surroundings and prevail over others in competition.  
Cultural dimensions on the national level included in ""self-transcendence"" include 
""egalitarian commitment"" and ""harmony."" ""Egalitarian commitment"" recommends voluntarily 
working for the welfare of others beyond egoistic desire. ""Harmony,"" the value emphasizing 
harmony with nature or environment, is similar to ""egalitarian commitment"" and contrary to 
３１ 
 
""mastery.""  
Schwartz (1992, 1994, 1999) classified China, Thailand, and Turkey as hierarchical 
cultures and Portugal, Italy, and Spain as egalitarian culture. Moreover, he classified China, 
Zimbabwe, and Greece into conquering cultures and Italy, Slovenia, and Mexico into 
harmonious cultures.  
Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1997) proposed a model focusing on the change in 
the relationship with value depending on the culture (Table 3.3.). The first cultural dimension 
focused on whether members of the culture deal with each other on the basis of standard rules 
or laws or on the basis of individual relationships. ""Universalism"" means the culture in which 
social norms and rules generally dominate and in which people are used to those norms and 
rules and adapt themselves to them. Under the theory that people should be treated equally 
under the rules, ""universalism"" implies equality and is characterized by clarity of message 
and the accurate setting of situations in communication. The US, Germany, and Switzerland 
showed high universalism. ""Particularism"" tends to emphasize those in special relationships 
with friends, brothers, sisters, or the self, instead of general citizens. Thus, ""particularism"" 
emphasizes strong paternalism and classification. ""Particularism"" is remarkably observed in 
France, Russia, along with most Asian countries. In those countries, people are sensitive to 
the inflow of ""universalism"" culture and even resistant to it. Moreover, conflict on the 
acceptance of a global culture and the persistence of localized native cultures are emerging as 
social issue.  
The second dimension focused on the difference in emphasis on individuals or groups 
depending on the culture. Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner (1997) named this dimension 
""Individualism/Communitarianism."" It is similar to ""individualism/collectivism"" as specified 
in another cultural dimension model. Unlike other models, the regions where Catholic 
３２ 
 
civilization developed including Germany, England, Canada, France, and Russia showed low 
individualism, but China and Japan demonstrated a relatively higher individualism tendency.  
The next dimension was marked by the degree that roles of reason and emotion 
dominated the relationship between culture and people. Those in a ""neutral"" culture 
thoughtfully restrain and control their emotion. However, people show their unrestricted 
emotions through smiling, laughing, ridiculing or gesturing in an ""affective"" culture. The 
emotion exposure level shows significant differences between cultures. Ethiopia and Japan 
showed the most neutral emotion exposure level overall. Where Austria showed the most 
neutral tendency in Europe, Spain, Italy, and France tended to be emotional. Communication 
also showed differences. Although information dependency was strong in an ""affective 
culture,"" a ""neutral"" culture focused on psychological motivations and symbolic expressions 
emphasizing moderate messages and implicative meanings.  
 
Table 3.3. Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner’s cultural dimensions 
Cultural dimensions Scales 
Are rules or relationships more important? universalism particularism 
Do people derive their identity from within themselves or their 
group? 
individualism communitarianism 
Are people free to express their emotions or restrained?  neutral affective 
Are an individual’s roles compartmentalized or integrated? specific diffuse 
How people are accorded respect and social status? achievement ascription 
 
The fourth dimension is whether the relationship level is integrated into one level or 
distributed into several levels at the same time. ""Specific"" culture has the individualism 
tendency classifying individual life and public business. ""Diffuse"" culture means the 
collectivism tendency that doesn’t classify individual life and public business. ""Specific"" 
cultures including the US prefer direct discourse. However, direct discourse is directly 
３３ 
 
connected to defamation in a ""diffuse"" culture. Japan, Mexico, France, and Russia are 
generally included in a ""diffuse"" culture. With respect to communication in those countries, 
people can start business or interpersonal relationships only after building a private 
relationship.  
The fifth dimension focused on how position and compensation are situated in a culture. 
In an ""achievement"" culture, position and compensation depend on achievement and 
performance. However, they are based on age, assets, class, and gender in ""ascription"" culture. 
Although titles are given when leaders acquire them through distinguished behavior in an 
""achievement"" culture, titles are used as the means to reinforce the hierarchical system in an 
""ascription"" culture.  
The GLOBE project is a recent academic effort to identify cultural dimensions. As the 
acronym GLOBE (""Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness"") means, 
the GLOBE project is a multinational research program to identify cultural effects on 
leadership and organization processes (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorman & Gupta, 2004). 
Proposed by House, the US management scientist, for the first time in the world, the GLOBE 
project investigated the correlation between social culture, organizational culture, and 
leadership, with over 170 scientists in 64 cultures participating. This project focused on the 
difference in leadership depending on the culture, and intensively investigated cultural 
features to identify such differences. While the GLOBE project is a cultural dimension model 
related to leadership, it shares the same context as Hofstede's model. The GLOBE project 
suggests cultural values as a theoretical framework because it was developed according to 
Hofstede's cultural dimension model as the next section describes.  
The GLOBE project identified nine cultural dimensions: ""power distance,"" ""uncertainty 
avoidance,"" ""institutional collectivism,"" ""in-group collectivism,"" ""assertiveness,"" ""gender 
３４ 
 
egalitarianism,"" ""future orientation,"" ""humane orientation,"" and ""performance orientation"" 
(Table 3.4.). The GLOBE project evaluated these dimensions along with two types of cultural 
manifestations. The cultural practices of an organization were described as ""as-if"" and the 
cultural values as ""should be."" In other words, ""as-if"" explains the culture of a country where 
members are included, and ‘""should-be"" explains the culture of a country which each member 
thinks to be desirable.  
 
Table 3.4. GLOBE’s cultural dimensions

In the GLOBE project, 62 cultures are classified into 10 cultural clusters; Latin Europe, 
Nordic Europe, Germanic Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Anglo, Confucian Asia, 
Southern Asia, Middle-East, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Each cultural cluster shows a different 
cultural dimension score. While Confucian Asia, Germanic Europe, and Anglo showed a 
higher value in ""performance orientation,"" Latin America and Eastern Europe showed lower 
values. And while Nordic Europe and Confucian Asia showed higher values in ""institutional 
３５ 
 
collectivism"", Germanic Europe and Latin Europe showed lower values.  
As explained above, GLOBE is based on Hofstede's model, but results from two models 
that are not always the same. ""As-if"" in GLOBE showed strong negative correlation against 
Hofstede's results for ""uncertainty avoidance"" but ""should-be"" demonstrated weak positive 
correlation. Furthermore, ""future orientation"" in GLOBE and ""long-term orientation"" by 
Hofstede, having similar cultural dimensions had a significant correlation in only 6 of 48 
countries, measured by both models. This indicated the difficulty in identifying common 
factors of cultural dimension models because such results were found by applying the same 
questions to organizational and national cultures in the GLOBE project (Hofstede, Hofstede, 
& Minkov, 2010). 
 
3.2. Hofstede's 5-D Model 
 
3.2.1. Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions 
Hofstede conducted a survey to identify the characteristics of culture using 116,000 
subjects in 53 countries working at IBM from 1967 to 1973. Then, he identified four cultural 
dimensions; ""Individualism/Collectivism,"" ""Power distance,"" ""Uncertainty avoidance,"" 
""Masculinity/Feminity"" (Hofstede, 1980). In 1991, he added ""Long-term orientation/Short-
term orientation,"" as a fifth dimension to address the limitation of viewing cultural 
dimensions based on Western perspectives (Hofstede, 1991).      
A number of researchers conducting comparative culture studies have used 
""Individualism/Collectivism"" (IDV) in a variety of fields as the most appropriate variable 
(Cutler, Erdem, & Javalgi, 1997; Taylor, Wilson, & Miracle, 1997; Triandis, 1995). The key 
point distinguishing individualism and collectivism is the extent to which individuals 
３６ 
 
scarifice their own goals for the good of an organization. Individuals are the most important 
unit of entity in individualism and they pursue self-orientation to which members in a society 
have no close relationship. In the collectivism culture, the members in a society exist in a 
social framework with close relationships. The loyalty of members in a social framework is 
emphasized and the members tend to emotionally depend on an organization (Hofstede, 
2001).    
Individualism encourages competition rather than cooperation and compensates 
individuals' achievements. The uniqueness of individuals is the most important value. In 
addition, individual goals take priority over organizational goals. Individuals tend not to 
depend on an organization or a group, and can have their own belongings, thoughts, ideas, 
evaluations or opinions. Such a culture emphasizes the individuals' leadership and 
achievement and values the individual's decision making in every aspect.  
However, the strict social framework classifying internal and external groups is the main 
feature of collectivism. Collectivism emphasizes group opinions and goals where an 
individual is included (rather than individual opinions or goals), the social norms and 
obligations specified by a group (rather than behaviors pursuing pleasure), the belief of 
sharing in a group (rather than belief in classifying the self and a group), and the readiness to 
cooperate as much as possible with group members (Triandis, 1995, 2001).  
Some studies suggested individualism is the cultural dimension of the Western world 
and collectivism of the Eastern world (Cutler, Erdem, & Javalgi, 1997; Frith & Sengupta, 
1991). Lodge and Vogel (1987) focused on the difference emphasizing individuals between 
the Western and the Eastern world. Hofstede also found this difference in a study. He pointed 
out that the IDV score was the highest in Anglo-Saxon countries, including England, the US, 
Australia, Canada, and also in Scandinavian and German-speaking countries including 
３７ 
 
Germany and Austria. However, Arab countries and Asian countries showed lower IDV 
scores. In particular, collectivism was prominent in Confucian countries including Korea 
(Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010).  
""Power distance"" (PDI) is a cultural orientation to power meaning the extent to which 
unfair power distribution in an organization is accepted (Hofstede, 2001; House, Hanges, 
Javidan, Dormans & Gupta, 2004). In other words, it’s the extent that hierarchical 
organizational inequality is accepted (Orr & Hauser, 2008).   
Generally, the higher the PDI score was, the more inequity was considered as a 
legitimate basis for social order, and indicated relatively how much easier the hierarchical 
relationship was accepted. In such a case, the members are dependent on those in higher 
ranks and are reluctant to express different opinions than from those in higher ranks. Cultures 
with higher PDI scores tended to be centralized, emphasizing titles and ranks, and had a 
higher ratio of supervisors. On the contrary, cultures with lower PDI scores didn’t accept 
inequality and tried to minimize social ranks and to eliminate inequality. Behavior that 
minimized laws and norms as much as possible predominated in organizations. Those in 
lower PDI cultures hold that everyone is close to power and believe that they can access 
power. Accordingly, social ranks constitute inequality, and roles are defined for convenience 
for members in such culture.  
While most Asian, Arab and African countries showed higher PDI scores, German-
speaking countries, Scandinavian countries, and Anglo-Saxon countries demonstrated lower 
PDI scores (Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov, 2010).    
""Uncertainty avoidance"" (UAI) can be defined as the extent that the members in a 
specific culture feel uncomfortable due to uncertain or unknown situations. Uncertainty 
avoidance means the tendency to reduce ambiguity (Hofstede, 2001). The UAI culture 
３８ 
 
strongly trying to avoid uncertainty shows a remarkable tendency to avoid uncertain and 
ambiguous things in every aspect. Thus, the culture provides stability to its members, doesn’t 
accept thoughts or behaviors beyond the normal course by imposing more official rules and 
regulations, and trusts experts or professional knowledge in pursuing a consensus of opinions. 
This culture type insists on the need for stipulated rules, plans, regulations, religious rituals, 
and ceremonies.  
However, a culture that is less active in avoiding uncertainty accepts uncertainty existing 
in life more easily and doesn’t feel significantly threatened by people or thoughts considered 
outside cultural norms. In addition, this culture type highly rates initiative or uniqueness, 
doesn’t like a human relationship structure bound by a hierarchical system, insists that norms 
should be minimized, and believes the self rather than experts.  
Countries in Latin America and in the Mediterranean showed higher UAI scores, and 
South Korea and Japan also showed higher UAI scores in Asia. However, other Asian 
countries demonstrated different cultural features with low or medium UAI scores. German-
speaking countries showed medium scores, and Scandinavian countries and English-speaking 
countries had low UAI scores (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010).  
""Masculinity/Femininity"" (MAS) determines the orientation to a relationship with others 
along with ""individualism/collectivism"" in Hofstede's cultural dimensions. It explains the 
gender difference in social roles which are culturally determined (Hofstede, 2001).  
Masculine culture emphasizes individual achievement, competition, confrontation, and 
aggressiveness-related values in an outcome-oriented culture. On the contrary, feminine 
culture is relationship-oriented, emphasizing unity, cooperation, and consideration or service 
to others (Hofstede, 2001; House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorman & Gupta, 2004). Scandinavian 
countries, Baltic countries, and South Korea and Thailand in Asia showed lower MAS scores 
３９ 
 
and German-speaking countries, China and English-speaking countries demonstrated higher 
MAS scores (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010).  
Hofstede's last cultural dimension, ""Long-term orientation/Short-term orientation"" (LTO) 
means the extent to which members are satisfied with delaying material, social, and 
emotional desires (Hofstede, 2001). It was found by the CVS (Chinese Value Survey) of 
Bond (1988). It addressed the criticism that held that existing studies cultural values were 
western-oriented and reflected the Asian cultural features.  
This cultural dimension compares long-term and short-term viewpoints in Confucian 
thought. Long-term orientation means the development of virtue by pursuing future 
compensation. In particular, tenacity and frugality are emphasized. Short-term orientation, the 
extreme opposite of long-term orientation, means developing virtue related to the past and the 
present. In particular, it emphasizes the execution of social obligations, respect for tradition 
and maintenance of dignity.  
Meanwhile, Minkov (2007) suggested two new cultural dimensions ""indulgence-
restraint"" and ""monumentalism-flexhumility"" based on the WVS (World Value Survey) in 
2007. ""monumentalism-flexhumility"" showed very strong correlation with existing LTO. 
Hofstede and his colleagues estimated new LTO scores based on WVS and named it LTO-
WVS, which replaced the existing LTO-CVS. LTO-WVS and LTO-CVS showed very similar 
results as cultural values with similar concepts. However, LTO-CVS explained the LTO 
implications related to a Chinese origin, as it was based on questionnaires from Chinese 
researchers. Furthermore, the studies of national LTO-CVS scores were limited to 23 
countries, and the results acquired by expanding the same survey showed low reliability. 
However, LTO-WVS repeatedly investigated the data from a global survey database and 
expanded the basic classification from CVS into 93 countries (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 
４０ 
 
2010).  
The national LTO-CVS scores indicated that East Asian countries pursued LTO. 
European countries and Anglo-Saxon countries demonstrated medium scores, and Nigeria 
and Pakistan showed the tendency to pursue short-term orientation. LTO-WVS also showed 
similar results in that East Asian countries had LTO. However, 6 in 23 countries analyzed in 
LTO-CVS showed significant differences in LTO-WVS scores. Pakistan, Germany, and 
England were classified as countries tending to have LTO culture and Brazil and Hong Kong 
as short-term orientation cultures (Hofstede, 2001; Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010).  
 
Table 3.5. Hofstede's cultural dimensions

Masculinity/Femininity The difference of gender on the social roles which are culturally

material, social, and emotional desires 
 
Hofstede's model provided the practical and conceptual sets of values for comparing 
culture the first time (Watson, Lysonski, Gillan & Raymore, 2002). Culture studies before 
Hofstede considered social phenomenon to be a marginal factor because there was no scale to 
empirically investigate cultural effects. Hofstede's model provides a scale from 0 to 100 by 
cultural dimension and enables researchers to accurately examine the differences in national 
culture by placing a country on the scale compared to other countries. This approach enabled 
researchers to identify the difference in national culture via numbers and to compare cultures 
among more than 3 countries. Moreover, the cultural distance between countries can be 
４１ 
 
measured by the difference in scores presented in Hofstede's model (Kogut & Singh, 1988).   
By quantitatively comparing national cultural differences, Hofstede's model has been 
used in diverse fields since the 1990s. In particular, it was used to identify how difference in 
values depending on culture is expressed in advertising or marketing, what values reflect 
culture, and to estimate what is suitable for a specific culture (Albers-Miller & Gelb, 1996; 
De Mooij, 2004; Taylor, Wilson, & Miracle, 1997).  
Several studies verified Hofstede's model's reliability and validity. Sondergaard (1994) 
examined 61 studies using Hofstede's model and found that the model was stable over time 
and depending on population size. Moreover, in studies reproducing Hofstede's national 
culture classification, a few countries showed a slight change in value classification, but 
generally demonstrated the same results as the original study (Cutler, Erdem, & Javalgi, 1997; 
Fernandez, Carlson, Stepina, & Nicholson, 1997; Wildeman, Hofstede, Noorderhaven, Thurik, 
Verhoeve, & Wennekers, 1999).   
Some criticized Hofstede's model even though his extensive and innovative study 
improved understanding of and differences between national cultures (Brett & Okumura, 
1998; Dorfman & Howell, 1988; Roberts & Boyacigiller, 1984; Schwartz, 1994; Steenkamp, 
2001). Such criticism focused mainly on the survey and sample in Hofstede's study. He had 
developed the model by 2 surveys executed at IBM from 1967 to 1973. The questions used in 
the surveys were not developed on theories but were selected from the survey, which was 
designed to evaluate workers' satisfaction, recognition of duties, and individual beliefs and 
goals. Thus, some criticized that the Hofstede's cultural dimensions couldn’t embrace all 
cultures because it was not designed to identify the national culture dimension (Dorfman & 
Howell, 1988; Schwartz, 1994). Furthermore, some criticized that the samples selected by 
Hofstede didn’t accurately reflect all spectrums of national culture and the countries added in 
４２ 
 
the further studies could be classified into different dimensions than he originally proposed. 
Moreover, some pointed out that IBM workers in the various countries didn’t represent the 
countries' general demographic characteristics with respect to education, scientific and 
technological background, and exposure to modernizing forces (Huang, 1995; Myers & Tan, 
2002; Schwartz, 1994). 
In spite of the criticism, Hofstede's model is considered the paradigm of value-based 
models for comparing cultures and its reliability and validity has been verified through many 
successive studies. In addition, it has been extensively used in a variety of fields because it 
can quantitatively identify cultural effects. 
 
3.2.2. Hofstede's Model in Communication studies  
The cultural dimension which was used the most in Hofstede's model was 
Individualism/Collectivism (Cutler, Erdem, & Javalgi, 1997; Taylor, Wilson & Miracle, 1997; 
Triandis, 1990). This was because IDV was the cultural dimension with the highest 
explanatory power for indicating the difference in communication approaches between the 
Eastern and Western world (Cai, Wilson, & Drake, 2000; Cho, Kwon, Gentry, Jun, & Kropp, 
1999; GudyKunst, Matsumot, Ting-Toomey, Nishida, Kim, & Heyman, 1996; Han & Shavitt, 
1994; Lin, 2001; Mortenson, 2002).    
The most significant difference in communication between individualism and 
collectivism is the clarity of message. It corresponds to the ""High Context/Low Context"" 
concept explained by Hall (1981, 1992). Collectivism culture has nonverbal and ambiguous 
expression whereas the individualism culture emphasizes the clarity of message. Since direct 
speech in the collectivism culture makes a group and an individual distinct, indirect speech is 
preferred. While communication in Asia is mostly ambiguous, indirect, and implicit, 
４３ 
 
communication in America and Europe tends to be direct and explicit (Gudykunst & Ting-
Toomey, 1988; Hall, 1976; Hall & Hall, 1990; Samovar & Porter, 2004; Triandis, 2001). 
IDV is applied to advertising most frequently in communication studies. Such studies 
focused mainly on content analysis related to the appeal and expression approach in 
advertising. The most representative case is the correlation between the IDV score and the 
figures in advertising. Frith and Sengupta (1991) investigated how the IDV score of 
Hofstede's model explained the difference in advertising techniques among countries. They 
measured the number of figures in print media advertising in the US, England, and India. In 
accordance with their analysis, the higher IDV score was, the more likely the advertisement 
was to depict only one person. However, the lower IDV score was, the more groups were 
shown, and the less likely it was that only one person was depicted. Alden, Hoyer, and Lee 
(1993) also analyzed TV commercials in the US, Germany, Thailand, and South Korea. They 
found that a strong correlation between IDV scores and figures in the commercials. The 
percentage of commercials depicting fewer than 3 figures was low in Thailand and South 
Korea which show a collectivism culture where the percentage of low depicted figures was 
high in commercials in the US and Germany with their individualism cultures. But on the 
contrary, Cutler and his colleagues identified a weak correlation between the number of 
characters in advertising and the IDV score. They insisted that the IDV was only a minor 
factor explaining cultural differences in advertising.  
Communication difference measured by PDI are found in terms of bidirectionality. 
Bidirectional communication is notable in cultures with low power distance. Their 
communication actors relate to a horizontal relationship and prefer the approach of coming to 
an agreement through conversation and discussion. In this type of culture, children are 
allowed to argue with parents and learn how to say ""No"" in the families in their early years. 
４４ 
 
Furthermore, students argue with teachers in schools and can criticize teachers. Members in 
such culture read a variety of newspapers, but show low confidence in newspapers.  
Unidirectional communication, however, is prominent in cultures with high power 
distance. Communicating actors in such a culture emphasize vertical relationships depending 
on social ranks, and thus the communication types vary in relevant cultures. For example, a 
superior in a specific organization focuses on how to effectively impose duties rather than 
discuss them with subordinates, and it is very rare that subordinates provide feedback to 
superior's opinions. Members in the culture with high power distance read relatively a few 
newspapers, but had high confidence in the newspapers they read (Hofstede, Hofstede, & 
Minkov, 2010; Khare, 1999; Khatri, 2009; Mintzberg, 1993; Richardson & Smith, 2007).   
Zandpour, Chang, and Catalano (1992) identified that PDI was an important factor 
affecting differences in advertising among cultures. A culture with a high PDI score tended to 
depend on more psychological appeals using celebrities. Moreover, figures in TV 
commercials are relatively old, or the ads predominantly appeal to social class structure by 
showing student-instructor or father-son relations out of respect for elders.  
Communication differences depending on the acceptance of uncertainty are based on the 
authority of the message. In such a society, it is recommended that communicating actors use 
more explicit, logical, and direct messages to relieve uncertainty in their communications. To 
this end, experts are mainly used to provide information in a culture trying to avoid 
uncertainty. The authority of the message by experts or those having special knowledge 
maximizes the communication's effect on the receiver. Accordingly, approaches enhancing 
the authority of the message have been frequently applied in such cultures, including 
explanation, composition, long advertising copy, experiment, or expert testimony. Conversely, 
approaches that satirize experts frequently appear in cultures accepting uncertainty and 
４５ 
 
humor has been used in many cases (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010; Kim, 2004).   
Communication difference according to MAS depends on the purpose of the 
communication. In the culture with strong masculinity, the so called ""report"" communication 
type delivering information is prominent. On the contrary, the ""rapport"" communication type 
is promoted for improving relationships and friendships in a culture with strong femininity. 
Masculine culture emphasizes data and facts where feminine culture emphasizes stories 
(Tannen, 1992). Such features rise to the surface in studies on Internet usage. Although the 
Internet is basically a personal tool, its purposes varies by culture type. While the Internet is 
used for relationships in a feminine culture, it can be used for reports in a masculine culture 
(De Mooji, 1998; Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010). Nevertheless, the communication 
difference in terms of MAS has not been essentially studied before now.    
The reflection of masculinity in the advertising focused on exaggeration, persuasion, and 
comparison, but reflection of femininity emphasized consideration and tenderness. For 
gender roles, a father and a son, and a mother and a daughter were found in masculine culture 
advertising. On the contrary, a father and a daughter, and a mother and a son appeared in 
feminine culture advertising. While masculine culture advertising appeal revolved around 
pursuing work and success, feminine culture advertising appeal revolved around pursuing 
pursued friendship and relationships. Moreover, the lower the MAS index was, the more its 
effect was reflected in advertising (An & Kim, 2007; De Mooji, 1998; Gilly, 1988; Kim, 1996; 
Milner & Collins, 2000).  
Communication difference relating to LTO revolved around the usage of symbolic 
meaning. Cultures with short-term orientation were interested in categorization and so 
applied the rules controlling a specific category. In addition, such culture showed a strong 
tendency to use formal logic in the troubleshooting process.  
４６ 
 
On the contrary, cultures with LTO tried to identify a specific issue in the whole context. 
So such cultures considered a number of relevant factors around the issue. Formal logic was 
almost not used at all for troubleshooting. A LTO culture also frequently used symbols to 
effectively demonstrate what kinds of relationship a specific issue formed in the whole 
context. However, not many communication styles symbolically demonstrate a specific issue 
in a culture with STO, emphasizing the analysis that is required for categorization (Nisbett, 
2003). 
While LTO is the variable which can represent communication characteristics in the 
Western and Eastern world in a more thoughtful way, existing studies substantially dismissed 
its importance. The existing studies related to LTO mainly examined the advertising field. 
The representative case examines how harmony between nature and human beings, which 
was investigated as important issue in a culture with LTO, was reflected in advertising. That 
value was generated because a LTO culture doesn’t like severe confrontation or directly 
mentioning products. Advertising purposes in a relevant region were found to be aimed at 
building the reputation of a company's reliability rather than directly selling its products. 
Accordingly, visual images related to nature, including bamboo, flowers, or fallen leaves 
symbolizing seasons, appear with important meaning (Kim, 2004).

4. NANOTECHNOLOGY AND MEDIA FRAME  
 
4.1. Nanotechnology 
 
4.1.1. Definition of Nanotechnology 
Since Feynman, the physicist, for the first time in 1959 mentioned the possibility that 
material on the level of individual atoms and molecules was manipulated, in his lecture, 
""There's plenty of room at the bottom,"" the discussion became earnest as Norio (1974) 
described the ability to delicately generate material on the nanometer (nm) level as 
""nanotechnology.""  
While nanotechnology has been defined in various ways depending on R&D policies 
and regulations in each country, it is generally specified as the scientific technology enabling 
people to understand and control material on the nanometer level. One nm means 1 billionth 
of a meter. Materials smaller than 100nm have completely different characteristics and are 
governed by the laws of quantum mechanics rather than physics (Table 4.1.).  
Nanotechnology constitutes the materials and systems having physical, chemical, and 
biological characteristics that are newly emerged, due to their sizes being smaller than 100nm. 
The change of characteristics at the nanometer level is caused by quantum mechanics, wave 
features, and interfacial phenomenon. Such nanostructure is the smallest material which 
human beings can make. Accordingly, nanotechnology aims to acquire the ability to control 
and effectively use structures and materials at the atomic and molecular level (EU, 2009; 
Japan, 2001; UK, 2004)  
The new phenomenon generated by nanometer size theoretically brings about 
unexpected results in most cases. If we can control the size of a certain characteristic, we can 
４８ 
 
improve the functions of the material beyond the limit we identified up to now. For example, 
reducing the size of structure is linked to the identification of material with unique 
characteristics including Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), quantum dots, thin film, DNA structure, 
and laser emitters. Consequently, nanotechnology controls the basic characteristics and 
phenomena on the nanometer level and so provides the potential to change goods and 
products generated by human beings in almost all fields.

taking advantage of its material characteristics unique to nano size, so that it can bring 
technological innovation in various fields 
 
4.1.2. Benefit and Risk of Nanotechnology 
Although it is thought that nanotechnology provides substantial benefits to human 
beings, some have suggested potential risks. For example, nanotechnology can be applied to 
improve food safety and quality. However, the food contaminated on the nanometer scale will

3 나노기술개발촉진법 (by Korean 'Law for Promoting R&D of Nanotechnology') 
４９ 
 
be accumulated in a body directly through the intestines and the nanomaterial included in the 
food package will penetrate the body and emit toxicity (Handy & Shaw, 2007).   
The potential benefits and risks of nanotechnology have been studied in three aspects; 
environment, health and society. For nanotechnology's environmental impact, manufacturing 
materials at the nanometer scale will improve environmental benefits by increasing the 
efficiency of resources and reducing the discharge of contaminants and waste (Drexler, 
Peterson, & Pergamit, 1991; Mulhall, 2002). Nanotechnology generates new materials that do 
not exist up to now and control and rebuild existing materials at the nanometer scale. Then, 
resources that are consumed in daily life can be reduced. Nanotechnology will also improve 
the product life cycle by preventing the degradation of product performance as parts and 
components wear out. In addition, nanofilters or molecular films can block the transfer of fine 
contaminants into the environment (Roco & Bainbridge, 2005).   
However, there are potential risks from emerging technology that are not verified and 
can’t be controlled. Nanotechnology can be a new contamination source, which is not 
biologically decomposed, like POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants). Furthermore, it is known 
that nanomaterials cause air, soil, and water pollution. Each nanomaterial is insoluble. 
However, when they are combined, the resulting compound's property is changed to be 
soluble and acts like a sterilizer. Moreover, nanotechnology can constitute a severe threat 
against the ecologic system by killing bacteria in the food chain (Bystrzejewska-Piotrowska, 
Golimowski, & Urban, 2009; Snir, 2008).  
The most extreme outlook on the risks of nanotechnology on the environment is 
Drexler’s ""gray goo."" It is a worst-case dystopia scenario in which ""nanobot"" replicating itself 
eats everything on the earth, and is beyond the control by human beings (Drexler, 1986). 
５０ 
 
Although mainstream science is relatively dubious of such a scenario, the question of risks 
has been continuously presented (Joy, 2000; Smalley, 2001).  
Regarding health impacts, nanotechnology has potential benefits as it can help identify 
and treat disease and improve physical functions. Doctors can identify atherosclerosis and 
Alzheimer’s disease earlier using nanotechnology. Moreover, the development of medical 
imaging using nanotechnology contributes to identifying diseases at the atomic and molecular 
levels and to tracking malignant cells. In the future, nanobots can destroy viruses and cancer 
inside a body, can improve the body structure damaged by aging, and can remove waste 
accumulated in a brain so human beings can live younger and healthier (Roco & Bainbridge, 
2005). Nanotechnology will also be used to improve the physical ability. Human beings will 
be able to have sensory organs equivalent to that of other animals or bones which are resistant 
to being broken (Wood, Jones, & Geldart, 2003).   
However, nanotechnology can be a critical health risk. Recent studies indicated that 
nanomolecules absorbed through air pile up in a lung due to their very tiny size and so can 
cause chronic diseases (Chau, Wu, & Yen, 2007; Poland et al., 2008). Furthermore, the risk is 
more serious because it is not scientifically known what harm could be caused by 
nanomaterials being directly absorbed through the digestive system (Chaudhry et al., 2008; 
House of Lords, 2010; Siegrist, Stampfli, Kastenholz, & Keller, 2008). Nanomaterials can 
easily pass through intercellular barriers and collect in a body or be moved through blood. 
However, its uncertainty is very high because the long-term impacts of nanomaterials are not 
known (Chun, 2009) 
Another health risk is the toxicity of nanomaterials. When size is reduced to the 
nanometer level, unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that can’t be seen in the 
world are generated. At this point, toxicity is also produced. Some studies reported that the 
５１ 
 
toxicity of nanomaterials destroyed the immune system and caused oxidative stress and 
cancers (Handy & Shaw, 2007; Warheit et al., 2004). In an experiment on lung damage after 
injection of a single carbon nanotube (SWCNT) in mice, the death ratio within 7 days 
exceeded 55% among mice exposed to nanomaterials of more than 0.5mg. The experimental 
also showed weight loss, lung damage, necrosis, granulomas, and peribronchial inflammation 
(Lam, James, McCluskey, & Hunter, 2004).  
Nanotechnology has also been generating social issues. There is a ""nanodivide"" that is 
aggravating inequality due to this emerging technology. Nanodivide in the world means the 
gap between advanced countries and developing countries in their ability to develop 
nanotechnology an issue directly connected to the national economy. To the extent that 
nanotechnology affects the competitiveness of goods and services, the economic gap between 
countries can’t help being widened more than it is now. Meanwhile, the inequality between 
the rich with the ability to purchase goods and services using nanotechnology and the poor 
without such an ability will also expand even within a country. For example, even when new 
therapy using nanotechnology is developed in the medical industry, the cost will be expensive 
due to its technology-intensive properties. Accordingly, the gap between being able to receive 
medical benefits between the class that can actively use nanotechnology-based therapy and 
the class which can’t will be widened. Moreover, if nanotechnology developed by big 
enterprises is exclusively controlled by patents or intellectual property rights like 
bioengineering currently is, the nanodivide between social classes can’t help being widened 
(Arnall, 2003).   
There are also potential risks against citizenship and human rights (Royal Society & 
Royal Academy of Engineering, 2004). Nanotechnology has helped develop innovative 
sensing devices like micro sensors. In particular, the remote sensors with a network 
５２ 
 
application have been extensively increased through the convergence of nanotechnology and 
information technology. Sensors on the nanometer level can be used to monitor individuals 
and to infringe on privacy (ETC Group, 2003; Mnyusiwalla, Daar, & Singer, 2003; Van den 
Hoven & Vermass, 2007). Accordingly, Mehta (2003) warned of the risk of 
""nanopanopticism,"" the monitoring system using nanotechnology. If nanotechnology is used 
to monitor the privacy of individuals, it will bring fatal and extensive side effects and then 
ultimately threaten democracy.

4.1.3. Initiatives and Regulations on Nanotechnology 
Nanotechnology improves the quality of life and plays a pivotal role in developing an 
economy. Therefore, many countries in the world have been implementing a variety of 
initiatives for the R&D of nanotechnology. Investment in nanotechnology is 10 billion USD 
every year and the related government budgets reached 65 billion USD in the world (Harper, 
2011).    
The US, with the highest worldwide nanotechnology investment, has pledged to provide 
1.5 billion USD to the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in 2015, and of the invested 
funds, over a third is invested in basic research (National Science and Technology Council, 
2014a, 2014b). The EU selected nanotechnology as the key issue of the seventh Framework 
５３ 
 
Program (FP7), the research and development funding program. The EU provided 3.5 billion 
Euro to the investment program entitled ""Nanoscience, Nanotechnologies, Materials and new 
Product Technologies (NMP)"" for a total investment amount for the FP7 of 10.8 billion Euro 
(European Commission, 2010). 
Nanotechnology investment in Germany and Austria has also occurred along with the 
EU's FP7. In 2010, Germany invested 400 million Euro on R&D by establishing the ""Nano 
initiative 2010"" and expanded its support of nanotechnology by announcing the new ""Action 
plan nanotechnology 2015"" in 2014. Accordingly, there are about 1,000 companies related to 
nanotechnology and over 70,000 employees who have been working in the nanotechnology 
business in Germany (BMBF, 2014). Austria also implemented the ""Austrian NANO 
initiative"" since 2002 and has invested 23 million Euro for R&D from 2008 to 2010 as well 
as 45 million Euro from 2004 to 2007 (BMWF, 2009)  
In Asia, South Korea and Japan secured high-level nanotechnology through initiatives. 
Japan selected nanotechnology as one of four key research fields in its ""Science and 
Technology basic Plan"" which has been implemented over five years since 2001 (Japan, 2001, 
2006). South Korea also invested 230 million USD in 2012 only by establishing a law for 
R&D (MEST, 2011).  
While there commonly are initiatives supporting nanotechnology in most countries, 
nanotechnology regulations vary country. Such regulations are classified into regulations 
against the risk of nanotechnology and regulations on materials and goods using 
nanotechnology. The former deals with the technological risks, evaluation, and social impacts. 
However, the regulations most are not yet actually implemented but studies on them have 
been ongoing. Social impact and risk communication related to nanotechnology have been 
investigated in America and Europe since late the 2000s, but there is no investment on such a 
５４ 
 
project in other regions (Linkov, Satterstrom, Moinica, Hansen, & Davis, 2009; Nasu & 
Faunce, 2012; Seong & Hwang, 2012).   
Regulations on materials and goods using nanotechnology are implemented mostly to 
control toxicity of chemicals. The US adopted enforced self-regulation for nanotechnology 
voluntary regulations by parties related to nanotechnology. The US government focused on 
collecting information to promote communicating the risks through building a database. In 
information-based regulations, external pressure plays an important role in implementing 
voluntary regulations (Linkov, Satterstrom, Moinica, Hansen, & Davis, 2009). In the 
""Nanoscale Material Stewardship Program (NMSP)"" the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) implemented, the US government provides information on whether new nanomaterials 
as well as existing nanomaterials are subject to the ""Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)"" 
as well providing information on nanomaterials produced or imported for commercial 
purposes (EPA, 2009).    
The EU adopted more strict command regulations than the US. The EU introduced the 
regulations entitled ""Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH)"" in 
2007. It is a monitoring system registering and evaluating all kinds of chemicals produced 
and traded in Europe, and includes nanomaterials. The nanotechnology of EU countries 
including Germany and Austria is subject to this EU-level regulation (Mantovani, Porcari, 
Morrison, & Geertsma, 2012; Nasu & Faunce, 2012).   
However, the regulations on nanotechnology other than in the regions mentioned above 
are currently inadequate. In particular, while South Korea and Japan are seen to have high 
technological competitiveness, the regulations in those countries have been merely pursued as 
an academic project up to now (Seong & Hwang, 2012).  
５５ 
 
In conclusion, most countries have been focusing on support rather than regulation in the 
situation in which potential benefits and risks related to nanotechnology exist together. And 
many initiatives concentrate on basic nanotechnology research and commercialization using 
the results of research. The risks of nanotechnology, however, have not been investigated 
sufficiently.  
 
4.2. Framing of Nanotechnology 
 
4.2.1. News Coverage as Heuristic 
It is difficult for the public to understand emerging technologies. Since scientific 
knowledge quickly advances, advanced and professional knowledge is required to understand 
emerging technologies. Furthermore, such technologies have complicated structures because 
they are generated by bringing together diverse kinds of technologies (Stephens, 2005). 
Therefore, although the public in a modern society accesses scientific information more 
easily than in the past, they are not sufficiently provided with scientific information helping 
them understand emerging technologies.  
Emerging technologies are a theme to be considered in politics, not simply in science. 
Modern society achieved its modernization based on rationality due to scientific advancement 
and technological innovation. However, the technology also expanded the risk beyond the 
control of human beings. In other words, the public don’t understand the causes of the risk 
generated by technology and can’t easily control such risks (Beck, 1986). In particular, 
emerging technologies show far higher uncertainty due to their advanced expertise and 
complexity. Accordingly, the discussion among social members in the public sphere is the 
５６ 
 
prerequisite for accepting the emerging technologies with its accompanying potential benefits 
and risks to society.  
Nanotechnology has all the characteristics described above. Nanotechnology deals with 
new phenomena beyond the limit of physics, chemistry, and biology on the nanometer level. 
Accordingly, it is a complicated and professional field which the public can’t easily 
understand. Moreover, since nanotechnology has significant impact on the entire society as 
well as individuals, including health and economy, social acceptance of nanotechnology must 
be urgently discussed.

To understand the characteristics of nanotechnology and determining how to socially 
accept it, the public has to accurately understand nanotechnology. However, social awareness 
on nanotechnology still needs to be improved due to the lack of information on the 
technology. In an EU survey (Eurobarometer, 2010), only 46% of respondents answered that 
they had heard about nanotechnology. Sixty-five percent of respondents in Germany 
answered that they heard about it, which was higher than neighboring countries including 
５７ 
 
France (53.9%), England (47.5%), and Austria (47%). And in the US 42.0%, 49% and 37% of 
respondents answered that they never heard about nanotechnology in 2006, 2008 and 2009, 
respectively (Hart Research Associates, 2007, 2008, 2009). In South Korea, 75% of 
respondents answered that they heard about the nanotechnology, which was higher than the 
EU and the US. However, 83% of those who reported answered that they didn’t know exactly 
the nanotechnology. This result indicated the low knowledge level related to the 
nanotechnology in South Korea (ME, 2011). Only 39.1% of respondents in Japan had heard 
about nanotechnology. In the survey implemented both in South Korea and Japan, only 2.4% 
and 2.0% recognized nanotechnology as a science having a social impact in South Korea and 
Japan, respectively (KOFAC, 2012). 
To explain public opinions on nanotechnology, it is necessary to examine how public 
attitude towards emerging technologies is formed. In the case of emerging technologies 
including nanotechnology, there is insufficient information provided to help the public judge 
such technologies. Public opinion on emerging technologies thus has to be created without 
information or with insufficient information.  
Earlier studies on science communication focused on the ""scientific literacy model"" 
governing how much information on emerging technologies was collected and used. The 
model insisted that those with more technological knowledge accepted the relevant 
technologies more easily than those without knowledge. Thus, the tendency to collect more 
information on emerging technologies seemed to affect social acceptance and public opinions 
on the technologies (Bauer & Schoon, 1993; Laugksch, 2000; Miller, 1998). This model is 
significant because it discovered that the public judged and determined whether to support 
technologies based on insufficient information, and the model also examined the relationship 
between social acceptance and the amount of media usage. However, the model had the limit 
５８ 
 
that scientific knowledge didn’t verify the correlation with attitude on technologies. 
Consequently, a high knowledge level on emerging technologies is not the key factor 
determining public opinion but merely means better understanding on the general scientific 
issues (Scheufele & Lewenstein, 2005). 
Since the scientific literacy model, science communication research concentrated on the 
cognitive miser model, dealing with the public's cognition process on emerging technologies. 
The model assumed that the process where the public judged new technology without 
information or with insufficient information was rational (Fiske & Taylor, 1991). People 
general apply cognitive effort only for the information bringing benefits to themselves. Such 
behavior is called ""low-information rationality"" by Popkin (1994), who pointed out that it 
was rational that people didn’t apply any cognitive effort for an individual's pursuit of 
information related to issues in which it was difficult to identify an individual's interest, such 
as nanotechnology. Accordingly, the public doesn’t use all information for judging emerging 
technologies. Instead, the public depends on heuristic like value predispositions or news 
coverage (Ho, Brossard, & Scheufele, 2008).       
Heuristic is the basis applied to the minimum effort by individuals to determine a 
specific issue. Since a heuristic process omits or reduces the steps dealing with decision 
making, it is a limited mode of information processing that requires less cognitive effort and 
fewer cognitive resources than a systematic process (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). By extension, 
individuals depend mainly on value predisposition and news coverage to determine their 
attitude on emerging technologies in modern society (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989). 
The representative case is that the public determines a number of controversial issues related 
to evolutionary biology and astronomical physics by reference to religious belief.  
５９ 
 
In particular, news coverage provides key heuristics to the public for emerging 
technologies requiring political judgment due to significant social impact and professional 
knowledge, such as nanotechnology (Nisbet, Brossard, & Kroepsch, 2003; Nisbet & 
Lewenstein, 2002). Science's reality to the public is what access through media (Nelkin, 
1987).    
The importance of media affecting public determination and social awareness on 
nanotechnology has been examined by a number of studies (Anderson, Petersen, Wilkinson, 
& Allan, 2009; Donk, Meta, Kohring, & Marcinkowski, 2012; Ho, Scheufele, & Corley, 2010; 
Petersen, Anderson, Allan, & Wilkinson, 2009; Scheufele & Lewenstein, 2005; Schmidt 
Kjærgaard, 2010; Te Kulve, 2006). The media helps the public understand complicated 
technological issues more easily and facilitates the interaction between the public and science 
by proposing the laws and regulations maximizing public benefits. Accordingly, the roles of 
news coverage have been strengthened regarding scientific themes, for example global 
warming, stem cells, and nanotechnology, which have to be considered together with politics  
(Ho, Brossard & Scheufele, 2008).          
In news coverage, Scheufele and Lewenstein (2005) found that the media frame 
provides key heuristics to the public. They pointed out that news coverage on nanotechnology 
was similar to the development pattern of the media frame which was identified when 
biotechnology became a social issue. While a high knowledge level of nanotechnology hasn't 
affected its public judgment, the approach of reproducing scientific issues through the media 
has affected on the attitude on nanotechnology (Figure 4.1.). In conclusion, individuals judge 
nanotechnology based on media framing and their judgment expands to form the public 
opinion.

4.2.2. Media Frame of Nanotechnology 
The media frame of nanotechnology has been investigated in many countries in the 
recent decade. Most studies covered the US, the United Kingdom, and Canada (Anderson, 
Allan, Petersen, & Wilkinson, 2005; Laing, 2006; Lewenstein, Gorss, & Radin, 2005; Weaver, 
Lively, & Bimber, 2009), Germany (Donk, Meta, Kohring, & Marcinkowski, 2012; Kohring, 
Marcinkowski, Donk, Metag, & Friedemann, 2011), Norway (Kjolberg, 2009), Denmark 
(Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010), Slovenia (Groboljsek & Mali, 2012), Poland (Lemańczyk, 2012), 
Turkey (Kamanlığlu & Güzeloğlu, 2010), and Italy (Arnaldi, 2008). Studies on media 
representation of nanotechnology also covered Anglo-Saxon countries (Faber, MacKinnon, & 
６１ 
 
Petroccine, 2005; Fitzgerald & Rubin, 2010; Friedman & Egolf, 2005; Stephens, 2005) and 
Europe (Grobe, Eberhard, & Hutterli, 2005; Metag & Marcinkowski, 2014; Te Kulve, 2006; 
Veltri & Crescentini, 2010; Zimmer, Hertel, & Böl, 2008) However, the studies of the media 
frame in East Asian countries including South Korea and Japan have not been reported yet.  
The media frame on nanotechnology in existing studies is classified into three types: the 
scientific project frame, the benefit frame, and the risk/regulation frame. The scientific 
project frame includes themes on R&D, scientific discoveries, and national initiatives. It has 
shown up in news coverage most frequently. The benefits frame focused on the economic and 
medical benefits generated by nanotechnology. The risk/regulation frame warns of the 
potential risk which may occur due to nanotechnology and emphasizes suggesting policies to 
overcome the risks.  
The scientific project frame and benefits frame are frequently discussed along with 
""scientific advancement"" and the risk/regulation frame along with ""Pandora’s Box."" The 
scientific project and benefits frames are closely related to science and technology policy, and 
the risk/regulation frame occurs along with social conflicts in many cases (Lemańczyk, 2012; 
Lewenstein, Gorss, & Radin, 2005). 
Besides the above frames, researchers observe other diverse frames including the 
science fiction and popular culture frames (Anderson, Allan, Petersen, & Wilkinson, 2005), 
the public accountability frame (Lewenstein, Gorss, & Radin, 2005), the ambivalence frame 
(Donk, Meta, Kohring, & Marcinkowski, 2012), the education frame (Schmidt Kjærgaard, 
2010), and the visionary/futuristic frame (Kamanlığlu & Güzeloğlu, 2010).  
While the benefit-oriented frames (e.g. scientific project frame, benefits frame) mainly 
represent nanotechnology positively, risk-oriented frames (e.g. risk/regulation frame) 
describe nanotechnology negatively. Positive nanotechnology news coverage is found more 
６２ 
 
often than negative. The same tendency was observed regardless of the time when and where 
studies were executed.  
Except for studies Lewenstein, Gorss, & Radin (2005) (on the news coverage from 1986 
to 2004) and Schmidt Kjaergarrd (2010) (from 1996 to 2006) conducted, most media frame 
studies on nanotechnology focused on the 2000s. This was because most countries 
substantially started their nanotechnology initiatives after 2001 when the US started NNI 
which reflected higher public and media nanotechnology interest. Accordingly, the media 
frames in the relevant periods emphasized the development and technological benefits of 
nanotechnology depending on national support. However, the situation gradually changed as 
the risks of nanotechnology were pointed out starting in the mid-2000s and regulation-
emphasizing frames increased (Weaver, Lively, & Bimber, 2009).  
As for the differences between countries where media frame studies on nanotechnology 
were conducted, US media had greater interest in nanotechnology's economic benefits, but 
European and Canadian media focused relatively more on risks and regulations (Lemańczyk, 
2012). Nevertheless, since the frames emphasizing nanotechnology benefits accounted for the 
overwhelming ratio in all countries' media, the difference between America and Europe or 
Canada is insignificant. In Laing (2006)'s study, although the US media focused on economic 
and investment benefits more than Canadian media, the Canadian media focused on scientific 
and research benefits from nanotechnology more than the US. However, it is difficult to say 
that there is the essential difference since the rate of media frames emphasizing 
nanotechnology benefits (71%) was overwhelmingly more than those emphasizing risks 
(18%).  
In addition, there are few studies which directly compared the differences between more 
than 3 countries. The comparison was generally restricted mainly to English-speaking 
６３ 
 
countries including America, England, and Canada (Laing, 2006). Indeed, most studies 
focused on analyzing the media in a single country or in countries speaking the same 
language. And there are limits to comparing the differences between countries because 
extraction and identification of frames vary in studies.   
Particularly, it should be noted that there are no studies on the media frames of 
nanotechnology in Asia, especially South Korea and Japan, which have top-level 
nanotechnology. Most studies are also concentrated on the late 2000s when various initiatives 
had been implemented. Thus, there is no study on the 2010s, when the public has experienced 
the efficiency of technology by actually having used the products applying nanotechnology. 
Moreover, there is insufficient data on the periods when a variety of regulations started to be 
discussed to address the concern about the side effects of nanotechnology. In this aspect, this 
current study identified the media frames of nanotechnology and investigated the differences 
in media frames by country and period.

5. RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
 
This study set out to identify the media frame of nanotechnology and to investigate the 
cultural effects on the media frame. Existing studies on the media frame of nanotechnology 
were limited to countries speaking the same languages or to individual countries. Moreover, 
most of studies were conducted before 2010, when nanotechnology regulations were 
substantially begun to be introduced. Accordingly, there are no sufficient studies containing 
public discourse on nanotechnology's potential risks.  
This study examined the media frames and compared them by country and period to 
identify differences. More specifically, the first research question was to examine the 
presence of media frames. This study examined how nanotechnology is framed in news 
articles, and what the dominant frames are and their variations that exist across countries. 
This study also looked at whether newspapers in South Korea, Germany, Austria, and Japan 
represent nanotechnology in different ways, and how media frames of nanotechnology 
changed from 2001 to 2015.  
 
RQ1a: Which media frames are presented dominantly in the news articles on 
nanotechnology? 
RQ1b: Does the pattern of the presence of media frames be associated with 
countries like South Korea, Germany, Austria, and Japan? If so, which variations 
of the presence of media frames are revealed across the countries? 
RQ1c: Does the presence of media frames change between 2001 and 2015? If so, 
which variations of the presence are revealed over time? 
 
６５ 
 
Media framing has been influenced by a variety of factors. In particular, public discourse 
on nanotechnology forms mainly depending on the social value of nanotechnology that 
doesn’t secure sufficient knowledge or isn’t individually experienced. While existing studies 
on media frames focused mainly on the microlevel factors of journalists and media 
organizations, they didn’t examine macrolevel factors, such as culture. A number of 
researchers did premise culture as a key factor affecting on the media frame, but there is no 
empirical investigation on this issue up to now.  
The second research question was to examine how the presence of media frames on 
nanotechnology could be explained by cultural dimensions and how these cultural effects on 
media frames differed across countries. For this, this study adopted Hofstede's cultural 
dimensions model and empirically investigated the cultural effect on the presence of media 
frames, which are identified in RQ1.   
 
RQ2: Are there cultural dimensions associated significantly with each media 
frame on nanotechnology? If so, how do the cultural dimensions contribute to the 
salience of each media frame? 
 
As discussed in chapter 2.1.3., frame building has a sequential linear order by which the 
media frame has different presence and salience. Therefore, RQ1 produced the results on the 
presence of media frames observed in news articles on nanotechnology and then RQ2 
analyzed the salience of media frames identified in RQ1, which was differentiated by cultural 
dimensions.

6. METHODOLOGY 
 
6.1. Frame as Cluster 
Although the concept of the frame has grown as one of most important and applicable 
methods in communication studies, there is not yet a standard set of content analytic 
indicators that can be used to reliably measure the prevalence of common frames in the news 
(Semetko & Valkenburg, 2000).  
To address this limitation, Kohring, a German professor at the University of Mannheim, 
has presented an alternative measurement that improves reliability and validity. With his 
colleagues, Kohring argued that some elements of frame are grouped systematically in a 
specific way, and formed by a pattern that is identified in the text (Donk, Meta, Kohring, & 
Marcinkowski, 2012; Kohring & Matthes, 2002; Matthes & Kohring, 2008). He calls this 
pattern frame. According to his assumption, ""a frame consists of several frame elements, and 
each frame element consists of several content analytical variables"" and ""every frame is 
characterized by a specific pattern of variable"" that ""signify single frame elements are 
grouped together by hierarchical cluster analysis"" (Matthes & Kohring, 2008, p.264).  
As patterns formed by a combination of frame elements, this method posits that frames 
are not coded directly with a single variable but are combined with frame elements. Therefore, 
a frame with several content analytical variables can achieve a higher reliability and validity 
than a frame with a single variable because frames are not subjectively determined but 
empirically suggested by an inductive clustering method. And this method has also another 
advantage in that the coding frame is conducted resistant to a coder's schemata or bias 
because a coder codes not frame but variables (Matthes & Kohring, 2008). 
 
６７ 
 
6.2. Operationalization  
This study aimed to identify media frames of nanotechnology through the cluster of 
frame elements. Entman (1993) defined the 4 frame elements constituting a frame: problem 
definition, causal attribution of responsibility, moral evaluation and treatment 
recommendation. Kohring suggested that ""if these elements are understood as variables, each 
of them can have several categories in a content analysis"". (Matthes & Kohring, 2008, p.264). 
In this study, frame elements are operationalized through the content analysis variable. And 
content analysis variables were identified in this study's pretest conducted in South Korea, 
Germany, Austria, and Japan, and also in existing studies on the media frame of 
nanotechnology.  
 
Table 6.1. Operationalization of frame elements 
Frame Element Categories Variables 
Problem definition Main Topic Scientific research, medical service/health care, 
economy, development of semiconductor, policy, 
moral/ethics, overview of nanotechnology 
Actor Science, business, politics, media/Public opinion, 
NGOs, military 
Causal attribution of

Risk Attribution Science, economy, politics, medical 
Moral evaluation Benefits Research, economy, health, consumer, environment 
Risks Research, economy, health, consumer, environment 
Treatment 
recommendation 
Call for regulation  Regulation policy/negative prospects  
Call for support Support policy/positive prospects 
 
At first, the problem definition element includes the main topics and actors categories, 
which define the bottom lines of news stories. Main topic is a central issue under 
investigation or a primary argument around which the other arguments revolve. This study 
derives several subtopics from earlier studies about nanotechnology, and then subtopics 
summarized to main topic with seven variables: scientific research, medical service/health 
６８ 
 
care, economy, development of semiconduc tors, policy, moral/ethics, and overview of 
nanotechnology. An actor refers to the person, group, or organization that is most often cited 
in the news article. Actor includes six variables: science, business, politics, media/public 
opinion, NGOs, and military.  
Second, the causal attribution of responsibility element includes the categories of benefit 
attribution and risk attribution. These explain who is responsible for the benefits/risks. For 
instance, science as risk attribution variable means that scientific actors can be blamed for the 
risks related to nanotechnology. Just like earlier studies, all actor variables which occur in 
news article are always not responsible for benefits and risks. For example, it simply does not 
appear in news article that the public is responsible for benefits or risks, but the public can be 
an actor in news article. Therefore, the benefit attribution and risk attribution categories 
include only four variables each: science, economy, politics, and medical.  
Third, the moral evaluation element executed its operational definition by the elements 
of assessment of the benefits and risks of nanotechnology. It discussed what topics had 
benefits or risks due to nanotechnology. For example, economy as benefits variable means 
""nanotechnology as a benefit for economy."" These categories include five variables each: 
research, economy, health, consumer, and environment.  
Finally, the treatment recommendation element was operationalized by the promotion 
and regulation on nanotechnology categories, and the positive and negative outlook on 
nanotechnology. Treatment recommendation thus includes two categories ""call for 
regulation"" and ""call for support."" Call for regulation generally highlights the risks of 
nanotechnology and proposes regulation on it. Meanwhile, call for support generally focused 
the positive perspective and supports governmental initiatives or policies. Call for regulation 
includes a variable ""regulation policy/negative prospects,"" and call for support includes a 
６９ 
 
variable ""support policy/positive prospects.""       
 
6.3. Countries and Newspapers 
This study selected South Korea, Germany, Austria, and Japan. South Korea and Japan 
in East Asia are included in the Confucian Asia cluster (Gupta, Hanges, & Dorfman, 2002). 
Both countries influenced on each other historically and built closer relationships as South 
Korea became a Japanese colony in the early 20th century. Both countries share cultural 
characteristics based on Confucian values including hierarchical relationships, social 
relationships, and authoritarianism (Ashkanasy, 2002). Conversely, Germany and Austria in 
Central Europe are included in the Germanic Europe cluster (Szabo, et al., 2002). Both 
countries kept a close relationship for a long time based around Christianity and the German 
language. Moreover, they share various kinds of values including equalitarianism, emphasis 
on personal rights, and legalism (Ashkanasy, 2002) 
These four countries adopt democracy and the capitalist system and are advanced 
countries having high-level nanotechnology with a national-level investment in common. 
However, South Korea and Japan, and Germany and Austria have very opposite cultural 
background, which is why this study selected those countries. This was to address the fact 
that a number of researchers postulated that the media frame would differ depending on the 
culture of a relevant society.  
Accordingly, this study assumed that comparing countries with different cultures would 
more specifically contribute to standardizing the cultural effect on media frame. Furthermore, 
this study excluded the effects of other macro level factors other than culture on the media 
frame by selecting countries similar in politics, economy, and ideology but with cultural 
differences. Since the cultural effects on a media frame can’t be properly investigated by 
７０ 
 
comparing only 2 countries, this study selected 4 countries; 2 countries from each different 
culture.  
Two newspapers issued in each country in its language were selected for the 4 countries: 
South Korean daily newspapers Chosun Ilbo (조선일보) and Hankyoreh Sinmun (한겨레신문), 
German daily newspapers Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Süddeutsche Zeitung, Austrian 
daily newspapers Standard and Presse, and Japanese daily newspapers Yomiuri Shimbun (読
売新聞) and Asahi Shimbun (朝日新聞). The selected newspapers were recognized as quality 
newspapers with nationwide influence in each country. Moreover, they substantially covered 
the public discourse on technology. Therefore, they were frequently used in studies 
conducting content analysis on news articles related to emerging technologies (Donk, Meta, 
Kohring, & Marcinkowski, 2012; Hibino & Nagata, 2006; Kim, 2011; Metag & 
Marcinkowski, 2014; Shineha, Hibino, & Kato, 2008).  
 
6.4. Data Collection      
For a comparative study between countries, this study selected individual news articles 
from 2001 to 2015 because the media's attention on nanotechnology increased rapidly since 
2001 when the US announced NNI. Articles including the word ""nano"" were searched in a 
database in each country. And then they were collected from the online archives of 
newspapers. The news articles in Germany and Austria were searched in the Genios GBI, the 
database of newspaper agencies using German language, and gathered from the online 
archive of each newspaper.  
Similarly, news articles in South Korea were searched in KINDS, the database of 
newspaper agencies in the Korean language, and collected from the online archive of each 
newspaper agency. In Japan, there is no database. So articles including the word ""nano"" were 
７１ 
 
searched from the online archive of the two newspapers and classified into articles of two 
types: paper and online versions. And then the news articles on paper were only used for the 
analysis.   
This study aimed to investigate news articles dealing with nanotechnology as the main 
topic. Thus, this study analyzed only the articles in which nanotechnology accounted for 
more than 50% of the news article or contained a statement essentially focused on 
nanotechnology. The analysis excluded news articles published in special supplements, 
recommendations for events, and the local section, while editorials and columns as well as 
articles in each section, including politics, society, or science were included in the analysis. 
Furthermore, news articles which were not related to nanotechnology, while including the 
word ""nano"" were also excluded (e.g., Apple iPod ""nano"", Indian automotive manufacturer 
Tata's ""nano"", Albanian prime minister ""Fatos Nano""). A total of 1,362 articles were selected 
to populate the analysis.  
 
6.5. Coding 
Four trained coders were selected. The coders analyzing the articles from the German, 
Austrian, and Japanese newspapers had bachelor’s degrees or higher. They are bilingual, both 
in their native language and Korean. Meanwhile, the coders analyzing articles from South 
Korean newspapers had bachelor’s degrees or higher but used only the Korean language. Two 
German coders analyzed German and Austrian newspapers each, and a Japanese and a South 
Korean coder analyzed their homeland's newspapers.  
In order to measure intercoder reliability, coders coded a random sample of 10% of the 
South Korean newspaper articles because they understood Korean language well in common. 
The intercoder reliability of all variables, using Scott (1955)'s pi, exceeded .80 which is 
７２ 
 
generally accepted in content analysis. This test revealed a reliability coefficient of .81 for the 
main topic, .83 for actor, .84 for benefit attribution, .84 for risk attribution, .80 for 
benefits, .81 for risks, .87 for call for regulation, and .82 for prospect. 
 
6.6. Cultural Dimension score 
As discussed in the literature review on media frame, the frame building process deals 
with the relationships between media frame and factor affecting the media frame. This study 
focused on cultural dimension as the independent variable with the salience of media frame 
as the dependent variable.  
This study adopted the cultural dimensions score in Hofstede's model. Hofstede's model 
can quantitatively examine the cultural differences between countries and enable researchers 
to compare more than 3 countries. The reliability and validity of Hofstede's model was 
verified in a number of studies.  
Table 6.2. presents the cultural dimensions scores of South Korea, Germany, Austria, 
and Japan (Hofstede, Hofstede & Minkov, 2010). In Hofstede's model, Germany was the 
most individualistic country while South Korea was the most collectivist country. Austria 
showed the lowest power distance score, while South Korea had the highest power distance 
score. Moreover, Japan had strong tendency towards avoiding uncertainty while Austria had 
the weakest tendency towards avoiding uncertainty. Masculine culture was prominent in 
Japan, but feminine culture was primary in South Korea. Austria had a short term-oriented 
culture, but South Korea had long term-oriented culture. In sum, South Korea and Japan were 
relatively collectivist, had high power distance scores, a long term-oriented culture, and 
showed a strong tendency towards avoiding uncertainty. However, Germany and Austria were 
individualistic, had a low power distance score and short term-oriented culture, and showed a 
７３ 
 
weak tendency towards avoiding uncertainty.

6.7. Statistics Methods 
This study computed binary variables for every original variable. And only binary 
variables having the frequency higher than 5% were adopted for cluster analysis for statistical 
reasons. 
For the RQ1, this study executed two-step cluster analysis comprising the combination 
of hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. Thus combination was suitable for 
determining the optimal number of clusters and processing a large amount of data. Since it is 
not easy to estimate the specific number of clusters related to nanotechnology due to the 
comparison between countries and expanded time span, this study determined an automatic 
decision on the number of clusters.  
For RQ2, this study built a logistic regression model to predict whether a type of media 
frame presents or not: logit (π)= 𝛽଴ + 𝛽ଵ𝑋ଵ + 𝛽ଶ𝑋ଶ + 𝛽ଷ𝑋ଷ + 𝛽ସ𝑋ସ + 𝛽ହ𝑋ହ , where 𝑋ଵ 
stands for Individualism/Collectivism, 𝑋ଶ  for Power distance, 𝑋ଷ  for Uncertainty 
avoidance, 𝑋ସ for Masculinity/Femininity, 𝑋ହ for Long-/Short-term orientation.  
In fact, the ideal way of measuring the cultural effects on the media frame is to compare 
newspapers from all countries. This is a method that focuses on the frequency of the media

frame that appear in newspapers of countries. In this case, since the media frame is on the 
ratio scale, a multiple regression analysis can be performed. However, due to various 
constraints such as language and sample size, it in nearly impossible to use the method in 
actual research. This is why most previous studies analyzing media frames as a dependent 
variable have used qualitative methodology, instead of quantitative methodology, for 
statistical testing of causal relationships (Scheufele, 1999; 2000).   
However, this study employed logistic regression, because the media frame can also use 
a binomial coefficient. In essence, a media frame is a categorical data that represents whether 
a media frame is present or not. However, the use of regression analysis causes a problem in 
making a statistical inference, because basic assumptions of regression analysis are not met. 
In other words, in regression analysis it is assumed that the dependent variable is a 
continuous variable, and the binomial coefficient form of the dependent variable in the 
present study does not meet this assumption.  
Logistic regression analysis is used in this kind of situations. Logistic regression is used 
when the dependent variable is a binary coefficient of 0 and 1. Logistic regression is an 
analytical method that predicts the likelihood of occurrence of an event because it uses 1 for 
the probability that the event occurs, and 0 for the probability that it does not, when there is 
an independent variable. Therefore, using logistic regression, it is possible to statistically test 
a causal relationship in which the media frame varies according to cultural dimension.  
This study used PASW Statistics 18 as a statistical software program for descriptive 
statistics, ANOVA, cluster analysis and logistic regression analysis.

7. RESULTS 
 
7.1. Descriptions of the Sample 
South Korea (n=482) showed the highest number of articles on nanotechnology 
followed by Japan (n=324), Germany (n=323), and Austria (n=233), in that order (Figure 
7.1.). Interest in the semiconductor drove more articles on nanotechnology in South Korea 
than in other countries. Samsung Electronics and its affiliates have been exerting a significant 
impact on the national economy enough to account for 20.4% of the South Korean GDP in 
2014. Accordingly, South Korean newspapers focused on the improvement of semiconductor 
manufacturing using nanotechnology by Samsung Electronics.

Süddeutsche Zeitung for 9.3% (n=126), and Standard for 9.7% (n=132), the newspapers in 
East Asia brought in more articles on nanotechnology than German-speaking countries.  
 
Table 7.1. Number of articles on nanotechnology in newspapers5 
 
Figure 7.2. shows how the articles are distributed over time. While 2006 was the year in 
which the most articles were published in a year (n=153), they were least published in 2014 
(n=35). There were a number of articles on nanotechnology in the mid-2000s, but the 
numbers rapidly decreased in the early 2010s. It is worth noting that while the articles 
decreased by about half in 2005 over the previous year, they reached the highest ratio in 2006 
again.  
In South Korea 2007 showed the most articles published (n=59) and the least published 
in 2015 (n=12). Respectively, the highest and lowest number of articles were published in 
2006 (n=54) and in 2014 (n=6) in Germany, in 2006 (n=47) and in 2014 (n=3) in Austria, and 
in 2007 (n=42) and in 2015 (n=9) in Japan.  
South Korea and Japan showed the highest number of articles in 2007 while Germany

and Austria published the most in 2006. The development of semiconductor manufacturing 
technology using nanotechnology and the earnest research commencement on carbon 
Nanotube and Graphene caused the highest number of articles in South Korea and Japan. 
Germany and Austria had the most in 2006 because of the dispute on the efficiency of 
nutritional supplements launched by Neosino, the official sponsor of FC Bayern München 
and the ""NanoCare Project"" initiated by the German federal government, which investigated 
the impact of nanomaterials on health.

Articles in South Korea increased in 2009 and 2010 over the previous year unlike other 
countries because Samsung Electronics successfully developed DRAM (Dynamic Random 
Access Memory) using nanotechnology. The articles in Germany showed a decreasing trend 
from the peak in 2006 (n=54) but rebounded once in 2011 (n=23) because of an increase in

articles related to the ""Aktionplan Nanotechnologie 2015"" considered by the German 
parliament at that time. Similar to Germany, articles in Austria kept decreasing from the peak 
in 2006 (n=27) but rebounded once in 2012 (n=15). The articles in Japan demonstrated 
relatively less change than in other countries.  
 
7.2. Media Frame of Nanotechnology 
A total of 1,191 articles, whose individual variable was less than 5% in frequency, were 
selected for cluster analysis. A hierarchical cluster analysis was executed to determine the 
similarity between subjects using a distance measurement. On the basis of a Dendrogram 
acquired from the cluster analysis, it was determined that six clusters were the most suitable 
(Figure 7.3.). Then, they were finally selected through a k-means cluster analysis. To verify 
the validity of the clusters, this study conducted ANOVA identifying the differences between 
clusters depending on variables. According to ANOVA results, all clusters showed significant 
difference, p<.05.  
Table 7.2. show the distance between centers of each cluster. The cluster 4 and 6 are 
closest (1.431), and cluster 2 and 6 are farthest (3.423). The proximity of the centers means 
that the characteristics of cluster 4 and 6 are more similar than the other clusters. On the other 
hand, the characteristics of cluster 2 and 6 are the most different. Therefore, clusters with 
similar and different characteristics are identified among the clusters.

Six frames as clusters were assigned the labels shown in the last row of Table 7.3. The 
last two and three rows of the table show the number of articles in which these frames occur. 
This number and percentage give an impression of the importance of the frame in the public 
nanotechnology discourse in South Korea, Germany, Austria, and Japan. 
Frame Ⅰ: “Overview of Nanotechnology.” The first frame accounting for 8.2% (n=98) 
of articles was named ""Overview of Nanotechnology."" The articles included in this frame 
focused on extensive description of and introduction to nanotechnology. Scientist (40.8%) 
was the most frequently observed among actors followed by media (26.5%) and economic 
actor (21.4%). The call to support nanotechnology was 8.2%, and the call for regulation was 
merely 3.1%. The benefits and risks of nanotechnology were not found in ""Overview of 
Nanotechnology.""

The term, nano, comes from the ancient Greek ""nanos"" meaning dwarf. The nanometer is a 
billionth of a meter, or approximately the size of a molecule. Because the naked eye cannot see 
smaller than 0.1 millimeter, it is difficult to even guess the size of one nanometer.

Nanotechnology has been used in pursuit of precision to the point of nanometers, as well as to 
control atoms and molecules. Horst Störmer, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1998, 
said, ""The possibilities for creating new things seem unlimited."" Richard Feynman, who received 
the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968, first proposed the concept of nanotechnology in 1959. Later, 
Eric Drexler, author of the Engines of Creation in 1986, wrote that 0.1 nanometer atoms and 1 
nanometer molecules could be manipulated at will using a machine called the ""assembler."" It was 
considered an outrageous statement at the time. However, nanotechnology has begun to take 
shape as demonstrated by Samsung Electronics' success in developing semiconductors using 50-
nm technology. They claim that it is electronics, materials, medicine, and energy. In particular, 
gene manipulation could fundamentally solve the food problem. In addition, the development of 
terahertz (10ଵଶhz) semiconductors could make supercomputers as small as personal computers. 
Like many developed countries, the Korean government is striving to support technology 
development, considering nanotechnology as the core technology to lead the 21st century. 
(Hankyoreh Sinmun, 2005/09/15)

What is nanotechnology? It is about the extremely small. One nanometer is one millionth of a 
millimeter With its thickness, one nanometer can divide a hair strand 50,000 times. 
Nanotechnology mimics the self-organizing structure and the principles of functional 
characteristics by learning the principles that exist in nature. Nanotechnology also reveals the 
mechanism of the invisible world, and creates very small structures for new materials. Engineers 
anticipate the advent of a technological revolution through nanotechnology in the next decade. 
(Standard, 2002/12/14) 
 
Frame Ⅱ: “Policy.” The second frame accounting for 6.1% of the articles was named 
""Policy."" The articles included in this frame focused on technology policy. In particular, most 
of them were related to medicine and health care using nanotechnology. Medical 
implementation (74.0%) was observed most in the articles, followed by the development of 
83 
 
the semiconductor (21.9%) which was mainly found in South Korea and Japan. The political 
actor (86.3%) was the most dominant among actors. Politics (90.4%) and research (74.0%) 
showed up as highest as the benefit attribution and the benefit, respectively, in the second 
frame. Call for support (95.9%) of nanotechnology was overwhelmingly highest. Risk 
attribution and risks were not found in ""Policy.""

The military is also interested in nanotechnology. In May, the United States invested 90 million 
dollar to establish the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies. The goal of the institute is to 
improve the function of the textile fiber surface to reduce the weight of the rucksack by half. 
Europe is on a par with the United States in the field of nanotechnology. Although more research 
papers were published in Europe than in the United States in the 1990s, their number of patents is 
similar. Currently, 2.8 billion euro have been invested in nanotechnology globally. A nano 
research center, where approximately 30 million euro was invested, will open at the end of March. 
It is expected to employ 1,500 researchers. Nano research is also very active in East Asia. To date, 
China has invested 1.8 billion euro in 900 research programs. It is also estimated that sales of 
nanofibers will reach 400 million euro within two years in Taiwan. (Presse, 2003/04/12)

The framework of their ""Nanotechnology Comprehensive Development Plan,"" which was 
reviewed and approved by the National Science and Technology Commission (NSTC), plans to 
inject 1,485 billion Korean won in research and development in this field in the next 10 years, as 
well as train more than 12,000 nanotechnology experts. The Korean government has set the 
following objectives: ""to build a major infrastructure for nanotechnology development within 
five years, and to secure at least top 10 most technologies with comparative advantage in order to 
ensure technological competitiveness at the level in top five highly developed countries by 
2010."" Under these objectives, the government selected the following areas and fields for 
intensive support: five areas of technology, such as electronic devices, new materials, processes, 
84 
 
equipments, and biotechnology, as well as key technical fields ""to secure competitive in,"" such as 
catalyst materials, molecular devices, and gene therapy devices.  
Other aims included training more than 12,000 specialists by creating and restructuring 
departments related to nanotechnology in universities, and providing educational programs such 
as master's and doctoral programs in nanoscience.  
Establishing the ""Joint Research Equipment Center"" for researchers' joint use of cost analysis, 
test, and manipulation equipment, the government decided to review the feasibility of 
establishing a nanotechnology research institute and creating ""Nano Town"" where 
nanotechnology research agencies are concentrated. (Hankyoreh Sinmun, 2001/07/23)  
 
<Sample article>  
The Kurchatov Institute, named after the Soviet nuclear scientist, has become the hub of Russian 
nanotechnology development. Russia is currently poised to reclaim the field of science and 
technology through nanotechnology. With the successful launch of the world's first satellite, the 
country competed with the United States in the Soviet era. However, top-notch researchers left 
the country and the science and technology in the country declined following the collapse of the 
Soviet Union.  
The Russian government's commitment to nanotechnology development is due to its potential for 
industrialization. A an international conference held in Moscow last October, Medvedev revealed 
that Russia will spend 318 billion rubles by 2015 for the industrialization of nanotechnology. He 
said, ""The technology for mass production of nanomaterials was still in the early stages of 
development. Russia must move away from the economy that depends on natural resources using 
nanotechnology."" 
Russia has a world-famous Russian Academy of Science (RAS). Founded in 1724, RAS consists 
of 50,000 researcher and 400 laboratories. However, Zhores Alferov, Vice Chairman of the RAS 
and Nobel physics winner in 2000, said, ""The institute's facilities are too old to conduct world-
class research."" However, this is not why the government designated the Kurchatov research 
center as the hub in nanotechnology development instead of the RAS. The real reason was the 
concern that the RAS, which focuses on basic research, may hinder the development of 
85 
 
nanotechnology, which requires applied research. Kovalchuk, Director of the Kurchatov Institute, 
said, ""Unfortunately, the reform of RAS has not yet been achieved. This is the only place in 
Russia where it is possible to conduct research on nanotechnology that combines biotechnology, 
IT , and cognitive science."" He also stressed, ""I have been thinking about how Russia would 
evolve after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Nanotechnology is at the heart of this issue."" 
According to local reports, President Putin expressed that he would increase the size of the 
Kurchatov Institute and spend an additional 10 billion rubles over the next three years. (Yomiuri 
Shimbun, 2010/01/29)      
 
Frame Ⅲ: “Economic Benefits.” The third frame accounting for 20.0% (n=238) of the 
articles was named ""Economic Benefits."" The articles included in this frame focused on the 
economic effects nanotechnology was to bring. Economy (49.6%) was the highest topic in 
this frame, followed by the development of the semiconductor (21.4%). Similar to ""Policy,"" 
development of the semiconductor was observed mainly in South Korea and Japan. The 
economic actor (82.4%) including enterprises and entrepreneurs, showed overwhelmingly 
highest among actors. Science (68.9%) and economic (71.0%) were identified the most as the 
benefit attribution and benefit, respectively, in the third frame. Economy accounted for 30.3% 
in benefit attribution and consumer for 20.2% in benefits. Call for support (10.9%) of 
nanotechnology was more than call for regulation (0.4%), but didn’t account for the 
significant ratio of overall articles. No risk attribution and risks were identified in the news 
articles found in ""Economic Benefits.""

The world of Marco Beckmann moves by very small things. Founder of Nanostart, a venture 
capital, he was fascinated by nanotechnology during his school days. He explained the size of the 
86 
 
nanoparticles in an easy manner. He said nanoparticles are the size of a soccer ball in the globe, 
but the impact of nanotechnology on the global economy is greater than soccer.  
Describing that ""Nanotechnology is about new manufacturing technology as well as new 
products. We change everything we produce,"" Beckmann noted its potential for various 
applications including self-cleaning ovens, scratch-resistant car coating, performance 
improvement of computer CPU, and breathable fabric. He added, ""Nanotechnology has long 
been routinely applied to industry. And a nano product is not the only label nano products are 
sold on."" Experts estimate the current nanotechnology end-product market at 250 million dollar. 
It is expected to reach 1 billion dollar by 2015.  
Since its establishment in 2003, Nanostart has raised approximately 30 million euro and invested 
in many areas of nanotechnology. The nine nanotechnology companies Beckmann invested in 
were listed on the stock market or acquired by large corporations. Beckmann was convinced that 
the companies could be sold at a high value next year. 
For example, Magforce, of which Nanostart has 65% share, is using nanoparticles for cancer 
treatment. The first commercial brain tumor treatment with Magforce's new technology was 
performed in October in Berlin. Beckamnn was convinced the technology would be the fourth 
axis of cancer treatment along with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Beckmann therefore 
replaced the Margforce board chairperson to accelerate the economic development of 
nanomedical companies.  
On the other hand, countries are investing huge amount of money on nanotechnology every year. 
Nanostart took advantage of this opportunity. Nanostart was selected as the fund manager of the 
Singapore Nanotechnology Venture Fund and attracted 1,090 Singapore dollars, approximately 6 
million euro. ""There is a niche in venture finance like ours,"" Beckmann said. ""The small is big."" 
He presented the goal, ""We will be an global venture capital fund in nanotechnology.""

Samsung Electronics has begun mass production of 16 GB NAND flash using the 51nm process 
for the first time ever. The 51nm process means that the electronic circuit of a semiconductor is 
composed of minute wires as thick (line width) as 1/2000th of a hair in thickness.  
In August last year, the company began mass production of 8 GB NAND flash using the 60nm 
process. In eight months it has mass-produced the products, dobling the storage capacity. The 
company explained that this semiconductor is approximately twice as fast in reading and storing 
data than the existing 60nm products. 
Samsung Electronics said it would be able to take the lead in the next-generation NAND flash 
market, because its products are more efficient than its competitors', who mainly produced it 
using the 55nm-57nm processes. The 50nm NAND flash market is expected to become a flagship 
market in the next year, and grow to 21 billion dollar by 2010.  
In this regard, Hynix semiconductor announced, in a company information session held in the 
26th, that it was planning to mass-produce 16 GB NAND flash using the 48nm process, which 
was under development. (Chosun Ilbo, 2007/04/30)   
 
Frame Ⅳ: “Environmental Risks.” The fourth frame accounting for 3.2% (n=38) of the 
articles was named ""Environmental Risks."" This frame focused on the environmental risks or 
side effects caused by nanotechnology. All articles in ""Environmental Risks"" adopted 
scientific research as the topic. Scientist (52.6%) was identified highest among actors, 
followed by political actor and media, which accounted for 21.1% each. No articles showed 
benefit attribution or benefits in the fourth frame. However, science was identified as the risk 
attribution and the corresponding risks were all about the environment. Call for regulation 
(65.8%) on nanotechnology was significantly high.  
 
<Sample article>  
Nanomaterials may affect the environment. All products and equipment release their components 
into the environment during or after their use. Therefore, in addition to the direct impact on the 
88 
 
human body, nano products may have indirect impact on human body through the nanomaterials 
released into the ecosystem. It has been reported that carbon nanotubes bind well to organisms in 
the natural world, and that when this occurs, the substance might spread rapidly.  
Different views may certainly exist regarding extrapolating animal toxicity results to human 
cases. There is also a lot of controversy regarding the impact of nanomaterials released into the 
environment. However, seemingly minor issues can still cause a disaster as they have in the past; 
therefore, the environmental impact of nanomaterials requires careful examination. Yet, there is 
not even the data on the status of release and treatment of nanomaterials to the environment in 
Korea.  
The technological advancement of mankind is not a race to a predetermined destination to break 
a record. Individuals are granted a limited amount of time, but the whole of mankind is granted 
with eternity. The sustainability of society is more important than the speed of development. 
Examining the impact of new technologies or substances on the environment, including humans, 
and finding ways to prevent associated problems are another task given to technologists along 
with that of technological advancement. (Chosun Ilbo, 2007/05/28)   
 
<Sample article>  
As the recently held the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society, scientists from 
Arizona presented an example of negative environmental impact of silver nanotechnology. The 
researchers reported that when they analyzed the washed water from the 'odor-preventing silver 
nanosock' at room temperature, the amount of silver ions detected were such that they could harm 
aquatic organisms. ""The silver nanoparticles used for antibacterial and deodorant removal can 
come off the socks during the washing process, and if the washing sewage flows into the river, it 
may kill the fish,"" said the researcher. They also noted that ""The finding suggests that they will 
destroy the river ecosystems and inflict damage on humans."" silver ions are known to damage 
aquatic organisms in much lesser amounts than are harmful to humans.  
Scholars have previously warned of the potential for nano products to destroy aquatic ecosystems. 
In November 2006, the U.S. Department of the Environment began regulating household 
appliances and products that used silver nanotechnology for antibacterial purposes. As a result, 
89 
 
silver nanotechnology washing machines, food storage containers, and air cleaners have been 
designated as regulated products, and producers have the obligation to prove that silver 
nanoparticles do not harm ecosystems. The decision of the U.S. Department of Environment was 
made based on the determination that abusing silver nanotechnology may kill beneficial 
organisms coexisting with humans and destroy ecosystems. This well demonstrates that the 
principle of ""government intervention"" that the government should resolve the conflict when 
public and private interests clash.  
When using silver nano products, consumers should consider the properties of silver nano. Silver 
nanoparticle product manufacturers mush increase the adhesive power of nanoparticles so that 
they do not fall off while consumers are using them. In addition, just like listing the food 
ingredients on product package, manufacturers need to indicate the nanoparticle use on product 
tags to inform consumer choice. The government should closely evaluate the potential of silver 
nanoproducts to inflict damage on aquatic ecosystems and humans. (Hankyoreh Sinmun, 
2008/04/11)    
 
Frame Ⅴ: “Research & Development.” The fifth frame accounting for 54.6% of the 
articles was named ""Research & Development."" This frame provided scientific-oriented news 
articles. The articles focused mainly on presenting the research process and results on 
nanotechnology without social context. Accordingly, the highest topic was scientific research 
(62.3%), followed by medical implementation (10.3%), policy (9.8%), and development of 
the semiconductor (9.1%), in that order. Scientist (89.5%) showed overwhelmingly highest 
among actors. The benefit attribution and benefits having the highest percentage in this frame 
were science and research (70.2%), respectively, followed by health (18.6%) and consumer 
(8.8%), respectively. While call for support on nanotechnology was identified, its ratio was 
negligable (3.7%). No risk attribution and risks were found in this frame.

Sony has developed a tape with the world's largest storage capacity. One cassette has the storage 
for 7,400 2-hr-long movies or 30 million 4-min-long songs. It can store 18.5 GB per square inch, 
approximately 6.5cmଶ, which is 74 times the size of the largest existing tape.  
The tape is made by attaching magnetic metal particles. Sony succeeded in reducing its size from 
the currently available tens of nanometer (nano=1/billion) to 7.7 nanometers. This increased 
recording density and capacity. The tapes are inexpensive to manufacture, compared with optical 
disks and other storage media. However, it takes time to find the necessary data in the tapes. 
Development of this technology is expected to help the government, financial institutions, and 
data centers of IT companies to store large amounts of information in preparation for disasters.

A stamp-size nanomaterial made by Pulickel Ajayan can swallow all light. The nanomaterial 
reflects just 0.045% of light. Ajayan and colleagues at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 
New York, USA, pulled the material out of carbon nanotubes and set the record for the darkest 
material in the world. Since the light is reduced by the process, only a very small fraction of the 
light is observed, the rest is absorbed by the dark material. Nanotechnology up until then has 
shown only the light in the visible area.  
The darkest material in the world, made from nickel and phosphorus, reflects 0.16% of the light 
from the surface. The color commonly called black reflects only 5-10% of light. The researchers 
are planning to apply for a listing on the Guinness Book of World Records after publishing their 
study in Nano Letters. Ajayan has already been on the Guinness Book of World Records in 2006 
for designing of the world's smallest toothbrush.  
His research is not confined to the academic field. Norbert Kaiser, an applied optics scientist at 
the Fraunhofer Institute, said the study could be applied to the field of solar energy. The material 
can be used for effective absorption of sunlight in electricity production. (Süddeutsche Zeitung,

Frame Ⅵ: “Health Risks.” The last frame accounting for 7.9% (n=94) of the articles 
was named ""Health Risks."" The frame focused on the medical side effects or health risks 
caused by nanotechnology. All articles in this frame adopted scientific research as the topic. 
Scientist (54.3%) showed highest among actors, followed by political actor (25.5%) and 
media (14.9%), in that order. Science was identified as the risk attribution in this frame. The 
corresponding risks were all about medicine and health. Call for regulation on 
nanotechnology accounted for 45.7%.

Nano cosmetics, nano-antibacterial lunch boxes, silver nano wahing machines, and nano 
toothpaste are some of the most commonly found products in stores these days. Nanotech 
products are already an integral part of our lives due to functions such as waterproofing, 
antibacterial, and decomposition of pollutants. Despite its excellent features, recent research has 
revealed the risks of nanomaterials. In the Forum on ""Nanotechnology and Health Risk"" held on 
October 30th, Professor Kim Younghoon at Department of Chemical Engineering in Kwangwoon 
University presented the finding of a foreign study that carbon nanotubes may have the negative 
health effects such as pneumoconiosis. In addition, the study warned that titanium oxide (TiO2) 
can be absorbed into the skin when the skin cuticle is peeled off, and be carried by the blood to 
the brain. The OECD established the Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials under the 
Chemicals committee in September 2006 to discuss countermeasures against the impact on the 
environment and human body. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also 
reviewing whether to include nanomaterials in the new chemical materials registration system 
using the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA). The United Kingdom adopted the Greenpeace's 
proposal and implemented Nanojury since November 2005. In Korea, the nanomaterials safety 
policy council was organized in March 2007; however, research and policymaking on its safety is 
still in its infancy. (Hankyoreh Sinmun, 2008/11/10)

There is a world where the smaller gets stronger. As the particle size becomes smaller, the surface 
area increases and the chemical reaction force becomes stronger. A carbon nanotube through 
which only one water molecule can pass is stronger than any metal, and highly conductive. But 
these small particles, which do not exist in the natural world, could easily pass through the 
protective membranes of the human body and cause unexpected problem. This possibility is 
closer to becoming reality.  
Dr. Bellina Veronesi of U.S. EPA recently published a report in Environmental Science & 
Technology suggesting that titanium oxide nanoparticles included in sunscreens have the 
potential to damage cranial verves. Titanium oxide is used in toothpastes and paints in addition to 
sunscreen. It is usually white, but becomes transparent when made of nanoparticles. Accordingly, 
sunscreen containing nanoparticles is gaining popularity, because it does not give a pale feel to 
the skin.  
The team injected this material into mice' microglia, which protects cranial nerves. The cells 
immediately attacked this material by releasing free radicals. The problem is that titanium oxide 
exposure longer than one hour causes excessive secretion of free radicals, and damages adjacent 
brain cells. Brain diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, are known to 
occur because nerve cells are damaged by free radicals. This is not the first time that research 
found that nanoparticles can inflict damage on al life form. In 2004, Professor Günter 
Oberdörster from Rochester University in the United States reported that mice that inhaled a 
20nm sized ""Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)"" nanoparticle for 15 minutes died in 4 hours. Teflon 
is used is a wide range of products from frying pan coatings to spacesuits, and artificial heart 
valves. It is not harmful in its solid stat, but becomes toxic as it becomes nanoparticles. Plants are 
no exception. Professor Daniel Watts from the New Jersey Institute of Technology published a 
study in Toxicology Letters in November last year that aluminum oxide nanoparticles used as 
abrasion resistant clear coatings inhibited the growth of plants including corn, cabbage, and beans. 
Nanoparticles are dangerous because of their size. Particles present in the natural world cannot 
get in the brain, whereas smaller nanoparticles cannot be blocked. Due to their small size, they do 
not get caught in the airways, so they enter pulmonary cells directly. Moreover, smaller particles 
93 
 
may induce toxicity that was not originally present due to increased their surface area. (Chosun 
Ilbo, 2006/07.03)     
 
Meanwhile, the positive or negative tone of news articles in each frame was determined 
based on casual attribution and moral judgment in frame elements. In other words, the 
positive or negative description of a specific frame is determined according to the ratio of 
benefit attribution and benefits, or risk attribution and risks, in the relevant frame.  
""Economic Benefits,"" ""Research & Development"" and ""Policy"" were positively 
described among all frames. Science (68.9%) showed the highest benefit attribution in 
""Economic Benefits"" and economy (71.0%) accounted for the highest as the corresponding 
benefits. In other words, news articles included in each frame investigated economic benefits 
of science and technology and covered such economic benefits positively. The only benefit 
attribution in ""Research & Development"" was science. Research (70.2%) showed the highest 
in the corresponding benefits. This indicated that the articles in a relevant frame positively 
described the development of nanotechnology mainly through R&D. Politics (90.4%), in 
""Policy"" showed up overwhelmingly highest among benefit attribution and research (70.4%) 
had the highest percentage among corresponding benefits. Considering that the medical 
implementation (74.0%) topic showed the highest ratio in ""Policy,"" the articles included in 
the relevant frame positively described the research on the medical application of 
nanotechnology mainly according to policy. However, ""Environmental Risks"" and ""Health 
Risks"" were covered negatively. Science was the only risk attribution in both frames and the 
corresponding risks were the environment and health, respectively.  
While benefit attribution and benefits comprised several variables in the frames which 
were positively described, risk attribution and risks in the frames which were negatively 
94 
 
described comprised a single variable. The frames positively describing nanotechnology were 
overwhelmingly higher (80.7%) than the frames negatively describing it (11.1%).  
 
7.3. Framing differences across countries. 
""Research & Development"" (45.1%) showed up as highest among articles on 
nanotechnology in South Korea (n=426), followed by ""Health Risks"" (22.1%), ""Economic 
Benefits"" (11.5%), ""Environmental Risks"" (8.9%), ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (7.7%) 
and ""Policy"" (4.7%), in that order.  
""Research & Development"" (41.4%) was identified most in Chosun Ilbo (n=249), the 
South Korean newspaper, followed by ""Health Risks"" (30.9%), ""Economic Benefits"" (13.7%), 
""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (8.0%), and ""Policy"" (6.0%), in that order. ""Research & 
Development"" (50.3%) also was identified most in Hankyoreh Sinmun (n=177), another 
South Korean newspaper, followed by ""Environmental Risks"" (21.5%), ""Health Risks"" 
(9.6%), ""Economic Benefits"" (8.5%), ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (7.3%), and ""Policy"" 
(2.8%), in that order.  
""Health Risks"" (30.9%) accounted for a high ratio in Chosun Ilbo, ""Environmental 
Risks"" didn’t show up at all. But Hankyoreh Sinmun showed a high percentage of 
""Environmental Risks"" (21.5%), and ""Health Risks"" (9.6%) were relatively low.  
""Research & Development"" (57.7%) showed the highest percentage in Germany 
(n=260), followed by ""Economic Benefits"" (33.5%), ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (6.9%), 
and ""Policy"" (1.9%), in that order.  
""Research & Development"" (55.3%) showed the highest percentage in the German 
newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (n=161), followed by ""Economic Benefits"" 
(33.5%), ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (8.1%), and ""Policy"" (3.1%), in that order. 
95 
 
""Research & Development"" (61.3%) also had the highest percentage in another German 
newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung (n=99), followed by ""Economic Benefits"" (33.3%), and 
""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (5.1%), in that order.  
Where ""Research & Development"" and ""Economic Benefits"" accounted for 95% in 
Süddeutsche Zeitung, ""Policy"" was nonexistent. While ""Research & Development"" and 
""Economic Benefits"" showed a lower percentage in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung than in 
Süddeutsche Zeitung, ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" and ""Policy"" showed higher 
percentages in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung than in Süddeutsche Zeitung.

The ""Research & Development"" frame showed up the most in the Austrian newspaper, 
Presse (n=82), followed by ""Economic Benefits"" (29.3%). ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" 
and ""Policy"" accounted for 11.0% each. ""Research & Development"" (58.8%) also showed up

(15.8%), ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (14.0%), and ""Policy"" (11.4%), in that order.  
Like other countries, Austrian newspapers also showed the common tendency that 
""Research & Development"" accounted for the highest ratio. However, ""Research & 
Development” showed a higher ratio in Standard than in Presse, while ""Economic Benefits"" 
accounted for a lower ratio in Standard than in Presse.  
""Research & Development"" (65.0%) showed the highest percentage in Japan (n=309), 
followed by ""Economic Benefits"" (19.4%), ""Policy"" (8.4%), and ""Overview of

(13.4%), ""Policy"" (10.8%), and ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (8.9%), in that order. 
""Research & Development"" also accounted for the highest number in another Japanese 
newspaper, Asahi Shimbun (n=152), followed by ""Economic Benefits"" (25.7%), ""Policy"" 
(5.9%), and ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" (5.3%), in that order.  
While Japanese newspapers had the common feature that the ""Research & 
Development"" frame accounted for a high ratio, ""Economic Benefits"" varied depending on 
the newspaper. Notable was the relatively higher ratio of ""Economic Benefits"" in Asahi 
Shimbun, having a progressive tendency, than in Yomiuri Shimbun, having a conservative 
tendency.

Of the four countries selected for analysis, Germany showed the highest frame 
concentration (Table 7.4.). The ratio of the top two frames in accumulative percentages of 
media frames was 91.2% in German newspapers, which was relatively higher than Japan 
(84.4%), Austria (76.0%), and South Korea (67.2%).  
 
7.4. Framing Dynamics Over a Time Span 
While ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" showed up as highest in 2001 (16.1%), it was 
lowest in 2012 (1.5%). Its percentage had been declining since 2001 and is experiencing a 
sudden rise since 2010. In particular, it recorded the most drastic change by falling down by 
10% over the previous year in 2012. This occurred because of the change in the roles of news 
articles in ""Overview of Nanotechnology."" While this frame was found mainly in articles 
introducing nanotechnology in the 2000s, in the 2010s it was accompanied with articles 
included in other frames. For the news articles on the economic consequences of 
nanotechnology, for example, ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" appeared as the supplementary 
98 
 
articles explaining nanotechnology on the same page  
""Policy"" showed its highest percentage in 2009 (9.1%), but its lowest in 2003 (2.1%). 
""Policy"" had a relatively more stable tendency than other frames because all countries 
selected for analysis implemented the national-level initiative on nanotechnology and then 
news articles continuously reported on that initiative. A nanotechnology policy or initiative 
was actually announced in the US in 2001 (the National Nanotechnology Initiative), in 
Austria in 2002 (Austrian NANO initiative), in Japan in 2005 (Science and Technology Basic 
Plan), in Germany in 2010 (Nano Initiative 2010), in Korea in 2012 (Nanotechnology 
Comprehensive Development Plan), and again in Germany in 2014 (Action Plan 
Nanotechnology 2015), and newspapers in each country gave major coverage to those 
policies/initiatives.  
""Economic Benefits"" accounted for its highest percentage in 2003 (34.0%), but its 
lowest in 2010 (9.2%). While the frame exhibited dynamic change from its fast rise until the 
mid-2000s, it kept a stable percentage around 10% since 2010. This was because the 
nanotechnology's economic effects have been felt since the late 2000s.  
""Environmental Risks"" showed up temporarily from 2003 to 2009. It had its highest 
percentage in 2008 (11.3%) but experienced a sudden change from 2007 to 2009. It was 
observed only in Hankyoreh Sinmun, in South Korea. Therefore, ""Environmental Risks"" had 
its limits in describing the nanotechnology frame dynamics.  
While ""Research & Development"" accounted for the highest percentage of all news 
articles, with its peak in 2001 (62.5%), and its lowest year in 2009 (44.3%). While it declined 
in the 2000s, its percentage rebounded in the early 2010s. However, it declined again from 
the mid-2010s. With the US National Nanotechnology Initiative in the early 2000s, each 
government began large-scale nanotechnology investment. Following this trend, newspapers 
99 
 
also showed increasing interest in nanotechnology. While their interest gradually decreased 
since then, it increased again as the achievements in nanotechnology arose in the 2010s. 
Since ""Research & Development"" was observed in the news articles covering successful 
nanotechnology research processes and developments, the dynamics of ""Research & 
Development"" most properly reflected newspapers' nanotechnology interest.  
""Health Risks"" showed up from 2007 on. This frame had its peak percentage in 2010 
(23.7%), but didn’t appear in 2003 at all. In spite of a sudden increase around 2010, it showed 
a stable tendency to stay around 10% since then. While ""Health Risks"" accounted for a lower 
percentage than ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" and ""Policy"" until the mid-2000s, it arose 
from 2007. Such change reflected the gradually increasing interest of newspapers on 
nanotechnology's risks as well as its benefits.  
The following is the change of frame by country during the relevant period. In South 
Korea, ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" showed its highest percentage in 2001 (22.2%), but it 
never appeared several years. ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" accounted for a substantial 
percentage of the total articles in the early 2000s, but rapidly decreased since 2006 and didn’t 
appear at all thereafter except for 2010, 2011, and 2014. ""Policy"" accounted for its highest 
percentage in 2002 (12.5%), but never appeared several times. Similar to ""Overview of 
Nanotechnology,"" ""Policy"" frame appeared frequently in the early 2000s. However, with its 
rapid decline since the mid-2000s, this frame repeatedly appeared and disappeared.

While ""Economic Benefits"" showed its highest percentage in 2003 (34.5%), it didn't 
appear in 2001 and 2011. It had significant change around 2003, 2009, and 2013, but tended 
to stay stable from 2013 on. ""Environmental Risks"" had its highest percentage in 2008 
(34.6%), but has not appeared since 2010. The frame percentage changed on a regular basis 
with 2005 and 2008 as its peak years.  
""Research & Development"" accounted for its highest percentage in 2001 (66.7%), and 
its lowest in 2008 (30.8%). It had been on a downturn but took an upturn from 2008 on. 
However, then it again showed a downturn since 2012. ""Health Risks"" showed its highest 
percentage in 2010 (41.9%) but didn’t appear in 2003. In spite of its sudden rise several times, 
it was gradually taking an upturn as time went by. In particular, it was more frequently 
observed than the ""Research & Development"" frame in 2015.  
In Germany, ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" had its highest percentage in 2010 (20.0%). 
However, it didn’t appear several times and has not appeared since 2011. ""Policy"" showed its 
highest percentage in 2010 (10.0%). However, it failed to appear 10 times between 2001 and 
2015. ""Economic Benefits"" accounted for its highest percentage in 2007 (53.3%) but didn’t 
appear in 2014. ""Research & Development"" showed its highest percentage in 2014 (100.0%), 
but its lowest in 2009 (41.7%). However, even with dramatic change in ""Economic Benefits"" 
and ""Research & Development,"" those frames were the limited in explaining because there 
were only 6 articles in those relevant frames in German newspapers at that time.  
In Austria, ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" showed its highest percentage in 2014 
(50.0%), but didn’t appear several years. Since the number of frames in Austrian newspapers 
from 2010 was not sufficient, the change was relatively dramatic. ""Policy"" accounted for its 
highest percentage in 2005 (25.0%), but didn’t appear several years. In particular, the frame 
102 
 
was rapidly decreasing from 2010 on. ""Economic Benefits"" had its highest percentage in 
2015 (44.4%), but didn’t appear several years. ""Research & Development"" showed its highest 
percentage in 2011(100.0%), and its lowest in 2006(41.5%). 
In Japan, ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" accounted for its highest percentage in 2001 
(22.2%) but didn’t appear from 2008 to 2014. In 2015, the frame accounted for 11.1%. 
""Policy"" had its highest percentage in 2011 (30.0%) and its lowest in 2007 (2.6%). The frame 
kept its percentage around 10% until 2007 and gradually increased since then. ""Economic 
Benefits"" had its highest percentage in 2013 (88.2%) and its lowest in 2015 (44.4%). While 
""Policy"" and ""Research & Development"" accounted for a higher ratio than in other countries, 
the change of those frames was not significant.  
 
7.5. Cultural Effect on Media Frame 
Table 7.5. presents the results from a logistic regression model with the simultaneous 
estimation of variables applying five cultural dimensions. In the logistic regression model, 
""Overview of Nanotechnology"" was not statistically significant, but other frames showed 
statistical significance with p<.0001.  
Two cultural dimensions, Power Distance (PDI) and Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI), were 
significantly associated with the presentation of ""Policy."" PDI showed a negative correlation 
with ""Policy,"" but UAI had a positive correlation. Without the influence of any other cultural 
dimensions, a country with a UAI score of one unit more was 1.091 times more likely to 
present a ""Policy"" as much as its reference country. However a country with a PDI score of 
one unit more was 0.947 times less likely to present a ""Policy"" frame. Accordingly, the higher 
the UAI score was, the more ""Policy"" appeared. Conversely, the higher the PDI score was, 
the less ""Policy"" appeared.

""Economic Benefits"" correlated only with the Individualism/Collectivism (IDV) culture 
dimension. Without the influence of any other cultural dimensions, a country with an IDV 
score of one unit more was 1.028 times more likely to present an “Economic Benefits"" frame 
than its reference country. Therefore, ""Economic Benefits"" was observed more frequently in 
news articles in countries with an individualist culture.  
""Research & Development"" had significant correlation with IDV and UAI among 
cultural dimensions. IDV and UAI showed a positive correlation with ""Research & 
Development."" Without the influence of any other cultural dimensions, a country with an 
IDV score of one unit more was 1.022 times more likely to present a ""Research & 
Development"" than its reference country. And a country with an UAI score of one unit more 
was 1.029 times more likely to present a ""Research & Development"" frame than its reference 
country. In other words, the more a culture tended to be individualistic and the stronger it 
avoided uncertainty, the more the ""Research & Development"" frame appeared.  
Meanwhile, since ""Environmental Risks"" and ""Health Risks"" were identified only in 
South Korean newspapers, the study did not compare a cultural dimension having affecting 
104 
 
both frames.  
In addition, this study compare the proportion of the media frame and the score on the 
cultural dimension of each country. The study results are as follows. First, the higher the IDV 
score, the higher the proportion of the ""Economic Benefits"" frame. Germany (67), which has 
the highest IDV score among the four countries, has a higher proportion of the ""Economic 
Benefits"" frame (33.5%) among all media frames, than other countries. Furthermore, the four 
countries were in the same order in terms of the magnitude of the IDV score and the 
proportion of the ""Economic Benefits"" frame: Germany (67/33.5%), Austria (55/21.4%), 
Japan (46/19.4%), and South Korea (18/11.5%).

the ""Policy"" frame, the PDI was generally in inverse proportion to the ""Policy"" frame, but the 
UAI did not show a specific correlation. Similarly, regarding the two cultural dimensions that 
influence the ""Research & Development"" frame, IDVs are generally found to be proportional 
to the ""Research & Development"" frame, but the UAI scores showed no specific correlation.

8. DISCUSSION 
 
8.1. Presence of Media Frame 
Research Question 1a was to identify the media frame on nanotechnology in newspapers 
in South Korea, Germany, Austria, and Japan. Six media frames were identified through 
cluster analysis.  
""Overview of Nanotechnology"" answered the inquiries including ""what is 
nanotechnology?"", ""what is the origin of the word ‘nano’?"", and ""how tiny is nanometer?"". 
And news articles on ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" supplemented articles on other frames 
generally as being published on the same page. The reason why the media appeared as the 
actor in ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" frame relatively more than other frames was that the 
media itself, in a number of news articles, explained nanotechnology to readers. It was also 
found that various types of actors had the chance to be mentioned equally in news articles 
because the frame focused on general explanation and introduction to nanotechnology rather 
than emphasizing the specific aspects.  
""Policy"" indicated that the public discourse on nanotechnology was formed at the 
political dimension. Political actors (governments or politicians) effected the use of 
nanotechnology in the medical field. It showed up by the overwhelming call for support of 
nanotechnology in the ""Policy"" frame. Therefore, ""Policy"" frame indicated the tendency 
related to nanotechnology in the sequence of ""Policy  R&D  Health Care/Medical 
Service.""  
""Economic Benefits"" discussed nanotechnology's practical and feasible benefits. 
Accounting for 20% of all frames, ""Economic Benefits"" is one of the main frames specifying 
public discourse on nanotechnology. News articles included in ""Economic Benefits"" had 
lesser calls for support because they focused on the economic results which would be realized 
107 
 
soon. Thus, this is compared to ""Policy"" emphasizing politics as the benefit attribution. For 
""Economic Benefits,"" science and economy as benefit attributions, and the economy as 
benefits were highlighted. Consequently, ""Policy"" included a benefit-oriented tendency and a 
call for support in news articles on nanotechnology while ""Economic Benefits"" showed only 
benefit-oriented tendencies. This indicated that business was positioned as the core in 
relevant news articles rather than political support, because of how efficiently 
nanotechnology was already verified in the economic sector.  
The political actor and the media had high percentages among various actors in the 
""Environmental Risk"" frame. It indicated that the discourse on environmental risks to be 
caused by nanotechnology was formed in the political sector as well as in science. In other 
words, ""Environmental Risk"" explained role sharing among actors as scientists investigated 
the negative effects of nanotechnology, the media warned society, and politicians tried to 
create policies to control it.  
""Research & Development"" accounted for the highest percentage in 6 frames. It 
indicated that the public discourse on nanotechnology was still formed around technological 
development and scientific discovery. The results of this study were mirrored in existing 
studies (Anderson, Allan, Petersen, & Wilkinson, 2005; Donk, Meta, Kohring, & 
Marcinkowski, 2012; Laing, 2006; Schmidt Kjærgaard, 2010; Weaver, Lively, & Bimber, 
2009) because ""Research & Development"" appeared in the general deployment process of 
emerging technologies. Indeed, emerging technologies and their efficiency rose as a social 
topic in their development phase. And then, as they enter into the popularization and 
commercialization phases, their practical effects are verified and public awareness on 
potential risks caused by those emerging technologies develops.  
108 
 
While the technological benefits of nanotechnology presently have been realized as it 
has entered into the popularization and commercialization phases, its risks are not yet 
scientifically verified. Accordingly, news articles on nanotechnology keep focusing on 
technological developments and corresponding benefits unless there otherwise is a definite 
risk that the public can perceive. 
The ""Health Risks"" frame is similar to ""Environmental Risks."" Specifically, both frames 
showed a higher ratio of the media as actor than other frames because the media role which 
explains the risks of nanotechnology well enough to be easily understood is reflected in both 
frames. Unlike the benefits of nanotechnology, its risks and side effects are not definitively 
determined. Accordingly, there are more opinions and judgments by the media itself 
compared to news articles on nanotechnology benefits. However, calls for regulation on 
nanotechnology differed in both frames. While calls for regulation showed up in both frames, 
""Environmental Risks"" showed relatively higher calls for regulation than ""Health Risks."" The 
benefits and risks of nanotechnology to medicine and health are relatively known well. 
Conversely, the risks of nanotechnology were mentioned more than its benefits related to the 
environment. Thus, while nanotechnology use and its regulation is supported with respect to 
medicine and health, only regulation is supported with respect to the environment.   
Research Questions 1b and 1c were to examine the differences in media frames by 
country and period. The most significant feature of media frames in South Korean 
newspapers is the appearance of the risk-oriented frame (""Environmental Risks"" + ""Health 
Risks""). Only newspapers in South Korea showed the risk-oriented frame. It accounted for 
31.0% of all media frames in South Korea and indeed the news coverage on nanotechnology's 
benefits and risks were relatively more balanced than in Germany, Austria, and Japan.  
The appearance of the risk-oriented frame is based on the unique way South Korean 
109 
 
newspapers deal with scientific issues. In South Korea, discussing scientific issues frequently 
changes into political discourse and finally causes serious ideological conflicts. Such 
conflicts arise because of two scientific scandals causing an enormous impact on South 
Korean society in the 2000s. One was the manipulation of stem cell research. In 2004, Dr. 
Hwang Woosuk at Seoul National University in South Korea published a paperstating that he 
successfully extracted stem cells from a cloned somatic cell. His research results rose to 
national prominence because they promised to treat incurable diseases using stem cells and to 
innovatively strengthen the competitiveness of South Korean bio-industry. At that time, the 
South Korea government designated Dr. Hwang as a ‘national scientist’ and provided a 
tremendous amount of financial research subsidy. Moreover, a biography of Dr. Hwang was 
even published for kids. However, PD Notebook, the investigative journalism program of 
MBC, the public broadcasting network in South Korea, raised doubts as to whether Dr. 
Hwang intentionally manipulated the research results. The next year, Dr. Hwang admitted to 
the manipulation.  
Another issue arose regarding mad cow disease.6 Seoul and Washington DC had been 
negotiating on importing American beef in 2008. At that time, PD Notebook broadcasted an 
investigative program criticizing the risks of American beef that was causing mad cow 
disease. In spite of the argument that PD Notebook exaggerated the risks of mad cow disease, 
a number of citizens who watched the program continued an antigovernment demonstration 
for about 100 days. Finally, the President of Korea apologized publicly and some ministers in 
his cabinet resigned.  
Both scandals definitely indicated that the public discourse in South Korea was 
dramatically changed due to the media and public frenzy on scientific issues. While media 
                                           
6 Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) 
110 
 
frames in South Korean newspapers related to science and technology focused mainly on 
""Scientific Achievement,"" ""Heroes,"" or ""Economic Benefits"" before both scandals (Chung, 
2004; Kim & Lee, 2005; Kim & Cho, 2005), ""Risks"" and ""Social Conflicts"" appeared after 
both scandals (Kim, 2011). In a study comparing media frames in newspapers in South Korea 
to those in the UK related to stem cells (Kim, 2011), the media frames in the UK passed 
through process of ""early concerns  British interest  medical progress."" However, the 
media frames in South Korea were changed leading to the sequence of ""bioethics  societal 
irrationality/national success  social problems/legitimization"" with the scandal of Dr. 
Hwang as the turning point. Consequently, the risk-oriented frame in South Korea was 
formed as news articles reflected a unique viewpoint which considered the uncertainty of 
technology not by its scientific aspect but by its political aspect.  
Meanwhile, risk-oriented frame varied in South Korean newspapers. While ""Health 
Risks"" was strong in Chosun Ilbo, ""Environmental Risks"" was found relatively more often in 
Hankyoreh Sinmun. Both newspapers showed differences in the risk-oriented frame because 
while nanotechnology effects on medical and health care issues was discussed both as to its 
benefits and risks, nanotechnology discussion related to environmental issues mainly 
highlighted the risks. This was evident from the fact that ""Economic Benefits"" and ""Policy"" 
had relatively smaller percentages in the conservative Chosun Ilbo than in the liberal 
Hankyoreh Sinmun. And building on the aspect that the articles in “Policy” deal mainly with 
medical implementation, Chosun Ilbo focused on both positive and negative impacts of 
nanotechnology on the medicine field. However, Hankyoreh Sinmun emphasized the risks 
inherently caused by nanotechnology more than Chosun Ilbo by focusing on issues related to 
the environment. 
111 
 
The media frames of nanotechnology in Germany were mainly positive and benefit-
oriented. Compared to the study of Kohring and his colleagues (Donk, Meta, Kohring, & 
Marcinkowski, 2012) adopting the same methodology as this study, the tendency of news 
articles on nanotechnology in Germany to comprise two main frames, ""Research & 
Development"" and ""Economic Benefits,"" was identified again. The researchers identified 4 
media frames from German daily newspapers from 2000 and 2008; ""Research & 
Development,"" ""Economic Benefits,"" ""Medical,"" and ""Ambivalence."" ""Research & 
Development"" and ""Economic Benefits"" also were identified in this study. Moreover, 
individual variables comprising the two frames were almost identical.  
 
 
Figure 8.1. Changes of media frame in German newspapers 
112 
 
 
For example, the variable selected as the main topic in ""Research & Development"" was 
scientific research in both studies. Furthermore, the ratio of selected variable in the relevant 
frame was very similar; 61.7% in Kohring and his colleagues' study, and 62.3% in this study. 
However, the ratio of variable selected in ""Medical"" and ""Ambivalence"" differed from this 
study. The main topic in ""Medical"" was similar to ""Policy"" in this paper, but the variable in 
actor and benefit attribution was similar to the ""Research & Development"" frame in this study. 
Moreover, while the main topic was partially similar to ""Overview of Nanotechnology"", 
‘Ambivalence’ was not observed in this study.  
It is notable that ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" playing the role of explaining 
nanotechnology was newly identified and ""Ambivalence"" dealing with social risks and 
benefits disappeared in the results of Kohring and his colleagues. Although only 
""Ambivalence"" was related to risks of nanotechnology in earlier results, ""Overview of 
Nanotechnology"" newly identified in this study didn’t deal with the risks. This indicated that 
media frames on nanotechnology in the German newspapers had a strengthened benefit-
oriented tendency. This was also showed by the ratio of ""Research & Development"" and 
""Economic Benefits"". While both frames in the earlier study accounted for 73.6%, they 
comprised 91.2% of all frames in this study. The increasing percentage of both frames 
positively describing nanotechnology in this study suggested the enhancement of a benefit-
oriented tendency.  
The benefit-oriented frame was found relatively more often in Germany because 
Germany has no issues triggering the public to recognize the risks of nanotechnology up to 
now. Moreover, substantial time is needed for nanomaterials to accumulate in a body or 
environment and expose either to serious damage. The only negative issue regarding 
113 
 
nanotechnology in German newspapers during the analysis period was the Neosino case. This 
case was related to health supplements using nanotechnology. It didn’t point out 
nanotechnology risks but raised doubts about its efficiency. While it damaged public 
confidence on nanotechnology, it didn’t intrinsically raise the risks of nanotechnology.  
Another reason for the benefit-oriented frame predominance in Germany is the policy of 
the German federal government focusing on the benefits of nanotechnology. The German 
government has been concentrating on nanotechnology development and commercialization 
by announcing the ""Action Plan Nanotechnology 2015."" This indicates that Germany aims to 
maximize the benefits of nanotechnology. While the government supports research on risks 
including the ""NanoCare Project,"" which is investigating the impact of nanotechnology on 
health, German policies mainly reflect the expectation of economic consequences.  
In Austria, the introduction to and policy on nanotechnology frames were relatively 
prominent. ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" and ""Policy"" accounted for 24.0% in Austria, 
which was higher than the 12.5% in South Korea, 8.8% in Germany, and 15.5% in Japan. 
Both frames were frequently observed in the early development phase of nanotechnology. In 
this study, both frames were also identified often in the early 2000s when nanotechnology 
initiatives were introduced in each country and nanotechnology projects were seriously 
started. Such feature was identified as the policies of each country promoting nanotechnology 
potential were introduced in the media, gradually increasing the need to explain that 
emerging technology.  
In this aspect, the ""Overview of Nanotechnology"" and ""Policy"" frames were found 
relatively more often in Austria because there were the development of nanotechnology and 
the formation of corresponding public discourse behind the other 3 countries. It’s only since 
2009 that the discourse on nanotechnology expanded from the science sector to society at 
114 
 
large in Austria (Nentwich, Kurath, Fleischer, Grunwald, & Eisenberger, 2010). This means 
that news articles in Austria had less impact from social discussion of nanotechnology than in 
other countries during the analysis period.  
The most unique result in Japanese newspapers was that ""Research & Development"" 
was found more often than in other countries. ""Research & Development"" accounted for 65.0% 
in Japanese newspapers, higher than the 57.7% in Germany, the 54.6% in Austria, and the 
45.1% in South Korea. A similar result was also found in biotechnology frames which drew 
attention as an emerging technology earlier than nanotechnology (Hibino & Nagata, 2006; 
Shineha, Hibino & Kato, 2008). The theme on biotechnology in the Japanese newspapers was 
changed from application to research and the media frame related to research and 
development was positioned as the core consistently dominating news articles in Japan for 15 
years.  
Existing studies, and this study as well, identified that scientific research and 
development and economic benefits were the main frames in nanotechnology news articles. 
This is because there is still no definite and direct risk caused by the technology which the 
public can clearly recognize, and because nanotechnology still has no cultural stigma that 
specifies the negative aspects of emerging technology like biotechnology, which has 
genetically modified crops described as Frankenstein food. Nevertheless, the reasons above 
alone are not enough to explain the unique significance of ""Research & Development"" in 
Japan. One possible explanation is that so called, ""Honne (本音) & Tatemae (建前')""7 culture, 
                                           
7 Honne (本音) is unique thoughts, emotions or wishes of an individual, Tatemae (建前) means behaviors and 
words which are accepted to be right from the other’s perspective. Honne & Tatemae indicates the unique 
contradictory culture of Japan which tries to hide the true heart of the self but to act in accordance with the ‘right 
ways’ determined by a society. 
115 
 
the unique culture of Japan reluctant to publicly link academic achievement to economic 
success, might be reflected in the media representation on emerging technology. 
Looking at the dynamics of the media frame, ""Research & Development"" and 
""Economic Benefits"" kept accounting for around 70% in the entire analysis period as the 
main way by which media portrays nanotechnology. However, when ""Research & 
Development"" increased, ""Economic Benefits"" was generally accordingly reduced. The 
correlation between both frames running in opposite ways during the same period is based on 
the characteristics of nanotechnology. Since nanotechnology has still been in the development 
phase, the recursive phases in the change of both frames were understood. A similar 
correlation was identified in an earlier study Kohring and his colleagues conducted by 
applying the same methodology used in this study.  
The risk-oriented frame observed only in South Korean newspapers had different risk 
topics per time period. The frame dealing with environmental risks was concentrated in the 
mid-2000s, but disappeared after 2010. Conversely, the frame dealing with health risks was 
not significant until the mid-2000s, but became prominent since 2008. The reason for the 
difference between environmental and health risks per period was that there are no concrete 
risks related to nanotechnology which the public can clearly recognize until now. As 
nanotechnology has been brought to society's attention, its environmental risks arose earlier 
than other issues. However, since the negative impacts of nanotechnology on the environment 
only can be identified after accumulating for a long time, there are no negative issues which 
the public and media can visually recognize. On the contrary, while there is no negative issue 
on health risks which can be visually identified up to now, like environmental risks, the 
media’s interest in risks has naturally moved to health as nanotechnology applications and 
policies focused on medicine. 
116 
 
 
8.2. Cultural Resonance and Salience of Media Frame 
Research Question 2 was to examine the cultural effect on media frame using a logistic 
regression model. When other factors were not considered, it was verified that the media 
frame resonated with a specific cultural dimension.  
The cultural dimensions power distance and uncertainty avoidance had an effect on 
""Policy."" It indicated resonance between both cultural dimensions and ""Policy."" The stronger 
the tendency to avoid uncertainty and the lower the power distance was, the more frequently 
""Policy"" was observed.  
The effect of power distance on ""Policy"" was classified largely into two perspectives. 
The first is the effect of the cultural dimension itself on the frame. According to Hofstede's 
research, the lower the PDI score a society had, the higher the social position and academic 
background of its scientists were. In other words, the power distance was lower in a society 
with a more advanced higher education system. Power in such a society was based on official 
position and specialty. Thus, a society with lower power distance acquires political effects on 
a specific issue through system based on special knowledge. The society with lower PDI 
score related to nanotechnology emphasizes the necessity of technology policy more than a 
society with a higher PDI score, and it has an effect on the emergence of the media frame.  
Next comes the effect of national characteristics comprising cultural dimensions on the 
frame. Power distance is closely related to national wealth. The lower the power distance is, 
the richer a country becomes. There is also a feature applied to power distance and national 
wealth in common. The more modern science and technology, advanced education system, 
and middle class a country has, the lower the power distance is and the richer a country is. 
Accordingly, technology policy like nanotechnology needing tremendous amounts of finance 
117 
 
and advanced special knowledge is observed mainly in rich countries. Lower power distance 
thus has an effect on the salience of media frames.  
An uncertainty avoidance culture also resonates with ""Policy."" A culture strongly 
avoiding uncertainty focuses not on avoidance of adventure but on reduction of ambiguity. 
Moreover, such a culture pursues rules and organization to clearly analyze and evaluate a 
specific issue. Accordingly, a society with a higher UAI score has relatively stronger rules 
and emphasizes the necessity for reducing anxiety of ambiguity, and as results, its members 
believe in the system. Nanotechnology has high uncertainty and its potential benefits and 
risks have socially discussed in society up to now. Accordingly, the media in a society with a 
strong uncertainty avoidance culture uses more ""Policy"" for nanotechnology.  
A culture with a higher IDV score had more ""Economic Benefits."" The basic 
characteristics of individualism include the responsibility of an individual, free market, and 
economic growth. It means the tendency to maximize benefits by accepting risks, and 
emphasizes economic compensation. Thus, it is inevitable that media in an individualism 
culture uses more ""Economic Benefits."" ""Economic Benefits"" in the individualistic society 
showed more cultural resonance because an individual is defined as ""Homo economicus"" and 
economic benefits are emphasized as compensation for the acceptance of the uncertainty of 
nanotechnology. The close correlation between individualism culture and economic results is 
natural because capitalism is based on individualism. To this point, Neuman and his 
colleagues pointed out that the economic consequence frame extensively reflected the 
benefits, losses, and values of capitalism (Neuman, Just, & Crigler, 1992). They identified 
that the media's application of an economic frame reflected the values of dominant capitalists.  
The cultural dimensions resonating with ""Research & Development"" were 
Individualism/Collectivism and Uncertainty Avoidance. The stronger the individualism 
118 
 
tendency and the uncertainty avoidance tendency were, the more frequently ""Research & 
Development"" was observed. Individualism is based on an individual's autonomy and the 
increase of individualism expands the intelligent openness. All ideas in such a society are the 
target of competition and skeptical criticism. Individualism has the tendency to be extremely 
intelligent and questioning and demands the highest standards. Accordingly, uncertainty is an 
opportunity for an individualist. Indeed, individualists think there is no uncertainty, risk of 
loss, individual compensation, and business prospective. In this aspect, the individualism 
culture considers technology as a good. Compliance with market principles accelerates 
technology innovation, and the extraordinary economic benefits obtained through technology 
innovation is connected to a premise for a better life (Wildavsky & Dake, 1990). ""Research & 
Development"" appears relatively more frequently by resonating with the technology 
preference in an individualism culture because it describes nanotechnology's positive aspects.  
As described above, a culture strongly avoiding uncertainty uses rules to reduce 
ambiguity. Moreover, it relies on the experts for pursuing the absolute truth. Thus, the basic 
property of Uncertainty Avoidance culture has an effect on ""Research & Development."" Since 
scientific research aims to clarify the absolute rules in the natural order, the media in a culture 
strongly avoiding uncertainty has a relatively greater interest on the research on 
nanotechnology. In addition, as the media depends more on experts for reducing uncertainty 
on nanotechnology, it naturally focuses on the scientific work experts perform.  
However, the presence and salience of the media frame was not necessarily in agreement. 
As in the relationship between IDV and the ""Economic Benefits"" frame, the countries that are 
stronger in a specific cultural dimension sometimes showed increased salience and presence 
of the corresponding cultural dimension. However, the influences of all cultures on frame 
building did not determine the presence of the media frame of each country. This shows that 
119 
 
the variation in media frame among the countries is determined not only by cultural factors 
empirically tested in this study but also by the combined effects of other micro- and 
macrolevel factors.  
In addition, the study results corroborated with the theoretical concept of salience of the 
media frame. However, it was partially confirmed that the salience has a sequential linear 
order relationship with the presence of media frame.    
 
8.3. Conclusions and Implications 
The most important conclusions from this study are as follows. First, newspapers in 
South Korea, Germany, Austria, and Japan had a common point related to the media frame of 
nanotechnology in spite of differences in cultural background. In all countries' newspapers, 
positive description on nanotechnology was overwhelmingly greater than negative. The 
primary frames defining nanotechnology were ""Research & Development"" and ""Economic 
Benefits."" These results are similar to existing studies. Therefore, the study again found that 
the media frame on nanotechnology had common characteristics in positive description, 
research and development, and economic consequences.  
Second, there were obvious differences among countries even though the 4 countries 
showed similar media frame patterns. The risk-oriented frame was found only in South 
Korean newspapers. German newspapers emphasized economic benefits relatively more than 
other countries. In addition, ""Research & Development"" and ""Economic Benefits"" reached 
91.2% of all frames. The frame concentration in Germany was higher than in other countries. 
This reflected that the German newspapers couldn’t report on nanotechnology with various 
perspectives. In Austria and Japan, newspapers demonstrated relatively higher ""Policy"" and 
""Research & Development"" scores.  
120 
 
Third, the more ""Research & Development"" increased per time period, the more 
""Economic Benefits"" decreased. Furthermore, the environment and health themes were 
identified in a risk-oriented frame in that order.  
Finally, the differences in media frame by countries included the cultural characteristics 
of each country. Consistent with the analysis on the effect of cultural dimensions on media 
frames using a logistic regression model, a specific cultural dimension and a media frame 
resonate with each other. The lower the power distance was and the stronger the uncertainty 
avoidance was, the more frequently the ""Policy"" frame was identified. This meant that the 
cultural dimensions of relying on experts and preferring a system based on expertise was 
reflected in the ""Policy"" frame.  
The ""Economic Benefits"" frame was observed more frequently in a culture with stronger 
individualism. Germany had the strongest individualistic culture followed by Austria, Japan, 
and South Korea in that order. Correspondingly, Germany showed the highest ratio of 
""Economic Benefits"" followed by Austria, Japan and South Korea in that order. It indicated 
that the cultural dimension emphasizing competition and economic benefits resonated with 
the media frame related to economy.  
This study compared the media frame of nanotechnology observed in the newspapers in 
South Korea, Germany, Austria, and Japan. Moreover, this study found that cultural factors 
had effect on the media frame, but were ignored in existing studies up to now. Accordingly, 
using culture dimension as the independent variable in the research model, comparing the 
difference in media frames expands the theoretical perspective of the framing study.  
Existing studies were limited to descriptive methods measuring the number of cases 
from which media frames were extracted. However, this study added a new approach to 
framing theory and methodology divided into three perspectives. First, this study empirically 
121 
 
examined the cultural effect on media frame. While a number of studies assumed that 
macrolevel factors including culture had an effect on frame building, there was no previous 
empirical investigation. Therefore, this study was significant in that it built a regression 
model evaluating the media frame using cultural dimensions and verified the quantitative 
variables for comparing countries.  
Second, this study examined not only the presence of the media frame but also its 
salience. Existing studies focused only on the ""presence"" of media frame. They demonstrated 
only the difference in media frames but failed to empirically demonstrate the correlation of 
factors affecting the media frame. Therefore, this study empirically verified how the salience 
of each media frame was observed differently depending on its attribution as well as on a 
specific factor.  
Third, the media frame was identified by clustering frame elements. This approach 
excluded coders' influence on frames based on the complexity of an issue but clarified the 
emergence of new frames and disappearances of old frames. Compared to existing studies 
using the same method, for example, ""Ambivalence"" in earlier study disappeared and 
""Overview of Nanotechnology"" was emerged in German newspapers, and ""Medical Benefit"" 
in earlier study was changed into ""Research & Development"" and ""Policy"" in this study. 
Additionally, the risk-oriented frame was observed only in South Korea. Thus, because a 
media frame is determined not subjectively but empirically, the study approach to extract a 
new frame by clustering elements overcame the methodological limitations of existing 
studies.  
This study also contributed to the literature comparing media content between cultures 
and to science communication studies. While existing studies focused on the early 
development phase of nanotechnology, this study identified long-term tendencies by 
122 
analyzing news articles for 15 years, including 2010s when the potential risks of 
nanotechnology were discussed in society. Moreover, unlike existing studies limited to 
national comparisons between Europe and the US or between the US and Asia, this study 
expanded into regional and cultural comparisons that included German-speaking culture and 
Confucian culture. In addition, as comparing 2 countries has a limit in how it can inform 
generalizing results, this study attempted to overcome such a limit by studying 4 countries 
with different cultures.  
8.4. Limitations of the Study 
The limitation of this study is its sampling countries. The 4 countries were intentionally 
selected because the Eastern and Western countries were compared in a conventional way. 
Furthermore, this expanded the academic research landscape by comparing German-speaking 
culture and Confucian culture which were neglected until now. Nevertheless, the number of 
samples was still small, creating several methodological problems. First, the range of culture 
dimension scores per country may cause biased results. Since the risk-oriented frame was 
activated only in South Korea, the effect of that culture dimension on the relevant frames was 
limited. Moreover, one has to be very careful to generalize the results and apply them to other 
societies because 4 countries are not a representative sample.  
Another study limitation was that the effect of the presence and salience of the media 
frame was not examined in interaction between macro- and microlevel factors. This study 
found that each country showed diverse media frame presence and so cultural dimension of 
each country had a different effect on the salience of a media frame. To this end, this study 
selected countries having similar macrolevel factors (except culture), including ideology, 
political freedom, economic system, educational competitiveness, and nanotechnology 
123 
 
development status. Nevertheless, this failed to effectively control the microlevel factors 
affecting on frame building including media routines, political orientation, and the expertise 
of newspaper science journalists. Furthermore, this study empirically verified the effect of 
culture on media frame, but the explanatory power of the effect was not large. This leaves the 
room for the possibility that macrolevel factors other than culture can influence frame 
building.  
The study's content analysis also had a limitation. Content analysis is effective for 
identifying a difference in issues and events, but can’t determine the causality because of its 
limited inference ability. Since qualitative analysis was not applied, this study has some 
limitations in providing insight and understanding on each frame element on clustering. 
 
8.5. Opportunities for Further Study 
When this study is further applied to countries with diverse cultures, the explanatory 
power of the regression model on media frames will be strengthened. In particular, further 
studies can more definitely identify cultural effects on the media frame of nanotechnology 
more definitely by including English-speaking and Chinese-speaking countries having 
leading technology. In addition, more diverse kinds of media have to be included, for 
example, TV, news agencies, magazines, and the Internet, to more clearly understand media's 
representation of nanotechnology. Thus approach is also significant to be able to compare 
investigations of the cultural effects beyond the different kinds of media boundaries.  
Further study needs to focus on the interaction between factors having an effect on 
frame building. To this end, this study adopted the culture dimensions of Hofstede. While the 
analysis identified the effect of individual culture dimensions on the media frame, the effect 
of the interactions between culture dimensions was not verified. Accordingly, further study 
124 
 
will measure the multiple effects of culture dimensions. Moreover, the effect of other 
macrolevel factors including politics, the economy, and religion on frame building should be 
investigated.   
Regarding methodology, this study improved reliability and validity by clustering frame 
elements. To maximize the efficiency of the methodology, with the media frame as the cluster, 
it is necessary to additionally select and examine the definitions of frames from a variety of 
researchers. Furthermore, diverse alternatives including interviews, surveys, or experiments 
will be combined for supplementing the limitation of content analysis whose causality can’t 
be easily identified.

This study also introduced the concept of the salience of media frame, Kohring's approach that identifies the media frame by clustering its elements, and Hofstede's 5-D model into a cultural comparative analysis of news coverage. This study used the news articles on nanotechnology from 2001 to 2015 in selected newspapers in South Korea, Germany, Austria, and Japan.  

This study identified six media frames using cluster analysis: ""Overview of Nanotechnology,"" ""Policy,"" ""Economic Benefits,"" ""Environmental Risks,"" ""Research & Development"", and ""Health Risks."" All these countries' newspapers used ""Research & Development"" and ""Economic Benefits"" as their main frames, and overwhelmingly described nanotechnology positively. 

This study found significant differences in the way the study countries' newspapers framed nanotechnology. The risk-oriented frame was used only in South Korean newspapers. German newspapers emphasized the economic benefits frame relatively more than other countries. Austrian and Japanese newspapers more noticeable favored the ""Policy"" and ""Research & Development"" frames.  

This study's nanotechnology frame dynamics showed that between 2001 and 2004, the more the ""Research & Development"" frame use increased per time period, the more the ""Economic Benefits"" frame use decreased. And the environmental and healthy theme appeared by turns in risk-oriented frame. 

This study also examined how cultural dimensions across the countries could explain at the macro level such media framing variations. A logistic regression model indicated that a specific cultural dimension and a media frame are related to each other.

1.  INTRODUCTION
Nanotechnology can be defined as “the understanding 
and control of matter at dimension of roughly 1 nm to 100 
nm, where unique phenomena enable novel applications”1-3. 
The untapped potential of this upcoming endeavour is that, 
at nanoscale the particles obey quantum mechanism and 
possess novel properties which are different from the macro 
counterpart4. With nanotechnology, a scientist can not only 
calculate but also manipulate matter at nanoscale for novel 
inventions5.
Nature itself has beautifully well designed nanomaterials 
(NMs) like vital biological molecules which govern the very 
existence of human beings6. The science of nanotechnology 
dated to the ancient era, has now revolutionised the modern 
day world. Nanotechnology has unlocked new avenues in 
different area like medicine, agriculture, electronics, cosmetics 
and daily utilities7. The consumer market is flooded with nano 
based applications in medicine, water purification system, 
commercial products and food industry. The upcoming 
applications of nanotechnology are implementation of the novel 
mechanism at nano level with precision, and “Food –Nanotech” 
is one of it. With the increasing trend of nano products there is 
an intentional (engineered) or unintentional (Incidental/waste 
NPs/environmental) exposure to nanoparticles (NPs)8,9 and 
human are coming in close contact with NMs, however their 
interaction with the bio molecular counterpart is still not clear. 
Nanotechnology has applications that noteworthy have ethical, 
legal and social implications (ELSIs)10. 
This article overviews the applications of nanotechnology 
in food industry drawing attention towards the safety issues, 
mechanism of nano induced toxicity, current regulations, 
guidelines and public acceptance of nano based applications 
in the food industry. 
2.  FOOD NANOTECHNOLOGY 
Nano technological applications can be classified into two 
forms: passive nanotechnology which includes paints, colloids, 
polymers and ceramics or active nanotechnology that include 
drug delivery and robotics. Food nanotechnology comprises 
both forms; “passive nanotechnology” as the NPs are used in 
packing material and “active nanotechnology” as in Nano-Food 
ingredients11. Applications of nanotechnology in food industry 
can be collectively termed as Food Nanotechnology. 
For Nano food applications usually two different 
approaches are integrated “Top down approach” and “Bottom up 
approach”12. Top down approach includes physical processing 
which mainly involves grinding and milling e.g. grinded green 
tea with improved antioxidant properties13. Bottom up approach 
is based on self-assembly and self-organisation. The process 
of self-assembly can be regulated by governing different non 
covalent forces. An example to bottom up approach is casein 
micelles and starch.

ABTRACT
Rapid development of nanotechnology has revolutionsed various areas of conventional food science and food 
industry. The novel properties of nanoparticles (NPs) have led to increasing application of nanotechnology in food 
industry. Nanofood market have a variety of products like the creamy ice-cream, drinks with no fat, enhanced flavour 
with nutrients and better textured, coloured and fresh looking food. Continuous monitoring for food spoilage or 
contamination is possible too. Nanotechnology has transformed the food industries which claim health benefits along 
with better taste. With the increasing use of NPs especially in food products, where humans are in close contact of 
the engineered nanomaterials (NMs), it is important to ensure safety before use. Bio-nano interactions often result 
in novel reaction and formation of products leading to toxicity. NPs mediated toxicity mainly includes inflammation, 
oxidative damage and genotoxicity. Prolong use of these particles can cause detrimental effects on health. Presently, 
due to lack of appropriate guidelines and regulations for food nanotechnology there are uncertainties regarding risk 
identification. Hence, it is essential to evaluate the consequences of this technology in terms of general public and 
occupational health risks associated with the manufacture, use and disposal of NMs, before instigating the same 
in day to day use.

frontiers and food nanotechnology is one of it14,15. Convergence 
of nanotechnology with other industries has improved vital 
steps which include production, processing, transportation, 
safety and storage. The four vital “Ps” where nanotechnology 
play a role in the food industry: are processing, product 
development, packing and prevention from damage. Various 
nano formulations are used in food nanotechnology like 
nano-emulsions, colloids, NPs and nanocomposites5. Nano 
formulations are used for better quality food with enhanced 
nutrition, food packaging to prevent damage and also detection 
of different microbial infections. This industry utilises the 
benefits of this technology in nano based delivery system 
(liposomes, nanocapsule, nanosphere, emulsions, cubosomes, 
biopolymeric NPs, food safety through biosensors to detect 
microbial contamination and in nano packaging. Many metal 
oxide NPs are widely used in food industries; silver NPs as 
antimicrobial agents, zinc oxide NPs in packing to improve 
shelf-life, silica oxide NPs as carrier molecules for aroma and 
flavouring agents and titanium dioxide NPs are effectively 
used for colouring agents. Many food industries are effectively 
using these NPs in plentiful products. KraftTm foods was 
the first to start a nanotechnology laboratory. In the current 
scenario, around the world nano application in food industry 
are increasing exponentially, and many more companies have 
come up with nano based products as shown in Table 1. Food 
nanotechnology is not only confined to food packing but also 
enhanced food texture, taste, colour, availability of nutrients, 
sensations through novel taste and creamier texture. Moreover, 
nano applications as biosensors can enable us to track 
contamination and spoilage while transportation and storage of 
food. Along with improved taste and texture, nano foods also 
guarantee health, nano based ice creams and mayonnaise are far 
more creamier, and at the same time, are also made from low 
fat nano formulations. Nano encapsulated products can deliver 
and distribute nutrients at the cellular level16,17. Futuristic 
prospective of nano food applications include smart packing 
which indicate food spoilage and expiry that are indicated by 
change in colour code change. Nano based application in food 
industry is increasing day to day different nano formulations 
and their use in food industry are summarised in Table 218.
3.  HOW SAFE IS NANO PARTICLES BASED 
FOOD PRODUCTS
There are considerable debates regarding how the novel 
properties of NMs could lead to adverse biological effects, with 
the potential to cause toxicity. Some of the crucial questions 
asked are: 1) Whether NMs are more toxic than their non-
nano counterparts? 2) Will NPs transform in the environment 
into more toxic forms? Graphite is approved by FDA, and 
considered as non-toxic, however the nano counterpart bucky 
balls are reported to show toxicity. Before NMs are allowed to 
be used in daily life activities, it is important for nanotoxicology 
research to uncover and understand how these materials 
influence the environment so that their undesirable properties 
can be eliminated. While nearly anything can be toxic at some 
particular dose, the more relevant question is: how toxic are 
NMs at the potential concentrations at which they might be 
used? Nanotoxicology is the study of negative side of the

nanotechnology revolution brought into concern since 1990. 
Nano toxicity is reported through many research proposals, 
and the use of NPs becomes a question. With the extended use 
of NPs in food industry the primary concern would be “How 
safe are these applications”? use of NPs in food industry may 
result in NPs mediated toxicity at different levels as shown in 
Fig. 1.
these NPs can adhere or blend to the packed food materials 
and result in toxicity20-23. Considering the harmful effects of 
NPs all the benefits of this technology get annulled. NPs are 
used in various sensors to monitor and eliminate microbial 
contamination and toxins from food. NPs can contaminate 
food during this process and result in toxicity as food comes in 
contact with NPs. In-vivo and in-vitro studies have highlighted 
the lethal effect of these metal oxide NPs. In the current scenario 
there is no relevant data about release of NPs from the packing 
material in food, therefore indepth studies are required in cases 
where metal oxide are used in packaging. It is also important 
to understand how these particles move into the food chain and 
environment on disposable of these packaging materials23.
Alternative to metal oxide is hybrid organic inorganic 
system which comprise of organic and biodegradable NMs. 
Zein, a component of corn protein in nano form can be used for 
making biodegradable plastic which is more tensile. Nano fillers 
made up of silicate e.g. nylon clay hydrid and mess network 
of silicate are quite promising for safer manufacture of nano 
made packing material in food industry, however these NPs 
can mildly interact with food and toxicity studies are required 
to implement their use24. These packaging materials ensure 
quality of the food item by control oxidation, release active 
components and maintain the texture of food. Commonly used 
food additives like gelatin, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, 
aliginate are effectively used in nanoenacapsulation for food 
packaging and application in relative to food industry. Organic 
and biocompatible nano formulation can certainly ensure better 
packaging as well as safety of the food items25. 
3.4  Oral Consumption of NPs and Toxicity at 
Cellular Level
Recent research has showed that NPs present toxic effects 
when in contact with biological interface. After ingestion these 
particles are diffused to the blood and lymph through which 
these can reach vital organs like heart, spleen, lungs, liver and 
possibly to brain with the ability to cross blood brain barrier. 
Nanoscale formulations are biologically more available, 
as they can penetrate deep into the tissue and cell, resulting 
in enhanced interaction with various biological molecules 
culminating toxicity. The toxicity mediated by the NPs greatly 
depends on size, composition, properties and aggregation26. 
With reduction in size the surface area increases, which results 
in offering more space for any interaction to occur. These nano 
bio interactions can trigger novel toxicological pathways. 
NPs are reported to stimulate inflammation, increased ROS 
production, immunological reactions, protein denaturation 
and DNA damage27. Most of toxicological studies focus on 
exposure to NPs through inhalation, ingestion, injection and 
dermal absorbtion however, considering food nanotechnology, 
oral route of exposure should be administered and bio-kinetic 
profile of NPs and biodistribution in different organs should 
be determined28,29. The gut wall executes the natural process 
of blocking larger material and absorbing small size particles 
with great efficiency. The NPs used in food nano industry are 
efficiently absorbed by the mammalian gut and accumulate 
in various organelles30. According to a research at Cornell 
university, led by Dr. Miceal Shuler it was reported that large 
Figure 1. Nanotechnology in food industry and toxicity issues.
3.1 Occupational Health Risks in Food Industry
A major group of population exposed to NPs are those 
involved in processing, packaging and transportation of 
products containing NPs. The prime route of exposure to NPs 
include inhalation and dermal absorption which can cause 
respiratory disorders and skin diseases. Currently there are 
no well-defined regulatory guidelines for manufacturing units 
to ensure safety while handling NPs. Also there is lack of 
knowledge as far as lethal dose of exposure, is concerned.
3.2 Nano Flavour: Adding Taste can be Risky
Nano ingredients are profoundly used in food industry to 
alter food in various prospects. Most of the nano supplements 
are used to enhance taste and nutritional value. Various vitamins 
are available in the food market at nano level however, the 
major concern is that at nano level these food ingredients 
can be toxic, specifically at higher doses19. Consumption of 
vitamins at nano level may result in excessive, unmonitored 
absorption of vitamins by the body which could be detrimental 
and possibly result in various neurological disorders19. It is 
unpredictable that nano fortification food, claim to meet the 
dietary requirement could replace the natural varied diet.
3.3 Nano Packing and Toxicity
use of NPs in food packaging is considered safe, as NPs 
are not a food component and usually accepted by the public; 
however, leaching of nano substituent of packing materials is 
quite possible. NPs are used in packing material like wraps, 
container, beer bottle, chopping board, cooking utensils etc, 
where NPs can leach out and contaminate the food. Metal oxide 
NPs like zinc oxide, silver oxide, copper oxide and magnesium 
are used for making packaging material as these ensure long 
term storage of food items. However, it is quite possible that 
280
ANAND, et al.: DEF. LIFE SCI. J., VOL. 3, NO. 3, JuLy, DOI : 10.14429/dlsj.3.12922
dose intake of polystyrene NPs, blocks iron absorption and its 
long term utilisation may result in intestinal structure changes. 
NPs can also result in gut related ailments like Cron Disease. 
Increased absorption of NPs may result in altered nutritional 
profile and intrusion of foreign substances in the blood31. When 
ingested, these nano particles can disturb the gut microbial flora 
which also determines the health of an individual. It is important 
to study the fate of NPs that include absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion by the human body32. The body can 
breakdown these NPs into more toxic metabolites e.g. metal 
oxide NPs into metal ions. 
The intensely used nano formulations in food industry 
which include aluminium, silicon and titanium are commonly 
seen to aggregate in lymphoid tissue. Biological entities like 
nucleus of the cell are easily reached by these particles. NPs 
are reported to cross the placental barriers33,34. The increased 
surface to volume ratio enable more interaction with cellular 
bodies35. The change in physio chemical properties, ruled 
by the increased surface area influence cellular uptake and 
interactions36,37.
ROS generation is a common phenomenon on exposure 
to NPs. Cells have defensive machinery to overcome ROS 
generations, however failure in this, results in toxicity38,39. 
Increased surface area of the NPs results in extensive ROS 
generations. The interaction of these particles may result in 
altered cellular morphology and cytoskeleton40,41. Wu42,43, 
et al. showed that NPs disrupt cytoskeleton networks by 
changing actin fibers. Though it is reported that NPs effect the 
cytoskeleton network, the detailed mechanism and the role of 
cellular pathways involved is yet to be studied.
Inorganic NPs can interfere with the delicate balance of 
cellular homeostasis and thereby alter complex intracellular 
signalling pathways, resulting in a cascade of possible effects. 
These interactions can occur by several mechanisms, such 
as: genotoxic effects caused by high levels of ROS44, altered 
protein or gene expression due to the perinuclear localisation 
of the particles35, altered protein or gene expression levels 
due to leaching of free metal ions45, altered activation status 
of proteins by interfering with stimulating factors such as 
cell-surface receptors46, and altered gene expression levels in 
response to the cellular stress that the NPs induce47.
To date, the effect of NMs on protein or gene expression 
levels has only scarcely been investigated and sufficient data 
needs to be generated in order to get a holistic view of the extent 
NPs can cause alterations to intracellular signalling pathways. 
Studies on genotoxicity induced by these NPs lacks detailed 
data and real harm caused by these NPs is yet not clear. The 
effect of chronic exposure and subsequent lethal damage of the 
genetic material has not been investigated conclusively. 
Because of the high surface to charge density, pH at 
NPs surface is different from their surrounding48. NPs are 
also exposed to various enzymatic degradation resulting in 
generation of free ions and disruption in cellular homeostasis49,50. 
The surface charge enables NPs to bind with various proteins, 
leading to formation of protein corona51,52. Even the presence 
of proteins will result in strong bonding between the NPs and 
proteins53 which can be prevented by protective coating.
It is clearly demarked that bio nano-interaction can mediate 
toxicity at different level of cellular organisation. Not only this, 
there is a dual concern of toxicity effecting human health as 
well as environment. These NPs inadvertently get built up at 
different level in the food chain during the manufacturing, 
utilisation and disposable process. At different levels these NPs 
may behave different with different unexpected surrounding, 
resulting in novel reactions and formation of lethal substances. 
It is important to effectively evaluate and put forward standard 
guidelines before the nano food market flourish.
4.  REGULATIONS: ELSIS
The need of the hour is to develop considerable ethical, 
legal and social implications (ELSIs) before nano food 
products are introduced in the market10. Till date, there are no 
specific guidelines to evaluate toxicity related to nano food. 
The monitoring agencies like FDA regulate food products not 
technologies, thus multiple regulatory bodies are required to 
deliver safe nano food products in market. Combitorial system 
comprising of toxicologist and food technologist is required 
before implementing nanotechnology to human health54. 
Another aspect by the Institute of Food Science and Technology 
is that when nano material is a component of food additive then 
conventional E-numbering system should be implemented 
along with subscript “n”55. Despite of the lack of concrete rules 
and regulations and incomplete knowledge nano food market 
is flourishing by the day, ignoring the detrimental effects. In 
European union, “Scientific Committee on Emerging and 
Newly Identified Health Risks” risk assessment related to 
nanotechnology and defining recognised terminology to evaluate 
toxicity mediated by NPs is emphasised. Standard analytical 
methods must be developed for effective detection of NPs in 
food56. Regulations related to nanotechnology can be framed 
well defined horizontal and vertical legislation. The horizontal 
legislation is very broad and includes aspect of nanotechnology 
but does not specifically state methodologies to do so. On the 
other hand the vertical legislation is well defined, explanatory 
and most recent. Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and 
Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and General Product and 
safety Directive (GPSD) in European countries regulate nano 
technologies under horizontal legislation. Both define safety 
through gathering adequate information that whether the 
substance used is safe on production and well explained on 
labelling57. The Food Additives Directive (89/109/EEC) was 
the first legislation to include nano technologies in specific58. 
5.  PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE TO NANO-FOOD 
TECHNOLOGY 
The prime concern is public acceptance, trust and 
willingness to pay for nano technologies in food industry. The 
public is willing to buy food with nano packaging but nano 
food where a NM is a part of ingredient are less acceptable 
and considered to be less safe and compared to the nano based 
packaging59. In a study by Siegrist60, el al. it was found that the 
public is reluctant to accept nanotechnology related foods or 
food packaging with nano composition. Thus the big question is 
will this novel technology be accepted or rejected? In a research 
it was found that public perception on food nano technologies is 
not simple but complex, and influenced by multiple factor e.g. 
281
ANAND, et al.: DEF. LIFE SCI. J., VOL. 3, NO. 3, JuLy, DOI : 10.14429/dlsj.3.12922
when product is less beneficial, consumers are more concerned 
about risk as compared to, when benefits are high61. Research 
on public perception on nano technologies also indicates that 
there is lack of information about nano food application and 
their impact on health and environment. Due to the unexpected 
outcome of the genetically modified food, public is reluctant to 
accept something which is artificially synthesised. However, 
a change in this notion can be brought through transparency, 
education, implementation and assurance of safety.
6.  FUTURE OF FOOD NANOTECHNOLOGY 
Considering the current scenario, the conflict between 
benefits and risk will last long before a proper regulatory 
authority would be constituted and guidelines will be 
framed; however, despite the safety concerns the benefits 
of food nanotechnology cannot be ignored. It is therefore 
essential to maintain a balance between “too strict” and “too 
loose” in scheming the standards and guidelines for food 
nanotechnologies62. updated research on toxicity correlated 
with innovative upcoming nanotechnologies is essential for their 
safe application in food industry. Safety of NPs applications in 
food industry can be ensured only by evaluating their physio-
chemical properties in the corresponding surrounding63. 
Benefits of nanotechnology in food industry can be harnessed 
by using NPs of biological and organic origin. Based on the 
research information, implementation of a well designed safety 
guideline in consideration to the food based applications of NPs 
is a prerequisite. Public acceptance of this novel technology 
can be achieved if the benefits are worth paying and more as 
out weights its drawbacks. Public awareness about both pros 
and cons of this application is required, by proper labelling and 
advertisement of such applications in food industry64. Though, 
demanding practical implementation of this technology in food 
industry is a far off dream, yet nanotechnology can certainly 
modernise the food industry.
7.  CONCLUSIONS
Every technology comes with a pros and cons. The Janet 
facet of nanotechnology cannot be ignored. On one hand 
nanotechnology has made our lives much easier on the other 
hand there can be severe harmful drawbacks of this technology. 
Currently scientific research is at the very benign state, and 
many mysteries of the nanotechnology are yet to be known 
before wide spread diaspora of these in the surrounding. 
Application of nano based products can certainly be used in 
food industry under well defined regulatory guidelines.

ABSTRACT 
Canadian Nanotechnology and Equity Challenges: Implications for 
Pro-Poor and Gender-Inclusive Policy 
Gita Ghiasi Hafezi, Ph.D. 
Concordia University, 2018 
Nanotechnology has been hailed as a disruptive technology that would revolutionize existing 
products and processes, open up new markets and business opportunities, as well as offer socio-
economic benefits. Research and development (R&D) in this emerging technology presents great 
importance to many nations, offering a significant technological advantage that gears towards 
economic growth. However, despite the immense promise of societal benefits from 
nanotechnology applications, nanotechnology might expose societies to various forms of 
inequities. The main objective of this thesis is to examine two priority dimensions of equity 
concerns related to nanotechnology: the lack of R&D for nanotechnology applications that 
(predominantly) benefit developing nations (pro-poor R&D) and the scant representation of 
women in nanotechnology fields. This study adopts a combined use of bibliometrics, social 
network analysis, and survey results to perform both dimensional and cross-dimensional analysis, 
providing a better understanding of both issues and of how the two are related. The focus of this 
study is on Canada, a country who prioritizes nanotechnology research and development in its 
science and technology strategy, and actively practices gender fairness in the scientific system and 
is strongly involved in international development through its R&D efforts. 
The findings reveal that only a narrow spectrum of Canadian nanotechnology articles and patents 
reflect pro-poor priorities, and acknowledge the importance of promoting and leading research and 
innovation in pro-poor areas, as it holds the potential to promote the economic development both 
within and between nations. However, these pro-poor scientific and innovative efforts tend to be 
highly male-dominated in terms of the scientific community and the workforce involved. Gender 
iv 
differences in citation and journal impact of papers published in the nano-pro-poor applications 
reveal the presence of the Matilda effect at the level of first-authorship and a strong selection effect 
at the level of last-authorship for women. While the majority of male authors and male inventors 
collaborate exclusively with men, those involved in a mixed-gender team outperform male-only 
teams. Therefore, it is important that policymakers pay attention to both gender and pro-poor 
initiatives simultaneously, because practices to promote pro-poor innovation might result in a 
wider gender gap and adversely affect social development. Furthermore, gender analysis of 
nanotechnology scientific reward system confirms that the gender productivity gap remains a 
challenge in the field and that these gaps are reinforced by the fact that the most productive 
researchers are less likely to collaborate with women. The results also show the amount of extra 
effort that women must devote to their research to retain their top status in academia, and the extent 
that their recognition when in top positions is fragile compared to men. This study also confirms 
the cumulative advantage of creating a gender-inclusive culture that enables women to improve 
their scientific productivity and impact. The results of this study have strong implications for 
policy development (or reform) targeting both gender equality and poverty alleviation in emerging 
interdisciplinary areas, promoting a more equitable and inclusive society.

Chapter 1 - Introduction 
Introduction  
The term “nanotechnology” was coined in 1974 by Norio Taniguchi, a Japanese scientist to refer 
to the control of semiconductor processes on the nanometer precision. However, the concept was 
originated by Richard Feynman (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1965), in a visionary lecture titled 
‘There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom’ which provided useful insights on manipulation of matter 
at atomic and molecular scales (Sandhu 2006). The term was not popularized until 1986 when Eric 
Drexler proposed the idea of molecular machines and their manufacturing in his book ‘Engines of 
Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology’, which later was referred to as molecular 
nanotechnology (Collins 2007). 
The term nano is originated from the Greek word “nanos” or “nannos” which refers to “dwarf”, 
and is used as a prefix for units to represent a billionth of that unit. A nanometer (nm) is thus one 
billionth of a meter (10-9 meters). However, the wide use of the term “nanotechnology” as an all-
encompassing reference to a broad range of research and development efforts to study matters at 
a nanoscale, reinforced the need for a rigorous definition of the term for the development and 
implementation of policies and initiatives in the field (Palmberg et al. 2009). Therefore, many 
agencies and governmental bodies have proposed definitions of nanotechnology, among which are 
National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme 
(FP7), European Patent Office (EPO), and International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). 
The most widely used definition of nanotechnology in the policy context is “the understanding and 
control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena enable 
novel applications. Encompassing nano-scale science, engineering, and technology, 
nanotechnology involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at this length 
scale.” (NNI 2014). 
Under this broad umbrella definition, nanotechnology is not confined to any specific technology 
or research but is an interdisciplinary pursuit, which draws on physics, chemistry, engineering 
sciences, material sciences, biology and other disciplines (Porter & Youtie 2009a). This 
2 
interdisciplinary nature offers numerous potential benefits in a broad array of application areas, 
including but not limited to materials and manufacturing, electronics, aerospace and aviation, 
environment, energy, agriculture, water treatment and remediation, medicine and pharmaceutics 
(Mamalis 2007; Salamanca-Buentello, Persad, Martin, Daar, Singer, et al. 2005). 
Nonetheless, the convergence of disciplines at the nanoscale greatly complicates the envisagement 
of the new prospects for nanotechnology and demarcation of its scope and scientific boundaries 
(Salamanca-Buentello & Daar 2016), and the societal impacts of nanotechnology development are 
largely unexplored (OECD 2014a). The analysis of publication and patent data provide a useful 
tool to assess the scientific, innovative and societal impact of nanotechnology, which could help 
address the challenges of tracking the development and use of nanotechnologies and serve to 
inform science and technology policies (Roco 2011). 
1.2- Problem description 
Nanotechnology has been heralded by many as a revolutionary innovation for industrial production 
(Bhattacharyya et al. 2009; Roco 2017; Schulenburg 2004; Stix 2001). While still at an incipient 
stage, promoters of nanotechnology promise that it will spur economic growth and job creation in 
a variety of sectors ranging from materials, medicine, and agriculture to research and development 
(Roco 2011). However, the possible economic benefits of nanotechnology could be undermined if 
nanotechnology negatively impacts the environment and public health, or reinforces inequalities 
(Cozzens 2010), stigmatization and discrimination (UNESCO 2014). Therefore, science and 
technology policymakers are challenged with the difficult task of supporting nanotechnology 
innovation, while also considering its potential negative implications. This task is further 
complicated by the high degree of uncertainty that still surrounds nanotechnology, such as its 
environmental, health, social and economic outcomes, as well as how those outcomes will be 
distributed within and between countries (Hankin & Read 2016). 
To help understand such policy decisions and to help guide nanotechnology innovation towards 
fair and sustainable outcomes, scholars have put forward several frameworks including inclusive 
innovation (Foster & Heeks 2013; Heeks et al. 2014) and responsible research and innovation 
(RRI) (Schroeder et al. 2016). The notion of inclusive innovation is widely embraced by 
international development agencies—such as World Bank, United Nations Development 
3 
Programme (UNDP), and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)—
and is built around innovations targeted directly at meeting the needs of the developing nations 
and low-income populations, offering scope for the introduction of “pro-poor” policies. RRI is a 
framework that is rooted in developed countries, and that aims at better align research and 
innovation (especially related to emerging technologies) with the societal needs and expectations. 
One articulation of RRI, offered by the European Commission, consists of six main themes, 
namely, public engagement, gender equality, science education, ethics, open access and 
governance.  
This study sheds light on two important dimensions of inclusive and responsible research and 
innovation—gender equality and pro-poor innovation—using Canada as a case study. Canada is a 
leading nation in nanotechnology, and has enacted several policies and programmes to spur 
nanotechnology research and development, such as establishment of several world-renowned 
research institutes (including National Institute for Nanotechnology and NanoQuebec), and 
involvement in several international policy collaborations (including collaborations with 
International Council on Nanotechnology (ICON) and Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) Working Party on Nanotechnology) (NanoPortal 2014). It has also 
invested heavily in developing its nanotechnology capacity (139 million USD in 2005 (Palmberg 
et al. 2009)) and accounts for 1.3% of nanotechnology patents and 2.2% of nanotechnology 
publications (in 2017) globally (StatNano 2018)1.  
In June 2016, the Government of Canada launched an “inclusive innovation agenda”2 to develop 
a policy framework that promotes innovation and economic growth while ensuring that 
opportunities to benefit from and participate in innovation are available to all Canadians 
(Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada 2016). One of the six primary action 
areas introduced in Canada’s inclusive innovation agenda is to promote global science excellence, 
the explanation of which alludes briefly to the RRI’s gender inequality dimension and the shortage 
of women in Canadian science. Lack of women’s participation in nanotechnology contributes to 
the general lack of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. 
Furthermore, the underrepresentation of women in nanotechnology could exacerbate existing

gender disparities in science by furthering the negative stereotype that women are less technology-
adept (UNESCO 2014).  
Pro-poor research and innovation have received scant attention in Canada’s inclusive innovation 
agenda. This is likely due to the fact that the agenda has been launched by Innovation, Science and 
Economic Development Canada (formerly Industry Canada), the department responsible for 
industrial development, rather than by international affairs or development. However, Canada has 
been long involved in supporting pro-poor research and innovation through its International 
Development Research Centre (IDRC), an institution that particularly supports R&D related to 
improving the livelihood of poor and developing nations.  
1.3- Scope and Objectives 
The main objective of this study is to examine two priority dimensions of equity concerns related 
to nanotechnology, namely pro-poor potential and gender equity, to provide a better understanding 
of both issues and of how the two are related. For this purpose, this study provides both within- 
and cross-dimensional analysis, where the focus is on Canada, a country who prioritizes 
nanotechnology R&D in its S&T strategy (Minister of Industry 2014), and actively practices 
gender fairness in the scientific system and is strongly involved in international development 
through its R&D efforts. The importance of analyzing the pro-poor R&D dimension arises from 
the fact that it adds to Canada’s years-long investment in knowledge and innovation to improve 
livelihood in developing countries, and the gender equity dimension is that it contributes to 
Canada’s limited efforts to support and engage women in nanosciences. Cross-dimensional 
analyses add another layer to the understanding of the relationship between nanotechnology and 
inequity because it looks into the cross-cutting relationship between the two concerns, in the sense 
that a solution to one problem might positively or negatively affect another problem. For example, 
persisting equality and equity concerns of nanotechnology cannot be allayed if Canada’s R&D 
efforts for pro-poor nano-innovation lead to a less gender-equal R&D workforce. Therefore, from 
an insight perspective, the main objectives of this study focus on three levels of analysis, including 
pro-poor dimension, gender dimension, and cross-dimension analysis.

The General Objectives 
Pro-poor dimension: 
1. Examine whether nanotechnology research and technological advancements in one of the 
most affluent countries, Canada, holds potent promises for poor in developing countries. 
2. Identify scientific factors that influence scientific productivity and impact of Canadian 
researchers involved in nanotechnology pro-poor R&D.

nanotechnology, and pinpoint key challenges they face in their persistent publishing and 
patenting efforts in developing this breakthrough technology and applications. 
5. Identify industries where companies involved in Canadian pro-poor nanotechnology R&D 
are poised for growth and examine where these industries stand in the Canadian economy 
in terms of the gender gap in wage and employment. 
The Specific Objectives 
1. Examine the quantity and quality of nanotech-related articles and patents of one of the most 
affluent and innovative countries, Canada, which can potentially bring benefit to the poor. 
2. Investigate the role of female scientists (versus their male counterparts) in developing these 
applications.  
3. Analyze gender differences in collaboration patterns among authors, inventors, and author-
inventors and examine the distinct role of individual scientists in the innovative process. 
4. Examine citation and journal impact of articles by authorship order for authors of each 
gender.

5. Explore the evolution of co-authorship and co-inventorship networks in time and the spread 
of knowledge through the scientific individuals of each gender in the networks.  
6. Map gender diversity in co-authorship and co-inventorship collaboration teams of 
researchers of each gender and analyze scientific and technological productivity and impact 
of researchers involved in these scientific collaboration teams. 
7. Provide visualization of networks to better understand the network structure and position 
of female researchers in their networks of collaborations. 
8. Identify nanotech-related companies that are involved in pro-poor nano-innovation and 
determine where industrial sectors that are the primary focus of these companies stand in 
the Canadian economy in terms of gender employment and wage gap. 
9. Determine influencing scientific factors on scientific productivity and impact of 
researchers involved in pro-poor nanotechnology research.  
10.  Identify scientific and demographic, and cultural factors that exacerbate or alleviate gender 
disparities in scientific productivity and impact. 
11.  Identify barriers and obstacles women face in their scientific community that impede their 
publishing and patenting productivity.  
12.  Propose policy and strategy implications for the promotion of gender equality and poverty 
reduction within nanotechnology innovation efforts. 
1.4- Organization of the thesis 
This thesis comprises five chapters and is organized as follows. Chapter 2 provides a cross-
dimensional analysis of nanotechnology and equality, investigating whether Canadian 
nanotechnology R&D is addressing the needs of the poor and addressing gender disparities in 
research and innovative advancements of pro-poor applications of nanotechnology. This chapter 
uses bibliometric analyses of the Scopus article database over the period 1996-2011 and the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office over the period 1996-2009. Statistics Canada data are then 
used to map where the companies involved in the development of these applications stand in the 
Canadian economy in terms of gender equality in wages and employment. Chapter 3 complements 
Chapter 2 by applying social network analysis to explore differences in collaboration patterns of 
authors and inventors of each gender whose work is related to pro-poor applications of 
nanotechnology. Both of these chapters (chapter 2 and 3) call for development and implementation 
7 
of pro-poor and gender-responsive policies to promote holistic equality in the emerging science 
and technology sectors. Chapter 4 looks into the two dimensions (gender equality and pro-poor 
innovation) separately and tries to articulate equity challenges of nanotechnology development in 
Canada with the use of survey results and the Scopus database. This chapter applies an exploratory 
approach to analyze how both bibliometric and sociodemographic indicators are linked to 
scientific, cultural and social factors influencing scientific productivity and impact of Canadian 
nanotechnology researchers from a pro-poor and gender perspective. This chapter concludes with 
several gender-related policy implications to support the involvement of women in 
nanotechnology research activities on the one hand. It also provides pro-poor policy implications 
to promote international development. Finally, chapter 5 presents concluding remarks and suggests 
several avenues for future work.

pro-poor potential in Canada’s R&D landscape 
A cross-dimensional analysis of nanotechnology and equality: Examining 
gender fairness and pro-poor potential in Canada’s R&D landscape 
Abstract  
Countries invest in nanotechnology primarily to increase economic growth and industrial 
development. However, nanotechnology might expose societies to various forms of inequalities, 
or at the same time, might be used as a tool to decrease existing inequalities. These inequalities 
fall along two dimensions, vertical and horizontal, where the former refers to economic inequalities 
(e.g., rich-poor gaps) and the latter indicates social inequalities (e.g., gender and ethnicity gaps). 
This study is a cross-dimensional analysis of nanotechnology and equality, investigating the 
relationship between the development and commercialization of nanotechnology applications that 
improve the livelihoods of the poor (pro-poor applications), and the gender gap in the scientific 
workforce. Cross-dimensional analyses are essential to more fully understand how emerging 
technologies affect equality—an effort to decrease inequality in one dimension (closing rich-poor 
gaps) might still increase overall global inequality if it also widens inequality in another dimension 
(widening gender gaps)—and to guide policy: many affluent countries, like Canada, aspire to use 
R&D to reduce inequality in both dimensions. Bibliometric analyses of the Scopus article database 
and the United States Patent and Trademark Office are used to explore if Canadian nanotechnology 
is addressing the needs of the poor and then to examine gender disparities in research and 
innovative advancements of pro-poor applications of nanotechnology (i.e., energy, agri-food, and 
water). Statistics Canada data are then used to map where the companies involved in the 
development of these applications stand in terms of gender equality in wages and employment. 
Only a small percentage of Canadian nanotechnology articles and patents reflect pro-poor 
priorities. Furthermore, Canadian workplaces that are producing pro-poor nano-applications are 
largely male dominant. Both pro-poor and gender-responsive policies are needed to promote 
holistic equality in emerging science and technology and foster economic growth.

2.1- Introduction 
The application of nanotechnology3 to a wide array of products and industries has potential to 
create enormous economic and societal benefits, and across the world, firms, governments, and 
universities are increasingly investing in this technology. There is a growing literature on the 
economic and policy dimensions of nanotechnology that documents these trends, focusing on how 
nanotechnology contributes to technological competitiveness (Forster et al. 2011; Mowery 2011; 
Shapira and Wang 2009). Nevertheless, these studies mostly reflect the viewpoint of affluent 
countries and focus on commercial payoffs of nanotechnology applications, leaving the debate 
about equity and nanotechnology – i.e. nanotechnology’s potential to open gaps between 
developed and developing nations, between different racial groups, between men and women, etc. 
– open and intense (Cozzens and Wetmore 2011). Therefore, it is important to understand how 
nanotechnology might create new inequities, and how to use this breakthrough technology to 
alleviate existing inequities. For example, advances in nanoscale sciences related to medicine and 
nano-materials used for water purification (Hillie & Hlophe 2007), and for agricultural and energy 
production (Nature Nanotechnology 2007; Salamanca-Buentello, Persad, Martin, Daar, & Singer 
2005), could improve the livelihoods of the poor and address inequity issues. And given that 
nanotechnology is still emerging and has not yet been fully entrenched in society, it is of utmost 
importance to gauge and define its effects on equity and equality4 now.  
Inequalities can be categorized along two dimensions, vertical and horizontal, where the former 
indicates the unequal distribution of wealth and income between counties or individuals (rich-
poor), and the latter implies differences between groups in terms of culturally-defined categories 
(e.g., gender and ethnic inequalities). Both types of inequalities are among the factors that hinder 
social cohesion5 and inclusion6 (Cozzens et al. 2007; Cozzens and Wetmore 2011). Hence, science, 
                                                        
3 Nanotechnology is “the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nanometers, the size-
scale between individual atoms and bulk materials, where unique phenomena enable novel applications” (NNI 2007). 
4 The term inequality explains a “given empirical distribution” while the term inequity describes “a normative 
judgment about a given inequality” (Cozzens and Wetmore 2011). 
5 Social cohesion refers to all efforts which “ensure that every citizen, every individual, can have within their 
community the opportunity of access: to the means to secure their basic needs, to progress, to protection and legal 
rights, and to dignity and self-confidence” (Council of Europe 2001, p.5). 
6 Social inclusion is “people’s ability to participate adequately in society, including education, employment, and public 
services, social and recreational activities” (Litman 2003). 
10 
technology, and innovation (STI) policies aimed at reducing inequalities are important tools to 
help build a cohesive and inclusive society. Cozzens divides these policies into three categories, 
namely pro-poor (associated with poverty alleviation), fairness (associated with horizontal 
inequalities) and egalitarian (associated with vertical inequalities) (Cozzens 2008). 
This study applies Cozzens’s theory of equity and nanotechnology (Cozzens 2010) to provide the 
first quantitative, cross-dimensional analysis of nanotechnology and inequality. It investigates the 
relationship between the development and commercialization of nanotechnology applications that 
benefit the poor (pro-poor) and the gender gap in the scientific workforce. Cross-dimensional 
analyses are crucial to more fully understand the relationship between nanotechnology and 
inequality because exploiting nanotechnology’s potential for the poor could lead to a less equitable 
global society if it widens inequalities at horizontal dimension while trying to rectify vertical 
inequalities. 
Cross-dimensional analyses are especially important to inform policymaking in advanced 
economies, like Canada, that are actively trying to use R&D to promote equality in both vertical 
and horizontal dimensions: by improving gender fairness in the scientific workforce, and by using 
R&D as a tool to help international development. Increasing women’s participation in STI has 
long been a goal in the science and technology (S&T) policy discourses of Canada, as part of the 
quest for gender equality and economic growth7. Organizations such as Society for Canadian 
Women in Science and Technology and Engineers Canada are devoted to promoting gender 
equality in science and engineering fields. However, within the national government, policies for 
gender inclusion in S&T only exist in the form of initiatives within the Natural Sciences and 
Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). In terms of commitments to using R&D to 
help developing countries, Canada, has played a leading role through its International 
Development Research Centre (IDRC), a unique institution that focuses explicitly on STI in 
developing countries. Furthermore, in 2004, Canada set a target of using 5% of R&D investment 
to address challenges in developing countries (Salamanca-Buentello, Persad, Martin, Daar, & 
Singer 2005).  
                                                        
7 Given that women represent 50% of Canadian population (Urquijo & Milan 2011) but only 20% of the scientific 
workforce (Shendruk 2015), they represent a potential human capital asset that if tapped, could enhance the 
performance of S&T activities. 
11 
Therefore, if Canada can increase women’s participation in research and development of the pro-
poor applications of nanotechnology, this will contribute to many of its policy goals: it will not 
only help raise the level of innovativeness of the Canadian economy and improve gender equity, 
it will also create benefits for low-income and developing nations. Henceforth, this study has three 
main objectives. It (1) examines whether nanotechnology’s scientific and technological advances 
in one of the most affluent countries, Canada, hold potent promises for poor and developing 
countries; it (2) provides an improved understanding of women’s contribution to these advances 
over time and (3) further examines where potentially pro-poor nanotechnology-focused industries 
stand in the Canadian economy in terms of gender gap in wage and employment.  
2.2- Literature Review 
2.2.1- Nanotechnology and Millennium Development Goals 
Potential applications of nanotechnology could have positive impacts on poor and marginalized 
communities. Fabio Salamanca-Buentello and his colleagues (2005) have ascribed the most 
promising nanotechnology applications with respect to the United Nations (UN) Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), arguing that nano-applications in energy, agri-food, and water are 
the most likely to benefit the poor, improve livelihoods, and contribute to achieving several of the 
MDGs: eradication of poverty, decrease in child mortality, improvement of maternal health, 
control of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and environmental sustainability.  
Nonetheless, none of the top pro-poor nanotechnology applications contribute to the third UN 
MDG, namely gender equality and empowerment of women. This underlines that it is not possible 
to reach global equity by introducing novel nano-applications that might reduce the gap between 
the poor and the rich while also increasing gender disparity. Hence, it is of great importance to 
look into the cross-cutting relations of both inequality dimensions and to understand how 
development and commercialization of these pro-poor applications affect gender equality. 
Invernizzi and Foladori (2005) found the Salamanca-Buentello’s argument too ‘optimistic’ and 
claimed that new technologies are designed for the advantaged rather than the disadvantaged. 
Cozzens et al. (2013) thus further empirically tested the argument of Salamanca-Buentello (2005) 
by examining nanotechnology research advances in energy, agri-food, and water that have pursued 
the MDG-related priorities and argued that both developed and developing countries benefit from 
12 
these applications. The last UN MDG which envisions creating a global partnership for 
development highlights the social responsibility of developed countries to address the needs of the 
developing countries and to ensure that developing countries can benefit from the new 
technologies. However, in the literature, there is still a research gap on the extent to which 
nanotech-related research and technological rise of affluent countries are in consonance with the 
needs of developing countries and MDGs (Harsh & Woodson 2012).  
This study accordingly seeks to corroborate the work of Cozzens and her colleagues (2013) and 
specifies how nanotechnology research and development (R&D) in Canada (i.e., one of the top 
affluent countries) is relevant to the context of developing countries. Particularly it examines 
scientific and technological advances in the top potential ‘pro-poor’ nano-applications (energy, 
agri-food, and water).  
2.2.2- Nanotechnology and Women 
Issues related to women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are often 
seen as threefold (Schiebinger 2008). Firstly, there is a research focus on investigating women’s 
participation in STEM at an individual level where the concepts of “glass-ceiling” and “leaky 
pipeline” have been coined to address gender barriers women face in their career path (Buré 2007). 
A second focus is on analyses of women’s involvement in the cultures of STEM at an institutional 
level. An example here is the work of McAdam and Marlow (2008) which examines women’s 
difficulties in founding technology-based start-ups. Third, there is a societal level focus on women 
and the outputs of STEM, to see how women are involved in bringing quantity (Bordons et al. 
2003; Cole & Zuckerman 1984; Etzkowitz et al. 2000; Larivière et al. 2011, 2013a; Leahey 2006; 
Nakhaie 2002; Prpić 2002; Xie & Shauman 1998) and quality (Borrego et al. 2010; Long 1992; 
Peñas & Willett 2006; Whittington & Smith-Doerr 2005) to research and technological advances 
in various countries.  
When it comes to nanotechnology specifically, there have been very few studies on women’s 
participation and performance in nanotechnology science and innovation, despite the growing 
literature and focus on the capacity building in nanotechnology development. The works of Smith-
Doerr (2011), and Meng and Shapira (2011) shed first light on nanotechnology and challenges of 
gender equity. By employing feminist theories and comparing the nanotechnology development 
13 
to biotechnology, Smith-Doerr (2011) attempted to explore the probable place of women in 
nanotech-related research and production. Meng & Shapira (2011) further tried to explore one of 
the areas Smith-Doerr (2011) highlights, namely nanotechnology patenting by women, and 
concluded that there is a gradual reduction in the gap distance between female and male patenting. 
Smith-Doerr (2011) calls for further research into gender equity in the emerging nanotechnology 
sector, underlining nanotechnology’s importance to policies that try to halt emerging gender 
inequity in STEM and promote equality. This paper, thereby, intends to fill this gap by tracing 
women’s scientific and innovative productivity and impact in pro-poor nanotechnology 
applications. 
2.2.3- Nanotechnology and Employment 
Many have argued that nanotechnology’s promise for job creation is huge (Palmberg et al. 2009). 
However, Stephan et al. (2007) and Freeman and Shukla (2008) found the number of nanotech-
related jobs is ‘few’ and job growth in nanotechnology ‘modest’. According to Roco and 
Bainbridge (2001), nanotechnology is expected to create around 2 million jobs by the end of 2015 
and 6 million jobs by 2020 worldwide (Roco 2011). For Canada alone, the estimated 
nanotechnology market value will be around 100 billion dollars, and the sector will consist of 
approximately 600,000 jobs by 2020 (Alberta Advanced Education and Technology 2007).  
However, these forecasts may vary based on different definitions of nanotechnology, the degree 
of optimism, and the degree that nanotechnology can add value to final products (Hullmann 2007). 
The majority of the nanotech-related workforce is formed by highly educated scientists and 
engineers (Invernizzi 2011). This could be due to the fact that nanotechnology is still in 
development stages and thus current jobs are related to R&D activities. However, the broad 
spectrum of nanotechnology creates the need for workers with a range of skills at different levels 
of the production chain (e.g., in manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution) (Invernizzi 
2011). Hence, nanotechnologies might have a great potential to revolutionize the labor market in 
the near future, in terms of types of jobs and skills required, and these changes could affect various 
sectors. The research on how nanotechnology’s promise of employment would affect different 
classes of people is very nascent. Thus, this study puts focus on the industries where companies 
involved in Canadian pro-poor nanotechnology R&D are poised for growth and identifies the 
gender gap in employment and wage.

2.3- Methods 
2.3.1- Data 
In this study, scientific publications are extracted from the Scopus database. Scopus accumulates 
and presents one of the largest article abstract and citation databases spanning science, technology, 
medicine, social sciences, arts, and humanities. Scopus provides an extensive coverage of data 
about peer-reviewed scientific publications in multiple disciplines including abstract, citation (per 
each year) and author information data (for each co-author), which gives Scopus significant 
advantages over other databases, as these data are very valuable and useful for assigning different 
attributes (e.g., gender and sector). Only peer-reviewed articles are analyzed in this study as they 
serve as the most commonly used measure of contributions to scientific knowledge (Moed 1996).  
The patent data come from the United States Patents and Trademarks Office (USPTO) which has 
the largest coverage of patents registered in North America and provides patent data information, 
including inventor name, assignee name and location, international patent classification (IPC) 
code, application and grant date, and geographical location of the residence for each inventor.  
The nanotechnology-related article and patent data are extracted using a full-text keyword search 
strategy. More details can be found in Barirani et al. (2013) and Tahmooresnejad et al. (2015). Our 
focus in this study is on articles published in 1996-2011 and patents granted over the period 1996 
to 2009 because these are the years where the complete data are available to us. 1996 is the first 
year in which Scopus has full coverage, and 2011 was selected as the end year because it takes a 
lag of a few years to update all the publications after a given year is over.  
Canadian nanotech-related articles involving water, energy, and agri-food applications are 
identified using the keyword filters proposed by Cozzens et al. (2013), and those where at least 
one author is affiliated to a Canadian institution are extracted. Similarly, patents are classified into 
those three applications using the same keyword filters while looking only into titles and abstracts. 
A total of 1,157 articles and 2,528 authors, and 365 patents and 608 inventors are identified. The 
gender is assigned to each author using the GenderChecker name and gender database8. For those 
authors where GenderChecker assigns a unisex designation or is not able to assign a gender 
                                                        
8 http://www.genderchecker.com 
15 
designation at all, gender is manually assigned based on author’s academic, professional or 
Linkedin profiles. Note that gender is assigned to all the authors and inventors identified. 
Academic, governmental and industrial sectors are assigned to authors based on their affiliations. 
Similarly, provinces are assigned based on where affiliated institutions are located. For patents, 
different sectors are assigned based on the assignee sector type, i.e., whether it is a university, 
governmental agency or a company.  
Canadian author-inventors (A-Is) are Canadian inventors whose names also appear in the Canadian 
nanotechnology articles database. In this study, A-Is are assigned to those who are involved only 
in publishing and patenting in pro-poor nanotechnology applications, and a total of 43 A-Is are 
identified in our databases. For validation, 1000 random authors and inventors were selected, and 
their gender and sector were independently identified and confirmed.  
Created databases on nanotechnology publications and patents are further used to identify 
nanotech-related companies to which at least one publication is affiliated or to which at least one 
patent in water, energy or agri-food applications is assigned 185 unique companies are found in 
our article and patent databases). These companies are classified based on their North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) code using the Mergent Online database9and the 
identified industries are examined with regard to the number of female employees and wages by 
using the Labour Force Survey estimates (LFS) table of Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada’s LFS 
data10 table provides the list of industries and the data on the number of men and women employed 
in Canada and their hourly wages. These steps allow us to identify industries associated with 
nanotech-related companies in water, energy, and agri-food and categorize them under male-
dominated and gender-balanced sectors (see below for more detail on how these designations are 
made). 
2.3.2- Bibliometrics 
The analyses are based on bibliometric indicators of scientific and innovative activities. 
Bibliometrics is a method commonly used to assess innovative and scientific research excellence

16 
through quantitative analyses of patent and research publications. This study deploys quantitative 
bibliometric indicators to conduct large-scale analyses to measure the scientific excellence and 
innovative potential for pro-poor nanotechnology applications in Canada. 
To evaluate the productivity of researchers or groups of scientists, this study uses the number of 
publications as the main indicator. Average number of citations per year is used to address the 
scientific impact and publication quality. The SCImago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) is also used 
as a journal quality indicator. SJR is a journal prestige metric, which uses Google’s PageRank™ 
to rank nearly 17,000 journals based on Scopus data. SJR weights received citations based on the 
subject field, quality, and prestige of a citing journal (Guerrero-Bote & Moya-Anegón 2012). Due 
to its specific features, such as being subject-field normalized, exclusion of journal self-citations 
(maximum 33% of journal self-citations is counted), broader coverage of journals, and 
compatibility with Scopus data (García-Peñalvo et al. 2010; Guerrero-Bote & Moya-Anegón 
2012), SJR is chosen in this study as a measure of journal quality.  
All of these measures are used based on fractional counts of articles, assigning each author 1/x 
count of authorship where x represents the number of co-authors in an article. This means that if a 
paper with five authors has the same citation impact as a sole-authored paper, the author of the 
sole-author paper is considered to be involved in higher quality work than any of the five 
individuals of the co-authored paper. 
A similar approach is applied to patents. The volume of patents is used as an indicator of 
technological output and quality of patents is evaluated based on average number of citations 
received per year and the number of claims. Each of these indicators is measured as a fractional 
count of patents where inventorship is measured as 1/y where y is number of inventors listed in a 
patent. Further, each of these bibliometric indicators is measured for female scientists and their 
male counterparts to map gender disparity in development of pro-poor technologies. 
Table 2.1 shows the number of Canadian nanotechnology articles and patents with energy, agri-
food, and water applications. Nanotechnology-related articles with energy applications represent 
only 3.7% of all the Canadian nanotech-related publications, which is the highest among the three 
pro-poor application areas of nanotechnology. Ontario has the highest share of nanotech-related 
publications in all the three applications followed by Quebec. As for patents, the shares of 
17 
nanotech-related patents with energy and agri-food applications are higher (respectively, 5.8% and 
2%) compared to their shares of publications (3.7% and 1.2% respectively). Ontario holds the 
highest share of patenting, and British Columbia and Saskatchewan show prominence in energy 
and agri-food patent applications, respectively. Given that the numbers of papers and patents are 
very small in Saskatchewan, the cross-province analysis in this research is confined to Ontario, 
Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta.

2.4- Results 
2.4.1- Nanotechnology and Millennium Development Goals 
Universities hold the highest share of publications across all the provinces. University of Alberta 
and University of Toronto are among the most active universities. Ontario has a high share of 
governmental publishing, which is due to the existence of the National Research Council (NRC) 
and Health Canada related laboratories in Ottawa, Ontario, the national capital (Fig. 2.1A). The 
laboratories include the NRC Institute for Microstructural Sciences, the Steacie Institute for the 
Molecular Sciences, the NRC Institute for Biological Sciences, Health Canada’s Healthy 
Environments and Consumer Safety Branch and Health Canada's Biologics and Genetic Therapies 
18 
Directorate. Agri-food applications hold the highest share of governmental involvement in 
scientific research, in which the NRC’s Plant Biotechnology Institute (in Saskatchewan) and 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Saskatoon Research Centre play an important role (Fig. 
2.1B). The private sector and hospitals are involved in low rates of publishing across different 
provinces for pro-poor nanotechnology applications. However, AB Sciex LP and Medicago Inc. 
are among the top firms involved in publishing. 
 
Figure 2.1- (A) Share of different sectors in pro-poor nanotechnology publications by province11; (B) Share of different sectors 
by field12 
Nanotech-related publications with energy applications are the main focus across most of the 
dominant provinces. The number of publications in water and agri-food applications is similar but 
low across different provinces (Fig. 2.2A). Fig. 2.2B shows the cumulative volumes of articles 
across the years 1996 to 2011. The exponential trend line was chosen as it fits best to the 
cumulative number of articles (R squared more than 0.95). Fig. 2.2B reveals that the number of 
papers with the three pro-poor applications follows a trend-line with higher exponential growth 
rate than the one of the overall nanotechnology papers. Papers with the focus on water and energy 
applications have the highest exponential growth rate, explaining an accelerated focus on these 
specific application areas despite the fact that share of articles in these applications is low.  
2.4.2- Gender Disparities in Publications 
Authorship of pro-poor nanotechnology papers is largely male-dominated. Women hold merely 
18% of total authorship (Fig. 2.4C) in all the pro-poor applications which is even lower than the 
share of women authorship across all the sciences and all the engineering, which are 30%

12 Abbreviations for sectors are: U=University, G=Government, I=Industry, H=Hospital 
19 
(Larivière et al. 2013a) and 20% (Ghiasi et al. 2015), respectively. Fig. 2.3 shows that despite the 
growth in the number of articles and authors, the share of female authorship did not change 
noticeably over the 15-year period.  
 
Figure 2.2- (A) Nanotechnology authorship by province in pro-poor applications; (B) Trend line based on cumulative number of 
publications in nanotechnology (right axis) and its pro-poor applications (left axis) 
Narrowing the focus to disparities across different sectors, the share of women authorship has 
shown to be higher in universities and governmental agencies and is the lowest in industry. Women 
affiliated with governmental agencies have published in higher ranked journals, and their 
publications have received higher numbers of citations compared to their male counterparts. 
Women in academia, despite the higher overall quality of papers compared to other sectors, were 
involved in papers which had lower citation impact and were published in lower quality journals 
in comparison to their male peers.  
It might seem that authorship in industry favors women in the sense that on average they have 
published in only slightly lower quality journals and their publications received more citations, 
however it should be noted that the share of industry in pro-poor nanotechnology authorship is 
very small (~3%) and involves only 57 papers with only 17 female authors. Therefore, the findings 
on paper quality for women in industry are biased due to the small number of women involved. 
Nanotechnology authorship with energy applications is the most male-dominated application 
where women published articles with lower scientific impact. This may be due to the fact that 
research in energy occurs largely within the highly male-dominated fields of engineering and 
physics, whereas agri-food and water applications are associated with less male dominant fields, 
namely earth sciences, biology, biotechnology, chemistry and health sciences, according to the 
20 
work of Larivière (2014), who mapped the level of male dominancy in scientific authorship of 
different disciplines in Quebec, Canada and worldwide. Authorship in agri-food and water 
applications was less male-dominated, and women have published in journals with the same 
quality as their male peers. However, women received lower citation rates. This finding might 
correspond to the “Matilda effect in science” (Rossiter 1993) at the citation level, where the 
number of citations of papers published by women is lower than the number of citations expected 
to be received by papers published in a given journal. A similar interpretation is discussed  in 
engineering (Ghiasi et al. 2015) and all sciences  (Larivière 2014). 
 
Figure 2.3- Number of articles and authors (left axis) and share of female authorship (right axis) over years in pro-poor 
nanotechnology applications13 
Women in Quebec have proved to be dominant, given that their share of authorship is higher than 
the authorship share of Canadian women. This is in line with the analysis of Larivière (2014) 
across all scientific fields. Moreover, Quebec women were involved in papers published in higher 
ranked journals that also received higher numbers of citations than their male peers from Quebec.

and male authors (A) by sector (B) by application and (C) by province  
2.4.3- Patent Analysis 
As one might expect, industry holds the lion share of patent inventorship (73%), followed by 
universities (16%) and governmental agencies (9%). In terms of provinces, Ontario holds the 
highest share of patent inventorship followed by British Columbia and Quebec (Table 2.1). British 
Columbia has the highest share of industry patenting, and universities play a major role in Quebec 
and Alberta (Fig. 2.4A). Government plays a large part in the development of nanotechnology 
patents in agri-food applications compared to the other applications (Fig. 2.4B). Top governmental 
agencies involved in pro-poor nanotechnology patenting are the NRC, the Ministry of Natural 
Resources, and top companies are the Xerox Corporation, Nortel Network limited and Zenon 
Environmental Inc. Top universities are the University of Saskatchewan and Laval University.  
 
Figure 2.5- (A) share of different sectors in pro-poor nanotechnology patents by province; (B) Right share of different sectors by 
field 
Similar to the publication analysis, the volume of patents with energy applications is the highest 
among dominant provinces, and the patent inventorships with agri-food and water applications are 
almost the same. However, the power trend lines (the best-fit trend lines in this case) on cumulative 
number of patents suggest that the growth rates of energy and agri-food patents are higher than the 
overall nanotechnology patent growth rate. Water has the lowest growth rate, which implies that 
technological advancements with water applications are very undeveloped in Canada. 
2.4.4- Gender Disparities in Patents 
Similar to authorship, despite the growth in the number of patents and inventors, the share of 
female inventorship only slightly increased overtime (Fig. 2.7). Women were involved in only 
11% of inventorship in pro-poor applications of nanotechnology (Fig. 2.8C). This share is similar 
22 
to the findings of Sugimoto et al. (2015) who analyzed all technological fields worldwide and 
found a proportion of 10.3% in 2013. It is also higher than the findings of Mauleón et al. (2013) 
who focused on Spain and found that women were involved in only 9% of patents. This could be 
due to the interdisciplinary nature of the nanotechnologies, based on which Meng and Shapira 
(2011) justified the narrower gender gap they found in nanotechnology patenting in the US.

of patents in nanotechnology (right axis) and its pro-poor applications (left axis) 
When focusing on women participation in patenting across different sectors, one sees that 
women’s share of inventorship is slightly higher in industry compared to universities and 
governmental institutions. Women were involved in industry patents with the same citation impact 
as their male counterparts, however, at universities and government institutions, there was a gender 
gap in the citation impact (Fig. 2.8A). Contrary to female authorship, the share of women 
inventorship is slightly higher in the energy and agri-food sectors (12%) than in the water (7.5%) 
(Fig. 2.8B). Women contributed to patents with a lower number of claims in all the sectors, 
applications, and provinces. The quality of nanotech-related patents with energy applications, in 
general, is higher than the ones with agri-food and water applications, and women have also proved 
to have almost the same citation impact as their male peers in this specific application area. The 
share of women inventorship is highest in Alberta, and female inventors contributed to patents 
with the same citation impact as their male peers in Quebec and Alberta (Fig. 2.8C). This also 
corresponds to the publication analysis where papers published by women in Quebec and Alberta 
have shown to have the same impact as the papers by their male counterparts.

female and male inventors (A) by sector (B) by application and (C) by province  
This study also provides cross-gender analysis for the production, performance, and quality of 
Author-Inventors (A-Is). Author-inventors are here Canadian-affiliated individuals who published 
at least one paper and registered at least one patent in subfields of water, agri-food, and energy. 
Women account for only 5% of A-Is. However, women A-Is have shown on average to be involved 
in articles published in higher quality journals and articles receiving more citations. They were 
also involved in patents with almost the same number of claims and with even higher number of 
citations than men. Therefore female A-Is have contributed to more quality work compared to the 
male A-Is. 
2.4.5- Employment Analysis 
Industries which are comprised of at least one company contributing to the scientific and 
technological development of pro-poor nanotechnology applications are identified. 52% of the 
companies are focused primarily on manufacturing, followed by professional services (24%) (Fig. 
2.8A).  
24 
For this study, industries are assigned as gender-balanced  where the employment gap or wage gap 
in that specific industry is lower than the gender gap across all the industries in Canada (Orange 
bars in Fig. 2.9) and as male-dominated  where the employment and wage gaps are higher (blue 
bars in Fig. 2.9). In Canada, the employment gap in the share of women and men across all 
industries is 1.9%, and the gender wage gap is 16.4%. Among the identified industries, only the 
educational services industry has shown to be pro-women in terms of both employment and hourly 
wages.

male A-Is; (B) Share of female A-Is inventorship (left axis) and citation impact and patent claim (right axis) of the patents 
granted to female and male A-Is 
Looking into industries representing the three pro-poor applications of nanotechnology, all the 
three application areas have shown to be largely male-dominated in terms of both wages and 
employment. However, the agri-food industry shows a lower gap in comparison to energy and 
water applications. Energy and water subfields are almost equally male-dominated in terms of both 
employment and the gender wage gap.  
As discussed above, nanotechnology authorship and inventorship in agri-food applications are less 
male-dominated. Together with the employment analysis, this implies that women in this 
application area are subject to less inequality in comparison to the other two subfields. 
However, it should be noted that publishing and patenting activities in all the pro-poor applications 
are highly male dominant, and women face high wage gaps and employment gaps in workplaces 
in these areas. These findings represent a clear call for integration of gender-responsive policies 
across the development of these application areas, as discussed more in the conclusion below.

2.5- Discussion and Conclusions 
The findings reveal that only a narrow spectrum of Canadian nanotechnology articles and patents 
reflect pro-poor priorities for energy, agri-food and water applications which is significant because 
these are the three application areas of nanotechnology that have been identified as having the 
most potential to create pro-poor technologies. However, this study found a higher share of 
nanotechnology publications in these three pro-poor applications for Canada than the shares found 
by Cozzens et al. (2013) in their global analysis. This shows that Canada has a larger focus on the 
development of pro-poor nanotechnologies than the worldwide average, even if only slightly so. 
Ontario has the largest share of governmental publishing and patenting activities, which is due to 
the fact that many of the governmental agencies—including NRC related agencies—are located in 
Ottawa, the capital. The share of governmental involvement is the highest in scientific and 
technological advancements in agri-food applications. Among the three application areas, Canada 
26 
puts more focus on publishing and patenting on energy applications, which is in line with the 
worldwide analysis of pro-poor nanotechnology applications (Cozzens et al. 2013). The growth 
rate of publications in these applications is higher than the development of all Canadian 
nanotechnology papers, which corresponds to an accelerating focus on publishing on pro-poor 
technologies. However, in terms of patents, the growth rate of nanotechnology patents with water 
applications is very slow and is lower than that of all nanotechnology patents, which is contrary to 
the case of energy and agri-food applications. 
Canadian women researchers account for only 18.45% of total nanotechnology authorship in the 
three application areas, and they have shown higher dominance across governmental and 
university sectors, leaving industry as the most male-dominated sector. Women in governmental 
agencies contribute more to higher quality work than their male peers. Authorship in agri-food 
applications is less male-dominated in comparison to the other applications. Female researchers in 
Quebec have proved to be the most dominant compared to other provinces in terms of authorship 
and quality of work.  
The patent analysis in this study reveals that the share of Canadian women inventorship is only 
11.3% and the share of women inventorship across different sectors is quite similar. Inventorship 
in water applications is the most male dominant. Women in Alberta have shown to be involved in 
a higher share of inventorship, and patent citation impact reveals that inventions by women are 
equally important as those created by men in that province. Female A-Is have contributed to higher 
quality publications and patents than male A-Is. It has been shown that all the companies involved 
in R&D for all three application areas are active in highly male-dominated industries in which 
women are subject to lower rates of employment and lower hourly wages.  
These findings can help inform Canada’s decades-long process of determining how to best help 
developing countries. In 1968, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) – which 
was folded into the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development (DFATD) in 2013 – 
was established to alleviate poverty and support sustainable development in poor countries. Along 
with Canada’s allocation of 0.7% of GDP to foreign aid in 1970, the IDRC was created by the 
Parliament of Canada to help developing counties by the use of science, technology, and 
innovation, and provide support and formation of a local research community whose research 
provides long-term solutions to socio-economic and environmental issues facing developing 
27 
countries (Marcus 2013). In 2004, the government of Canada affirmed the importance of research 
associated with addressing the needs of developing world and devoted 5% of its R&D budget to 
address the challenges faced by developing countries (Salamanca-Buentello, Persad, Martin, Daar, 
& Singer 2005). In 2006, the collaboration between the Association of Universities and Colleges 
of Canada (AUCC) and IDRC was formed to support scientific and technological advancements 
which bring benefits to developing countries and help solve development problems (AUCC 2006). 
Currently, there is a debate on the establishment of a Development Finance Institution (DFI) 
(Laverdière 2015) to facilitate investments in private sector companies that promote development. 
Despite of all these efforts and all of the nanotechnology’s promises in revolutionizing the 
Canadian market, only a narrow spectrum of nanotechnology research and development efforts in 
Canada contribute to the success of the UN MDGs and the needs of developing countries. This 
shows there is a clear need for the integration of pro-poor policies into the existing science and 
technology priorities in Canada. However, this is not sufficient. Because these pro-poor scientific 
and innovative efforts tend to be highly male-dominated in terms of both the scientific community 
and the workforce, the incentives to develop pro-poor nanotechnology applications might widen 
the gender gap and hinder social development. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for Canada to 
focus on the establishment of both gender-related and pro-poor policies concurrently.  
Canada’s effort to mainstream gender in S&T policies is largely confined to NSERC initiatives 
and gender-related programs on women in nanotechnology is nonexistent at national, 
organizational and institutional level. Although NSERC shows policy concerns for 
underrepresentation and repression of women in sciences, its gender-related initiatives seem not 
to be very effective. According to Shendruk (2015), the share of women working in the STEM 
fields barely changed since 1987, and they are still underpaid (7.5% less than their male peers). 
With the right gender-responsive policies that help attract and support more women in these nano-
application areas, Canada might be able to reach a higher level of gender equality in its workforce 
and broaden its knowledge capacity and research performance in addressing developing world’s 
challenges. The results of this study are thus of great importance to policy makers to gain insight 
into the identification of leverage points to promote both gender equality and poverty alleviation 
in emerging science and technology policies, enhance success in new interdisciplinary 
environments (such as nanotechnology) and consequently foster economic growth.

Chapter 3 - Article 2: Inequality and collaboration patterns of Canadian nanotechnology: Implications for pro-
poor and gender-inclusive policy 
Inequality and collaboration patterns of Canadian nanotechnology: 
Implications for pro-poor and gender-inclusive policy 
Abstract  
Policymakers and scholars are increasingly concerned with how nanotechnology can reduce 
inequalities and provide benefits for underprivileged, disadvantaged, and poor communities. This 
paper simultaneously addresses two concerns related to nanotechnology and equity: the lack of 
research and development (R&D) focused on nanotechnology applications that benefit developing 
nations (pro-poor R&D) and the lack of women in nanotechnology fields. The paper focuses on 
Canada, an affluent country that is committed to both pro-poor and gender responsive policies. 
Social network analysis is used to examine collaboration patterns of authors and inventors whose 
work is related to pro-poor applications of nanotechnology. Differences in collaboration patterns 
of scientists of each gender are then examined to better understand how they are involved in 
networks of authorship and inventorship. The findings reveal that female first-authored papers 
receive a lower rate of citations and are published in higher ranked journals compared to those 
papers first-authored by men. Nevertheless, when women are last or corresponding authors, their 
papers receive equal or higher citation rates and are published in lower or similar ranked journals. 
Women are as, or more, collaborative as their male peers in their co-authorship and co-inventorship 
networks. While the majority of male authors and male inventors collaborate exclusively with 
men, those involved in a mixed-gender team outperform male-only teams. Women, as both authors 
and inventors, are involved in more gender-balanced collaboration teams. The study calls for 
development and implementation of gender-related policies in Canada to increase the prevalence 
of female scientists in collaboration networks, and to support the participation of women in pro-
poor areas.

3.1- Introduction 
Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field at the intersection of engineering, biology, physics and 
chemistry that involves manipulation and control of matter at a molecular level (NNI 2014). 
Nanotechnology has gained momentum in various application areas—such as energy generation 
and supply, water treatment and remediation, agriculture and food production, medicines and 
healthcare, manufacturing, and environment—which evinces a great potential to benefit both 
developing and developed nations (Salamanca-Buentello, Persad, Martin, Daar, & Singer 2005). 
Research and development in this groundbreaking technology has been supported by large national 
investments worldwide because it is seen to offer a great technological advantage and fuel 
economic growth (Palmberg et al. 2009).  
However, many nations have grappled with the challenge of policy making for nanotechnology. 
Because applications are complex and uncertain, and because the hyped promise of job creation 
(Roco, 2011) and the rapid commercial payoff (Hobson 2009) distort delineation of the scope of 
nanotechnology development (Schummer 2007). Debates about nanotechnology’s benefits not 
only complicate economic analysis, but they also reveal the complexities of nanotechnology’s 
ethical, environmental, legal, and social implications (Muchie & Demissie 2013).  
This makes nanotechnology a difficult, yet critical case, for science and technology (S&T) policy 
scholars and practitioners who are increasingly interested in understanding how innovation 
alleviates or exacerbate inequality, and whether new technologies provide benefits for 
underprivileged, disadvantaged and poor communities and groups (Cozzens 2012; Cozzens & 
Wetmore 2011; Harsh & Woodson 2012; Pidgeon et al. 2009; Wiek et al. 2012; Zehavi & Breznitz 
2017). Recent policy initiatives at the United Nations (UN) have highlighted the equity issues 
connected to nanotechnology and what is at stake (UNESCO 2014). Unequal access to the latest 
discoveries in nanotechnologies and stark disparities in resources and opportunities for 
nanotechnology research, development and innovation could bring forth a “nano-divide” (Daar et 
al. 2004) between nations and communities. UNESCO (2014) argues that this may perpetuate and 
exacerbate the gulf between privileged and marginalized groups across the globe, increase the 
vulnerability of poor and disadvantaged communities to environmental and health problems, and 
could lead to discrimination and stigmatization.  
30 
At the same time, nanotechnology could serve as an impetus for sustainable development in poorer 
countries; it could help create so-called pro-poor technologies (Salamanca-Buentello, Persad, 
Martin, Daar, & Singer 2005). For instance, nanotechnology could lead to clean, inexpensive, 
efficient and reliable devices to harness renewable resources and providing new solutions for 
energy generation and storage, water treatment and desalination and disease diagnosis (UNESCO 
2014). Nanotechnology could thus be a tool to help meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) – the successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – to end poverty, reach 
equality, and fight climate change by 2030. The 17th goal of UN SDGs specifically highlights 
revitalization and implementation of global partnership and calls for development and transfer of 
pro-poor technologies, acknowledging the importance of advanced emerging technologies to help 
reach the SDGs. UNESCO (2014) also raises an additional important concern about potential 
discrimination, stigmatization, and marginalization connected to nanotechnology – the male 
dominancy in nanotechnology fields. This gender disparity could preclude women from 
participating in and benefiting from nanotechnology advances. In addition, as a further negative 
consequence, women might be seen as less adept and qualified compared to men, and suffer 
prejudice that hampers their career development.  
This paper simultaneously examines both of these critical equity issues connected to 
nanotechnology as identified by the UN, namely pro-poor potential and gender equity, to better 
understand both issues, and how the two are related.14 An important starting point to tackle these 
issues is examining the characteristics of nanotechnology R&D systems in affluent countries, 
where the bulk of nanotechnology R&D occurs (OECD 2013). It is here where gender inequality 
in the scientific workforce can be most significantly manifested, and where research priorities and 
patenting may or may not align with the needs of developing nations. For instance in 2013, 56.5% 
of nanotechnology patents were filed in North America, 19.5% in Western Europe and 27.8% in 
East Asia and all by developed nations and multinational companies (MNCs), focusing mainly on 
the computers and electronics sector (Jordan et al. 2014) and on concerns of affluent communities, 
particularly decreasing the size for computers and laptops.  
                                                        
14 For instance, a policy that focuses on economic inequality and increasing investments in pro-poor areas, alone, 
might exacerbate the underrepresentation of women and gender inequalities in STEM fields as an unintended 
consequence. 
31 
This paper focuses on Canada, a country that has a strong focus on pro-poor technologies and on 
gender equality in the S&T workforce. Canada’s International Development Research Centre 
(IDRC)—established by Parliament of Canada in 1970—has been long involved in supporting 
research and development related to improving lives and livelihoods in developing countries, and 
through IDRC, Canada allocates no less than 5% of Canada’s R&D investments to international 
development issues. In terms of gender, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council 
of Canada (NSERC) has a research chair program for Women in Science and Engineering 
Program, which along with Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology (SCWIST), 
helps implement and support initiatives to increase the participation of women in S&T fields 
(NSERC 2010). However, Canada does not have gender-related policies designed to engage 
women in nanotechnology specifically.  
In order to understand how the characteristics of Canada’s nanotechnology R&D are connected to 
pro-poor applications and to gender equity, social network analysis (SNA) is utilized. After briefly 
reviewing the literature on nanotechnology collaboration networks, collaboration patterns of 
researchers and inventors involved in the development of pro-poor nanotechnology applications 
are analyzed. For this analysis, this paper uses the top three potential pro-poor applications of 
nanotechnology identified by Salamanca-Buentello (2005) who correlated nanotechnology 
applications with the UN MDGs: (1) energy storage, production, and conversion (2) agricultural 
productivity enhancement (3) and water treatment and remediation. The paper then further 
investigates differences in collaboration patterns of scientists of each gender and provides a better 
understanding of how they are involved in their network of authorship and inventorship. Our 
results show that women are as, or more, collaborative as their male counterparts and are involved 
in more gender-balanced scientific collaboration teams in their co-authorship and co-inventorship 
networks. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings for Canada’s 
policies. 
3.2- Literature Review 
3.2.1- Nanotechnology Collaboration Networks 
Analysis of collaboration networks helps us understand the interactions among researchers, 
inventors, and their behavior. Scientific collaborations are formed through joint efforts to reach a 
32 
common goal, enabling continuous interaction of knowledge, skills, and resources (Katz & Martin 
1997) and thereby enhancing of scientific productivity. These collaborations are generally in the 
form of co-authorship, co-inventorship and university-industry relationships (UIRs). Researchers 
are increasingly motivated to collaborate because of many recent trends in science: research 
problems are becoming more varied and complex, expertise is more specialized, the amount of 
scientific knowledge is growing exponentially, research funding sources are more competitive and 
varied, and technologies that support science are changing rapidly (Hara et al. 2003). On the one 
hand, there is some empirical evidence that collaboration among scientists leads to higher research 
productivity (Lee & Bozeman 2005; Pravdic & Oluic-Vukovic 1986; Price & Beaver 1966) and 
quality (Aksnes 2003). On the other hand, some studies found no significant impact of an increase 
in co-authorship collaborations on publication productivity, and argue that productivity is 
dependent on the background of the individual scientific collaborators (Duque et al. 2005; Pravdic 
& Oluic-Vukovic 1986). For example, the presence of prolific scientists (known as star scientists) 
(Zucker & Darby 1995, 1996), or of so-called gatekeepers – individual scientists at the network’s 
frontier who play a key role in negotiating the inflow of external knowledge (Schiffauerova & 
Beaudry 2012) – can both be important factors linked to productivity. For nanotechnology, various 
patterns of co-authorship collaboration are mapped and analyzed in the works of (Meyer & Persson 
1998) and (Tang & Shapira 2011). Similarly, co-invention collaborations are analyzed in the study 
of Schiffauerova & Beaudry (2012) with a specific focus on stars and gatekeepers.  
UIRs, also known as public-private collaborations, stimulate innovation and scientific capacity by 
providing industries with novel ideas to exploit the commercial potential of new discoveries, and 
by enabling universities to enhance their know-how through sharing knowledge with firms 
(Nikulainen & Palmberg 2010). It is generally accepted that collaboration between university 
researchers and industry scientists emerge in the form of co-patenting and co-publishing and this 
type of collaboration has a positive effect on the innovative productivity (Schultz 2011). Some 
publication and patent-based indicators are introduced in the literature to map UIRs, including, but 
not limited to, citations to non-patent literature, papers published by authors affiliated to industry, 
patents filed by universities, papers with at least one author from industry and one author from 
university, patents invented by academics but filed by industry, lexical linkage between articles 
and patents, and author-inventor links (Bassecoulard & Zitt 2004; Cassiman et al. 2007; Maraut & 
Martínez 2014). More specifically for the field of nanotechnology, many studies show a propensity 
33 
of industries to employ university researchers (Kim et al. 2010), an increase in UIRs in general 
(Zucker & Darby 2005) and increased productivity for university researchers involved in patenting 
(Meyer 2006). This study also pays attention to the distinct role of Author-Inventors (A-Is) of each 
gender, researchers involved in the production of knowledge as well as development of a 
technology, who are associated to most productive and highly cited researchers in nanotechnology 
(Meyer 2006) and maps gender differences in scientific and technological production and 
collaboration patterns of the A-Is.  
Regarding the collaboration patterns of female scientists (versus their male counterparts), some 
studies found that women are more inclined than men to collaborate via co-authorship based on 
the number of sole-authored articles (Hunter & Leahey 2008; Ozel et al. 2014). While some other 
studies have found the opposite (Kyvik & Teigen 1996; Prpić 2002). Long (1990) found no 
significant difference between men and women in their co-authorship collaboration patterns. These 
inconsistencies stem from the use of various samples and different measures of collaboration. 
Nevertheless, it is important to note that these studies overlook one key issue, namely scientific 
and technological productivity. Gender differences in scientific and technological productivity 
have been addressed in several other studies (e.g., in (Davarpanah & Moghadam 2012; Meng & 
Shapira 2011; Miller et al. 2012; Ozel et al. 2014)). However, there have only been a few studies 
that specifically looked at how the collaboration patterns of female scientists impact their 
productivity (Bentley 2012; Kyvik & Teigen 1996; Long 1992), which found a positive impact of 
collaboration on women’s productivity. On the gendered collaboration patterns of researchers in 
nanotechnology, it is shown that women are more likely not to be included in collaborations, as 
patents with only-male inventors are more likely to be the result of scientific collaborations while 
patents with only-female inventor(s) are possibly the result of individual scientific activity (Meng 
& Shapira 2011). Accordingly, Villanueva-Felez et al. (2015) found that women acquire less 
information from collaborations and tie strength is lower for women’s scientific collaborations.  
Although, a nanotechnology R&D strategy conducive to pro-poor growth might benefit developed 
nations by promoting SDGs in developing countries and creating new markets in developed 
nations (Rodrigues et al. 2007), studies focusing on collaboration and productivity of 
nanotechnology researchers in pro-poor areas is nascent and only limited to energy sector and 
country-level analysis (Guan & Liu 2014). This study tries to fill this void and look into differences 
34 
in collaboration patterns of researchers whose focus of research is on the top pro-poor areas of 
nanotechnology. 
Social network analysis (SNA), as a specific tool for collaboration analysis, is used to identify 
crucial factors which influence the motivation for and behavior of scientific collaborations, and 
how these are connected to productivity (Abbasi et al. 2011; Catherine Beaudry & Schiffauerova 
2011; Eslami et al. 2013; Newman 2001; Uddin et al. 2012). The use of social network theories in 
the cross-gender analysis of collaboration networks and their productivity is still nascent in the 
literature, and as yet, is largely undeveloped in nanotechnology and its pro-poor areas. Henceforth, 
this research not only intends to trace women’s scientific and innovative productivity performance 
but to study how their involvement in various collaborative teams and networks affects scientific 
and innovative productivity. 
3.3- Methods 
3.3.1- Data 
This paper uses an all-nanotechnology article and patent dataset developed by researchers at 
Concordia University and École Polytechnique de Montréal (Barirani et al. 2013; Moazami et al. 
2015; Tahmooresnejad et al. 2015), which is comprised of nanotechnology-related articles indexed 
in the Scopus database and nanotechnology patents in the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office (USPTO) database. Since Scopus offers full coverage on publication data from the year 
1996, and usually after a lag of few years, full publication data of a given year become available, 
this study focuses on papers published from 1996 to 2011. Complete patent data was available to 
this study for patents granted over the years 1996-2009. Articles and patents with at least one 
author affiliated with a Canadian institution are further identified. Canadian nanotechnology-
related articles and patents with pro-poor applications in energy, agri-food and water (top pro-poor 
applications of nanotechnology) are further extracted using the set of keyword filters introduced 
for each of these three areas in (Cozzens et al. 2013) applied to abstract, title, and keywords (where 
applicable) of the nanotechnology-related articles and patents. The order of authors is further 
identified to address gender differences in the contribution of first, corresponding, and last author 
of a paper. 
35 
The province and the sector (university, government, and industry) of an author’s publishing 
activities are identified based on the author affiliation. For patents, the province of an inventor is 
given information. However, the sector is identified based on the type of assignee, whether it is a 
firm, governmental agency, university or an individual. The gender of each author and inventor is 
further assigned based on author first names using GenderChecker.com name-gender database, 
which was developed from 2011 UN Census data. For those scientists whose gender is unknown 
or unisex after using GenderChecker.com, their academic, LinkedIn, or any other online profile is 
used to determine their gender, so that that gender can be assigned to all authors and inventors. 
Appendix A lists most common given names of identified authors and inventors and their gender. 
Author-inventors (A-Is) refer to those researchers who are involved in both patenting and 
publishing in pro-poor areas. Inventors and authors are paired based on their first names and last 
names, and A-Is are further selected as those pairs with patent(s) and article(s) similar in title(s) 
and abstract(s), or those pairs whose province(s) listed on their patents matches province(s) of their 
current and previous affiliations in the Scopus database. The productivity of scientists is further 
defined as the total number of their publications and patents. Average number of citations per year 
as a measure of scientific impact, together with the SCImago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) – a 
journal prestige metric, which uses field-subject weighted citations to rank journals according to 
Scopus data and classifications (SCImago Research Group 2007) – as the measure of journal 
impact, is used to measure research quality of an author. For inventors, average number of citations 
received per year is used as a measure of impact. The number of patent claims, a series of numbered 
expressions describing the invention in technical terms and defining the extent of the protection 
conferred by a patent, is used as an indicator of broad application and potential profitability of an 
innovation, or innovation quality (Lanjouw & Schankerman 2004). Since extracted articles and 
patents are within the same field and same country, field and country-specific normalizations are 
not applied in this study. A total of 2,528 authors, 608 inventors, and 43 A-Is which are involved 
in publishing 1,157 articles in years 1996-2011 and 365 patents in 1996-2009 are identified.  
3.3.2- Social Network Analysis 
Collaboration networks are a type of complex network – irregular structured networks whose 
nodes or vertices dynamically evolve in time (Boccaletti et al. 2006)– within which knowledge 
creation, diffusion, and utilization can occur. In these networks, nodes represent actors of a 
36 
knowledge system (e.g. individuals, firms, institutions) and links imply their collaborations in 
developing a product. This study focuses three specific types of networks: co-authorship network, 
co-inventorship network and combination of the two (being referred to as co-innovation network 
in this study), and examines collaboration patterns among scientists and innovators of each gender 
through the use of created databases on patents and publications. Given that actors and their 
interactions form networks, SNA is a useful tool to examine how dense, cohesive, and complex a 
network – as a whole – is. While at an individual level, SNA helps to understand the relationship 
between the ways an actor is embedded in a network and actor’s behavior, influence, power, and 
accessibility to different resources and opportunities (Wei et al. 2011). Hence, network analyses 
are used in this study to help identify connections between authors and inventors of each gender 
and to track cooperation patterns and flows of knowledge based on co-publication and co-patenting 
activities. 
The connectedness of a network’s nodes can be measured in terms of network density and the 
network’s clustering coefficient. The importance of nodes and links is analyzed using centrality 
measures. Since networks are disconnected, network degree centrality and clustering coefficients 
are deployed in this study to characterize innovation network structures and assess the role of 
individual scientists (actors) in the scientific and innovative productivity of a network.  
Network density is the ratio of the number of observed links in a network to the total number of 
possible links in the same network and shows how fast information diffuses among the scientists. 
Degree centrality is the measure of a node’s total number of connections and represents 
collaborativeness and popularity of a node and its advantaged position for catching information. 
The clustering Coefficient (CC) is the ratio of the total number of links that could exist for an actor 
to the number of real existing links and is a measure of the transitivity of a network. It shows how 
well neighbors of a node are connected to one another and how well direct collaborators of one 
node are connected to one another if the node is removed from the network. Therefore, a lower 
CC value indicates that the node plays a more important role the in the network, compared to a 
different node with a higher CC value. The closer average clustering coefficient (ACC) of a 
network is to 1, the more connected the network is (a network with a high degree of ‘cliquishness’) 
(Zweig et al. 2014).

In this research, co-authorship and co-inventorship networks are created for nanotechnology’s 
three top pro-poor applications: water, energy, and agri-food. The network of scientists is 
generated based on the database of the co-authored scientific articles, and similarly, the 
inventorship network is built using the database of co-inventors from the patents in the related 
fields. Afterwards, article authors who are also assigned as an inventor to at least one patent within 
the same application – known as Author-Inventors (A-Is) – are identified in the network, and the 
links between author-inventors and other authors and inventors are studied. Finally, networks of 
scientists and inventors are put together, presenting what is referred to as “co-innovation network” 
in this study. A 5-year temporal window is adopted to assess the dynamics of innovation over time. 
Networks are created based on 5-year windows starting from 1996 to 2011 for publications and 
1996-2009 for granted patents. In this research, collaboration team of a researcher is defined as all 
the distinct authors and inventors who co-published or co-patented with the researcher. 
Collaboration networks are visualized in Gephi (Bastian et al. 2009), an open source software 
which enables analyses and visualization of large networks and facilitates calculation of network 
properties. Visualization helps better understand the network structure, along with the calculation 
of network measures, including number of nodes, number of links, network density, degree 
centrality and clustering coefficient. Networks comprise of several connected components, which 
are known as clusters. The giant component is the largest connected component of a network.  
Edges of the network are classified into FF, FM, and MM collaboration, which identify whether 
the authorship or inventorship collaboration is between a female scientist with another female 
scientist (FF collaboration), a female and a male scientist (FM collaboration) or between two male 
scientists (MM collaborations). The team structure is further analyzed in terms of whether a given 
scientist has only female, only male or mixed gender collaborators.  
The weight of edges network represent the extent that researchers who have already collaborated 
together (on papers or patents) repeat their collaboration by authoring another paper or patenting 
another patent—which is sometimes referred to as loyalty (Zamzami & Schiffauerova 2017) and 
in this research, it is referred to as the collaboration repetition rate. This rate helps to understand 
better how strong collaboration ties are among researchers of each gender in their both publishing 
and patenting activities.

3.4- Results 
3.4.1- Publication analysis 
3.4.1.1- Authorship order 
The order of authors in the byline provides an approximate measure to evaluate the contribution 
of each author. The declining rate of alphabetical ordering in authorship (i.e., usually used in 
articles published in the field of mathematics, economics, and high energy physics) (Waltman 
2012) has led to the use of contribution-based ordering as a common practice (Clement 2013). 
Here, the first position is typically allocated to younger researchers with lower professional rank 
and last position is given to the principal investigator with a high rank (West et al. 2013). This has 
been studied in the experimental fields of materials science and chemical engineering (Costas & 
Bordons 2011; Ho 2012), which are the main fields of nanoscience. Moreover, the correspondence 
is often assigned to the senior author (e.g., programme director, principal investigator) (Nahata 
2008) who is mostly responsible for the initial conception and supervision of the research 
conducted for the paper (Mattsson et al. 2011). Consequently, first, last, and corresponding 
authored publications play a major role in hiring and promotion in the field of nanotechnology. 
Analysis of authorship order can, therefore, help us understand in/equality in the field.  
The findings reveal a drop in the share of first author positions that are assigned to women (female 
first authors) and an increase in the share of female last authors over time (Fig. 3.1), noting that a 
5-year moving window is used to assess trends. Average number of authors per paper is slightly 
higher when women are listed as first authors in the byline, and is lower when they sign their 
names as corresponding or last authors. The number of authors of a paper is shown to be positively 
correlated with the citation impact of the paper in several studies (Aksnes 2003; Beaver 2004; 
Bornmann & Daniel 2008; Lawani 1986). When women are listed as first authors, their papers 
receive lower citation rates than their male peers, despite having a similar number of authors (Table 
3.1) and published in journals with higher SJR rankings (Fig. 3.2). This might be related to the 
well-known Matilda effect (Rossiter 1993)—women receive lower credit and recognition than 
expected compared to their male counterparts, which in this case means the expected rate of 
citations received by signing papers with higher number of co-authors and publishing papers in 
journals with the same SJR as journals in which male first-authored papers are published (Ghiasi 
39 
et al. 2015; Knobloch-Westerwick & Glynn 2013; Larivière 2014). One important aspect to 
consider is that the average number of citations per paper varies greatly in different subject areas 
(Marx & Bornmann 2015). The proportion of female-authored papers that are published in 
engineering and physics subject areas is low compared to that of male-authored papers (Fig. 3.3). 
These fields were identified as two of macro-disciplines that are highly cited by nanotechnology-
related papers (Porter & Youtie 2009a). Therefore, the lack of participation of women in 
engineering and physics fields might also partly contribute to differences in citation impact of 
female and male first-authored papers.  
 
Figure 3.1- Fraction of first, last and corresponding 
authored papers by women 
 
Figure 3.2- Citation and journal impact of papers sole-, first-
, last-, and corresponding- authored by each gender 
However, regardless of differences in subject areas, equal (or higher) citation impact is found 
among papers in which women are listed as the corresponding (or last) authors, and these papers 
are published in journals with equal (or slightly lower) SJR rankings. This shows that when women 
sign their names as corresponding or last authors – positions which are usually signed by the 
principal investigator and the supervisor of research project (Tscharntke et al. 2007) – their papers 
receive equal or higher recognition compared to papers where men are the last authors. This might 
be due to a correlation between the low fraction of female corresponding or last authors and the 
low fraction of women in senior STEM academic positions (a result of the so-called ‘leaky 
pipeline’(Berryman 1983) which could lead to a strong selection effect in science and engineering 
fields: unless being highly competent and qualified, women tend to leave the field. While women 
first authors receive lower recognition for their scientific work, women as corresponding (or last) 
authors might represent a small proportion of female researchers in senior positions who are 
exceptionally qualified in the field and hence, their research group attracts scientific attention.

3.4.1.2- Co-authorship network analysis 
The co-authorship network is mapped to evaluate gender difference in the collaboration patterns 
of researchers. In this network, nodes represent authors, and two nodes are connected if two authors 
have collaborated on a paper together in the 5-year temporal window. Table 3.2 shows network 
properties over time. Average clustering coefficient (ACC) is high (close to 1). This represents a 
tightly connected network and shows that it is highly probable that two researchers that have co-
authored a paper with the same researcher, are connected themselves. The network is becoming 
less dense over time as the number of authors and connections increases—a common pattern when 
the number of authors increases: more collaboration opportunities lead to a sparser network.

To map gender differences in co-authorship collaboration patterns, degree centrality and 
productivity of authors of each gender are measured (Fig. 3.4). The average productivity of 
researchers of each gender is not significantly different in a 5-year temporal window (it is slightly 
lower for women). However, women, on average, are more collaborative (have higher degree 
centrality) than their male peers from the period 2000-2004. Canada implemented several 
41 
nanotechnology initiatives starting in 1997 by introducing a Centre for Advanced Nanotechnology 
at the University of Toronto, followed by other National Research Council (NRC) institutes in 
Alberta, British Colombia, Quebec and Ontario, including large institutions such as National 
Institute for Nanotechnology (NINT) and NanoQuébec (established in 2001). In addition, the 
Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada put forward the Women in Science 
and Engineering (WISE) Chair program in 1996 to boost participation of women in STEM fields. 
These national initiatives might be the reason behind the changes in trends from the period 2000-
2004.  
As stated in the methodology, the higher the clustering coefficient (CC) of an author, the more 
well-connected the co-authors of the author are to one another. CC of a node, therefore, shows to 
what extent an author is important – nodes with a lower CC play more important linking roles in 
the network (Zweig et al. 2014). The analysis shows that the gap between the CC of female and 
male authors has decreased over time. Male authors hold lower CC over time, revealing their 
important positions in the co-authorship networks (Fig. 3.5).  
 
Figure 3.4- Average degree centrality and productivity of 
authors of each gender 
 
Figure 3.5- Average clustering coefficient of authors of 
each gender 
Our analyses of collaborations (the edges of co-authorship network) show that the share of male-
male (MM) collaboration is the highest in all the years and small changes are detected in these 
shares over time: MM collaborations slightly decreased and collaborations of researchers (of any 
gender) with female authors slightly increased (Fig. 3.6). Fig. 3.7 shows that women repeat their 
co-authorship collaborations with their female peers at a very low rate, whereas men are highly 
loyal to their male co-authors and repeat their collaboration with men at a higher rate. However, 
the trend shows an incline toward repeating co-authorship with women (as the weight of FF and 
FM collaborations is increasing).

collaboration overtime

(edge weights) overtime 
3.4.1.3- Co-authorship collaboration teams 
The analysis of the full network for the whole period provides insights into how researchers form 
their co-authorship collaboration network. MM collaborations represent the highest share and 
highest level of loyalty for collaborations on authoring papers, which attests that the scientific 
system (of pro-poor nanotechnology) is not only dominated by men but also favors them (Table 
3.3) in the sense that the repetition rate of collaboration with men is the highest for both genders.  
Table 3.3- Share and repetition rate (weight) of collaboration types in the full co-authorship network 
Collaboration type Share Repetition rate 
FF 5.43% 1.026 
FM 32.03% 1.085 
MM 62.54% 1.1 
To better study the scientific system and the structure of collaborative teams, authors are classified 
into authors who only published by themselves, and authors who have collaborated only with men, 
only with women, and who have formed mixed gender teams in which at least one author of each 
gender is present. Around 50% of female authors included both genders in their teams of 
collaborators, and less than 40% only collaborated with male authors. However, the share of men 
who exclusively collaborated with men is slightly higher than the share of male researchers who 
included both genders in their authorship collaboration network (Fig. 3.8). Researchers, regardless 
of their gender, are more productive when they collaborate with both genders. These results are in 
line with a study of the engineering community (Ghiasi et al. 2015), which is expected as 
nanotechnology is an interdisciplinary field, comprising of engineering, physics, and chemistry 
(Porter & Youtie 2009a). Women who collaborated only with men published in higher ranked 
43 
journals and their publications received a higher number of citations compared to women involved 
in mixed gender teams. Nevertheless, male researchers who collaborated with both genders 
published in journals with higher SJR, and the same citation rate is found among male researchers 
involved in only male, only female and mixed-gender collaboration teams (Fig. 3.9).

authors, only female authors and both

Figure 3.9- Productivity of authors (of each gender) involved in collaboration 
with no one, only female, only male, and both genders- and the citation and 
journal impact of their publications 
The analysis of collaborators of authors of each gender shows that women tend to include more 
female researchers and lower numbers of male researchers in their co-authorship teams, compared 
to their male peers, representing a lower gender gap in women’s co-authorship collaboration teams 
(Fig. 3.10). Men also tend to collaborate exclusively with men over time, and the share of 
researchers who are sole authors and did not collaborate with anyone is greater than the share male 
researchers collaborating only with female authors (Fig. 3.11). However, female authors 
collaborate with both genders at the highest rate over time and the share of female scientists who 
sole-authored their papers and those who collaborated only with women are very similar (Fig. 
3.12). This shows a lower level of gender differences in the formation of collaborative networks 
of female scientists. 
Fig. 3.13 presents the visualization of the co-authorship network in years 1996-2011. Blue nodes 
represent male authors, and orange nodes are female authors. The size of each node corresponds 
to its degree centrality. Clusters represent authors who work closely because their research subject 
and their expertise are similar (or complementary), or they work in the same geographical location 
(Parveen & Sreevalsan-Nair 2013). 
44 
 The network visualization is based on Gephi’s Force-Atlas 2 algorithm. In this layout, nodes stay 
closer if they are connected, and the distance is defined based on the weight of edges (Bastian et 
al. 2009). The visualization shows that women are more central when they are located in small 
clusters, whereas men are highly central when located in the giant component. Hence, 
collaboration with women is higher when they are located in smaller clusters. This might be due 
to the lower availability (lower numbers) of male authors to participate in co-authorship 
collaborations. In other words, researchers in these clusters are specialized in a very specific topic, 
and options for choosing collaborators are very limited. Therefore, there are higher chances for 
women to be selected as collaborators. Consequently, specializing in a very specific topic might 
lead to the lower gender gap in the team of collaborators.

3.4.2- Patent analysis 
The sequence of inventors’ names in a patent does not follow a particular order, and it has no 
bearing on the amount of contribution of an inventor to the invention. Therefore, the analysis of 
authorship order is very different from that of inventorship. 
3.4.2.1- Co-inventorship network analysis 
This study provides a gendered analysis of co-inventorship and collaboration patterns in patenting 
to map differences in the scientific and technological system of pro-poor nanotechnologies. The 
findings show that inventors tend to have higher degree centrality and are more collaborative than 
inventors. Average clustering coefficient is high and close to 1, which again shows a tightly 
connected network (Table 3.4). Therefore, two inventors that have collaborated on a patent with 
the same author are very likely connected to one another.

Female inventors are more collaborative than male inventors overtime, and are more than, or as 
productive as their male peers over different periods (Fig. 3.14). The average clustering efficient 
of male inventors is lower than for their female peers, representing the higher impact of removing 
male inventors from the network (Fig. 3.15).  
Figure 3.14- Average degree centrality and productivity of

Figure 3.15- Average clustering coefficient of inventors of

The share of MM collaborations is the highest in inventorship collaborations. However, trend 
analysis shows that the share of different co-inventorship collaboration types did not change 
dramatically over the years. However, there is a slight decrease in FM collaboration and increase 
in FF and MM collaboration over time, showing that co-patenting collaboration among inventors 
with the same gender is slightly increasing (Fig. 3.16). Looking into repetition of co-patenting 
collaborations and loyalty of inventors to their peers of each gender, FF collaborations are repeated 
more often than other types of collaboration from the period 1998-2002 to 2003-2007. This 
anomaly in the data is due to the unique collaborations of specific female scientists at Xerox 
Research Centre of Canada (Fig. 3.17).

3.4.2.2- Co-inventorship collaboration teams 
On average, MM collaborations form the lion share of co-inventorship collaborations (Table 3.5). 
However, FF collaborations outweigh other types of co-inventorship collaborations, due to the 
aforementioned productive team of female inventors at Xerox Canada.  
Table 3.5- Share and repetition rate (weight) of collaboration types in the full co-inventorship network

The analysis of collaboration patterns of inventors sheds light on the extent of gender-balance in 
the structure of collaborative teams. The share of male inventors who exclusively collaborated 
with men is greatly higher than male inventors who participated in mixed-gendered teams. 
Whereas, the share of female scientists who collaborated only with men and those involved in 
mixed-gender teams is very similar. Looking into female-only and male-only collaboration teams, 
women involved in female sole-inventorship outnumber women involved in only-female 
collaboration teams, whereas the higher share of men is involved in single-gender collaboration 
teams than in sole patenting (Fig. 3.18). According to Meng and Shapira (2011), this implies that 
single-gender patenting for male inventors is mostly the result of collaborations while for female 
inventors, it is more due to their individual inventive activities. Similar to the authorship analysis, 
productivity of researchers involved in mixed-gender invention collaboration teams is higher for 
researchers of both gender. The impact and quality of patents held by female inventors involved 
in teams of both genders, and of those held by male inventors involved in single-gender teams is 
higher (Fig. 3.19).  
The analysis of collaboration patterns reveals that women on average include a higher number of 
women in their collaboration teams over time. However, they also include higher numbers of male 
collaborators. The average gender gap in the team of co-inventorship collaborations of female 
inventors is lower, and their teams are more gender-balanced (gender gap= 73%) than the teams 
of their male peers (gender gap= 82%) (Fig. 3.20). The share of male inventors who include only 
male scientists in their networks of inventorship collaboration is greatly higher than other male 
inventors forming collaborations with at least one female researchers (Fig. 3.21). On the other 
48 
hand, differences in the proportion of female inventors forming collaborations with only men and 
those with both genders decrease over time (Fig. 3.22). These results conform with the gendered 
analysis of the U.S. nanotechnology patents (Meng & Shapira 2011), which found that women are 
more likely to be part of a mixed-gender collaboration team.

The visualization of co-inventorship collaborations, in which each node represents an inventor, 
and the links represent a collaboration of two inventors on a patent, is presented in Fig. 3.23. The 
size of each node is associated with its degree centrality. Female inventors are orange nodes, and 
blue nodes are male inventors. The network is composed of several disconnected clusters due to a 
higher degree of technological specialization of patents. In patents, as opposed to publications, 
dominant women are located in the center and giant component (biggest cluster) of the network, 
working with dominant male scientists.

3.4.3- Author-Inventors 
The co-innovation network, in this study, is composed of co-authorship and co-inventorship 
collaborations that are connected by scientists who are involved in both publishing and patenting 
(known as A-Is). A-Is are important researchers and are usually considered as the channels of 
scholarly communication between university and industry (Cassiman et al. 2007; Maraut & 
Martínez 2014). A-Is present different collaboration behaviors as authors and as inventors, which 
can shed light on differences seen in comparing scientific and technological systems. Therefore, 
this paper analyzes A-Is and their distinctive role in the co-innovation network as a separate 
category, noting that, earlier in this study, A-Is were included as inventors in the patent analysis 
and as authors in the publication analysis.  
Results show that A-Is are the most collaborative scientists, however, female A-Is are less 
collaborative than male A-Is (Fig. 3.24a). The clustering coefficient of A-Is is the lowest, 
50 
highlighting their important role in the network (Fig. 3.24b). Although being low in number, 
female A-Is are more productive in publishing articles and less productive in patenting than male 
A-Is (Fig. 3.24c). This might be related to the conductive environment of academia for female 
patenting (Sugimoto et al. 2015). Therefore, women A-Is are mostly affiliated to academic 
institutions, in which publishing is more of a priority than patenting.

inventors, and inventors 
Comparing collaboration teams of the three types of actors, this study shows no large difference 
between the number of female collaborators and the number of male collaborators of authors of 
each gender in their networks of collaboration. As for A-Is, male collaborators and female 
collaborators of male A-Is outnumber those of female A-Is. Conversely, for inventors, female 
collaborators and male collaborators of female inventors, outnumber those of male inventors (Fig. 
3.25).

Fig. 3.26 maps the co-innovation network in three deferent classifications: actor type, gender, and 
sector. Dominant A-Is are located in small clusters where collaboration between industry and 
university is conspicuous, which might be due to their specialization in very specific nano-related 
subjects that also attract industry attention.

3.5- Discussion and Conclusions 
This study examines collaboration patterns of authors, inventors, and author-inventors involved in 
Canadian nanotechnology, whose research is in line with the UN SDGs and likely to benefit 
developing countries. The cross-gender analysis reveals different collaboration patterns among 
authors, inventors, and A-Is. For this purpose, the paper first examined citation and journal impact 
of articles by authorship order for authors of each gender. Female first-authored papers receive 
lower numbers of citations, include a slightly higher number of authors and are published in higher 
ranked journals, whereas gender differences in citation rates are not conspicuous when women are 
corresponding or last authors. Female corresponding and last-authored papers receive equal or 
higher numbers of citations, while being published in equal or slightly lower-ranked journals with 
a lower number of co-authors. The former might be related to the well-known Matilda effect—
systematic repression of women’s contribution to science, which is often accredited to their male 
52 
counterparts—which has been identified in science and engineering (Ghiasi et al. 2015; Knobloch-
Westerwick & Glynn 2013; Larivière 2014). Moreover, scant representation of female-authored 
papers in engineering and physics fields might account for lower citation rates for women as first-
authors, as these fields are among highly-cited macro-disciplines by nanotechnology-related 
papers (Porter & Youtie 2009b). 
However, this study also examines this issue when women are listed as corresponding or last 
authors, authorship positions often held by the principal investigator of the research project (or the 
researcher of senior rank), and shows that female corresponding or last authored papers have 
similar (or more) scientific impact, despite being published in lower or equal ranked journals with 
lower number of co-authors. This might be due to the fact that a very low proportion of women 
authors are listed as last or corresponding authors, and a similar low proportion of women are able 
to reach high ranking positions in academia due to the glass ceiling (Tang 1997) and leaky pipeline 
(Berryman 1983) phenomenon in academia. The concept of a ‘glass ceiling’ addresses gender 
barriers that preclude women from being promoted to high-level positions, and the ‘leaky pipeline’ 
concept refers to more women than men leaving their scientific professions at each stage of career 
development. Therefore, these limited numbers of women were subject to a strong selection effect, 
according to which women who reach higher ranked positions are required to be extremely 
qualified, competent and accomplished. Therefore, the research of these women becomes well-
known in the field and has higher citation impact regardless of the journal in which it is published. 
At the inventorship level, the order of inventors does not follow any specific sequence and is not 
based on contributions, status or other characteristics of inventors.  
Female authors are as central as their male peers in their authorship network and are more central 
than their male peers in their inventorship network, showing that women in both networks are as 
or more collaborative than their male peers. Moreover, the share of collaboration with women (FF 
and FM collaborations) is increasing over time in the co-authorship network, whereas single-
gender collaborations (FF and MM collaborations) are increasing in the inventorship network. 
Women are forming more gender-balanced teams in their authorship and inventorship 
collaborations. More than 52% of female authors include at least one female researcher in their 
co-authorship teams, while 45% of male authors collaborate exclusively with their male peers. The 
fraction of female inventors who form mixed-gender collaborative teams is similar to that of 
53 
female inventors who collaborate only with men. 58% of male inventors collaborate only with men 
and do not include any female inventors in their collaborative teams. However, actors, regardless 
of their gender and their type (author, inventor, or A-I) are more productive when involved in a 
mixed-gender team.  
The visualization of networks of co-authorship and co-inventorship reveals that women authors 
are more central when they are located in small clusters in a co-authorship network, whereas they 
are more central when located in the giant component in the inventorship network. Hence, 
collaboration with women is higher when they are located in smaller clusters and collaborate with 
highly central male authors. This could be explained by the degree of specialization of the 
researchers. In the co-authorship network, when women are highly specialized and located in small 
clusters, the number of potential collaborators is very limited, and therefore, it might be more likely 
that women are selected as collaborators for co-authored papers. However, the co-inventorship 
network is more male-dominated and patents are more specialized and technical than articles. 
Therefore, women are more central when located in the giant component where the highest share 
of researchers is involved. This might give women a higher chance of collaborating with central 
male inventors, which might lead to more recognition and therefore more opportunities for 
collaboration.  
These results can inform Canada’s (still limited) policies to support women in science and 
technology, like NSERC’s focus on the development and implementation of strategies to increase 
participation of women in STEM fields as students and professionals. These policies tend to 
overlook collaboration issues. Supporting female scientists in their collaborations is not a specific 
focus area, and is only incorporated into policies in terms of general national and regional 
networking strategies for female scientists (NSERC 2010). Moreover, there is no specific policy 
in Canada (at national, regional or institutional levels) which focuses on gender equity in 
nanotechnology. This study can serve as an input for data-driven analyses by policymakers to 
prioritize actions that correct the gender imbalance in collaborative teams working on pro-poor 
nanotechnologies. If policies can be implemented that encourage researchers to form 
collaborations with female scientists and that support participation of women in pro-poor areas, 
then Canada can contribute to its R&D investments in terms of both economic and social 
54 
development by simultaneously addressing two of the main equity concerns connected to 
nanotechnology.  
3.5.1- Research limitations and prospects for future research 
Authorship order is only a proxy for contribution and seniority of authors. For example, the last 
author might mistakenly receive credit as a primary investigator of the research project, while in 
reality, that author might actually be the person who made the least contribution. In some 
authorship practices, a lead (first) author or a middle author is responsible for correspondence, 
who might be a graduate student or a junior researcher. Hence, in these cases, the corresponding 
authorship is not necessarily associated with seniority or directorship of a project. Therefore, there 
is no common indicator to consistently identify and evaluate the characteristics of a group leader 
on a given scientific publication, but authorship order is the best proxy we have. Another limitation 
of this research is that women only account for 13% of all inventors involved in pro-poor nano-
papers, which results in a low share of FF inventorship collaborations. Therefore, the repetition 
rate for this type of collaboration is influenced by the strong collaboration ties of specific female 
scientists at the Xerox Research Centre of Canada.  
This research focuses on two main equity challenges of Canadian nanotechnology (gender and 
pro-poor potential). It thus provides a baseline for future studies addressing equity concerns in 
other emerging technologies and in other national contexts. As this body of work expands, it can 
serve policymakers and research managers to help ensure that emerging technologies lead to more 
just societal outcomes.

Chapter 4 - Article 3: What factors influence equity challenges of Canadian nanotechnology? Implications for pro-
poor and gendered innovation 
What factors influence equity challenges of Canadian nanotechnology? 
Implications for pro-poor and gendered innovation 
Abstract 
Gender equality and pro-poor innovation are important dimensions of inclusive and responsible 
research and innovation. Based on bibliometric and survey data of nanotechnology researchers in 
Canada, this paper analyzes how gender interacts with key scientific, cultural and social factors to 
influence scientific productivity, and how these same factors influence the degree to which 
Canadian nanotechnology research is targeted towards issues facing poor communities. The 
findings show that the gender productivity gap remains a challenge in the field, and that these gaps 
are reinforced by the fact that the most productive researchers are less likely to collaborate with 
women. The results also show the amount of extra effort that women must devote to their research 
to retain their top status in academia, and the extent that their recognition when in top positions is 
fragile compared to men. This study also confirms the cumulative advantage of creating a gender-
inclusive culture that enables women to improve their scientific productivity and impact: such 
cultures tend to privilege first-author publications over patenting, and thus prioritize a type of 
output where women have had more success. Finally, this paper acknowledges the importance of 
leading and promoting research and innovation in pro-poor areas, as it holds the potential to 
promote the economic development both within and between nations.

4.1- Introduction 
Researchers generally use the term “gendered innovations” to discuss the integration of gender 
analysis into all phases of research, and specifically utilizing gender analysis as a resource to fuel 
new discoveries and the development of new technologies (Schiebinger 2014). Gender equality is 
becoming a high priority in responsible research and innovation (RRI) frameworks based on the 
idea that gendered innovations can be a catalyst for excellence in science and technology, 
improving science by removing gender bias from scientific discoveries (Rifà-Valls et al. 2013). 
Schiebinger (2007) introduces three separate but interrelated levels of analysis to understand 
gender issues in science, which also represent three approaches to try to achieve gender equality: 
(1) Fix the numbers of women: participation of women in science; (2) Fix the institutions: gender 
in the cultures of science and engineering; and (3) Fix the knowledge: gender in the results of 
science.  
Our theoretical framework utilizes these three levels of analysis to better understand current gender 
inequalities within the nanotechnology workforce of a nation, whether the current culture and 
structure of nanotechnology research will alleviate or deepen these gender inequalities. This paper 
applies a gender dimension to questions of who are the drivers of nanotechnology scientific 
innovations and who are most likely to profit from scientific reward system in nanotechnologies, 
on the assumption that providing more equitable context for women to engage, retain and thrive 
in nanotechnology sciences, help to thrive gendered innovations and improves nanotechnology 
sciences.  
In addition, our framework also considers the concept of nano-divide (Smith 2001) used in the 
inclusive innovation framework15, which signifies that unequal access to nanotechnology 
innovation could precipitate a divide between countries and individuals, exacerbating existing 
disparities between poor and rich countries, and between privileged and marginalized groups. If 
the nano-divide can be overcome, nanotechnology has the potential to drive sustainable 
development in poor nations and could greatly contribute to the development of pro-poor 
technologies. 
                                                        
15 Inclusive innovation is defined as any innovation that “seeks to expand affordable access to quality basic goods and 
services for excluded populations – primarily those at the “Base of the Pyramid” (World Bank 2013 p. 8). 
58 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, the literature on gendered and inclusive 
innovations is reviewed in order to provide a theoretical framework of the study. The 
methodological details of the survey and bibliometric analysis of Canadian researchers involved 
in nanotechnology R&D are then provided. The findings section explore gender disparities in 
scientific productivity and impact; and identify factors that exacerbate or alleviate these disparities, 
and are followed by a discussion and a conclusion on the policy implications of these results. 
4.2- Literature Review 
4.2.1- Fix the numbers of women: Participation of women in science 
Schiebinger’s (2007) first level of analysis looks into increasing women’s involvement in science 
and engineering fields, by studying the experiences of women in university, governmental labs 
and industry and proposing programs (e.g., funding allocation to women scientists) to ensure that 
women succeed in these fields. At this level, gender issues are described in the context of the so-
called “glass ceiling” and “leaky pipeline”. The concept of “glass ceiling” (Hymowitz & 
Schellhardt 1986) describes gender barriers that preclude women from being represented at high-
level positions, and the “leaky pipeline” (Berryman 1983) describes how more women than men 
leave the scientific profession at every educational and career stage. UNESCO (2007) associates 
(1) the occurrence of these concepts and lack of representation of women in senior positions with 
cultural factors such as work-life balance and (2) gendered approaches to the scientific reward 
system, including productivity, performance, and promotion. These factors emanate from 
traditional masculine discourse prevalent in the academic career system, where (3) women 
consistently need to work harder to compensate for being a women and to be recognized as 
professionals (Dryburgh 1999) and to overshadow the in/visibility paradox (Faulkner 2006)—
whereby women are visible as women but invisible as professionals. The aforementioned three 
points (1, 2, and 3) are incorporated in this study as follows: 
4.2.1.1- Level of seniority, and the phenomenon of leaky pipeline and glass ceiling  
Academic positions and level of funding are often postulated as factors associated with promotion 
and level of seniority in science, and the underrepresentation of women in senior roles (both in 
terms of ranking and funding) are often explained by the challenges of the leaky pipeline and the 
glass ceiling (Bowman & Ulm 2009; McDowell et al. 1999). Studies confirm the lower propensity 
59 
of women to reach high-level academic ranks (Besselaar & Sandström 2017; Mayer et al. 2017; 
McDowell et al. 1999) and an increased gender gap in productivity as academic rank increases 
(van den Besselaar & Sandström 2016). However, no significant gender differences in citation 
impact have been shown across academic positions (van den Besselaar & Sandström 2016). Higher 
association of women to lower academic positions negatively affects their productivity, initiating 
a vicious cycle which finally leads to the lower rank and status for women (van den Besselaar & 
Sandström 2017).  
These differences are also observed at the level of funding. Women, in general, receive lower 
research funding than men (Bowman & Ulm 2009; Larivière et al. 2011), while funding positively 
influences the productivity of researchers (Ebadi & Schiffauerova 2016; Tahmooresnejad & 
Beaudry 2015) and scientific impact of publications (Jowkar et al. 2011; Wang & Shapira 2015). 
Therefore, women’s lower funding performance might result in lower productivity and impact, 
which reinforces attainment of lower levels of funding for women. In accordance, academic 
ranking and level of funding are factors that can illuminate or debilitate women’s progression in 
science. 
4.2.1.2- Gendered approaches to productivity, performance, and promotion 
The persistence of gender differences in scientific productivity despite the numerous efforts to 
alleviate these differences is referred to as the ‘productivity puzzle’ (Cole & Zuckerman 1984). 
Women account for less than 30% of scientific authorships (Larivière et al. 2013b), and their 
papers receive fewer citations when controlling for disciplines, journal impact factor (Larivière & 
Sugimoto 2017), authorship order, and different types of collaborations (Larivière et al. 2013b). 
Productivity and citation rates are of particular importance as they indicate a baseline according to 
which a researcher is awarded among his/her scientific community, regarding hiring, 
reappointment, tenure, promotion, funding allocation (Holden et al. 2005) and salary 
(Toutkoushian 1994). Gender differences in these attributes highlight the disadvantaged position 
of women in their scientific community and their struggle to receive adequate recognition for their 
work, and indicate how being a woman can be a contributing factor to cumulative disadvantages 
in a scientific career. This study takes into account scientific output (number of publications per 
active year) as the measure of productivity of a researcher, and scientific impact (number of 
citations per active year) to better analyze to what extent a scientist is influential and is recognized 
60 
among his/her scientific community. Scientific productivity and impact are considered in this study 
as determinants of scientific performance. 
While self-citations are an inevitable part of scientific research that reflects the cumulative nature 
of ones’ research, they can also artificially inflate citation rates and raise the position of authors 
among their scientific community (Costas et al. 2010; Glänzel et al. 2006) and might, in turn, 
positively influence productivity. Gendered studies on self-citations have shown that men cite 
themselves at a higher rate than women (Ghiasi et al. 2016; Hutson 2006; King et al. 2015). These 
trends have been associated with gender differences in self-promotion. Our analysis looks into 
gender differences in self-citations to see whether it can affect the gender gap in productivity and 
impact. We use self-citation indicators introduced in Costas et al. (2010), which classifies 
indicators into share of internal (vs. external) citations and share of author (vs. co-author) self-
citations.  
4.2.1.3- Additional level of effort in research 
Achieving a higher rate of patenting and of first-author production both represent involvement in 
higher prestige research and leadership roles, and thus account for accomplishments of a researcher 
(Azoulay et al. 2007; Wilson et al. 2012), but with one major difference: there are fewer 
opportunities for women to be socialized into networks that lead to being a patentee (Murray & 
Graham 2007) and women patent at significantly lower rates than men (Ding et al. 2006). On the 
other hand, first-authorship is more coveted by women: when a female scientist contributes to a 
paper, she is more likely to be the first author than the last-author (Pierson 2014), which might 
relate to the fact that women lead the papers that they author. The gender gap is also higher in 
inventorship (~89%) (Sugimoto et al. 2015) than in first authorship (~60% to ~70%) (Filardo et 
al. 2016; Rexrode 2016). Therefore, women need to work considerably harder to reach the same 
opportunities as their male peers in patenting (Mongeon 2017). Following the argument of 
(Dryburgh 1999; Faulkner 2009), this study shares the assumption that women in male-dominated 
fields are required to work harder and devote extra efforts than men to compensate being a woman 
and prove their competency. Hence, a higher rate of first-authored publications and a higher rate 
of patenting are associated with a researcher’s additional level of effort. This study assumes that 
authorship order in nanotechnology is contribution-based, according to which first-position 
authors are often leading the experimental work (Larivière et al. 2016; H. Moed 2000). This 
61 
assumption is derived from the fact that contribution-based ordering in authorship is becoming a 
common practice in experimental sciences (Clement 2013), whereas alphabetical ordering is 
declining and is merely confined to some disciplines such as mathematics, economics or high-
energy physics (Costas & Bordons 2011; Waltman 2012). 
4.2.2- Fix the institutions: Gender in the cultures of science and engineering 
Gendered policies in science and engineering generally advocate for an increase in the number of 
women in science to remedy inequality and fix the issues caused by the leaky pipeline and glass 
ceiling. These policies typically place great emphasis on attracting more women into scientific 
fields and pay less attention to the workplace cultural factors that create gender biases both in 
numbers and scientific experiences (Bagilhole et al. 2008; Etzkowitz & Gupta 2006; Faulkner 
2006). This sheds light on the importance of culture, which includes institutions, regulations, 
norms, values and implicit assumptions of a given society. The creation of masculine academic 
and organizational cultures impinges on women’s participation and advancement in science, and 
affects their reputation as professionals in science and engineering fields. Some important cultural 
factors to allay these concerns are identified in Buré (2007), among which are (1) networking and 
social capital, (2) proportion of men and women in teams, (3) work-life balance, (4) support and 
gender inclusive policies. This research also considers these workplace cultural factors (1, 2, 3, 
and 4).  
4.2.2.1- Networking and social capital 
Networking and collaboration among researchers can be measured through co-authorship patterns. 
The number of co-authors is shown to be highly associated with the productivity (Fanelli & 
Larivière 2016) and citation count (Biscaro & Giupponi 2014; Uddin et al. 2013) of a researcher. 
Gender differences in collaboration patterns have shown that women are less involved in sole-
author publications and thus have a higher propensity to collaborate (Hunter & Leahey 2008; Ozel 
et al. 2014). However, women are shown to have a fewer number of distinct collaborators than 
men (Bozeman & Corley 2004; Cole & Zuckerman 1984). Furthermore, women are more involved 
in interdisciplinary research collaborations (Rhoten & Pfirman 2007; Van Rijnsoever & Hessels 
2011) and have fewer international collaborators (Rosenfeld & Jones 1987). Nanotechnology, as 
an interdisciplinary field, might provide more collaboration opportunities for women than 
established engineering fields, physics or chemistry. Therefore, gender differences in co-
62 
authorship collaborations present an important factor when considering social capital and 
networking opportunities of researchers, and the networking rate is measured by distinct number 
of co-authors (per active year) in this study. 
4.2.2.2- Proportion of men and women in teams 
Researchers, regardless of their gender, form their collaborations around men (Bozeman & Corley 
2004; Ghiasi et al. 2015; Knobloch-Westerwick & Glynn 2013) and the repetition rate for these 
collaborations are lower for women than men (Ghiasi et al. 2015; Villanueva-Felez et al. 2015). 
However, women include a higher share of other women in their teams compared to their male 
peers (Bozeman & Corley 2004; Ghiasi et al. 2015). Since researchers who collaborate largely 
with women are less cited and less recognized among their scientific community (Catherine 
Beaudry & Larivière 2016), this share drops as women’s academic rank increases (Bozeman & 
Corley 2004). Hence, this study considers share of female co-authors to indicate the proportion of 
men and women in teams. 
4.2.2.3- Work-life balance 
The scholarly literature on work-life balance suggests that academics of both genders face similar 
challenges. However, because of the pressure created by social norms around motherhood, women 
curtail their career prospects more readily and experience more stress related to a work-life balance 
compared to men (Conley & Carey 2013; Mason et al. 2013; Ward & Wolf-Wendel 2012; Wilton 
& Ross 2017). Female academics are often saddled with more domestic and childcare 
responsibilities, and their careers—when measured by their publication records—are slowed down 
or even halted (Forster 2001). However, childrearing is shown to have no effect (Cole & 
Zuckerman 1987; Long 1990; Reskin 1978; Sax et al. 2002) or positive effect (Astin & Davis 
1985; Beaudry & St-Pierre 2016; Fox & Faver 1985) on the productivity of women academics. 
These results are further explained by the association of childrearing with a degree of maturity that 
cannot successfully be captured by the age of the researcher (Beaudry & St-Pierre 2016), and 
incorporation of other factors, including age and dependency of children (Fox 2005; Sax et al. 
2002; Stack 2004). However, compared to male academics, the increase in productivity is 
significantly lower for female academics (Beaudry & St-Pierre 2016).  
63 
Along these lines, the issue of dual-career couples is one of the main focuses of studies on work-
life balance in academia, as more women than men are in dual-career relationships (Tzanakou 
2017). Employment within close geographical proximity or in the same institution is one of the 
primary concerns for dual science career couples (Obakeng Mabokela 2011). However, women 
are more challenged to secure their career advancement, career mobility and work-life balance, 
and are more likely to interrupt their careers to follow a spouse or a partner, considering jobs that 
do not suitably align to their qualifications (Becker & Moen 1999; Ferber & Huber 1979; Rusconi 
& Solga 2008; Cooke 2007). Therefore, partnering—which is lamentably not often considered in 
science and technology policies—is at least as crucial a factor as parenting in women’s career 
progression, because being in a dual career household disfavors women’s careers in academia 
(Ackers 2004). This paper determines the level of work-life balance by examining parenthood 
stage and by using scales for difficulties a researcher faces in balancing work and personal life, 
and in managing his/her career because of his/her spouse/partner career. 
4.2.2.4- Support and gender inclusiveness 
The growing representation of women in male-dominated professions does not necessarily imply 
greater integration of women into organizations. Because of their scant representation in certain 
fields and professions, women are often excluded from informal ties and relationships (Kanter 
1977). The exclusion of women affects their social integration, which is often measured by the 
level of support and encouragement from their colleagues (Wallace 2014). This is provided by 
Kanter’s (1977) concept of tokenism, which emphasizes the additional stresses experienced by 
those in a minority group (i.e., tokens) due to their numerical or proportional underrepresentation 
in certain organizations or professions, including isolation and exclusion from social and 
professional networks. In this regard, Taylor (2010) found that women in male-dominated 
occupations receive lower levels of support from colleagues and supervisors, highlighting 
structural barriers that hinder women’s career progression and success. The creation of a gender-
inclusive culture can help overcome these barriers and encourage career progression of both 
genders (Cartwright & Gale 1995; Sharma & Sharma 2012). Hence, this paper incorporates 
positive treatment from colleagues, women’s representation in the workplace, and lack of gender-
inclusive culture as crucial factors to better understand the culture of the nanotechnology research 
system. 
64 
4.2.3- Fix the knowledge: Gender in the results of science 
The third level refers to how gender analysis can enhance knowledge production in science and 
engineering, noting that gender is a factor that shapes the content of science and can open new 
research avenues. Schiebinger & Klinge (2013) detailed state-of-the-art methods of sex and gender 
analysis, and introduced several case studies in different fields, including nanotechnology, to 
demonstrate how the incorporation of gender analysis into research can result in the development 
of new knowledge and technologies, which is being referred to as gendered innovations. 
(Schiebinger 2008) considered this level crucial for efforts to recruit and retain women in science, 
in the sense that, increasing the number of women in scientific professions opens the way to 
reconceptualize science and engineering research.  
This paper incorporates the third level in the sense that it advocates a more comprehensive 
definition of nano-divide than is generally adopted in the context of inclusive innovation: divides 
between who will and will not have access to, profit from, benefit from, and control the 
nanotechnologies (Sparrow 2007). Nano-divide is conventionally studied to address the concerns 
around divides between developed and developing nations, or poor and rich 
communities/individuals (Daar et al. 2004; Moore 2002; The Royal Society 2004). This study 
looks into this concern not only from an inclusive innovation (more specifically, economic 
development) perspective, but also from a gender perspective and pays attention to two questions 
relevant to the nano-divide: (1) how developed and developing nations benefit from 
nanotechnology R&D differently, and (2) how men and women profit from nanotechnology R&D 
differently.  
In sum, the approach of this study is informed by (Schiebinger 2008) framework of gendered 
innovations, and incorporates its three approaches to gender inequality to provide a comprehensive 
cross-gender analysis of Canadian nanotechnology scientific publications and impact. It further 
identifies the most important scientific, cultural and social attributes and factors that exacerbate or 
reduce gender discrepancies in scientific production and impact, considering both bibliometric and 
sociodemographic indicators. This study applies the exploratory approach to further develop and 
contribute to gendered aspects of science, technology and innovation policy discourse. This study 
also considers the inclusive innovation framework and determines influencing scientific factors on 
scientific productivity and impact of researchers involved in pro-poor nanotechnology research. 
65 
4.3- Methods 
4.3.1- Data 
In this paper, nanotechnology researchers are identified using an all-nanotechnology article dataset 
developed by (Barirani et al. 2013; Moazami et al. 2015; Tahmooresnejad et al. 2015). This dataset 
is gathered from the Scopus database, which claims to provide a comprehensive coverage of 
scientific publication data from 1996 (Elsevier 2016) and provides a larger journal coverage 
compared to Web of Science (Mongeon & Paul-Hus 2016). One of the advantages Scopus presents 
over other comprehensive publication databases, top among which is Web of Science, is its unique 
author identifier for each author. The Scopus Author identifier is a unique ID assigned to each 
author, based on which information on an author’s research output can be obtained, including list 
of publications, citation metrics, current and previous affiliations, number of co-authors and the 
like.  
7,343 authors are identified in the dataset who have at least one affiliation to a Canadian institution 
and who published more than two publications in the field of nanotechnology over the years 1996-
2011. In order to gather a list of researchers to whom to send the questionnaire, the email address 
of a researcher is identified by the email address listed on the most recent publication where the 
researcher is designated as a corresponding author by referring into the researcher’s Scopus author 
profile (using Scopus Author Identifier). If not available, then the email was obtained by referring 
to the researcher’s academic and professional profiles (e.g., personal websites, LinkedIn profiles, 
affiliated institution website, etc.). In the end, the questionnaire was sent to 6,606 valid email 
addresses, and 523 valid responses (out of 674 total) were collected. These 523 researchers 
identified themselves as active researchers in nanotechnology in Canada, and their bibliographical 
data was further collected by the use of their Scopus Author ID. Total number of publications, 
total number of citations, number of self-citations from all authors, number of self-citations from 
the selected author, number of co-authors, number of first-authored publications and year of first 
and last publication (as of March 2016) are further assigned to each respondent. Data on patents 
was further collected through a manual search of United States Patent and Trademark Office 
(USPTO). For this purpose, first, the researcher’s name, province, and country are matched with 
the inventor’s, and second, similarity between abstract, title and subject area of their patents and 
their scientific papers are verified. Data for funding is collected through Natural Sciences and 
66 
Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council (SSHRC) awards databases. Therefore, funding in this research refers to the governmental 
funding awarded to the researchers in their scientific careers. 
Gender is further assigned to respondents using the gender-checker name and gender database16. 
For those whose gender remain unidentified or unisex, gender was assigned manually, using online 
academic or professional profiles. The numbers of female and male respondents are, respectively, 
92 and 431. The maximum number of co-authors recorded in Scopus is 150, and most of the 
respondents had high numbers of co-authors (mean=91.56 and median=93), and the first names of 
some of the co-authors were not listed in the Scopus. Therefore, the share of female co-authors in 
this study is the proportion of women among main co-authors of the selected author. Scopus lists 
co-authors by the number co-authored publications with the selected author, which is also referred 
to as the level of loyalty in this study. Therefore, for co-authors, gender is assigned to at least top 
15 loyal co-authors of a selected author to cover, at a minimum, the top 10% of major co-authors.  
The questionnaire entails two dimensions to understand nanotechnology equity challenges: (1) 
facts and (2) perceptions. The former involves attributes and demographic information of active 
nanotechnology researchers, including their level of funding, academic ranking, parenthood and 
the like. The latter addresses inequalities through perceptions of researchers by posing six Likert-
type questions, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The first question directly 
addresses the nano-divide and the pro-poor aspect of Canadian nanotechnology and the other 
questions highlight both gendered and general aspects of workplace culture that can hinder the 
scientific development of nanotechnologies. 
4.3.2- Model 
This paper has two dependent variables: traditional research output measured by the number of 
peer-reviewed documents (indexed in Scopus) per career age, as well as the total number of 
citations per career age. The former is a measure of scientific productivity of a researcher, whereas 
the latter is associated with the research impact and indicated to what degree a scientist is 
influential and recognized by his/her scientific community. The two dependent variables present

two criteria by which researchers are rewarded. In this study, career age is measured by the number 
of years between last and first publications of a scientist. The dependent variables are better 
represented by a log-normal distribution, due to the skewness of their distributions. Since the 
natural logarithm of these variables follows a normal distribution, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 
regression modeling is applied in this study.  
Table 4.1 presents a list of independent variables, their descriptions, their mean for each gender 
and the significance level of differences between male and female researchers. Two measures of 
the distorted normal distribution, namely kurtosis and skewness, are calculated for each of the 
continuous independent variables to ensure that their distributions are closest to normal. The 
variables with large kurtosis or skewness are further transformed using either natural logarithm or 
inverse function, verifying that the distribution of the independent variables is closest to the normal 
distribution. Models are therefore expressed as:

All explanatory continuous variables in the models are transformed using the z-scores in order to 
minimize the multicollinearity problems. Table 4.2 verifies that the correlation coefficient among 
independents variables is very low, and variables are not correlated. The moderating effects of 
gender and questionnaire measures of facts and perceptions are also analyzed. More specifically, 
this study looks into interactions of dFemale, dChildmorethan1, dAcademicRank, dFund (facts) 
and Propoor, Balancediff, TreatPositive, WomenFew, GenderExclusive, Spousediff (perceptions) 
with other continuous variables. These moderating effects help explain whether determinants and 
contributing factors of nanotechnology scientific reward of researchers differ for men and women 
(of different academic rank or funding), and what differences a more equitable context 
(mainstreaming of gender and pro-poor perspectives) exhibit in this reward system.  
Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 reveal robust regression results with significant interaction terms through 
all models. Inverse interpretations are considered for variables with inverse transformation. 
68 
Moderating effects are further plotted in MATLAB to help interpretations, taking into account 
only interacting variables. Therefore, it is important to note that these plots only show differences 
in the trends and hence, are not indicative of definitive quantities. All analyses are descriptive and 
exploratory. This paper considers the threshold of 0.1 as the significance level for regression 
analysis, since this study aims to explore effects and trends rather than to test inferences (similar 
to the approach of Thiriet et al. (2016) for exploring ecological trends). Moreover, it is important 
to clarify that, regression analysis only captures the relationship between the independent and 
dependent variables and does not show the causality of the relationship. Therefore, in this paper, 
impact (or effect) of an independent variable on a dependent variable does not imply any causality 
and merely refers to the degree of association between an dependent and an independent variable. 
4.4- Descriptive results 
Of the 523 respondents, 17.6% were women. Men were associated with older career age and older 
stages of parenthood, which in this paper are determinants of the degree of maturity of a researcher. 
Men were involved in higher rate of nanotechnology scientific production compared to women, 
but no difference in citation impact was found. Considering a researcher’s additional level of 
activities in nanotechnology, there was no significant difference between the numbers of patents 
granted to men and women, while men were involved in higher rate of lead (first) author 
production. Both internal citations and author self-citation rates were not different between the two 
genders (Table 4.1). The perception of nanotechnology culture (Table 4.1) was more masculine 
for women compared to men: women had more difficulties in balancing their career and personal 
life, and they compromised their careers more to support their partner’s career progression. 
Women perceived a lower level of support and positive treatment from their colleagues; they found 
themselves in a more male-dominated field; and they reported a lack of gender-inclusive initiatives 
and culture at a higher rate compared to men (Table 4.1). To better understand the underlying 
reasons behind differences in perceptions for men and women, gender differences in related sub-
factors listed in the questionnaire in the form of close-ended statements are analyzed. Fig. 4.1 
presents the proportion of respondents of each gender who chose the selected sub-factor to the 
number respondents of each gender who chose ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ for the selected Likert-
scale question.

For work and life balance, a higher share of researchers (both men and women) who have difficulty 
in balancing their work and personal life, reported struggling with taking additional work home 
and making time to spend with their families. Geographical constraint on the choice of an 
educational institution was considered as the main stressor for the career progression of dual career 
couples/partners. In general, a higher share of women stated that they live separately from their 
partners and that they needed to interrupt their careers to follow their partners’ relocation.  
Researchers who received support and positive treatment from their colleagues claimed that their 
gender has no impact on their collaboration opportunities and that their comments and suggestions 
are taken seriously by their colleagues. Women in a positive environment felt comfortable asking 
for help from their male colleagues, and they benefit from the scientific advising from their 
colleagues at a higher rate. Moreover, 61% of women reported having the same opportunities as 
their male peers in a supportive environment. Researchers of both genders addressed the lack of 
representation of women among faculty members and research teams in male-dominated fields. 
However, women expressed their concerns over the underrepresentation of women in decision-
making processes and the fact that majority of decisions on their academic status and progress is 
made by their male peers. Among those researchers who identified themselves as working in a 
gender-exclusive culture, gender differences in perceptions were most different: women laid claim 
to fewer supports and opportunities and the need to devote extra effort to fill the same positions as 
their male peers and to be considered as professionals among their peers. However, men perceived 
that the gender-exclusive culture stems from women’s lack of interest in science and engineering 
and the dearth of female role models in nanotechnology. 
4.5- Regression results 
The OLS regression results for the various factors associated with productivity (number of 
publications per career age) of a researcher are presented in Table 4.3, and Table 4.4 exhibits 
regression results for the scientific impact of a researcher (number of citations per career age).  
Total number of patents, number of co-authors per career age, and number of first-authored 
publications per career age are positively associated with scientific productivity and scientific 
impact of nanotechnology researchers. However, a higher share of female co-authors has a 
negative impact on the productivity of researchers (Table 4.3). Yet, as a standalone variable, it 
71 
does not have a significant effect on research impact of a researcher (Table 4.4). This finding is in 
accordance with the effects of gender: being a woman significantly affects research productivity 
(Art-3) but presents no significant effect on the citation impact of a researcher. Therefore, as 
women are significantly less productive, researchers who collaborate mainly with a higher share 
of women are also associated with lower scientific productivity. These gender disparities represent 
one of the main gender equality issues in the nanotechnology field that, if not addressed, might 
form a vicious circle that excludes women from the nanotechnology scientific community. 
Share of internal citations has no significant effect17 on productivity and a negative significant 
effect on the total scientific impact of a researcher (Table 4.4). A higher share of author self-
citations is associated with higher productivity (Table 4.3) and scientific impact of a researcher 
(Table 4.4- (Cont’d18)). This shows that the more internally a researcher “receives” citations, the 
lower is the impact of a researcher. However, the more author self-citations (rather than co-author 
self-citations), the more influential (i.e., a researcher with high citation impact) and productive a 
researcher is. This highlights the value of self-promotion on boosting one’s research impact. These 
findings confirm those of (Costas et al. 2010) which found that the share of internal citations 
decreases as total impact of the paper increases and author self-citations increases as the 
productivity and academic rank grows.  
This study also confirms that higher rate of internal citations does not play a positive role in 
inflating a scientist’s overall citation impact. However, it shows that author self-citations do. 
Therefore, author self-citations are associated with an author’s citation impact and could present a 
considerable challenge to decision making for rewarding nanotechnology researchers. A higher 
percentage of author self-citations among productive and more established researchers might occur 
because these authors have more publications to cite.  
However, these aforementioned independent variables show different patterns of effects when 
interacting with gender, academic rank and the questionnaire measures.  
                                                        
17 Note that share of internal citations becomes significant in Table 4.3 when academic rankings of researchers of each 
gender are added to the model (Art-1, Art-4).  
18 Note that share of author self-citations becomes not significant in Table 4.4 when academic rankings of researchers 
of each gender are added to the model (Cit1-Cit8).

4.5.1- Questionnaire results: Facts 
4.5.1.1- Academic ranking 
Male full professors publish significantly more than men and women of any academic ranking. 
Moreover, the regression results reveal that female researchers who are not professors publish 
significantly less than male and female full professors19 (Art-1). The differences in scientific 
impact are not significant between the research impact of women in tenured or tenure-track 
positions and male full professors (Cit-1). Moreover, there is no significant difference between the 
overall scientific impact of female and male researchers who are not in tenured (-track) positions 
(Cit-1).  
Although women in tenured or tenure-track positions are significantly less productive than male 
full professors (Art-1)20, the scientific impact of their research is not different from that of male 
full professors (Cit-1). This finding complies with the selection effect, according to which in male-
dominated disciplines where women face greater career risk to pursue their academic career, 
female faculty have equal or higher publication impact (Duch et al. 2012; Ghiasi et al. 2015) and 
the gender gap in impact is less conspicuous than in productivity. 
The lower productivity of female researchers shows that women who are not in tenured or tenure-
track positions, including postdocs or researchers (with a Ph.D. degree) who are affiliated to 
industry or governmental agencies, are less productive (weakly significant) than their male peers 
(men of the same ranking). While no significant difference is found for the publication impact of 
researchers of each gender, when these female researchers become involved in patenting, they 
surpass their male peers (men who are not in tenured or tenure-track positions) in terms of scientific 
impact (Cit-2). On the other hand, although higher first-author productivity positively affects the 
scientific impact of researchers of any gender and academic ranking, it benefits female researchers 
who are not in tenure-track professorship positions at a weakly significantly lower rate than that 
of male full professors (Cit-4). These types of differences might affect the opportunity of women 
to get into the tenure-track faculty positions. Because although higher rate of the first-author 
                                                        
19 Male full professors and men with high level of funding are considered as the reference category in the regression 
results included in this study. However, the significance level has been verified for other cohorts being considered as 
the reference category.  
20 The significance level for female full professors is weak. 
74 
production and patenting, both, are associated with making extra effort in scientific activities in 
this paper (which was addressed in section 2), it is more difficult for women to become involved 
in patenting activities in nanotechnologies (Meng 2016)—as gender disparities in patenting is 
more conspicuous than in first-author publications. Female assistant and associate professors are 
less productive than male full professors. However, a higher rate of patenting and first-author 
productivity exacerbates this productivity gap (at a weak significance level) (Art-1). The impact 
of patenting is even negative for female junior faculty. This highlights the disadvantaged position 
of female junior professors, in the sense that they benefit less from first-author productivity and 
there is a productivity payoff for being an inventor. 
Although a higher number of co-authors positively affect the total impact of nanotechnology 
scientists, it favors publication impact of female junior professors less than men of any academic 
rankings (Cit-3)21. This also confirms another hindrance for female junior professors: networking 
and collaboration privilege female junior professors significantly less than male researchers of any 
academic ranking in terms of recognition and scientific impact. On the other hand, when female 
junior professors co-author more papers with a higher share of female researchers, their research 
becomes more recognized and presents more impact (Cit-5) (at a weak significance level). This 
might be associated with women’s propensity to collaborate with other female scientists (Ghiasi 
et al. 2015; Ozel et al. 2014) and shows that high impact junior professors include a higher share 
of female researchers in their co-authorship collaborations. However, as women climb in academic 
ranks, they might comply with the male-dominated system and share of female co-authors, thus, 
exhibits no impact on the total impact of the female full professors. 
Female full professors who are involved in patenting are significantly more influential than men 
of any academic ranking (Cit-2)22.This also can be explained by the selection effect. Women need 
to be highly competent in their work in order to break the glass ceiling to reach top positions in 
academia and also become involved in patenting, a male-dominated scientific activity. 
                                                        
21 This difference is weakly significant for male assistant and associate professors. 
22 This difference is weakly significant for male full professors.  
 
 
75 
Internal citations are associated with the lower scientific impact of a researcher. However, it 
significantly disfavors female full professors more than any other cohorts (except male assistant 
and associate professors) (Cit-6)23. Women need to be exceptionally competent to climb the 
academic ladder and become full professors (Toren 1988) and women self-cite at a lower rate than 
their male counterparts (King et al. 2016). However, their recognition at the full-ranked position 
could be fragile and dwindle as share of internal citations increases. Therefore, this can be 
interpreted to mean that although women have to work harder and longer and exude extreme 
competency in order to climb in the academic hierarchy (Toren 1988), their recognition in top 
academic positions in the field is fragile, and women are most susceptible to the disadvantages 
internal citations bring to research impact of scientists.  
4.5.1.2- Funding  
In this study, men with high levels of funding (more than 100K) are most productive (Art-2) and 
their research has a higher impact compared to other cohorts24, except for women with low level 
of funding (Cit-8). Women with a low level of funding are involved in (weakly) significantly 
higher impact research than men with low funding and when they become involved in more 
patenting activities, the impact of their work exceeds even that of men with high funding. Since 
patenting is associated with the higher scientific impact of women with low funding, this activity 
might play an important role to boost recognition of women and help them raise more funding. 
Women with a high level of funding are significantly less productive and less influential (at a weak 
significance level) than their male peers. Collaboration with higher number of researchers is 
associated with higher productivity and scientific impact of highly-funded female scientists. This 
notwithstanding, these networking activities (weakly) significantly benefit highly funded men at a 
higher rate. Hence, this disadvantage might play out as a hindrance for women to receive 
recognition and raise further funding. Women on average receive less funding than men (Larivière 
et al. 2011) and often are required to put extra effort to fill the same position and ranking as their 
male peers (Dryburgh 1999; Faulkner 2009). However, their title as a highly funded researcher 
might be altered because they are less productive and influential than men of the similar title. 
                                                        
23 These results are weakly significant for male full professors and female assistant/associate professors. 
24 The difference is weakly significant for women with high level of funding. 
76 
4.5.2- Questionnaire results: Perceptions 
4.5.2.1- Pro-poor research 
The impact of internal citations on productivity is more positive for research activities with strong 
pro-poor orientation (Art-3) (Fig. 4.2a). This is associated with the low number of nanotechnology 
papers in pro-poor areas. The share of nanotechnology-related papers which focus on top three 
pro-poor applications—i.e., energy, agri-food, and water (Salamanca-Buentello, Persad, Martin, 
Daar, Singer, et al. 2005)—to the total number of nanotechnology papers worldwide is less than 
5% (Cozzens et al. 2013). Therefore, scientific discoveries and networks in pro-poor areas are 
limited and highly specialized and productive researchers are more prone to receive citations from 
their direct co-authors (internal citations). However, the impact of author self-citations is positive 
but lower on productivity (Fig. 4.2b) and is negative on scientific impact for researchers involved 
in nanotechnology pro-poor areas (Cit-9) (Fig. 4.3a). This might be due to the differences in the 
scientific reward system of research in pro-poor areas. In pro-poor areas, the focus is more on the 
discovery’s potent promises for developing countries and enforcement of policy reforms (Cozzens 
2010). Traditional indicators, such as citations, might be less important in pro-poor areas and 
author self-citations, therefore, play a trivial role in inflating a researcher’s productivity and 
impact.

citations (internal citations) and (b: right) author self-citations. 
The effect of the number of patents on scientific impact of a researcher is more positive (at a weak 
significance level) for those involved in pro-poor application areas (Fig. 4.3b). Patents are means 
of successful translation of a technology from research into commercialization and product 
77 
development. Patenting in pro-poor areas might help introduce products that have the potential to 
ameliorate the economic gap both within and between nations. Patenting in pro-poor areas thus 
might represent more prestigious research and innovation, which could positively influence the 
scientific impact of a researcher. Since the share of nanotechnology research with pro-poor focus 
is very limited, first-author publications have great importance in conducting high prestige 
research and is associated with a researcher’s higher impact in pro-poor (Fig. 4.3c). 
4.5.2.2- Work and life balance 
The effect of patenting is higher (at a weak significance level) on the productivity of a researcher 
when he/she has difficulties in balancing her/his professional and personal life (Art-4) (Fig. 4.4). 
Patenting, as an additional scientific activity to publishing, is associated with hard work and more 
applicable research, which could potentially result in higher production of research. However, it is 
more difficult for women to enter the patenting process due its male-dominated culture. Therefore, 
patenting’s association with higher productivity of researchers dealing with work-life balance 
might generate gender biases in productivity and benefit men more than women. The findings also 
reveal that difficulties in work-life balance affect women in non-tenure track positions the most. 
Their research impact is significantly lower compared to men of any ranking (Cit-10)25.

middle) patents, and (c: right) first-author production. 
                                                        
25 The difference is weakly significant for male assistant/associate professors and men who are not in tenured or tenure 
track positions.

4.5.2.3- Positive treatment from colleagues 
Receiving positive treatment from colleagues is associated with a researcher’s higher scientific 
impact (at a weak significance level). However, gender plays a moderating effect on the 
relationship between the receipt of positive treatments from colleagues and researcher’s total 
impact, and this effect is adverse for women (Cit-11) (Fig. 4.6a). This also shows that highly cited 
female and male researchers are not treated equally by their colleagues. The receipt of positive 
treatment from colleagues is adversely associated with highly cited women, which might result in 
lower levels of attention and recognition in the longer term, and therefore might leave women 
more vulnerable to retain their recognition as highly cited researchers. The positive impact of the 
first-author production on productivity (Fig. 4.5a) and citation impact (Fig. 4.6b) is lower for a 
researcher who is receiving positive treatments from his/her colleagues (Art-5; Cit-11). In a 
‘positive treatment’ environment, researchers might be less required to devote extra effort to lead 
projects in order to boost their productivity and impact, as opposed to the environments in which 
a researcher is not treated properly. Moreover, the negative impact of share of female co-authors 
on the productivity of a researcher is lower in a positive environment (Art-5) (Fig. 4.5b). This 
means that a positive environment might provide the basis for forming more gender-balanced 
authorship teams—an important factor that might help to break the vicious circle around 
collaboration with women and productivity.  
The positive effect of author self-citations on productivity (Art-5) (Fig. 4.5c) and the negative 
effect of internal citations on scientific impact are stronger (Cit-11) (Fig. 4.6c) in the workplace 
environments where colleagues treat each other positively. This could be associated with the fact 
that positive relationships with colleagues might result in more repetitive collaborations or more 
79 
loyalty with co-authors and a researcher is more likely to be included in his/her co-authors’ or 
colleagues’ lead publications. Hence, a higher level of author self-citations is strongly associated 
with higher productivity of researchers in positive environments. On the other hand, loyalty forms 
a dense local cluster of researchers which adversely affect the knowledge transmission (Zamzami 
& Schiffauerova 2017), which might only promote internal citations rather than receiving external 
citations and recognition from the scientific community. Therefore, the higher share of internal 
citations is highly associated with lower citation impact.

4.5.2.4- Women’s representation in the field 
Given the interdisciplinary nature of nanotechnology, one can posit that it has inherited gendered 
scientific system from various disciplines, ranging from highly male-dominated fields (including 
80 
physics, engineering, and chemistry) to more gender-balanced fields (including health and 
medicine). However, Nanotechnology scientific system is highly male-dominated and women 
represent only 18.9% of nanotechnology authors (Mihalcea et al. 2015). The analyses reveal that 
the impact of first-author productivity (on total productivity) of researchers decreases as their 
workplace becomes more male-dominated. This could relate to the assumption that researchers 
who are located in male-dominated fields might be able to delegate more while researchers in 
gender-balanced fields might be required to work harder and lead more research (higher first-
author productivity) to boost their productivity (Art-6) (Fig. 4.7a). This could be explained by the 
fact that R&D in nanotechnology is intrinsically male-dominated and for those researchers who 
are in a more gender-balanced field, it is required from them to work harder to compensate for the 
differences they are facing in the gendered cultural aspects of their workplace and their research 
community. The highest share of nanotechnology papers is published in journals in the fields of 
materials science, chemistry, physics, biomedical and engineering sciences (Porter & Youtie 
2009b). Cross-citation analysis has shown a higher level of proximity and similarity for the nano-
papers published in highly male-dominated fields (materials, chemistry, physics, and engineering 
fields) on the one hand, and for the nano-papers published in more gender-balanced and less 
productive fields (health and clinical research) on the other hand (Larivière et al. 2013b; Porter & 
Youtie 2009b). Therefore, researchers in less male-dominated disciplines are located in smaller 
and denser co-authorship and citation networks where the share of nanotechnology papers 
produced in these disciplines is limited. Internal citations are inevitable in these fields (because 
there exists only limited relevant of publications to cite) and thus are highly associated with 
productivity of researchers. Therefore, the impact of internal citations is more positive and higher 
for less male-dominated fields (Fig. 4.7b). The positive impact of author self-citations on 
productivity decreases as the researcher’s field become less male-dominated (Fig. 4.7c). This is 
likely related to the fact that men cite their own work at a higher rate than women (Ghiasi et al. 
2016; Hutson 2006; Molly M. King et al. 2016) and women receive a higher self-citation rate from 
their immediate co-authors (Ghiasi et al. 2016). Nanotechnology is thus not unlike other scientific 
fields in this way. Therefore, author self-citations play a more important role in male-dominated 
fields than in more gender-balanced fields. 
81

share of all authors’ self-citations (internal citations), and (c: right) share of selected author self-citations. 
4.5.2.5- Gender exclusive culture 
The effect of gender-exclusive culture on scientific impact of a researcher is negative (Cit-13). The 
existence of gender-inclusive culture conforms to the accommodation of equitable measures in the 
workplace of a researcher. This might expose publications of a researcher (of any gender) to a 
larger community (including both men and women) and hence might reward a researcher with 
increased visibility and recognition. The positive impact of patents on productivity is highest (at a 
weak significance level) for researchers with gender-exclusive workplace culture (Art-7) (Fig. 
4.8a). In this culture, equitable measures are not considered to help women access the same 
opportunities, therefore patenting might be more rewarded and boost researchers’ productivity. 
However, for researchers with gender-inclusive workplace culture, first author production presents 
the strongest impact (at a weak significance level) on productivity (Art-7) (Fig. 4.8b). This culture 
might consider the fact that it is easier for women to be involved in the first-author production 
rather than patenting, and therefore represents a more equitable pathway to achieve the scientific 
reward.  
4.5.2.6- Difficulties in managing career and life partnership 
Difficulties in managing career and life partnership (marriage) significantly negatively affects 
productivity and impact of a researcher (Art-8; Cit-14). Women are facing this difficulty more than 
men in this study (Table 4.1). Therefore, there exists the need to introduce gender-related policies 
to facilitate relocation and employment of the partner/spouse, ensuring that neither the career of 
the scientist nor that of his/her partner/spouse, suffers because of the other’s career.  
82 
 
Figure 4.8- Impact of gender-exclusive culture on scientific production with respect to (a: left) patents and (b: right) first-author 
production. 
The impact of patenting on scientific production of a researcher is higher (at a weak significance 
level) for researchers facing difficulties in managing their career and partnership/marriage. This 
again highlights the fact that these researchers might be required to work harder and get involved 
in patenting in order to be involved in more collaborations and thereby could potentially increase 
their scientific productivity. However, as discussed earlier, it is easier for men to become involved 
in patenting and therefore, the situation could worsen for women without appropriate policy 
actions. On the other hand, the impact of first-author production and networking (collaborating 
with a higher number of co-authors) increases as a researcher’s ability to manage his/her career 
and partnership/marriage increases. These findings are similar to those on gender-inclusive culture 
(section 5.2.5), in the sense that, the introduction of policies to support dual career couples might 
open up a more equitable context (weighting the roles of first-author productivity and 
collaborations rather than patenting) for a researcher to boost his/her productivity.

4.6- Discussion and conclusions 
The purpose of this study is to provide a gender analysis of nanotechnology research and 
development. It develops a model for examining how nanotechnology R&D structures and cultures 
are gendered and might establishe a baseline from which policy changes can be initiated to tackle 
emerging inequities and/or foster equality—all of which are priorities for nanotechnology fields 
(Smith-Doerr 2011). 
Gender differences in the perceptions of scientific culture  
The descriptive results of this study reveal that men were more productive. However, the scientific 
culture of nanotechnology was perceived as more masculine by women than by men. Women 
reported a higher level of difficulties in balancing their career and personal life, either in general, 
or more specifically, in managing their careers because of their spouse/partner’s career 
progression. Finding time for family and leisure, and geographical constraints on the choice of 
institutions with regard to a partner’s career were among the most highlighted factors affecting 
work and life balance. Women perceived a lower level of support and less positive treatment from 
their colleagues, while a higher level of support was associated with equal opportunities for both 
genders and the fact that opinion and comments of a researcher are considered seriously by their 
colleagues. This is in line with the findings of Brainard et al. (2014) who found less informal 
support for nanotechnology female scientists in the US. Women found themselves in a more male-
dominated field and raised the issues of the lack of representation of female faculty in their 
departments and the fact that decisions on their academic progress and status are made majorly by 
their male counterparts. Women also reported a lack of gender-inclusive initiatives at a higher rate 
compared to men. They expressed their concerns about less support and fewer opportunities in 
comparison to their male colleagues, and also about the extra effort they must devote to their work 
to fill the same positions as their male peers and to be perceived as professionals in the field. 
However, men strongly associated a gender exclusive culture with a lack of female role models in 
nanotechnology and women’s lower level of interest to enter this field. These results are coherent 
with previous studies on gender differences in perceptions of workplace climate and career 
development (Brainard et al. 2014; Bronstein & Farnsworth 1998; Gunter & Stambach 2005), 
according to which the climate of science is described as ‘chilly’ for women and that a smaller 
89 
share of women relate their workplace to a positive environment, because they experienced 
negative attitude and exclusion by colleagues, and unfairness in progression processes.  
Influencing factors of the reward system of nanotechnology scientists 
The regression analysis reveals the positive association of number of patents, number of co-authors 
per career age, and number of first-authored publications per career-age on scientific productivity 
and scientific impact of a nanotechnology researcher.  
Gender 
Being a woman is associated with lower scientific productivity of a researcher. Accordingly, a 
higher level of co-authorship collaborations with women also exhibits a negative impact on the 
scientific productivity of a researcher. This might create a negative cycle that results in the 
exclusion of women from co-authorship collaboration teams. This is an area where policymakers 
can explore mechanisms to encourage the inclusion of women in scientific collaborations and 
thereby, to break the cycle. 
Academic rankings 
When controlling for the academic status of researchers, gender differences in scientific impact 
was less conspicuous than in scientific productivity among researchers in tenured or tenure-track 
positions. The findings shed light on the disadvantaged position of female junior faculty (i.e. 
assistant and associate professors), in the sense that their productivity benefits less from first-
author publishing and patenting, and their scientific impact also benefits less from collaborative 
research compared to other types of researchers. These results are in line with the findings of 
Besselaar & Sandström (2017), which suggest that the general lower academic rank of women and 
their lower prevalence in leading roles have a negative impact on their performance which in turn 
reinforces lower academic status. It is also shown that a higher rate of collaboration with female 
co-authors is associated with a larger scientific impact and more recognition for female junior 
professors compared to men of any academic ranking. One possible explanation is that female 
researchers tend to include a higher share of women in their co-authorship collaboration teams 
(Ghiasi et al. 2015) and form stronger ties with them (Ozel et al. 2014). However, as women’s 
status rises in academia, they comply with the system and therefore, the inclusion of a higher rate 
90 
of female (main) co-authors is no longer positively associated with a higher impact for female full 
professors. 
Along these lines, engagement in patenting activities is shown to be positively associated with 
scientific impact of women in top academic ranks (female full professors), and a higher rate of 
internal citations is most adversely associated with their research impact. These results might bear 
witness to the amount of extra effort that women are required to devote to their research to retain 
their top positions in academia (as it is more difficult for women to enter patenting due to its male-
dominant nature) and how their recognition in top positions is susceptible to the disadvantages 
(e.g., internal citation rate) compared to men of any ranking. These results are consistent with the 
reduced opportunities that women have to become a highly productive researcher (compared to 
men), explain the reasons behind the persistence of the glass ceiling in academia, and account for 
invisibility and exclusion of junior female academics from effective and collaborative research. 
These findings highlight the need to develop gender-related policies to shatter the glass ceiling.  
Funding 
Similar results are found when controlling for the level of funding. Involvement in patenting is 
associated with the scientific impact of women with low levels of funding more strongly than their 
male peers, and thus could improve their chances to raise future funding. However, women with 
high levels of funding are less productive and recognized than men with high levels of funding, 
and networking and collaborative research privileges those men more than women. These factors 
might hamper the ability of women to raise further funding and therefore, make it more difficult 
for women to retain their titles as highly funded researchers. Funding is verified to be a driving 
force for scientific performance in Canadian nanotechnology (Tahmooresnejad et al. 2015; 
Tahmooresnejad & Beaudry 2015), and higher scientific performance leads to more funding 
(Ebadi & Schiffauerova 2015). The gender gap in both research performance and funding has the 
potential to exclude women from this virtuous circle and bring more funding opportunities to men 
who already have high levels of funding. These findings help policymakers explore gender-
responsive mechanisms to support women’s involvement in patenting and to help women raise 
funding for research.  
 
91 
 
Work-life balance 
Engagement in patenting is associated with the higher productivity of scientists struggling with 
work-life balance either in general or in the particular case of dual-career couples. However, since 
patenting is a highly male-dominant activity, without gender-related policy actions, patenting 
might advantage men over women, and might increase the gender productivity gap of 
nanotechnology scientists. Difficulties in balancing a career and marriage/partnership, specifically, 
is associated with lower the productivity and scientific impact of a scientist. Organizations and 
academic institutions should be aware of and receptive to the need for policy reforms that support 
dual-career academic partnerships to ensure equal career opportunities for the scientist and his/her 
partner/spouse. 
Supportive and positive environment 
This study confirms that a supportive and positive working environment could contribute to an 
increased recognition and a higher citation impact for a nanotechnology scientist. However, highly 
cited women are treated poorly by their colleagues, while highly cited men are treated positively. 
This might be associated with Kanter’s (1977) ‘tokenism’ phenomenon, highlighting the extra 
pressure token women (women in minority) experience because of their disproportionate 
representation and higher visibility, which often leads to exclusion and isolation from their peer 
group, and ultimately results in low recognition from their community.  
In an isolating and unsupportive scientific environment, first-authorship is strongly associated with 
the higher productivity and citation rate of a scientist. Or, in other words, scientists might be 
required to put extra effort and lead projects to designate themselves as productive and high impact 
scholars in settings where they are not treated properly by their colleagues. On the other hand, in 
a positive and supportive environment, collaboration with women—being measured by the share 
of female co-authors—does not present staggering negative effects on the productivity of a 
researcher and is thus more facilitated. However, this positive setting can potentially place a 
scientist in a denser and smaller co-authorship cluster, where author self-citations also promotes 
the research impact of the scientists affiliated to the cluster and thereby might result in higher rate 
of repetitive collaborations that increase the productivity of a researcher. These repetitions in 
92 
collaborations might pose a barrier for nanotechnology scientists to receive recognition outside 
their immediate collaborators and decrease their overall citation impact.  
Women’s representation in the field 
This paper also reveals that in a more gender-balanced field, the impact of the first-author 
production on the scientific productivity of a scientist is higher. This might be due to the fact that 
the nanotechnology scientific system has accommodated a considerably higher number of men 
than women in both authorship (Mihalcea et al. 2015) and inventorship (Meng & Shapira 2011), 
and therefore, researchers in a more gender-balanced field might need to make more efforts to 
compensate the gendered cultural differences of their workplace and their research community. 
Moreover, higher rate of internal citation is associated with the higher scientific productivity of a 
researcher in gender-balanced fields. This can be explained by the smaller and denser network of 
citations and authorship across more gender-balanced fields (i.e., health and clinical research) 
(Larivière et al. 2013b; Porter & Youtie 2009b). This might yield closer research topics and 
collaborations between nanotechnology scientists, and productive researchers are thus less likely 
to cite nanotechnology research outside their immediate connections. On the other hand, author 
self-citation rate is more associated with increased productivity of nanotechnology scientists 
working in male-dominated fields. This might be related to the higher propensity of men to self-
cite their own papers (King et al. 2016) and greater likelihood for women to receive self-citations 
from their co-authors (Ghiasi et al. 2016). Therefore, in male-dominated fields, author self-
citations are more associated with the productivity rate of a researcher.  
Gender inclusive culture 
This study also confirms the importance of implementing gender-inclusive initiatives in 
institutions, since highly cited scientists are most strongly associated with gender-inclusive 
workplace cultures. Furthermore, the impact of first-author production rate on productivity is the 
highest for nanotechnology scientists conducting research in workplaces with a gender-inclusive 
culture, whereas the impact of inventorship is the strongest for scholars working in a gender-
exclusive culture. This finding illustrate a potential cumulative advantage of the creation of 
gender-inclusive culture, in which first-author productivity is more extensively rewarded than 
93 
patenting, thus reinforcing a more equitable context as it is easier for women to engage in the first-
author production.  
 
Inclusive innovation 
One other important focus of this paper is on nanotechnology inclusive innovation, calling 
attention to the nanotechnology research in the context of developing countries. Results show that 
high impact scientists, who are involved in nanotechnology pro-poor research, are associated with 
a higher rate of first-authorship and inventorship. This acknowledges the importance of leading 
research and innovation in pro-poor areas, as it holds the potential to promote the economic 
development of both developed and developing countries. Moreover, due to the smaller and denser 
cluster of researchers with nanotechnology pro-poor focus (Cozzens et al. 2013), internal citations 
are linked to a higher rate of productivity of these scientists. Additionally, author self-citation rate 
is least valued in scientific productivity and impact of researchers in pro-poor application areas. 
This finding is compatible with the assumption that the reward system in pro-poor nanotechnology 
areas values development and societal impact of scientific discoveries above traditional indicators 
(e.g., h-index, citations, number of papers, and the like) and hence, there is less incentive for 
researchers to cite their own work. These findings could provide a baseline to support policy 
reforms that encourage more research in pro-poor areas and create more innovations that can 
benefit poor communities.  
Prospects for policy development 
This paper lays out a potential policy framework for gender equity and inclusion in Canadian 
nanotechnology. Thus, for the first time, a systematic and comprehensive pro-poor and gendered 
analysis of scientific performance and impact of nanotechnology research is carried out which 
serves as stimulation for further research to incorporate gender equity policies into other emerging 
fields. The study identifies key factors that influence the performance and efficiency of Canadian 
nanotechnology researchers from a pro-poor and gender perspective, and offers policy 
recommendations to expedite development and poverty reductions, and facilitate involvement and 
retainment of women in nanotechnologies.  
94 
4.6.1- Research limitations 
In this study, the scientific productivity of a researcher is measured as a fraction of the total number 
of publications he/she has published, and there is no indication whether all these publications are 
nanotechnology-related. However, all researchers have identified themselves, in the questionnaire, 
as active nanotechnology researchers. This paper measures only first-author productivity (leading 
research) and patenting (inventing) as extra efforts in academic activities. However, last- or 
corresponding authorship might also be associated with the supervisory role of a research project. 
Since there is no official practice in authorship order for assigning the primary investigator (or 
supervisor) of the research project (Tscharntke et al. 2007), last or corresponding authorship could 
be linked to an author who actually has made the least contribution or is only responsible for 
correspondence. Therefore, this paper takes into account only first-authorship as a devotion of 
extra effort into research, because it relates to contributions to the highest proportion of tasks 
performed in a paper (Larivière et al. 2016). Lastly, this study uses an exploratory approach to 
provide a better understanding on potential gender influences on nanotechnology’s scientific 
reward system. Therefore, it includes the effects and trends that have weak (level of) significance 
and the p-value threshold for a statistically significant result is considered at 10

Chapter 5 - Conclusions and Future Work 
Conclusions and Future Work 
5.1- Concluding Remarks 
This thesis addresses two of the priority concerns related to nanotechnology and equity: the lack 
of pro-poor R&D and the scant involvement of women in nanotechnology R&D. The significance 
of this thesis is fivefold: it (1) focuses on nanotechnology at the two priority dimensions of 
inequalities, rich-poor, and gender inequality, both separately and as interrelated. It (2) assesses to 
what extent nanotechnology research and technological efforts of one of the most affluent 
countries, Canada, meet the UN SDGs, presenting scientific and technological productivity and 
impact of pro-poor applications of nanotechnologies. It (3) analyzes women’s contribution to 
scientific and innovative advancements of pro-poor applications of nanotechnologies and maps 
their scientific performance through analysis of their involvement in various collaboration 
networks (co-authorship, co-inventorship, and co-innovation networks). It (4) examines gender 
gap in wage and employment among industries that are the focus of pro-poor nano-innovation in 
the Canadian economy. It (5) identifies key scientific, cultural and social factors that are associated 
with scientific productivity and impact of nanotechnology researchers and examines whether the 
influence of these factors varies across genders. Finally, it (6) proposes implications to promote 
the implementation of both gender equality and poverty alleviation policies in emerging science 
and technologies and new interdisciplinary fields, and thereby improve economic development.  
This research is cutting across several research areas, including but not limited to technology 
management, industrial innovations, labor-market outcomes, social network research, 
bibliometrics and statistics, and social studies of science. Therefore, the contributions of this study 
are conceptual, methodological and empirical, extending the research on relationships of gender, 
pro-poor innovation, collaboration patterns, and scientific and technological productivity and 
impact, and social impact of emerging technologies.

5.1.1- Conceptual Contributions 
This research applies a broader definition of nano-divide that better conveys how underpinning 
divides can occur along multiple dimensions connected to who will and will not have access to, 
profit from, benefit from, and control of nanotechnologies (Sparrow 2007) rather than the 
traditional North-South divide. More specifically, this study also sheds light on the divide 
nanotechnology R&D might precipitate between individuals of each gender (within a nation). The 
idea of a nano-divide is largely studied from an economic development perspective, incorporating 
the context of the divide between developed and developing nations, or poor and rich individuals. 
However, this study conceptualizes the nano-divide from a gender perspective, trying to map the 
divide between genders to better analyze how individuals of each gender profit from 
nanotechnology R&D differently.  
Another contribution is that this study is the first attempt that focuses on two priority dimensions 
of Canadian nanotechnology and inequality, pro-poor innovation and gender inequality, and cross-
cutting relationships between the two dimensions. The cross-dimensional analysis is also high 
importance because these problems interact and a solution to one may exacerbate or benefit the 
other, related inequity concerns and when allayed together can yield system-level benefits. For 
example, if the growth of interest in pro-poor nano-innovation could add to gender biases in the 
scientific workforce, international development efforts could be futile as they affect social 
development of a nation.  
One of the major contributions is that this study introduces a research and development dimension, 
particularly to define the concept of workforce diversity in emerging science and technology 
markets. For disruptive technologies, which are at an incipient stage of development, the main 
focus of the market is on R&D activities rather than production and operations. Therefore, 
scientific research and inventions present important information on companies and industries 
where new knowledge and technology is produced and disseminated. Socioeconomic statistics 
from governments and international organizations provide a context for understanding the potent 
workforce diversity in these companies and industries.  
Moreover, knowledge networks present important information on how gender diversity is 
practiced in collaboration teams. This study re-conceptualizes collaboration from a gender 
97 
perspective, providing a more detailed study of the association between genders and collaboration 
formation, loyalty, and publishing and patenting activities. For this purpose, this study defines 
scientific collaborations based on the gender of scientists and gender diversity in their team of 
collaborators. This is the first study that pays close attention to scientific and technological 
productivity and impact of author-inventors of each gender (researchers who are involved in both 
patenting and publishing in nanotechnologies), whose contributions to knowledge networks are 
crucial as they connect the two communities of authors and inventors.  
Furthermore, this research draws upon the three approaches of “gendered innovation” concept, 
namely ‘fix the number of women’, ‘fix the institutions’ and ‘fix the knowledge’. This study 
introduces factors to operationalize this concept under two themes: facts and perceptions. The 
former considers gender differences in the level of funding, academic rankings, collaborations 
(including collaboration with women), scientific productivity and impact to better understand 
barriers hindering women’s involvement and progression in science and to fix the number. Along 
these lines, this study examines the role of self-promotion and devotion of extra work (and efforts) 
in academic progression and performance of women. Moreover, this study is the first attempt that 
sheds light on the importance of gendered cultural and institutional factors on the scientific 
performance of nanotechnology researchers. These are incorporated as perceptions and are defined 
as the level of work-life balance (which also included the challenges facing dual career couples), 
positive treatment from colleagues, women’s representation in the workplace, and lack of gender-
inclusive culture.  
5.1.2- Methodological Contributions 
The major methodological contribution of this study lies in extending bibliometric methods 
beyond conventional analysis of articles and patents, proposing a novel approach that could be 
applied in a better understanding of the socio-economic impact of an emerging technology. This 
research suggests the use of author affiliation data and patent assignee data to identify companies 
that are actively involved in research and development of a novel technology within an economy. 
It further proposes the use of databases on company and industry information (e.g., Mergent 
Online, LexisNexis Academics) to identify the primary industry classification code (For example 
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), Standard Industrial Classification 
(SIC), or International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC)) associated to each of the selected 
98 
companies, identifying the main industries of focus. Public socio-economic data at the time of (or 
a specific period of) the publication or patent can be further utilized to better analyze labor market 
outcomes. For example, public data on employment and wage across various types of work, 
gender, ethnicity, age, and provinces are provided by Canadian and the US government for each 
class of industry, which are known as Labor Force Survey (LFS) and Current Employment 
Statistics (CES), respectively. This method provides several avenues for the technology impact 
analysis and could provide an estimate for employment and age for groups of people (gender, 
ethnicity, economic class, province of residence, type of job, etc.). This research suggests using 
socio-economic data at the time of the publication or granted patent, ensuring the company was 
active at the time.  
Another methodological contribution of this research is that this research proposes a method for 
the identification of author-inventors. For this purpose, first or middle initials are removed from 
given names. Afterwards, inventors and authors are paired by matching their (main) given names 
and last names. A-Is are identified as those pairs with patent(s) and article(s) similar in title(s) and 
abstract(s)26, or those pairs whose main subject area(s) of publications (in Scopus database) are 
similar to the international patent classification (IPC) code(s) on their patents, or those pairs those 
pairs whose province(s) of their current and previous affiliations in the Scopus database. 
The combination of the methods incorporated in this study—i.e., bibliometrics, social network 
analysis, regression analysis—provides a comprehensive methodological frame to conduct gender 
analysis in scientific workforce, requiring extensive publication and patent data processing, 
analysis, and detailed modeling. More specifically, This study defines province and sector (i.e. 
university, industry, government) of publishing or patenting activity of a researcher, gender of a 
researcher, fractional count of authorship and inventorship of researchers, average rate of citation 
and journal impact of an author, average rate of citation and patent claims of an inventor for the 
extracted publication and patent data. These data and methods provide a strong tool to conduct 
gender analysis of the scientific system and to map gender biases and differences. For example, 
this study incorporates a data-driven approach to reveal the possibility of the existence of 
phenomena of Matilda effect and Selection effect in scientific production, using authorship and 
                                                        
26 In this research, patent paper pairs are identified manually. However, various similarity measures can be applied to 
identify patent paper pairs (for example the method introduced in (Magerman et al. 2015)).  
99 
citation and journal impact data. This study shares the assumption that papers published in higher 
ranked journals are subject to higher citation impact (based on the definition of SJR). Matilda 
effect—systematic underestimation of women’s contribution to science—is thus might be detected 
in gender differences in citation and journal impact. Accordingly, Selection effect—the 
overachievement of women in senior academic positions—could be observed in gender differences 
in authorship, and citation and journal impact.  
Moreover, this study gives a methodological context for studying collaboration patterns of 
scientists. Each edge—a link that connects two authors (or inventors) when they co-author (or co-
invent) together on at least one article (or patent) of the inventorship and authorship network is 
categorized into F-F (a link that connects two female scientists), F-M (a link that connect a male 
scientist to a female scientist) and M-M (a link that connects two male researchers) and pays 
attention to weight of each edge—a measure that shows the number of distinct papers (or patents) 
that the two scientists collaborated together)—as a measure of collaboration repetition rate or 
loyalty to better understand who are the most loyal collaborators of a researcher. These methods 
provide a means of mapping gendered patterns in scientific collaborations. In accordance, this 
study uses Gephi’s Force-Atlas 2 algorithm layout (in which nodes stay closer if they are 
connected, and the distance is defined based on the weight of edges (Bastian et al. 2009)) for 
network visualization, which provides essential context to analyze the network structure and 
visualize location of female (vs. male) researchers within their authorship or inventorship network.  
5.1.3- Empirical Contributions 
The main empirical contribution is that this study informs two priority social concerns around 
nanotechnology research and development: the lack of focus on nano-applications that benefit 
developing nations (pro-poor R&D) and the scant representation of women in nanotechnology 
fields. Moreover, this study put a cross-cutting emphasis on mainstreaming gender-inclusive 
policies into pro-poor policy processes in nanotechnology, based on the assumption that equity 
and equality dimensions are related and development initiatives should have a positive impact on 
issues such as gender equality (OECD 2014b). Therefore, empirical findings are categorized into 
three levels of analysis: the pro-poor dimension, the gender dimension, and cross-dimensional 
analysis. 
100 
5.1.3.1- Pro-poor dimension 
This study shows that the focus on nanotechnology’s prioritized pro-poor application areas—i.e. 
energy, agri-food, and water—is very limited, being reflected in the share of publications and 
patents in these application areas. However, the growth rate of articles in the three pro-poor 
applications is more pronounced than that of all nanotechnology papers, which reveals the 
accelerating focus on scientific advancements of pro-poor technologies. Moreover, the growth rate 
of nanotechnology patents with water applications is slow and less than that of all nanotechnology 
patents, which is contrary to the case of energy and agri-food applications. This shows that 
technological advancements with water application are of low concentration in Canada.  
However, analysis of the survey data shows that higher rate of first-author production and 
patenting activities are highly associated to higher prestige and visibility (measured by citation-
impact) for scientists whose research could potentially improve the livelihood in developing 
countries. These findings confirm that leading research and innovation in pro-poor areas is not 
only rewarding (for nanotechnology researchers), but is of great significance due to its potent 
economic development incentives. This study also proposes that the reward system of scientific 
advancements in pro-poor areas might value societal impacts of the discovery more than traditional 
indicators such as citations, impact factor, h-index and the like. 
5.1.3.2- Gender dimension 
The analysis of survey data, albeit requiring further confirmation, highlighted several gendered 
differences and practices in the nanotechnology scientific system. This study shows that the 
perception of the scientific culture of nanotechnology is more masculine for women in comparison 
to men. Women expressed that they deal with more difficulties in balancing their scientific career 
and personal life, and more specifically, reported that their careers suffered (at a higher rate 
compared to men) in order to manage their spouse/partner’s career advancements. Women 
addressed receiving a lower level of support and positive treatment from their colleagues and found 
themselves in a workplace that overlooks gender inclusive initiatives at a higher rate compared to 
men.  
The findings of this study reveal that women are significantly less productive in nanotechnology 
publishing and a higher rate of co-authorship collaboration with women is associated with lower 
101 
productivity of a researcher. It is of utmost importance to explore policy mecahnisms to address 
these disparities in nanotechnology. Otherwise, they might form a vicious circle that continues to 
disadvantage women. This study also shows that the gender gap in citation impact is less 
conspicuous than in productivity, and women are involved in the same impact research as their 
male peers.  
This research also highlights gender disparities in scientific productivity and impact among 
researchers of different academic rankings and with different levels of funding. The findings show 
that women in junior faculty positions might be disadvantaged because their productivity and the 
impact of their research benefit less from first-author publishing and patenting (extra effort in 
scientific research), and scientific collaborations, respectively.  
Collaborating with a higher share of female co-authors is associated with higher citation impact 
and more recognition for female junior professors compared to men of any ranking. However, as 
women climb the academic rank ladder, they are more likely to comply with the male-dominated 
system and the share of female co-authors, thus, presents no positive association with the total 
impact of the female full professors.  
The results of this study also confirm that women in top academic positions might be required to 
devote extra effort into their research (i.e., become involved in patenting) to become more 
influential than their male colleagues. However, their recognition in top academic positions in the 
field could be fragile, and their recognition in top ranks are most susceptible to negative impacts 
(in this case: negative effects of internal citations).  
Similar results are found when the level of funding is considered. Although women are required 
to show higher competency to raise high levels of funding, their title as a highly funded researcher 
might be altered because they are less productive and influential than men of the similar title. 
Moreover, networking and increases in collaborations could potentially advantage highly-funded 
male researchers over women of the same title in terms of scientific production and impact, which 
could hinder the ability of women to raise further funding. These findings could explain the reasons 
behind women’s lack of career progression in science and the persistence of glass ceiling and leaky 
pipeline phenomena in academia and shed light on the need to develop gender-related policies to 
support women’s career advancements.  
102 
Another important contribution of this study is that it also focuses on gender-related cultural 
factors of nanotechnology research system. In this regard, this research found that patenting is 
associated with the higher productivity of those with difficulty in balancing personal and 
professional lives, both in general and for the particular case of dual-career couples. However, 
since this activity is highly male-dominated and might present more opportunities to men, policy 
reforms are required to explore mechanisms to eliminate the barriers women face in patenting. 
Furthermore, having difficulties in balancing work-life negatively affects the research impact of 
women who are not in tenured or tenure-track positions, which could work to the detriment of 
those female researchers, affecting their promotion or tenure-track hiring processes. 
Another important contribution of this study is that it shows that highly cited women and men are 
not treated equally by their colleagues: highly cited women are treated poorly, while their male 
peers receive support and positive treatment from their colleagues. This is of great significance 
because this might result in isolation and exclusion of high impact female researchers from their 
peer group and thus leads to lower level of recognition in long-term, leaving women dealing with 
more difficulties in retaining their status as a highly cited researcher. 
Nanotechnology is interdisciplinary and representation of women varies across nanotechnology 
fields. This research illuminates that in gender-balanced fields, researchers might be required to 
lead their publications more and work harder to be identified as highly productive researchers. 
This might be due to the fact that these researchers need to compensate gendered cultural 
differences between their workplace and their scientific community. Moreover, author self-
citations is more associated with productive researchers across male-dominated fields than across 
gender-balanced fields, which might be related to the higher propensity of men to self-cite (King 
et al. 2016). 
This research draws attention to the implementation of gender-inclusive policies. Because the 
findings reveal that lack of gender-inclusive culture could results in lower visibility, recognition 
and scientific impact of researchers. Most importantly, it reveals that gender-inclusive culture 
could provide more equitable context to reward scientists and boosts their productivity: this culture 
promotes the first-author production rather than patenting, which is easier for women to become 
involved. 
103 
5.1.3.3- Cross-dimensional analysis 
This research also reflects cross-cutting relationships between the two primary inequality concerns 
around nanotechnology (pro-poor innovation and gender inequality), to analyze how the progress 
in pro-poor research and development could alter gender inequality in the R&D workforce. This 
study reveals that research and innovation in nanotechnology’s three prioritized pro-poor 
application areas are highly male-dominated. Women account for 18.45% of total authorship and 
11.3% of total inventorship. Moreover, companies that are involved in research and development 
of these pro-poor applications are active in highly male-dominated industries where women face 
high wage and employment gap in the workforce. Women are involved in lower impact (citation 
rate) papers and patents, compare to their male peers. However, when women are author-inventors, 
they contribute to higher impact publications and patents compared to male A-Is.  
This study also provides insights into the gendered authorship practices and impact in pro-poor 
applications of nanotechnology. Female led-authored (first-authored) papers receive lower citation 
rates, although being published in higher impact-factor journals. This might suggest the presence 
of Matilda effect when women lead a research project, in the sense that women receive lower 
recognition for their scientific work as expected—i.e., expected rate of citations received by co-
authoring papers with a higher number of researchers and publishing in higher ranked journals. 
However, when women are corresponding (or last authors), their papers receive equal (or higher) 
citation impact and is published in journals with equal (or slightly lower) ranks (SJR). This might 
be related to a selection effect, which asserts that women who reach senior positions in academia 
are required to be extremely competent and qualified; otherwise, they tend to leave the field.  
This study provides a detailed analysis of collaboration patterns of researchers involved in pro-
poor nanotechnology R&D across genders. It showed that women are as or more collaborative 
than their male peers in their networks of co-authorship and inventorship collaborations. It also 
looked into gender homophily in collaborations and found that collaborations with women are 
increasing over time in the authorship network. Nevertheless, single-gender collaborations are 
increasing in the inventorship network. This study revealed that women are involved in more 
gender-balanced authorship and inventorship collaboration teams, and argues that although 
scientists of both genders are more productive when involved in a mixed-gender team, more than 
45% of male authors and 58% of male inventors collaborate exclusively with men. This is an 
104 
important implication for policymakers to consider and support the aspect of collaboration with 
women in the development of gender-related and pro-poor policies.  
5.1.4- Policy implications  
Results of this PhD study are of great help to provide implications for policy design on: (1) how 
to encourage nanotechnology scientists to publish and patent in the pursuit of United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals, (2) how to promote women’s participation in nanotechnology 
publishing and patenting activities and how to promote collaboration with women (3) how to 
provide opportunities and enhance employment of women in nanotech-related sectors, and finally 
(4) how to change the gendered culture in academia and scientific workplaces in order to remove 
barriers for women as they attempt ascent to scientific eminence. These analyses also provide 
insights into the understanding of the role of the cross-cutting relationship between pro-poor 
technologies and gender equality in knowledge production, dissemination and utilization, upon 
which policy and business strategies to promote innovation within a more equitable economy can 
be developed.  
Canada has been actively involved in international development initiatives, going back to the 
foundation of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in 1968 with the mission 
to manage Canada’s international efforts to help people in poverty—which was lamentably merged 
into the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development in 2013. As a part of Canada’s 
international development efforts, in 1970, Parliament of Canada established the International 
Development Research Centre (IDRC) with the mission of investment in knowledge, innovation, 
and solutions to improve livelihood in developing nations. Development Finance Institution was 
recently (in 2017) established with the main objective to support the contribution of private sector 
investment to development. These efforts accentuate Canada’s great potential in aligning its 
research and development activities in support of the needs of developing countries and the 
Sustainable Development Goals. This study calls for the clear need to integrate pro-poor policies 
into the science and technology policy discourse in emerging fields in Canada. 
However, this study informs policymakers on the importance of mainstreaming cross-cutting 
concerns. This study shows that pro-poor scientific and innovative efforts are highly male-
dominated and women are disadvantaged both in their scientific community and market workforce. 
105 
Therefore, it is important that policymakers pay attention to both gender and pro-poor concerns 
simultaneously, because practices to increase pro-poor innovation might result in wider gender 
gap and adversely affect the social development. On the other hand, Canada’s efforts to increase 
participation of women in science and technology is very limited and is confined to the Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) research chair program for 
Women in Science and Engineering and partial investments in programs such as PromoScience 
and CREATE, none of which has a mere focus on gender initiatives. Moreover, NSERC’s policies 
largely focus on participation rather than retention or progression of women in the science and 
engineering fields.  
Canada’s R&D efforts in nanotechnology is long established and prestigious, which are credited 
with founding the Centre for Advanced Nanotechnology at the University of Toronto in 1997, and 
National Research Council (NRC) institutes in Alberta, British Colombia, Quebec, and Ontario, 
introducing large institutions such as National Institute for Nanotechnology (NINT) and 
NanoQuébec (established in 2001). Despite all these efforts, initiatives to mainstream gender in 
nanotechnology R&D is nonexistent at national, institutional, and organizational levels. The 
results of this study have strong implications for policy development (or reform) targeting both 
gender equality and poverty alleviation in emerging interdisciplinary areas, promoting a more 
equitable and inclusive society. 
5.2- Prospects for future research 
This study incorporates the analysis of the gender dimension merely based on survey data analysis 
and modeling. Although regression modeling has its own merits and helps define important 
gendered aspects of scientific reward system in nanotechnology, it is also important to incorporate 
bibliometrics and social network analysis to better map gender disparities in nanotechnology in 
Canada (which in this research is only confined to cross-dimensional analysis).  
This study focuses only on Canada. One promising research avenue is to conduct similar analyses 
for other countries and provide cross-country comparisons to better understand who is actively 
involved in the development of pro-poor innovation in nanotechnologies and how these 
developments differ across the globe. Another future research direction is related to the issue of 
inequity and diversity, including other underrepresentative groups (for example race, ethnicity, 
106 
religion or economic background) to better understand how nanotechnology R&D could 
potentially offer solutions or exacerbate the existing inequities.  
This study could also inform future studies around social sciences of other emerging technologies 
such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Canada is attempting to become a leader in 
artificial intelligence, investing $125 million in Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy led 
by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)27. The investment will be devoted to 
three research centers—namely the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), the 
Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (AMII) in Edmonton, and the new Vector Institute for 
Artificial Intelligence, in Toronto—to engage more scientists and improve scientific excellence in 
this emerging field. However, studies around equity, equality and development challenges of this 
emerging technology are nascent but necessary. This research could potentially provide a baseline 
for these studies to address equity concerns of this emerging technology.  
Last but not least, qualitative methods (e.g., interview and observation) provide necessary means 
to examine in more detail several dimensions of inequalities that may be caused by the 
development of nanotechnologies. These methods help better understand the findings drawn from 
bibliometric analysis of articles and patents, network and regression analysis, and will bring 
insights into why results gained through quantitative means occurred. These methods help provide 
answers to key questions arising from the analytical findings of this Ph.D. research: What are the 
key elements for scientists to get involved in publishing or patenting in the three pro-poor 
applications of nanotechnology – water, energy, and agri-food? Who do they define as the main 
beneficiaries of their research? What are the motivations behind initiating collaboration with other 
scientists? Are these authorship and inventorship collaborations motivated by the pursuit of new 
product development? What benefits do academic scientists (or inventors) obtain from their 
collaboration with industry (or academia)? What are the key elements for scientists to get involved 
in publishing or patenting? What are the strategies for coping or succeeding in male-dominant 
fields? How these responses vary among men and women scientists? And finally, what are the 
obstacles women face in their collaboration with other researchers that impede their scientific and 
technological productivity?

Research and development (R&D) in this emerging technology presents great importance to many nations, offering a significant technological advantage that gears towards economic growth. However, despite the immense promise of societal benefits from nanotechnology applications, nanotechnology might expose societies to various forms of inequities. The main objective of this thesis is to examine two priority dimensions of equity concerns related to nanotechnology: the lack of R&D for nanotechnology applications that (predominantly) benefit developing nations (pro-poor R&D) and the scant representation of women in nanotechnology fields. This study adopts a combined use of bibliometrics, social network analysis, and survey results to perform both dimensional and cross-dimensional analysis, providing a better understanding of both issues and of how the two are related. The focus of this study is on Canada, a country who prioritizes nanotechnology research and development in its science and technology strategy, and actively practices gender fairness in the scientific system and is strongly involved in international development through its R&D efforts.

The findings reveal that only a narrow spectrum of Canadian nanotechnology articles and patents reflect pro-poor priorities, and acknowledge the importance of promoting and leading research and innovation in pro-poor areas, as it holds the potential to promote the economic development both within and between nations. However, these pro-poor scientific and innovative efforts tend to be highly male-dominated in terms of the scientific community and the workforce involved. Gender differences in citation and journal impact of papers published in the nano-pro-poor applications reveal the presence of the Matilda effect at the level of first-authorship and a strong selection effect at the level of last-authorship for women. While the majority of male authors and male inventors collaborate exclusively with men, those involved in a mixed-gender team outperform male-only teams. Therefore, it is important that policymakers pay attention to both gender and pro-poor initiatives simultaneously, because practices to promote pro-poor innovation might result in a wider gender gap and adversely affect social development. Furthermore, gender analysis of nanotechnology scientific reward system confirms that the gender productivity gap remains a challenge in the field and that these gaps are reinforced by the fact that the most productive researchers are less likely to collaborate with women. The results also show the amount of extra effort that women must devote to their research to retain their top status in academia, and the extent that their recognition when in top positions is fragile compared to men. This study also confirms the cumulative advantage of creating a gender-inclusive culture that enables women to improve their scientific productivity and impact.

Public Authority Liability and the Regulation of
Nanotechnology: A European Perspective
Nina Natalia Baranowska*
Abstract
This paper argues that in certain circumstances public authorities should be
liable for regulating nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is an emerging field of
technology that enables to control shape and size of various structures, devices and
systems at nanometer scale on which one nanometer is equal to one-billionth of a
meter. In spite of being a nascent field of science and technology, its scope of
application – in the food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, construction, textile,
electronics, and agricultural industries – is expanding rapidly. The risks
associated to nanotechnology, however, and its long-term consequences are still
largely unknown, particularly in regards to its health and safety impacts on
individuals. In this context of uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding this emerging
technology, it is highly problematic that the current legal liability framework in the
European Union for defective products under Product Liability Directive (85/374/
EEC), and the public authority liability for damage caused by EU institutions or by
its servants in the performance of their duties under Article 340 (2) TFEU – fails to
effectively protect users of nanotechnology.
Thus, it is imperative to ensure an adequate legal response in order to protect
users of nanotechnology. This piece proposes a regulatory framework that will
enable users to claim compensation from public authorities in cases of incomplete or
insufficient regulations in regards to nanotechnology. The proposed liability scheme
is based on (a) public authority liability as a secondary claim; (b) the infringement
of objective precautionary principles; (c) whereby the burden of proof rests on the
public authority; and (d) the limitation period for a claim for damages starts from
the time of knowledge about the cause of damage.
Finally, this paper concludes by recommending the implementation of
additional solutions to safeguard the protection of the users of nanoproducts.
These include creating an innovation fund for companies to share their profits with

I. INTRODUCTION
In what circumstances, if any, should public authorities be held liable for
regulating the nanotechnology phenomenon? Such a question is not usually
taken into consideration in discussions about regulations concerning
nanotechnology1, i.e. technology that includes structures measuring in the 100
millionths of a millimetre. The area of application of nanotechnology is
extremely vast and includes such fields as the food industry, medicine,
construction, and textiles. The potential of the use of nanotechnology is still
growing and more and more products contain nanoparticles. Therefore,
nanotechnology is being discussed from various perspectives including ethics
and society, business, and global sustainability.2 The legal aspects of
nanotechnology are analyzed mainly from the point of view of regulations and
recommendations of regulatory agencies in the areas of health and safety, the
environment, international trade and intellectual property law (patent and
copyright protection).3 Within the scope of tort liability, the issue of
nanotechnology is raised mainly in the context of liability for defective products.4
The possibility of placing a duty on public authorities to regulate
nanotechnology is a controversial issue. In general, the concept of public
authority liability includes the non-contractual liability of a public authority to
1 As explained below, discussion about regulating nanotechnology focuses mainly on the
areas of health and safety (see e.g. Aida Ponce Del Castillo, The EU approach to
regulating nanotechnology (Brussels: ETUI, 2010) at 33-34), environmental issues (see
e.g. Nanowerk, ‘‘Nanowaste - Nanomaterial-containing products at the end of their life
cycle,” online: <http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=38848.php> [‘‘Nano-
waste”]), and intellectual property law (see e.g. Hsinchun Chen et al. ‘‘Trends in
nanotechnology patents” (2008) 3:3 Nature Nanotechnology 123; David S. Almeling,
‘‘Patenting Nanotechnology: Problems with the Utility Requirement” (2004) 1 Stan
Tech Law Rev 1; Indrani Barpujari, ‘‘The Patent Regime and Nanotechnology: Issues
and Challenges” (2010) 15 Journal of Intellectual Property Rights 206). The liability
issue is analyzed (mainly) from theproduct liability perspective (see e.g.GeraintHowells,
‘‘Product Liability for Nanotechnology,” (2009) 32 Journal of Consumer Policy 381
[Howells, ‘‘Product Liability”]). The idea of regulating public authority liability for
improper regulation of nanotechnology is missing in those discussions.

make good any damage arising from its acts or omissions. The concept has
evolved since the 19th century, when legal systems were initially based on the idea
of full state immunity, expressed in a maxim ‘‘The King can do no wrong”.5 The
‘‘public authority” usually refers to central and local government (e.g. federal
and provincial government), the legislative body (e.g. parliament), ‘‘the State”
itself (if the State has a legal personality), as well as judges and judicial
representatives. Therefore, the possibility of holding public authorities liable
depends on the shape of a political and legal system in a given country, and
attention must be paid to the specific bodies responsible for making policy and
legally binding decisions. Further parts of this paper use the notion ‘‘public
authorities”, with the reservation that it may concern the government or
legislature in the context of a specific case or legal order.
This paper is concerned with European Union (EU) law, including the
liability of the European Union as a policy-maker and maker of product liability
law. However, the concepts presented here have a universal nature and concern
general policy recommendations which can be applied in various legal systems.
EU law is an interesting example of exercising public power. The EU is a political
and economic union consisting of 28 Member States which has created an
internal single market and, to certain extent, a standardized system of law.6
Looking back at the origin of the EU, and earlier at the creation of the European
Communities, it should be noted that the deepened cooperation between states
was, and still is, based on the growth of the internal market and economic trade,
including the abolition of barriers to starting and conducting business activity.7
It would have been impossible, however, to put the idea of creating a common
market into practice without conducting legislative activities at the level of the
Union and the states, and creating a complete and coherent system of judicial
protection.8 The Member States passed some of their law-making competencies
to EU institutions, but at the same time they maintain their own internal legal
systems.9 Therefore, in the EU, there are two levels at which public power is

exercised: national and EU.10 Both systems are combined within a web of legal
enactments and legislative processes. The approximation of the systems of law in
the EU Member States is done through the harmonization and unification
processes. Harmonization includes all actions taken by the member states in
order to adjust national systems of law. It involves primarily the introduction of
similar legal solutions (especially in respect of minimum standards) or, in general,
the introduction of ‘‘consistency”, in its broad meaning, into the systems of law.
This consistency is derived from various traditions (Romano-Germanic,
Scandinavian, and common law),11 which demonstrate different legal
mentalities and different approaches to law. The basic tool in the
harmonization of laws in the EU is the Directive.12 Unification, on the other
hand, includes legislative activities undertaken by the Union legislator as well as
the uniform application of legal norms by courts of law. Unification is mainly
achieved by Regulations.13 Legislative actions of the EU, which acts as a public
authority through Directives and Regulations, have a significant impact on
determining common standards of protection for individuals. The problem of
policy strategy in the case of nanotechnology is of key importance for EU
legislators from the perspective of protecting individuals. Regardless of any
specific public authority liability, the arguments used later in this paper show
that, in certain circumstances, public authorities should be held responsible for
acts or omissions in their regulation of nanotechnology. This paper will consider
three aspects of liability. The first aspect is liability for the improper regulation of
nanotechnology, for example, when nanoproducts harm a consumer. A
‘‘consumer” is a final user of a product containing nanoparticles, such as a
user of clothes or paints produced with the use of nanomaterials.14 The gist of
this liability would be, in one sense, a continuation of the liability for defective
products (product liability). However, the difference is that the cause of the
defectiveness of a product will be the lack of proper regulation, which would
otherwise have ensured the user’s safety.
The second aspect is liability for the improper regulation of nanotechnology
in situations when nanomaterials can cause damage to the ‘‘operators”, such as

of Community Law, (The Hague: Kluwer Law International, 2004) at 23-106.

European Union: The Role of Legal Science and Education” (2006) XI Juridica
International 20.
12 Directives bind the member states in respect of the result, allowing them, as a rule, to
freely choose the formandmethod to achieve that result (seeTFEU, supranote 7, art. 288
para. 3). Due to the very extent of this freedom the directive is considered to be the most
appropriate instrument for the approximation of laws.
13 Regulations have general application, they bind in their entirety and they are directly
applicable in all Member States (see TFEU, supra note 7, art. 288(2)).

the operators of nanomaterials during a production process or during their
application (e.g. while using nano-devices). Some nanomaterials, like nanosilver,
have toxic properties, so that operators are exposed to danger in relation to the
application of nanomaterials.
The third aspect is slightly different and concerns liability for the improper
regulation of nanotechnology where regulations cause harm to companies using
nanomaterials. The introduction of unjustified restrictions on the application of
nanotechnology may cause financial losses for the enterprises applying this
technology. What is more, overregulating nanotechnology may curb
technological development.
Improper regulation in given aspects could be both the lack of regulations
(legislative omission), or imperfect regulation, i.e. regulation not resulting in
proper protection or regulation that is too strict.
The main problem related to nanotechnology, and expressed in the paper, is
to provide appropriate safety levels for nanotechnology’s users (consumers and
operators), while also providing a favourable environment for technological
development, which to some extent is also desirable from a societal perspective.
The starting point of the paper is to present nanotechnology as an emerging
technology, and show how its characteristic features such as size, unpredictability
and the fact that it is still under development (Part II) lead to a key problem:
increased risks (Part III). The current state of research on nanotechnology does
not allow a determination of the long-term consequences of using nanoproducts
(including the impact of nanoparticles on the human body and the environment,
as well as the properties of materials reduced to nanoscale, etc.). Part IV explains
the reasons why the market, social norms and ‘‘architecture” may not fully
regulate for safety measures related to the use of nanotechnology, and why hard
law regulations are necessary. As a result, legislation could play a central role in
regulating nanotechnology. Part V concerns problems related to product liability
regulation. According to an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) report from 2013, the existing legal framework is able to
cover nanoproducts.15 However, the report takes into account mostly regulatory
aspects (mainly the food industry perspective), not liability issues. The product
liability law that is now in force in the European Union (under Product Liability
Directive 85/374/EEC16) does not effectively protect the users of
nanotechnology, which means that in the case of damage caused by a
nanoproduct, the users are deprived of adequate protective measures.

PUBLIC AUTHORITY LIABILITY & THE REGULATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 111
A proposed solution for these problems is to draft regulations which enable
injured parties to claim compensation from public authorities in situations when
policy-makers have not imposed the necessary regulations, or have enacted
incomplete or insufficient regulations. This would establish regulation around
public authority liability (Part VI). The scope of the EU’s non-contractual
liability, as a legal entity responsible for policy-making, for damage arising from
the incomplete or lack of sufficient regulations does not currently cover
nanotechnology.
This paper bases the proposed regulations on certain assumptions, including:
a) the regulation will provide the aggrieved parties with compensatory damages
when the injury was caused in connection with the use of nanotechnology; b)
regulating public authority liability will create incentives for policy-makers so
that they will take more effective and more precautionary actions; c) by
regulating public authority liability tort law could regain its primary function
which is the materialization of the idea of justice; d) although any additional
regulations can result in stifling the pace of technological development,
regulating public authority liability can slow down this pace potentially to a
lesser degree than regulating the liability of companies because public authority
liability does not affect the functioning of tech companies directly and thus it
interferes less in the pace of technological development; and e) the public and
businesses expect that the policy-makers will take regulatory steps.
Part VII will explain the elements of this type of liability. First, public
authority liability should be a secondary claim. This regulation should be based
on an objective infringement of law, informed by precautionary principles, and
not a standard of subjective fault. The burden of proof should rest on the public
authority, which means that the public authority will have to prove that it has
not infringed precautionary principles. Because of the long-term consequences of
nanotechnology, the limitation period should start from the time of knowledge
about the cause of damage.
Apart from hard law regulation, there is a need to propose some mechanisms
that will fulfill the presented concept. First, companies should share their profits
with the government by contributing to a special ‘‘innovation fund”. Public
authorities could contribute to the research process not only by paying
compensation but also by ordering additional research, subsidizing research
centers, and providing various programmes financed from public funds. The last
point is that the users of nanoproducts should be informed about nanomaterials
used in products and about the risks related to nanotechnology.
II. NANOTECHNOLOGY — EMERGING TECHNOLOGY
Nanotechnology is the ‘‘design, characterization, production and application
of structures, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at nanometre
scale.”17 One nanometre (nm) is equal to one-billionth of a metre (0.000000001

m). To put it vividly, a red blood cell is approximately 7000nm wide, while
hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells, which carries oxygen, is
approximately 5 nanometers.18 The concept of nanoscience and the possibility
of manipulating materials at the size of atoms and molecules was described for
the first time by Richard P. Feynman during the plenary session of American
Physical Society in 1959. The term ‘‘nanotechnology” was used for the first time
by Japanese professor Norio Taniguchi of the University of Science in Tokyo in
1974. In 1980 Eric Drexler, an American engineer, developed and popularized
the potential of molecular nanotechnology in his book Engines of Creation: The
Coming Era of Nanotechnology.19
Nanotechnology is a fast growing area with considerable potential.
According to some authors, nanotechnology is ‘‘science’s next big thing”,20 or
even ‘‘the next industrial revolution”.21 The broad scope of the application of
nanotechnology means that users are sometimes not aware of nanoparticles’
existence in various products or of the use of nanotechnology in everyday life.
Nanotechnology is also an interdisciplinary field and involves expertise
knowledge from different disciplines such as physics, chemistry, engineering,
information technology, and biology.22
The existence of nanoparticles in everyday products is not a new event.
Nanomaterials have been used in the past, for example, in car tires.23 However,
the scope for the application of nanotechnology is broadening. Nanotechnology
is now used in the food industry, the pharmaceutical industry, medicine (e.g.
contrast agents used in diagnosis and biomedicine), cosmetics and sunscreens,
construction (e.g. insulation materials, self-cleaning and automotive paints), the
textile industry and sporting goods (e.g. smart clothes), the agricultural industry

(e.g. pesticides), electronics, optics, aerospace, and the defense industry, etc.24 It
is difficult to estimate how many consumer products with nanoparticles are
already on the market. Different authors indicate that the number of
nanoproducts that have already been introduced to the market could vary
from 500 to more than 1600.25 The future and potential of nanotechnology are
difficult to predict. Researchers are still working on nanodevices that could be
used in cancer diagnosis.26 In future, nanoparticles will probably be able to come
together on their own and be self-replicating, so that they can function like living
creatures.27 It seems that all discussions about nanotechnology and its attendant
problems are just beginning.
III. NANOTECHNOLOGY — MACRO-PROBLEMS
Although the use of nanotechnology is growing rapidly, with more and more
products including nanoparticles, this technology poses certain threats and risks.
One may claim that every new technology carries some risk, but as presented in
this paper, the risks entailed by nanotechnology and its potential negative
impacts are significant.
The first and most obvious observation is that nanomaterials have reached a
size that requires highly-advanced research apparatuses such as nano-
microscopes to apply nanomaterials in products and to control them.
Therefore, not every laboratory or scientific centre will possess the essential
equipment to carry on research on nanomaterials. It leads to dangerous
consequences for the users of nanoproducts with regards to evidential proof
problems. For example, in the case of injuries caused by a nanoproduct, the user
will have a limited ability to prove that a particular nanomaterial used in the
product caused their injury. This challenge is not restricted to nanotechnology. It
is a previously known phenomena apparent from the use of other highly
advanced technologies. However, in the case of nanotechnology it occurs with
increased frequency, especially because the level of knowledge and the access to

114 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND TECHNOLOGY [16 C.J.L.T.]
highly advanced equipment which can examine nanoparticles are limited. The
other difficulties refer to uncertainty concerning causality. Even if the injured
party has access to the advanced equipment and thus the possibility of examining
the effects of nanoparticles, in some cases it will still be impossible to prove what
exactly caused the damage (the nanoparticle itself, the reaction with other
particles, the technique by which it has been applied in the product, the way of
using the product, etc.). This uncertainty is the result of basing production
processes on technologies with effects that are not fully understood, and which
may be uncontrolled.
The second argument, which is closely related to the previous one, is that this
technology is still under development. Researchers and experts are working on
new practical applications for some nanomaterials as well as new measurement
methods. It is already scientifically proven that some materials change their
features when they are minimized to nanoscale.28 For example, some of them
change their colors, while others can be extremely hazardous, even though the
same material when ‘‘regular” size is not. For example, nanosilver is highly
toxic.29
Third, the long-term safety of nanomaterials is unverified and the risks
related to their application are difficult to estimate. It also means that the
consequences of nanomaterials for human health are mostly unknown. One of
the potential uses of nanotechnology in medicine is that of enabling nanodevices
such as nanotubes or nanoshells to circulate in the bloodstream. Because of their
size, smaller than a human cell, nanodevices could get access to areas of the body
which are now inaccessible. Owing to this ability, nanodevices could diagnose
diseases and deliver treatments in a more precise and accurate way.30 However, it
is still unknown how the nanodevices would interact with human cells: how the
organism would manage to eliminate them, and what the long-term
consequences of circulating nanodevices in blood vessels could be. The second
example regarding long-term safety refers to the level of protection after the
period of the use of nanomaterials has ended. There is not enough research on
how nanowaste will respond to thermal or biological treatment.31
IV. DECIDING WHEN AND HOW TO REGULATE
NANOTECHNOLOGY
When facing challenges caused by technological innovations,32 policy-
makers have in practice two possible scenarios to enact. In the first scenario, they
28 See Steffen F. Hansen & Anders Baun, ‘‘When Enough is Enough,” (1 July 2012) 7

32 For example Brownsword describes new technologies as the challenge of regulatory

can introduce some regulations on the emerging technology. The regulations will
usually impose limits on the application of the technology, set out requirements
for introducing the technology to market, the conditions under which the
technology can be used (e.g. safety standards) or, in the most extreme way, they
can forbid the use of the technology. In the second scenario, policy-makers can
simply wait and observe how the new technology is going to develop. Even
though policy-makers do not take any steps to establish new regulations for the
technology, the technology will usually be regulated, to some extent, by existing
legal rules. In this case the concept of ‘‘translation”, developed by Lawrence
Lessig, is of key importance.33 According to Lessig’s concept, in the face of
changing technological realities, ‘‘translation” protects the meaning and restores
the original values of existing legal regulations. In some cases changing an
interpretative practice and, for example, increasing the scope of the application
of existing rules will be sufficient to deal with new technologies.34
Moreover, the lack of legal actions from public authorities does not mean
that the use of the technology is not regulated. According to Lessig, there are
four modalities that could regulate it: legal norms, social norms, markets and
‘‘architecture”.35 If legal regulations do not provide an adequate legal response
for the new reality created by the emerging technology, other modalities will take
the primary role. Lessig claims that social norms regulate the reality and are
enforced by a community. Markets regulate people’s behavior by price. The last
modifier that could operate in the absence of legal regulations is ‘‘architecture”.
The ‘‘architecture” of the physical world has an impact on how technology is
used. For example, it can make the application of the technology more common,
encourage people to use it and build trust in it.36
How can these modalities be relevant to the case of nanotechnology? First of
all, the market could regulate the use of nanoproducts by their price. This would
mean that if nanoproducts are cheaper than products which do not contain
nanoparticles, people are encouraged to buy more nanoproducts. On the other
hand, if the price of nanoproducts declines too far, consumers might start
thinking of nanoproducts as being cheaper, less reliable and poorer quality
replacements of regular products.
connection, see R. Brownsword Rights, Regulation and the Technological Revolution
(Oxford: Oxford University Press 2008). Marchant, Allenby, and Herkert describe new
technologies as the ‘pacing problem’, see G. Marchant, B. Allenby & J. Herkert, The
Growing Gap between Emerging Technologies and Legal-Ethical Oversight: The Pacing
Problem (Springer Netherlands, 2011).

116 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND TECHNOLOGY [16 C.J.L.T.]
The crucial element of regulating nanotechnology by social norms refers to
the level of consumers’ knowledge of this technology. A society which is well-
informed about nanoproducts can make a conscious decision and generate
norms about whether, and how, it wants to use nanoproducts.
The most challenging task is to apply ‘‘architecture” to nanotechnology. It
should be noted that Lessig’s concept of modalities refers primarily to new
technologies with relation to cyberspace. Taking into account the nature of
nanotechnology, which is a highly advanced and scientific field, and that
nanoparticles are imperceptible by the regular user, the ‘‘architecture” modality
will probably have a limited application to this technology. However, it can
apply to the physical design of nanoproducts, especially their packaging. The
package informing the user that nanomaterials are used in a production process
can encourage or discourage people to buy the nanoproduct, depending on a
current consumer fad. Furthermore, the amount of safety information a label
contains can result in gaining or losing consumers’ trust in a product.
All the modalities expressed by Lessig could have some impact on the
manner that nanotechnology is regulated. However, their importance decreases
when we take into account the need to establish a proper level of safety for
nanoproducts, and the possibility for redress when damages are caused by
nanoproducts. Neither social norms, the market, nor ‘‘architecture” can fully or
effectively regulate for product safety and ensure sufficient protection from the
risks nanotechnology involves and thus they will play minor roles. Precise safety
requirements are an emerging issue related to nanotechnology.
The pace of technological development and its influence on legal regulations
has induced wide-ranging and in-depth discussions among legal scholars.37 Lyria
Bennett Moses makes an interesting point that instead of trying to answer how
new technologies should be regulated, one should answer how the adjustment of
the legal response to socio-technical change might be institutionally managed.38
Bennett Moses indicates that policy-makers have to find an adequate response,
not because technology itself is a problem, but because innovations create a new
socio-technical landscape with many new negative characteristics such as harm,
risks, market failures, and inequality.39 Tony Prosser identifies four rationales
for regulating technologies. These are: 1) economic efficiency and market choice,
(2) regulation to protect rights, (3) regulation for social solidarity, and (4)
regulation as deliberation.40 Bennett Moses explains that regulation processes

have to take into account reframing regulatory design, regulatory institutions,
regulatory timing, and regulatory responsiveness,41 while Julia Black has stressed
the role of political considerations.42 Roger Brownsword, on the other hand,
points out that technological development can have both positive and negative
impacts on the liberty of individuals.43 The use of some technologies might result
in the loss of liberty44 or contribute to the creation of a surveillance system.45
Instead of paying attention to the normative backgrounds of technological use,
Brownsword highlights the role of ‘‘technological management”, which might
practically prevent users of a technology from taking certain actions.46
Nanotechnology is a technology in which legal regulation could play a
central role. The benefits of regulating nanotechnology could include, among
other things, the protection of its users47 and building public trust. Research
done by the Woodrow Wilson International Center in 2005, titled ‘‘Informed
Public Perceptions of Nanotechnology and Trust in Government”, shows that
there is high demand for effective government regulation of nanotechnology.48
The study was carried out with groups of citizens in Cleveland, Dallas, and
Spokane, in the USA. A majority of the participants felt that government control
beyond voluntary standards is necessary with respect to nanotechnology (55%).
Among the preferred ways of government actions that will increase public trust,
participants indicated: safety tests before market (34.5%), supplying more
product information so people can choose (24.9%), showing how regulatory
practices are sufficient (11.9%), and better tracking the product risks in market
(9.6%).49

On the other hand, policy-makers’ actions to regulate a technology can stifle
the pace of technological development and even result in blocking further
development. For example, the way genetically modified organism (GMO)
technology has been regulated in the EU (e.g. mandatory labelling) outpaced
attention to the environmental, health, and safety implications,50 while other
products, such as hormones, remain less tested and monitored. The role of the
policy-maker is thus to balance the necessity of ensuring an adequate level of
protection while using nanotechnology (if the benefits outweigh the risks) to
provide more advanced research and to foster innovation. The lack of knowledge
about the long-term health effects of using nano-products causes difficulties in
establishing one precise standard that can be applied to public authorities that
are seeking to craft regulations that attempt to balance both health and safety
considerations with the creation of conditions in which innovation in the
nanotechnology area can thrive. Generally, it can be claimed that the standard
should correspond to the safety level that the users are entitled to expect, based
on the current state of knowledge, but also including justified predictions. Those
expectations should be assessed from the normal and prudent user’s
perspective.51 Even though nanotechnology is usually operated by a specific
group of users (e.g. scientists, researchers), the assessment of the safety of a nano-
product should be made solely based on what a final, normal user could expect.
The complexity of nanotechnology and the vast scope of its application justify
taking into account the safety expectations of the final user. It means that the
standard applied by public authorities should remain flexible and correspond to
actual problems.
Too strict or too expanded a regulatory legal system can also lead to
overregulation.52 Both the users of the technology and the companies working on
the technology can be overwhelmed by the number of regulations. Moreover,
when the regulations are very precise and detailed, they start losing their
flexibility, and after some time, their importance. For example, if the policy-
maker draws up a list of potential dangerous materials and provides the exact
name or chemical composition, it can quickly turn out that a substance with a
similar, but not exactly the same, chemical composition will be excluded from the
application of this regulation, even though it has dangerous features. One
solution to prevent such a situation is to create principle-based regulations,
which would be more flexible and accurate.53 Principal-based regulation is one of

the regulatory approaches which is based on the general and broad principles
established by the public authority, instead of precise and detailed rules.54 Owing
to that, regulated entities (e.g. companies) have more freedom in choosing the
methods of complying with these principles. At the same time, broad principles
are less likely to be outpaced by the passage of time and fast-changing
technological realities.55
Regulation might also be a costly process. More regulations on technology,
such as restrictions on a production process, higher safety standards and
mandatory requirements like additional, more detailed safety tests, product
labelling, risk tracking, mandatory maintenance and reviews of a product, can all
impose extra costs on a company. These extra costs generated by additional
regulations are usually passed on to the consumers of the final product.56 When
users receive a product which meets higher standards of protection, the price of a
product will usually be higher. This means that the costs of raising a product’s
standards will be covered by the users of the technology, which at the end of the
day can result in ‘‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater.” Ensuring high
quality and safety standards can lead to an increase in price to a level where
buying a product is no longer cost-effective and lucrative. Users can thus make a
decision not to purchase a product, but then they will be deprived of the real
possibility of taking advantages of technological development. Therefore, setting
disproportionate standards of protection can adversely affect users’ decisions.
Moreover, if users do not buy products, companies will not have enough revenue
to invest in further innovations. Nonetheless, it can be observed that currently,
more and more policy-makers and legal scholars recognize the problems
associated with nanotechnology. Their works are devoted, for the most part,
to public law regulations (administrative admission, registration of
nanomaterials, etc.).57 A report, ‘‘Regulatory Frameworks for Nanotechnology
in Foods and Medical Products”, by the OECD Working Party on
Nanotechnology (WPN), published in 2013, suggests that the existing legal

framework is able to cover nanoproducts.58 The European Commission also
concluded that ‘‘foods and medical products that may contain nanomaterials, or
otherwise involve the application of nanotechnology, are covered under existing
national and/or regional legislative and regulatory frameworks that are relevant
and applicable to food and medical products”.59 The commentators are less
optimistic. Clarence J. Davis argues that the existing regulatory and management
scheme will probably not be able to deal with nanotechnology. Among the
obstacles he points out are: lack of sufficient data, inability to monitor and
control the development of nanotechnology by regulatory authorities, and
insufficient funding of research and enforcement mechanisms.60 There are also
contradictory opinions about whether or not nanotechnology should be
regulated. Sonia Arrison claims that nanotechnology could flourish only
through ‘‘modest regulation, civilian research, and an emphasis on self-
regulation and responsible professional culture”.61 The argument for self-
regulation is that companies and private research centers can assess the actual
risk in a better way than government.62 Certain groups such as the Natural
Resources Defense Council and Greenpeace call for slowing down
nanotechnology research and development.63 A more balanced opinion has
been expressed by Linda Breggin and Leslie Carothers. The authors propose a
multi-pronged and integrated approach to the nanotechnology phenomenon.
This approach could include ‘‘elements of regulatory and voluntary programs

under existing environmental statutes; corporate stewardship; tort liability;
federal, state, and local legislation; voluntary standards; disclosure; liability
insurance; and international measures”.64
V. PROBLEMS WITH EUROPEAN PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW
So far, little attention has been devoted to the issue of liability with respect to
nanotechnology.65 Although nanotechnology generates new risks, there is no
separate liability regime, which means that the traditional rules of existing tort
law have to be applied in the case of injuries caused by nanomaterials. From the
user’s perspective, liability rules might be as important as health and safety
regulations. This is because the safety rules are addressed mainly to the
companies, and consumers are not directly identified by such regulations. The
regulation of compensation for damages caused by products which do not meet
certain safety requirements might be thus more interesting for the users of
nanoproducts. This area is regulated by tort law, more precisely by product
liability law, and its role in connection with the development of new technologies
should primarily be users’ protection.
Unfortunately, existing regulations in force in the EU Member States
regarding liability for damage caused by defective products, implemented under
the Product Liability Directive,66 is not a fully adequate legal response to the risks
connected with nanoproducts and fails to ensure appropriate levels of safety for
users of this technology.67
First of all, the Directive limits the scope of its application to ‘‘tangible”
goods. According to Article 2 of the Directive, ‘‘product” means all movables,
with the exception of primary agricultural products and game, even when
incorporated into another movable or into an immovable.68 The definition of a
‘‘product” causes some problems with respect to nanotechnology. Nanomaterials
can be classified as tangible, but invisible, objects which are the components of
the product. However, nanotechnology can also be used to produce products, for
example by nanolaser;69 as well as possibly being a part of a service, for example
medical procedures or treatment,70 which are not covered by the scope of the
application of the Directive.

Secondly, legal problems are related to a notion of ‘‘defectiveness”. Under
Article 6 of the Directive, a product is defective when it does not provide the
safety which a person is entitled to expect, taking all circumstances into account,
including (a) the presentation of the product, (b) the use to which it could
reasonably be expected that the product would be put, and (c) the time when the
product was put into circulation. Also, a product shall not be considered
defective for the sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into
circulation. The phrase, ‘‘the safety which a person is entitled to expect”, shows
that the Directive regime is based on a consumer expectation model.71 The crucial
element of this model, however, is the necessity that consumers are well-informed
so that they can make an informed decision as to whether or not they would like
to use nanoproducts. Currently, there is no legal obligation to inform consumers
about the risks associated with the use of nanoproducts, e.g. by labelling.
Labelling issues remain controversial. Marchant, Douglas and Abbott
introduced labelling as a discriminatory action, from the point of view of
market mechanisms, because of its stigmatization effect.72 Similarly, Juni has
pointed out the difficulties of companies in relation to the communication of the
risks.73 Introducing new technologies can cause fear and social concerns, and run
into resistance against their use. In many cases this anxiety is unsupported and
based solely on the fear of novelty. It often results from false, selective, or
misinterpreted information about a new technology, as well as conflicting reports
from the science world, ‘‘media storm”, and groups of opponents. An example of
distrust in technological development might be the example of the ‘‘anti-vax”
movement emerging in Europe and North America.74 This movement originates
from an article of Dr. Andrew Wakefield published in the The Lancet in 1998.
According to Wakefield’s research, 8 of 12 children brought by their parents to a
hospital in London exhibited symptoms of autism within 14 days after MMR
vaccination (measles, mumps and rubella). The research was criticized by other
experts and finally it turned out that in an examined group there was only one
case of autism symptoms, which appeared a few months after the vaccination.
Dr. Wakefield was removed from the register of professional medical
practitioners and 12 years after it was published, his article was withdrawn
from the journal.75 Despite these facts, the ‘‘anti-vax” movement is growing and
members of this group stigmatize vaccination technology.

PUBLIC AUTHORITY LIABILITY & THE REGULATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 123
The stigmatization effect can also be seen in case of GMOs. Although new
technologies are usually introduced to the market under the assumption that they
will be beneficial and bring improvement to existing technologies, they are
sometimes rejected by the potential users for above mentioned reasons. In that
case, labelling can magnify the effect of distrust and resistance, which can be seen
in the social approach to GMO in the EU. The EU selectively targets products
which are made through GM processes, although there is no evidence that proves
that these processes are riskier than other methods of processing food.76 Under
EU Regulation No. 1830/2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of
genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products
produced from genetically modified organisms,77 GMO products are subject to
strict labelling and traceability, even though researchers are in agreement that
GMO food products are not more hazardous than the non-GMO food, and are
actually even safer.78 Consumers are more aware of the existence of GMO food,
but on the other hand they are not informed about hormones for example, which
are less monitored, and at the end of the day consumers could make a biased
decision.
Nonetheless, to some extent, labelling can be beneficial. First, since users do
not know that the product contains nanomaterials, they have a limited ability to
benefit, for example, from the protection provided by tort law. Accurate
information enables users to make an informed decision about whether they
want to use potentially dangerous technology and expose themselves to the
possibility of harm.79
Apart from labelling, users could also be informed about risks by the media
or public campaigns. According to Howells, if risks are known and users are
informed, the matter of defectiveness depends on whether the risks are socially
acceptable.80 Greater risk will probably be more acceptable in the area of
medicine and pharmaceuticals, where the risk could bring considerable
improvement, rather than in the cosmetics or entertainment industry.81 The
moment of assessing the defectiveness of a product is when the product is put
into circulation on the market, under Article 6(1)(c) of the Product Liability

Directive. Under Article 6(2) a product shall not be considered defective for the
sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into circulation.82
The notion of defectiveness is tied to the admissibility of the development
risk defence. According to Article 7(e) of the Directive, the producer shall not be
liable if he proves that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time
when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence
of the defect to be discovered.83 This defence is especially favourable to those
producers who use new technological processes, the consequences of which are
difficult to predict. The existing legal framework demands that companies make
a reasonable decision based on data and research available only when the
product is put into circulation. As indicated above, the most significant problem
with nanoproducts is that currently, the risks and negative effects on the human
body and the environment are mostly unknown. The growing pace of
technological development in the area of nanotechnology could result in
producers being able to easily free themselves from responsibility. The existing
regulations also create an incentive to put products on the market carelessly and
to do less research ahead of time.84
The next problem relates to the limitation period. Under Article 10(2) of the
Directive, the rights conferred upon the injured person to claim for compensation
shall be extinguished upon the expiry of a period of 10 years from the date on
which the producer put into circulation the product which caused the damage.
Taking into account that the detrimental effects of nanotechnology applications
might not present themselves for a long period of time, a 10-year limitation
period from the date on which the producer put the product into circulation
seems to be insufficient.
More general problems with the existing legal framework of product liability,
related not only to nanotechnology, are concerned with how to assign
responsibility for damage, establish causal links, and define the scope of the
damage to be repaired.85
VI. LEGAL RESPONSE: PUBLIC AUTHORITY LIABILITY
Given the aforementioned problems, the constantly expanding scope of the
application of nanotechnology, and the increasing degree of risks, the discussion
on regulating liability for damage caused by nanoproducts is urgent. The
regulations presently in force for EU Members under the Product Liability
Directive fail to ensure appropriate levels of safety for users of nanoproducts. As
a result, users are deprived of full tort law protection, and in some cases of
damage caused by nanoproducts, they will not be able to obtain compensation. It

seems necessary to adjust tort law to these new challenges in order to ensure an
appropriate level of protection.
This section focuses on legal remedies that will facilitate the efforts of
nanotechnology’s users in obtaining compensation. The proposal goes beyond
the traditional concept of a product liability regime and concentrates not on
product liability itself, but on a public authority liability focused on the case of
the non-regulation, or improper regulation, of nanotechnology.
1. Justifying Regulation of Public Authority Liability
One may ask why policy-makers should be liable for taking any regulatory
action. The decision on whether or not to regulate a new technology depends
almost entirely on the vision of a particular policy-maker. Regulations are
supposed to reflect the societal interactions and needs, as well as attitudes,
existing in a society which usually expresses traditional, regional and cultural
diversity. Policy-makers have the freedom to make decisions concerning the
scope and form of regulations. This can help explain why GMO technology is
regulated differently in the US and the EU.86
One of the concerns around regulating for public authority liability with
respect to new technologies is the excessive burden this would place on public
authorities to foresee the effects of the legislative solutions that are adopted.87
This leads to the more fundamental question of who should bear the risk of
regulatory policy, and why. First, it seems justifiable to assume that public
authorities should be aware of the consequences of their decisions. They have
access to a wide range of the latest research results, and if in doubt, they can
commission further analyses, evaluate regulatory proposals with experts and
public opinion, and, based on that, weigh the pros and cons. The policy-makers’
decision also has an impact on whether and how technology will be used by
companies, and how products will be introduced to the market. Companies thus
rely on legal regulation and adjust their production processes to the existing legal
framework. On the other hand, there is a threat that the users will bear all the
costs of introducing technology to the market.
It is clear that policy-makers are also the risk-taking actors when introducing
new technologies into public use. In the discussion on the role of government in
the innovation industry, one may find opinions such as the following, that:
Governments have always been lousy at picking winners, and they are
likely to become more so, as legions of entrepreneurs and tinkerers
swap designs online, turn them into products at home and market them
globally from a garage. As the revolution rages, governments should

126 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND TECHNOLOGY [16 C.J.L.T.]
stick to the basics: better schools for a skilled workforce, clear rules and
a level playing field for enterprises of all kinds. Leave the rest to the
revolutionaries.88
To challenge this opinion Mariana Mazzucato puts a simple but relevant
question: who actually funded these revolutionaries?89 Taking as an example the
smartphone’s features such as internet connectivity, GPS, touchscreen, and
microchip, one must notice that they were all funded by governments,90 which
often make decisions on commercialization policy. Although the opinion that all
innovations flourish thanks to government action is exaggerated, one has to
notice that policy-makers can have a real impact on the technological reality.
While Mazzucato stops her arguments at proving why the government is an
active actor on the innovation field, thus explaining why companies should
contribute to public funds, it is possible to go a step further. The contribution of
public authorities to technological development can support the liability they
should bear for their policy decisions.
The next argument for regulating public authority liability is that it can
create incentives for policy-makers to take more effective and more
precautionary actions in order to ensure adequate levels of user protection.
Before making a legally binding decision on a regulatory policy, policy-makers
can, for example, commission more research on the potentially detrimental
effects of the technology to be regulated.
Liability for damages arising from the exercise of public authority can thus
influence the effective exercise of power. Although the functioning of the public
authority is not subject to basic economic assumptions, such as the assumption
of maximizing profits, public authority liability can create incentives for policy-
makers.91
2. Legal Basis for Regulation
Generally, to ensure an appropriate level of protection, there are other legal
concepts to be applied. However, none of them separately represent a sufficient
legal response to the challenges posed by nanotechnology.
One solution is to reconsider the existing legal framework of product liability
rules based on the Directive, so that it can fully cover all injuries caused by
nanotechnology. In other words, the regulation of product liability could be
tightened for producers. Among the shortcomings in establishing stricter

regulation on product liability, the major one is the risk of hindering
technological development and innovation.92 Over-regulating product liability
rules can prevent companies from investing in further progress and research in
nanotechnology.93 It might be more profitable for the companies to use tested
and better-known techniques rather than applying innovations which could
expose them to the risk of paying high compensation. What is more, from an
economic perspective, the higher costs of production resulting from overly strict
legal requirements, or the more serious and real possibility of paying monetary
compensation, are often passed on to consumers. At the end of the day,
consumers would have to bear the costs of ensuring an adequate level of
protection.94
The other solution for balancing health and environmental risks against the
commercialization of nanotechnology, which was proposed in the literature,
concerns mandatory private-public insurance schemes.95 So far, private-public
insurance programs are typically applied to nuclear damage, where there is on
the one hand low-probability, but on the other, high-loss.96 According to
Maksim Rakhlin, private-public insurance could cover nanotechnology if the
elements were as follows: ‘‘(1) mandatory participation as a precondition to
research and development, (2) creation of a cross-insurer pool of premiums and
deductibles to use for claimant payouts, (3) federal government coverage of
losses exceeding coverage provided by a cross-insurer pool, and (4)
indemnification from tort liability of program participants.”97 In spite of the
fact that public-private insurance could possibly balance the risks posed by
nanotechnology applications and the need for commercialization of
nanomaterials and further technological development, this solution has certain
shortcomings. First, it does not create incentives for government to introduce
effective and well-balanced regulations. It also does not involve public
authorities in the innovation process. Second, it affects companies directly by
increasing the price of market participation.98 It means that smaller companies

could be excluded from the market and at the same time consumers may bear the
additional costs.
Next, existing legal regulations around public authority liability are not an
adequate solution to tackle the problems related to nanotechnology. The liability
that the EU, as an entity with a legal personality, bears for damage caused by its
institutions or by its servants in the performance of their duties, found in Article
340(2) Treaty on the Functioning of the EU99(TFEU), gives an illustrative
example.100 According to Article 4(2)(f) TFEU, consumer protection is one of the
areas where the EU and the Member States share their competencies, which
means that EU institutions can regulate nanotechnology from the perspective of
consumer protection.
In the first place, it should be noted that Article 340(2) TFEU does not
provide the specific prerequisites of liability, which are to be determined on the
basis of the general principles common to the Member States. The formulation of
the conditions of non-contractual liability lies with the Court of Justice of the
European Union (CJEU), which is the only body that is competent to adjudicate
complaints for damages.101 There is uncertainty around this provision. Both the
general formulation of Article 340(2) TFEU and the diversification of liability
rules in the Member States result in the CJEU having wide discretion in setting
the rules for claiming damages. To some extent, this generality could be treated
as an advantage, as it creates flexibility. However, CJEU judgments in many
cases are inconsistent, often devoid of plausible justification, and the accepted
jurisprudence is often not continued in subsequent cases. As a consequence, the
liability of the EU is not predictable and cannot fully secure consumers’ rights
with respect to nanotechnology.
The CJEU formulates four conditions of liability for damages of the EU:
infringement of the rule of law intended to confer rights on individuals,
sufficiently serious breach, actual and certain damage, and direct causal link.102
The lack of presumptions for any of the conditions hinders fulfilling and proving
all the requirements.
An interesting example with respect to the difficulties of proving causation is
the case, É.R.103 The applicants sought a remedy for damage allegedly suffered
by them as a consequence of the infection and subsequent death of members of
their families who developed a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (‘‘mad

cow disease”). The applicants brought actions for damages against the EU for
allegedly unlawful conduct in failing to adopt appropriate measures to prevent
the risks presented by ‘‘mad cow disease”. The probable origin of the disease was
a change in the preparation of cattle feed, which contained proteins derived from
sheep infected with scrapie. Transmission of the disease came about mainly
through the ingestion of feed, in particular, meat-and-bone meal containing the
infectious agent that had not been eliminated.104 The applicants contended that
the European Council and European Commission persistently and deliberately
favoured the interests of traders on the market in beef and veal to the detriment
of the health of consumers when they assessed and managed the risks linked to
the disease. The applicants claimed that there were wrongful omissions on the
part of those institutions in carrying out their duties and obligations in the area
of animal and human health and that they adopted insufficient, incorrect,
inadequate or belated standards and measures to deal with the risks resulting
from ‘‘mad cow disease”.105 The Court concluded that the allegedly unlawful
actions and omissions of the Council and the Commission cannot be considered
to be a definite and direct cause of the infection. In the light of the circumstances
of the case, the Court stated that it had not been shown that if those institutions
had adopted, or had adopted earlier, the measures which the applicants criticized
them for not adopting, the damage in question would not have occurred. As a
result, the Court concluded that there was no causal link between the damage
pleaded and the allegedly unlawful conduct by the EU institutions.106
The next problem is related to the limitation period. According to Article 46
of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union,107 proceedings
against the EU in matters arising from non-contractual liability shall be barred
after a period of five years from the occurrence of the event giving rise thereto.
The formula of limitation can drastically limit the possibility of claiming redress.
First, the beginning of the limitation period is counted from the materialization
of the damage, not from the moment of awareness of the damage.108 Second,
there is no detailed regulation addressing postponement, which would facilitate a
significant extension of the running of the limitation period.109 Third, five years
seems to be relatively short when we take into account the long-lasting effects of

130 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND TECHNOLOGY [16 C.J.L.T.]
nanotechnology. Therefore, the existing regulation on EU liability might not be a
sufficient legal response.
3. Regulation as the Best Form of Action?
As mentioned in Part IV, the non-legal regulatory mechanisms on their own,
which are the market, social norms and ‘‘architecture”, cannot guarantee a
sufficient level of protection with respect to the nanotechnology phenomenon.
The arguments discussed in Part IV remain relevant while analyzing the public
authority problem.
It should be noted that the liability for damage caused by acts or omissions
committed by a public authority is a common principle in European legal
systems.110 The lack of regulation or regulations providing an inaccurate
response to the risks created by nanotechnology results in law losing its function
as a regulatory mechanism for social relations. However, there are some
problems related to public authority liability. The uncertainty in determining the
proper standard of care is a challenge, and could cause liability to be blurred, or
create ineffective stimuli. Where liability is imposed excessively, a decreased level
of activity on the part of authorities could result. Conversely, if liability is
excessively tempered, an increase in the abuse of authority could result.
Secondly, liability will have an impact in terms of the costs of indemnification.
Public authorities paying compensation may also lead to a deterioration in state
budgets and increase the fiscal burden imposed on citizens. In order to avoid
these problems, non-legal mechanisms, such as an ‘‘innovation fund” will be
presented in Part VII.
4. The Appropriate Level(s) of Action
In the discussion on the appropriate level of regulating new technologies, the
main argument supporting the idea of unified, international regulations on
standards of protection is the transnational scope of the application of most new
technologies, the existence of international companies, and the world-wide
transfer of innovations.111 However, in the case of public authority liability, the
scope of regulation will be restricted to a defined political area. First, the
development of non-contractual liability is to a great degree different in
individual countries. Second, public authority liability will refer by nature to a
particular policy-maker. It means that the central point is to define the policy-
maker that has made a legally binding decision on nanotechnology. It could
make a significant difference when the same area of law can be regulated by
different bodies. For example, consumer protection is one of the areas where the
European Union and the Member States share their competencies.112

5. Do the Benefits of Regulation Justify the Costs?
Undoubtedly, any regulation will create some costs. As noted above, in the
case of public authority liability these are mainly the costs of the compensatory
process. However, the proposed solution does not affect companies directly, so it
will probably not hinder technological development, which is always a serious
concern when regulating technologies. The government, on the other hand, will
not be left alone with the burden of the compensatory process if a general
‘‘innovation fund” is created. Companies will thus contribute to the
compensatory process and public authorities will not have look for additional
funding, for example, in the form of a tax increase. Owing to this regulation,
users will receive a mechanism to recover their losses, which means that they will
not bear all the costs of introducing technology to the market alone, and
therefore the benefits of regulation will justify the costs.
6. Transparency of the Distribution of Effects Across Society
One factor that policy-makers should take into account while drafting any
new regulation, is to assess the impact of the regulation on society, including
different social groups. This is a general and universal goal of regulatory
transparency. The riskier a technology is, the greater the effort policy-makers
should undertake to create transparent regulations related to public health and
the environment. On the one hand, transparency ensures that no groups will be
excluded from protection or be unjustifiably affected. On the other, it should
enable technology users a choice between the various possible technological
options.113 The necessity of transparency was also pointed out by the European
Commission in 2000,114 when the Commission stressed that the decision of
whether or not wait for more scientific data before taking steps towards
regulating emerging technology should be based on transparency. In December
2000, the European Parliament endorsed a resolution of the Commission on the
precautionary principle,115 where in point 14 the European Parliament agreed
with the Commission that, before any decision is taken on measures to be
adopted, the decision-maker should have an overview of the available knowledge
on the risks of the activity or substance, carried out by experts who are
independent of the interested parties, recognized by the international scientific

community for their expertise in the field concerned, and appointed by means of
a transparent procedure.116
This proposal on public authority liability promotes the position of
consumers, taking into account that consumers are directly vulnerable to the
detrimental effect of using nanotechnology. Liability rules can thus ensure that
the users are not the only entities forced to bear the costs of technological
development.
However, it should be noted that regulatory decisions also affect companies,
businesses, and private research centers. The tougher regulations are, the more
precautionary measures and cost-benefit calculations companies have to
undertake to resolve convenient risk-optimizing behaviour, which in turn can
reduce incentives for investing in innovations.117 Stricter regulations could also
increase the costs of running a business. Policy-makers will usually justify the
decision of imposing more regulations on the ground that there is a fundamental
necessity to protect the environment and users of technology. The regulations,
however, need to be balanced and take into account the risks of using the
technology as well as its benefits. Decisions on how to balance regulatory steps
somewhere between an irrational fear of novelty and the potential harmful
effects of using nanotechnology should be based on the precautionary
principle.118 Literature and international acts use various definitions of the
precautionary principle.119 The UNESCO’s World Commission on the Ethics of
Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) tried to find a common core
from different wordings and definitions and proposed a general working
definition for the precautionary principle:
‘‘When human activities may lead to morally unacceptable harm that is
scientifically plausible but uncertain, actions shall be taken to avoid or
diminish that harm120 (. . .) [and] the judgement of plausibility should
be grounded in scientific analysis. Actions are interventions that are
undertaken before harm occurs that seek to avoid or diminish the
harm. Actions should be chosen that are proportional to the serious-
ness of the potential harm, with consideration of their positive and
negative consequences, and with an assessment of the moral implica-

tions of both action and inaction. The choice of action should be the
result of a participatory process.”121
As Roberto Andoro points out, adequate regulatory steps are based on
common sense and practical observations of technological implications and
should be taken when there is enough empirical evidence and reliable hypotheses
that a new product or technology might be potentially dangerous for its users.122
According to the European Commission, the lack of scientific proof of the
detrimental effects of using new technologies cannot be used to justify inaction.
All scientific advice and views should be taken into account, even if they
represent a minor fraction of the scientific community.123
Without a balanced decision-making process, the most convenient and
easiest solution would be either a complete ban on nanoproducts production,
until all the risks are precisely determined, or the opposite scenario, not
regulating nanotechnology at all, because of a lack of sufficient knowledge.
Those solutions seem unrealistic, impractical, and would be contrary not only to
market rules but also to societal needs.
To protect companies and businesses from the threat of the overregulation of
new technology, it is important to consider the right of companies to claim for
compensation if the regulations are too tight. Although this solution is an after-
the-fact protection, it could probably create incentives for policy-makers to
introduce more balanced regulatory schemes and therefore companies will not be
excluded from protection.
Taking into account the existing legal framework in EU law, the major
problem with liability for legal actions concerns the prerequisite of unlawfulness.
In the context of liability for damage caused by overregulation, it might be
difficult to prove the unlawfulness of the legal acts. There was a lively and long-
lasting debate over the liability for lawful conduct. Initially, in the case Biovilac,
the Court of Justice stated that if the concept of liability without fault were
accepted in Community law (now European Union law), the action for damages
for lawful legislative action can succeed only if the damage alleged by the injured
party exceeds the limits of the economic risks inherent in operating in the sector
concerned.124 The liability for lawful acts referred to the German law concept of
“Sonderopfer” [special sacrifice] and the French law concept of “rupture de
l’égalité devant les charges publiques” [unequal discharge of public burdens].125

134 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND TECHNOLOGY [16 C.J.L.T.]
However, in the FIAMM case,126 the Court of Justice rejected the concept of
liability for lawful acts. It based its decision on the argument that:
. . . comparative examination of the Member States’ legal systems
enabled the Court to make at a very early stage the finding concerning
convergence of those legal systems in the establishment of a principle of
liability in the case of unlawful action or an unlawful omission of the
authority, including of a legislative nature, that is in no way the
position as regards the possible existence of a principle of liability in the
case of a lawful act or omission of the public authorities, in particular
where it is of a legislative nature”.127
The Court of Justice also stressed that the legislative context is characterized
by the exercise of wide discretion, which is essential for implementing
Community policy. Therefore, the Community cannot incur liability unless the
institution concerned has manifestly and gravely disregarded the limits on the
exercise of its powers.128 It means that the wide scope of legislative freedom is
crucial for the making of EU policy decisions and thus the existing legal rules
would probably not cover the case of the overregulation of nanotechnology if
injured companies are limited to compensation only in the case of unlawfulness.
Although the Court of Justice rejects liability for lawful acts, there are certain
arguments in favour of this solution. Such regulation will provide the aggrieved
parties with compensatory damages suffered in connection with the use of
nanotechnology, when it is not possible to obtain compensation directly from a
producer (e.g. due to the limitation period or to legal requirements by a
producer, etc.) and thus strengthen protections for users. On the other hand,
companies will have the opportunity to obtain compensatory damages in the case
of overregulation. In this way, a balance between all stakeholders will be
maintained, and users and companies will have an indirect impact on actions
taken by policy-makers.
7. Keeping the Regulations Clear, Consistent, Comprehensible, and
Accessible to Users
It seems that the more complex and complicated technology becomes, the
more the rules of liability should be simple and straightforward.129 In the case of
nanotechnology, highly specialized and detailed knowledge is necessary to
understand all the complex processes that are involved. What makes

PUBLIC AUTHORITY LIABILITY & THE REGULATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 135
nanotechnology even more complicated is its interdisciplinary approach, which
necessitates cooperation between experts in biology, physics and chemistry. The
complexity of this issue also has an impact on regulations. It seems that certain
regulations remain specific and scientific (e.g. rules directed to researchers or
producers on the minimum/maximum quantities of nanomaterials in a product).
However, the regulations which are addressed to an ‘‘ordinary” user as well as
the general liability principles should be kept simple. One of the ideas for making
this a reality is to establish principle-based regulation, which can be adjusted to
changing and more complex technological problems.130 Undoubtedly, such a
regulation would ensure flexibility, which means that the legal act does not have
to be changed that often. On the other hand, it could not guarantee the stability
of the law. Moreover, simple and straightforward regulation requires more
initiative from the authorities which apply the law, including courts and
regulatory bodies.
8. Presenting Views by Stakeholders
Recent research shows that the public expects the government to take
regulatory steps in the area of nanotechnology,131 which means that the voice of
the users of nanotechnology is important in the debate on nanotechnology. At
the same time, the companies using nanomaterials might be interested in
imposing public authority liability, as legal regulatory acts influence business
decisions including the necessity of adjusting production processes in line with
established requirements.132 Before introducing new regulation, policy-makers
should take into account the views of all stakeholders, for example, through
public debates, or by hearing from groups of experts working on
nanotechnology. Any legislative initiative, which is not preceded by reliable
public and expert debate, might be socially destructive. The role of policy makers
is to initiate discussions, which should be held at the national as well as the
essential local level. At the national level, policy-makers could lead an
information campaign through traditional and social media, or hold public
consultations through government online platforms. Examples of such actions
might include public consultations organized by the European Commission and
certain agencies of the European Union such as the European Food Safety
Authority. These consultations concern policy approaches that can ease the
development of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things,133 as well
as nanotechnology.134 The results of consultations can be analyzed and discussed

by a group of independent experts from different research centers. Policy-makers
can also commission additional reports on the effects of imposing public
authority liability on state budgets.
However, in practice public consultations have their limits. The most
significant problem is that information about public consultations reaches only a
limited number of people. For example, in public consultations on the Internet of
Things, organized by the European Commission in 2012, only 600 people
responded.135 It seems that the circulation of information is insufficient. Perhaps
more effective actions can be performed at the local level by local authorities. For
example, they could manage information campaigns in schools or public debates
at universities. They could prepare and spread brochures, and invite citizens to
take part in various surveys. Information could also be included in local
newspapers or posters. At the local level, important tasks are undertaken by non-
governmental organizations, which are independent of government but can
cooperate with local authorities.
VII. ACHIEVING COMPLIANCE — DRAFTING REGULATIONS
According to Van Dam, ‘‘in establishing liability of public authorities, courts
have to steer between not hampering a good government on the one hand, and
correcting bad government on the other”.136 In EU law, public authority liability
is regulated in the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union and by the
decisions of the CJEU.
Public authority liability in the case of nanotechnology would remain a part
of the tort law system. One may, however, pose the question as to whether public
authority liability should cover only nanotechnology and exclude other emerging
technologies. While it is true that nanotechnology is used widely in everyday
products and its long-term consequences are still unknown, it has to be noted
that many other products pose considerable challenges for regulatory decisions
due to their high risk for users’ safety (e.g. asbestos, mercury). Just as the sphere
of unknown technological processes is growing, there will probably be more and
more examples of technologies, such as genetic engineering, causing similar
problems. Excluding other technologies from the scope of legal regulations on
public authority liability thus seems unjustified and impractical.
The potential elements and features of the proposed regulation shall be as
follows. Public authority liability should be a subsidiary claim to the one against
the producer of nanoproducts. If the infringed party does not receive
compensation from the company (e.g. when the company followed legal
requirements while monitoring production processes), then s/he could make a
claim for compensation from the public authority. If the infringed party received

136 Cees Van Dam, European Tort Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006) at 472.
PUBLIC AUTHORITY LIABILITY & THE REGULATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 137
compensation from the company, s/he will not have a right to sue the public
authority. The claim against the public authorities, however, could be a recourse
claim, meaning if the company provided the compensation and the injury is the
result of inadequate regulatory measures, the company could make a claim in
restitution for the public authority to return the previously paid compensation.
Furthermore, with regard to nanotechnology, subjectively understood fault
should be replaced with objective criteria such as the infringement of the legal
rules and/or precautionary principles, and move from fault-based liability to
strict liability. In extreme cases, when the damage is unpredictable and has
enormous scope, compensation should be granted even if the actions of public
authorities were lawful.
The next element is that of causal link. As shown in the É.T. case, proof of a
direct causal link can be a serious obstacle when seeking compensation.
Furthermore, European law contains a general principle that the party which
makes a claim bears the burden of proof regarding that claim. This is also
applicable to a defence.137 In the case of nanotechnology, the injured party
usually does not have a real possibility of gathering all the detailed information
on the causal link or exact source of damage. Creating presumptions or changing
the burden of proof will mitigate the barriers posed by the current process of
proving causality. This would mean that the policy-maker will have to prove that
it has not infringed precautionary principles. With this change in the burden of
proof, the injured party will receive a real chance of obtaining compensation.
Taking into account the fact that the long-term consequences of
nanotechnology are mostly unknown, the limitation period plays an important
role in regulating public authority liability. The length of the limitation period in
the case of the EU liability is now five years from the moment of the event giving
rise to liability. The Court of Justice’s case-law indicates that the length of that
period has been determined from the perspective of the necessary amount of time
that the aggrieved party needs in order to collect the relevant information in
order to submit a claim, and to review the facts that are to be invoked in support
of that claim.138
This argument does not correspond with the nature and problems related to
nanotechnology. Unknown long-term consequences justify the proposal of
starting the limitation period from the time of an injured party’s knowledge
about the cause of the damage. The five-year limitation period itself seems
adequate as the scope of protection of the aggrieved party’s interests depends not
only on the length of the limitation period, but also on the manner in which its

inception is determined (e.g. the moment of occurrence of damage, the moment
of knowledge about the damage, the moment of knowledge about the source of
damage) and the possibilities for its interruption and/or suspension (e.g. the
impact of force majeure, the mediation, etc.).
It should be noted that the objective of the limitation period is, on the one
hand, to ensure protection for the rights of the aggrieved party and to give that
party sufficient time to file a claim, while on the other hand, to prevent a
situation in which the aggrieved party could endlessly delay pursuing their right
to compensation. The limitation period is intended to encourage the aggrieved
party to take action, and after its expiry, to stabilize the legal situation.139 The
primary objective of the limitation period concept is the more general protection
of the interests of the tortfeasor.
In conjunction with the fact that claims for damages against a public
authority can involve a financial burden on the public authority and thus the
state, the limitation period in the case of public authority liability is directly
associated with the necessity of solicitude about public finances.140 The
limitation period thus allows the state to protect its finances from the demands
of individuals who have not displayed the necessary diligence and failed to take
advantage of their rights in the time provided.141 The five-year limitation period,
counting from the time of knowledge about the source of damage seems an
appropriate balance.
To achieve an effective protection system, there are certain mechanisms that
should accompany hard law regulations. To avoid the situation in which the cost
of indemnification procedures will be incurred by citizens, it is necessary to create
a mechanism, which will separate payment of compensation by public authorities
from the state budget. A solution to this problem is the creation of a special
‘‘innovation fund”. The essence of such a fund would be to create a general
return mechanism and promote cooperation between public authorities and
private companies. The primary assumption of the innovation fund is that
companies using nanotechnology will share their profits with the government. It
could be, for instance, 0.05% of annual income or one pre-determined
contribution per five-year period. The innovation fund could serve a dual
function. First, public authorities can use it as a special fund to pay potential
compensation. If the public authority is found liable for taking inadequate
regulatory steps, injured parties will have a guarantee that there is a source to pay
compensation. At the same time, the payment of the compensation will be not

PUBLIC AUTHORITY LIABILITY & THE REGULATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 139
imposed on all citizens, which would be the case if the public authority had to
pay it from public funds (and public funds are based on taxation). Moreover, the
private sector’s contribution to the innovation fund will burden private
companies to a lesser degree than if the compensation was paid directly by
companies, mainly because it will only consist of a small part of the company’s
profits. Nevertheless, such a contribution does, to a certain extent, transfer the
financial burden to the private sector. This scheme should be considered
appropriate, as the companies are those parties which make the most profits.
The aim of the innovation fund is not only compensatory. The second
function performed by this fund would be the contribution to further
technological development, first by subsidizing further research and also by
ordering additional research. This role of the innovation fund distinguishes it
from an insurance scheme.
The financing of research and development (R&D) is of particular interest to
many modern policy-makers. A general objective of the EU, adopted in the 2010
under the Europe 2020 Strategy,142 is to increase total expenses on R&D to the
level of 3% of GDP.143 Statistics presented by the World Bank in 2015 show that
the percentage of GDP devoted to R&D looks as follows: World 2.23%, OECD
2.55%, USA 2.79%, and European Union 2.05%. The data also presents
important differences between EUMember States, e.g. Sweden 3.26%, Denmark
3.01%, and Finland 2.90%, as compared to Greece 0.96%, Latvia 0.63%, and
Romania 0.49%.144 In 2017, the OECD published a new edition of Research and
Development Statistics (RDS), which covers recent data on R&D in all OECD
countries and selected non-member states.145
It suggests that two-thirds of the expenditures on R&D should come from
the private sector.146 To encourage companies to spend more on stimulating
innovations, public authorities offer R&D subsidies to companies.147 However,
the impact of R&D subsidies on increasing expenditures in the private sector and
thus on fostering the innovation process is under discussion.148 There is also

148 See P. David, B. Hall & A. Toole, ‘‘Is public R&D a Complement or Substitute for
140 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND TECHNOLOGY [16 C.J.L.T.]
uncertainty as to whether such subsidies help to improve an internal technology
strategy in a company and what their impact is in the long-term on a company’s
development.149 Some research shows that while subsidies on research (activities
‘‘far from the market”) result in a larger budget on research activities, subsidies
on development (activities ‘‘close to the market”) decrease the expenditures for
development activities.150 Therefore, direct subsidies are not a fully adequate
mechanism for supporting R&D.
The other possibility for supporting further innovation lies in various
programmes financed from public funds, which are managed by research funding
agencies, either national or international. At the EU level, a grant system is
administered by the European Research Council (ERC). Funding awarded by
the ERC is based on open competition and is not limited to certain disciplines.151
The funding scheme is now, however, mainly dependent on Horizon 2020, the
European Union’s Research Framework Programme for 2014 to 2020.152 It
means that the grant system is limited to the framework adopted under this
programme. Furthermore, a seven-year period might be in some cases too long
for the same grant scheme. The scope and intensity of technological development
are evolving and growing faster than policy-makers can react.
Therefore, an innovation fund could provide a more efficient, flexible and
adequate response to the needs and requests of the private sector. Companies
and research centers should have the possibility of receiving funds on a regular
basis, not only within special programs or frameworks. The application for
funding should be based on a peer-review grant system, and the application,
including detailed objectives and research steps, should be assessed by an
independent and diversified commission composed of experts in a specific field.
Perhaps double-blind reviews would be sufficient to reach an objective decision.
Due to the two functions of the innovation fund, it should be organized by a
government agency and supervised by a relevant ministry (at the EU level, by an
EU agency and the European Commission respectively). The scope of
application should not be limited and should include both basic and applied
research, as well as development activities.

PUBLIC AUTHORITY LIABILITY & THE REGULATION OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 141
Funds collected by the public authority should remain non-refundable,
which means that after the limitation period they would not be returned to the
companies.
At the same time, the users of nanoproducts should be informed of the
nanomaterials used in products as well as of the risks related to nanotechnology.
Labelling, educational programs at schools, financed for example by the
innovation fund, and the contribution of the media, would be beneficial for
users, companies and public authorities. Users could then make a more informed
decision about whether they want to expose themselves to the possible risks.153
Along with educational programs, public authorities should perform a duty of
monitoring regulation on nanotechnology by creating constant commissions and
mandatory periodic reviews of existing legal rules (e.g. every three-five years).154
VIII. CONCLUSION
Nanotechnology undoubtedly poses new regulatory challenges. Although it
has certain known benefits, it poses considerable risks to its users, with unknown
and unpredictable long-term consequences. While looking for solutions to ensure
the adequate level of protection and to enable users the possibility of seeking
redress for damages caused by nanotechnology, I have examined the existing
legal framework for product liability in the EU. The notion of product
defectiveness, the shape of the development risk defence, and the limitation
period indicate that the application of the Product Liability Directive to
nanotechnology might be limited. In order to provide users with an adequate tort
law mechanism, I propose regulating a public authority liability for legislative
omissions. Policy-makers should take an active part in the compensatory process
since if and how technology will be used by companies usually depends on
governmental decisions. Users, on the other hand, should not bear all the costs of
introducing technology to the market. This proposal argues that public authority
liability should be a subsidiary claim to a claim against the producers of
nanoproducts, and be based on objective criteria. The burden of proof should be
changed in such a way that policy-makers will have to prove that they have not
infringed precautionary principles as they apply in regulating nanotechnology.
Further, the limitation period should run from the time of knowledge about the
cause of damage. There is also a need to introduce certain mechanisms
accompanying hard law regulation such as a special ‘‘innovation fund”, labelling,
educational programs on nanotechnology, as well as mandatory periodic reviews
of existing legal rules by government commissions.

Nanotechnology is an emerging field of technology that enables to control shape and size of various structures, devices and systems at nanometer scale on which one nanometer is equal to one-billionth of a meter. In spite of being a nascent field of science and technology, its scope of application – in the food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, construction, textile, electronics, and agricultural industries – is expanding rapidly. The risks associated to nanotechnology, however, and its long-term consequences are still largely unknown, particularly in regards to its health and safety impacts on individuals. In this context of uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding this emerging technology, it is highly problematic that the current legal liability framework in the European Union for defective products under Product Liability Directive (85/374/EEC), and the public authority liability for damage caused by EU institutions or by its servants in the performance of their duties under Article 340 (2) TFEU – fails to effectively protect users of nanotechnology.
Thus, it is imperative to ensure an adequate legal response in order to protect users of nanotechnology. This piece proposes a regulatory framework that will enable users to claim compensation from public authorities in cases of incomplete or insufficient regulations in regards to nanotechnology. The proposed liability scheme is based on (a) public authority liability as a secondary claim; (b) the infringement of objective precautionary principles; (c) whereby the burden of proof rests on the public authority; and (d) the limitation period for a claim for damages starts from the time of knowledge about the cause of damage.
Finally, this paper concludes by recommending the implementation of additional solutions to safeguard the protection of the users of nanoproducts. These include creating an innovation fund for companies to share their profits with public authorities; governmental research subsidies and programmes financed from public funds; and consumer awareness and education campaigns about risks related to nanotechnolog","['text', 'nanoproducts', 'regulation of nanotechnology', 'product liability law', 'Computer Law', 'Intellectual Property Law', 'Internet Law', 'Privacy Law', 'Science and Technology Law']",disabled

The management of nanotechnology: Analysis of technology 
linkages and the regional nanotechnology competencies 
 
Abstract 
This study maps linkage of nanotechnologies and their clusters; identifies emerging and mature technologies 
and links to their application fields; and examines the profiles of regional nanotechnology competencies. A 
model is proposed to assist with the analyses. The patent data were retrieved from the Thomson Innovation 
database, which were subsequently analysed with the Thomson Data Analyser (TDA). The results show 
technological linkages using the proposed linkage model, for example, the linkage between the cluster of 
nanotubes-nanowires-polymers and the cluster of nanowires-semiconductors-optical identifies a nanoelectronics 
domain. In the Techno-Economic Network (TEN) framework, the result shows that the US maintains its 
position in the Science and Technology poles, revealing its strong competitiveness, while the nanotechnological 
competencies in Japan have lost strength significantly in recent years. Asian giants such as South Korea and 
China appear to be the most likely contenders for catching up with the US. The theoretical contribution of this 
study is the theoretical framework that has been adapted and tested in this research. Practical contributions 
consist of descriptive and analytical findings based on actors’ performances and the regions’ competencies. The 
research offers a useful insight for academic and research practitioners on how an emerging field such as 
nanotechnology can be analysed, and a way forward for materialising science and technology policies in this 
field.

1 Introduction 
Nanotechnology is still a growing area and is considered to be an emerging technology (Bozeman et 
al., 2007; Linton and Walsh, 2008; Islam and Miyazaki, 2009). The progress of nanotechnological 
developments and innovations, and their diffusion into various industries, is changing fast as 
nanotechnology is a highly vibrant emerging field. Over the past few years, several attempts have 
been made to study nanoscience and technology management (for example, three highly ranked 
journals called ‘Research Policy’, ‘Technological Forecasting & Social Change’ and ‘Technovation’ 
have published special issues on nanotechnology). If one looks at similar methodological approaches 
in similar fields by other authors, one finds various bibliometric studies (Braun et al., 1997) on patent 
and publication documents with the aim of understanding innovation systems in nanotechnology from 
a sectoral basis to a national or global one (Miyazaki and Islam, 2007; Porter and Youtie, 2009; 
Shapira et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2003; Goetze, 2010; Cheng, 2012; Lee et al., 2009; Islam and 
Ozcan, 2013; Abraham and Moitra, 2001; Encaoua et al., 2006; Faber and Hesen, 2004; Wu and Lee, 
2007; Ozcan and Islam, 2014), while others focus on technological advances and economic progress 
2 
 
(Greif, 1992; Ma et al., 2009; Hidalgo et al., 2010; Bachmann, 1998; Trappey et al., 2011; Tseng, 
2011). Patent data were chosen as the data sources for this study because patent data are considered to 
be a valuable source of information in the innovation management field, for example, for identifying 
promising technologies and assessing technological advances and new trends,  recognising types of 
linkages between actors and for forecasting technological change (Archibugi and Planta, 1996). The 
main emphasis of this study is to examine technology linkages and regional technology competencies 
using the systems of innovation approach, which comprises the linkages and flow of information 
among actors, such as inventors and organisations, in terms of innovation processes (Lundvall, 1992; 
Liu and White, 2001; Doloreux, 2002; Yim and Kang, 2008; Guan and Chen, 2012), and patents are 
one of the sources to enable the identification of where, when and how these relationships occur.  
A review of the previous literature indicated that there were certain limitations to the existing 
research. These limitations could be divided into those concerned with the methodology applied and 
the type of research. In terms of methodology, previous studies used a different data collection 
method. For example, Huang et al. (2011) categorised lexical and patent classification queries by 
analysing related methodological studies. Porter et al. (2008), Mogoutov and Kahane (2007) and other 
similar studies have used  lexical queries to gather all patents with ‘nano’ terms, which resulted in a 
total of around 140,000 patents, though many were unrelated. However, Porter’s (2008) lexical search 
query appears to be one of the most reliable for publication data gathering, since there is no possibility of 
using a combination of patent classification codes with lexical queries in this category. Given the limitations 
and drawbacks of the existing approaches (Huang et al., 2003; Scheu et al., 2006; Porter et al., 2008), 
this research sets out to develop an improved method which uses a combination of both patent 
classification codes and lexical queries. This approach helps accurate nanotechnology patent retrieval. 
In terms of relevant research, existing studies (Ma and Lee, 2008; Petruzzelli, 2011; Genet et al., 
2012; Guan and Zhao, 2013) lack the degree of investigation of nanotechnological dynamics as 
opposed to the present study, which focuses on technology linkages and the competitive strengths of 
specialisation in the nanotechnology field.  
Through the use of extensive patent analysis, this paper maps linkage of technologies and their 
clusters, classifies mature and emerging technologies and their application domains, and examines the 
profiles of regional nanotechnology competencies. Focusing on linkage mechanisms and the strength 
of the degree of specialisation of countries and regions introduces a different level of analysis, and 
this could present different outcomes for technology management specialists and patent analysts. We 
think this should make a worthy contribution to the literature, methodology and practice concerning 
the acquisition of nano-knowledge and its exploitation in the field of management of innovation, 
science and technology.

2 Literature and analytical framework 
This study draws upon two streams of literature to set the foundation for our analysis of technology 
linkages and regional competencies in the nanotechnology field, namely, systems of innovation and 
techno-economic network theories. We look at the systems of innovation theory (Freeman, 1991; 
Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993; Edquist, 1997) in terms of the interactions of various actors in 
technology development and diffusion within the system.  This approach stresses the importance of 
knowledge flows in innovation processes and their application at different levels: national, regional, 
sectoral and technological (Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1993; Freeman, 1995; Cooke and Morgan, 1994, 
1998; Malerba, 2004; Carlson and Stankiewicz, 1991). Understanding innovation systems can lead 
policy makers to suggest strategies that best enhance innovative performance and overall 
competitiveness, and to identify bottlenecks within a system that can hinder technology development 
and diffusion. 
A versatile and useful method for characterising innovation systems based on the actors and their 
activities is provided by the Techno-Economic Network (TEN) (Figure 1) – network of interactions 
among actors – which elucidates the emergence and diffusion of technological innovations and which   
proposes three major poles, namely, the Science, Technology and Market poles (Callon and Bell, 
1991). A TEN framework can be adapted for a system of innovation study by using patent 
information in order to examine the linkages of actors in various poles. With analyses of the linkages, 
it should be possible to see how current technology sources are generated and how these actors are 
linked to each other within an innovation system.  
 [Insert Figure 1 here] 
Reviewing existing nanotechnology-related studies (OECD, 2009; Islam and Ozcan, 2013; Zheng et 
al., 2014) proved that the top nations (e.g. USA, Japan, China, South Korea, Germany) hold over 90% 
of patent share and lead the technological competencies in nanotechnology fields. It is essential to 
examine the leading nations’ involvement in technology capabilities, as nanotechnology is a field 
where the technological strengths and foci of each country may differ. The countries included in this 
analysis are: the United States, Japan, China, South Korea, Germany, France, United Kingdom and 
Russia. These countries were selected on the basis of their predominant roles in the field of 
nanotechnology. It may be beneficial to identify the Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) of 
leading nations, as they influence nanotechnology-driven industry. This paper aims to answer the 
following: how nanotechnology’s technological linkages are shaped due to its multidisciplinary 
nature; where the linkages between technological domains occur and their causes; and how the trend 
of technology competencies is changing with respect to the leading nations’ involvement in 
nanotechnology. 
4 
 
Given nanotechnology’s multidisciplinary nature, it is to be expected that technology domains will be 
linked to each other at various levels. To assist with the process of the linkages of technologies and 
clusters, a new technology linkage model is being proposed as an analytical framework (Figure 2) to 
illustrate a possible scenario of technology linkages in different scientific disciplines and technology 
domains. The proposed model assumes that the nanotechnology field is diffused among different 
scientific areas and technology domains. As such, it is to be expected that there are linkages within the 
same discipline or across disciplines with some particular patents. Moreover, one can assume there 
will be diffusion in terms of patent usage in some applications as they may require multiple patents 
from different patent owners. Figure 2 makes use of various components and sub-components to 
illustrate a possible scenario of technological development in multidisciplinary fields such as 
nanotechnology and biotechnology. Accordingly, it can be assumed that fundamental research in any 
scientific field leads to an opportunity of having applied research that results in patents and 
commercial applications. This new technological progress forms a technological domain (e.g. 
materials, electronics) that will be linked to a certain field such as Chemistry. In the nanotechnology 
area, these technological advances are not unidirectional but a combination of research efforts in 
different scientific fields and technological domains. Looking at patent clusters and how they are 
linked, it is possible to identify which fields and technological domains are linked to each other. 
Analysis of prevalent patent clusters and their linkages will reveal key technologies and their linkage 
mechanisms in the nanotechnology field.  
[Insert Figure 2 here] 
The nanotechnology field is one of the key areas for collaboration-related studies due to its intense 
level of research participation across disciplines and sectors and its involvement of various actors. The 
complex task of integrating different disciplines and fields involves creating new business structures, 
new management models and new systems. Therefore, it requires new systems to enable these 
changes and hybrid individuals that can fulfil the requirements of different fields. Considering the 
research nature and characteristics of the nanotechnology field, it appears to be essential to conduct 
in-depth research in this area to throw light on the above issues. 
3 Research design 
Patent analyses have been used extensively in research for a number of purposes including 
identification of new technology opportunities (Lee et al., 2009), technology networks and diffusion 
(Goetze, 2010; Cheng, 2012) and forecasting technologies (Daim et al., 2006). Compared with the 
majority of quantitative methods in business studies, patent data mining studies are less frequent and 
it is still a developing field. Moreover, many nanotechnology-related patent studies only started 
emerging from the late 1990s and the beginning of this millennium, so this is an important area to 
5 
 
work on. This research applies a tech-mining method (Porter and Cunningham, 2005) which has had a 
significant impact on the analysis of technology dynamics. The outline of the research design is 
shown in Table 1. The data for this study was retrieved from the Thomson Innovation database and 
analysed using the tech-mining software Thomson Data Analyser (TDA), which automates mining 
and clustering of terms occurring in patent abstracts and descriptors according to authors, affiliations 
or keywords that it recommends. The TDA allows the analysis of patent data and their visualisation in 
many ways, such as cleaning the data of duplicates or unnecessary items, mapping, clustering, co-
occurrence, factor analysis and citation networks. After collecting the patent dataset, there are still 
certain steps which need to be taken to optimise the data, for example, eliminating duplicates by 
obtaining patent data with the DWPI (Derwent Patent Index) and preparing categories and groups for 
analysis.  
[Insert Table 1 here] 
After optimisation is completed, various analyses can be undertaken, such as trend, landscape, 
network, patent portfolio, citation and topological analyses. For this, the TDA is used as it performs 
multidimensional statistical analysis to identify clusters and relationships among nodes. Each cluster 
is represented by nodes, the size of a node representing the number of patent documents that belongs 
to it, while its centrality represents how often that particular node occurs with other nodes. The 
closeness of nodes and their thicknesses are calculated on the basis of the significance and 
interrelationship level between each node, which in turn is calculated on the basis of how many of 
those documents belong to the node and how many of those documents are shared.  
In addition to the TDA, another offering of Thomson Innovation called the Themescape tool can be 
used. Themescape extracts text terms from a set of patent records and generates a topological map 
showing the frequency of a term’s occurrence as apparent peaks on a geographical island. 
Themescape was used to map key technologies and allowed the categorisation of documents 
containing similar content, as they were placed near each other on the map. The density of documents 
can be indicated with tall or small peaks and the distance between peaks sheds light on the 
relationship between content, as peaks that are located closer to each other have more closely related 
content than peaks that are located farther away. Contour lines indicate relative document density and 
by using the tool it is possible to zoom in on a specific area whereby new contours, labels and 
documents can be revealed.   
This research also maps the profile of the nanotechnological competencies for nations. The patent data 
were converted to calculate the relative technological advantages of regions in nanotechnology. The 
Revealed Technological Advantage (RTA) index (Cantwell, 1993; Patel and Pavitt, 1997; OECD, 
2011) provides an indication of the relative specialisation of a given country in selected technological 
domains. A value above 1 indicates relative strength and a value less than 1 indicates relative 
6 
 
weakness. The regions of high share and high RTA can be interpreted as being countries with a 
relatively strong share in the Technology pole (i.e. relative importance to competencies in 
nanotechnology) and having distinctive advantages nationally. The region of low share and low RTA 
reveals countries allocating relatively fewer resources to technology or science and having less 
distinctive advantages nationally. It is to be noted that the value of the benchmark share in the X-axis 
is difficult to identify and varies depending on various dimensions such as the countries or region 
considered, innovation process analysed, national requirements etc. In this case, a break-even share 
has been chosen in order to accommodate all countries in such a way that a proper comparison of their 
technological or innovation performance can be made. Therefore, in this analysis, what matters is the 
direction of movement and comparative positions rather than absolute positions. 
One of the biggest challenges in a patent analysis is to gather required patent data by selecting the 
appropriate search terms so that the data set includes the relevant patents and excludes unnecessary 
patents, thus increasing the validity of the research. This study offers a more effective method with an 
improved patent search query which uses a combination of both patent classifications and lexical 
queries to exclude unrelated patents. Considering the limitations and drawbacks of existing patent 
data collection approaches the following search approach and terms were used: 
(AIOE=(B82*) OR FIC=(B82*) OR UCC=(977*)) AND ALLD=(nano* OR quantum* OR Qdot OR Qubit 
OR atom* OR probe OR epitax* OR fullerene* OR thin ADJ wire* OR thin ADJ film* OR buckyball* OR 
scanning ADJ microscope* OR tunnelling ADJ microscope* OR scanning ADJ electron* OR bionano* OR 
bio-nano* OR gCNT* OR Peapod* OR CSCNT* OR CNT* OR g-CNT* OR colloidal ADJ crystal*) 
The patent data collection and filtration process is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows how the 
required patents were collected.  49,544 individual nanotechnology patents were obtained after 
optimisation for the period of 1970–2012. The optimised data were imported into the TDA to validate 
the results further. Duplicate results were eliminated and variations of company, inventor, institutes 
and university names were unified where they appeared as separate patent assignees. After the dataset 
was cleaned and prepared, various functions offered by the TDA were utilised to generate the required 
analysis.

4 Results 
4.1 Nanotechnology patent contribution by Corporate-Academic-Inventors  
Previous studies have failed to investigate nanotechnological developments with respect to their 
provenance, be that academic, industrial or sole inventor.  The benefit of this section is to show where 
7 
 
academia’s, industry’s or inventors’ foci are in terms of technological domains. Table 2 illustrates the 
extent to which academic, industrial and sole-inventor involvement differs by country. In the US, 
Japan, Germany and the UK, corporate actors have a greater involvement than academic 
organisations.  This is mainly due to the presence in these regions of large corporate players with an 
interest in patenting their technologies. Another reason why patenting activity is predominantly 
business driven in these countries is that they are host to the world’s largest electronics corporations 
(such as IBM in the US and NEC in Japan), which perceive themselves as having a significant vested 
interest in nanotechnological applications. 
 In China, Russia and Taiwan, academic institutions are more heavily involved than their corporate 
counterparts, an unexpected outcome given the nature of their patenting activities. These results have 
been combined with interview analyses in order to understand why these three countries have higher 
levels of academic involvement. In China’s case, interviews with key experts in the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences and Tsinghua University were conducted and it was found that this is mainly due to state 
policy on funding: academia is allotted the largest funding share and there are relatively few sources 
of funding made available for academic-industrial collaborations. In addition, China’s patenting 
system is politically driven and gives considerable support and motivation to academia to file patents. 
Patent filing is closely linked to promotion, the award of bonuses and further research grants, and is 
prioritised over publications.   
[Insert Table 2 here] 
 
In this section, patent classifications are used to examine academic, corporate and inventor 
involvement and to discover in which technologies they are highly concentrated. Table 3 shows that 
while the significant patent share is held by industrial players, as is to be expected, academic 
involvement is still noteworthy. In the fields of E (General Chemicals), B (Pharmaceuticals), S 
(Instrumentation, Measuring and Testing) and D (Food, Detergents, Water Treatment and 
Biotechnology), academic involvement is almost at the contender level or at the same level as that of 
corporate players. 
[Insert Table 3 here] 
 
4.2 Key technologies and their links to application fields 
This research identifies mature and emerging technologies in the nanotechnology field and their 
applicability to relevant market domains. Table 4 shows some of the mature technologies such as 
V08-A04A (semiconductor laser), U12-E01B2 (semiconductor body with quantum wire, wells, super-
lattices) and U11-C01J6 (semiconductor materials and processing, strained layers and their 
8 
 
manufacture). Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that nanotechnology inventions with 
semiconductor materials and applications are relatively mature compared to other nanotechnologies. 
Looking at the emerging technologies, A12-W14 (polymer applications with nanotechnology) appears 
to be the most rapidly developing technology area in this field, as in 2004 there were only 72 patent 
records while this increased to 1,283 records in the peak year of 2008 (see Figure 4). Moreover, 
almost 35% of the patents appear to have been granted in the last 3 years. Another emerging 
technology is U11-A14 (nano-structural materials) for which 23% of patents have been granted in the 
last 3 years. The peak point for U11-A14 was in 2006 with 393 patent records, while in 2003 there 
were only 47 patent records. Between 2006 and 2009, there were over 300 patents granted for nano-
structural materials each year.  
Another technology within the nanotechnology field that has shown promising growth in recent years 
is E05-U03 (carbon nanotubes). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) had only 4 patents in 2000, but this 
gradually increased to 417 patents in its peak year of 2004. Between 2004 and 2009, the number of 
patents in the CNT field was always higher than 350 patents per year. The rapid increase in CNT 
patent documents is due to the recognised importance of this nanostructure in a very broad field.  
[Insert Figure 4 here] 
Professor Fan Shoushan1 was interviewed to help elucidate the findings of this research even further. 
A successful example can be given to show how an interlinked activity is turned into a commercial 
product through the efforts of both parties (a linkage between Tsinghua University and Foxconn). 
Since nanotubes were first invented, Tsinghua University has gained the capability of controlling the 
growth of CNTs and of transferring CNTs into long films in MWCNTs (multi-walled carbon 
nanotubes). CNT thin films are used to produce touch screen appliances that replace formerly used 
materials like indium tin oxide (ITO). Furthermore, this technology can be used for OLEDs (organic 
light emitting diodes) to make screens flexible.  In this Tsinghua-Foxconn case, personal relationships 
and trust between parties were found to be a vital element in managing such linkages between 
academia and industry. Most importantly, there had to be a mutual benefit and both parties had to 
have a need for each other.

second highest patent holder in the nanotechnology field (398 patents).

4.3 Themescape illustration of nanotechnology linkages and clusters 
In our proposed model as shown in Figure 2, it was assumed that there would be linkages within the 
same discipline or across disciplines, within their technological domains and their fields, and that 
there would be diffusion from one to the other. An examination of patents clusters shows which fields 
and technological domains are linked to each other. Using the Themescape mapping tool,  the key 
technology terms are mapped for all the nanotechnology patents available (Figure 5),  the density of 
technology terms is indicated topographically, and the distance between peaks throws light on the 
relationship between content as peaks that are located closer to each other have more closely related 
content than peaks that are located farther away. Overall, it is possible to see which domains have 
significant relevance within the nanotechnology field. An example is the linkage between the 
nanotube-nanowire polymers and the cluster of nanowire-semiconductor-optical applications, which 
identifies a nanoelectronics domain. By using the Themescape illustration, some of the dominant 
domains become very apparent and this leads to the identification of general fields such as chemical 
science (powders-nanoparticle-aqueous), optoelectronics (semiconductors-laser-quantum dots), 
biotechnology (protein-molecules-nanoparticles), and nanotools (probe-microscope-scanning). The 
Themescape map (Figure 5) provides support for the framework proposed in Figure 2 regarding 
technological linkages.  
As shown in Figure 5, the technological linkages between patenting clusters and the volume of these 
linked patents can be seen by the contour height between each technological field. Nanotube, polymer 
and semiconductor terms appear together in one of the highest peaks, which indicate the dominant 
field of a high number of content availability within each technology and the strong relationship 
between them. It can be predicted that nanotubes, semiconductors and polymers have the potential to 
be key materials under the nanotechnology umbrella in various sectors and most importantly in the 
electronics field, where they increase the efficiency of materials in many ways such as by increasing 
the mobility and reliability of electrical properties of circuits. It has been found that random arrays of 
nanotubes can form semiconducting and conducting networks. Commonly, single-walled carbon 
nanotubes are used with polymer semiconductors in this kind of application. Some of the applicability 
of these materials in the industry is in display technologies, storage devices, sensors and printed 
electronics. At present, the scientific endeavour is to make carbon nanotubes a practical option for 
transistors in microprocessors and other electronics. This is one of the reasons why large 
establishments in the electronics industry such as Samsung, Foxconn and NEC are seriously investing 
in these nanomaterials, as the patents granted in this area are likely to become one of the key 
competitive advantages in the future. 
In relation to relative applicability of nanostructures, it can be seen that nanowires and carbon 
nanotubes have conjoint applicability. We also looked at why nanotubes, nanowires and 
semiconductors appear together on the Themescape map. Nanowires are wires at nanoscale and 
10 
 
consequently are very thin structures. Scientists hope to use them to build tiny transistors for 
computer chips and other electronic devices. The characteristics of nanowires vary depending on the 
element that is used and they can have the properties of an insulator (e.g., SiO2, TiO2), a 
semiconductor (e.g., Si, InP, GaN) or a metal (e.g., Ni, Pt, Au). By arranging semiconductor wires in 
the right configuration, it is possible to create nanotransistors which can act as switches or amplifiers. 
Also, they can be used as logic gates (AND, OR and NOT gates) in semiconductor nanowire 
crossings. The nanostructures that can be made from nanowires can be used to build a nanocircuit 
with the help of carbon nanotubes, for example, with nanotube-based transistors (CNTFET). Yet 
again, this is a field in which large electronics companies are conducting research and attempting to 
gain key patents.

4.4 Regional nanotechnology competencies 
The data was converted to calculate regional advantages in nanotechnology as it is preferable to 
compare these on a relative rather than absolute basis. This transformation has been widely adopted in 
recent works on comparative technological developments at both country and sector level (Cantwell, 
1993; Patel and Pavitt, 1997; Islam and Miyazaki, 2010). The dynamic changes in the comparative 
positions of different regions are identified for categorising the technological competencies of firms in 
the Science and Technology poles. As illustrated in Figure 6, the X-axis represents the share of patent 
activities in the Technology pole and the Y-axis indicates the Revealed Technological Advantage 
(RTA) of countries, which enables the measurement of the comparative advantage of scientific and 
technological strength.  
The results indicate that the US maintains its high share in the Technology pole and a high RTA zone 
in all periods (above 40% patent share), revealing its strong competitiveness in the relevant 
technology field (see Figure 6). On the other hand, the Japanese position in the technology 
competencies moved from a high share and high RTA zone in the 1900–1994 period towards a 
significant low share and low RTA zone in the 2004–2009 period. The Japanese contribution in the 
nanotechnology field was substantial (41%), comparable to the US, in the early 1990s and then it 
slowly declined to around 25% in 2005–2009. This indicates that relative to other regions, the 
nanotechnological competencies of Japan had atrophied in the mid-2000s and have fallen behind in 
recent years. A similar trend was observed in the case of top European players (e.g. Germany and the 
UK). The decline in RTA in this case may be due to the entry of Asian rivals. 
By contrast, Asian countries’ trajectories are moving in the opposite direction to that of Japan and 
Europe. The top regional players exponentially improved their position in the early 2000s, which may 
11 
 
be due to their actors’ initiatives and policies to push nanotechnology into potential sectors. Countries 
such as South Korea and China (and Russia) gained substantial strength in nanotechnological 
competencies in the 2004–2009 periods. Our RTA analysis indicates that the Asian giants’ 
nanotechnology competencies have been focused on, and directed towards, the production of 
nanomaterials and their applications in nanotechnology-based products. It seems China is the most 
likely candidate for achieving parity with advanced countries. Within public infrastructures, several 
grassroots organisations are sprouting up to take advantage of nanotechnology. It is very interesting to 
see that, in their Nanotechnology pole, the development of the Asian players is exponential in nature. 
The analysis reveals learning patterns of technology and innovation structures for the Technology 
pole from a comparative evolutionary perspective.

5 Discussion 
The motivation to conduct this research is the increasing pace of nanotechnology development and 
diffusion worldwide. The main output of this research is in the area of nanotechnological dynamics 
focusing on the technology clusters and their linkages, involvement of academia’s and industry’s foci 
in terms of technological domains, and a comparison of regional competence building. In this paper, a 
new linkage model is proposed which assumes that this field is diffused among different technology 
domains, which in turn reflects the linkages within the same disciplinary fields or across disciplines. 
As such, the study of nanotechnological linkages has presented novel and highly informative results in 
terms of interrelationships within the field in comparison to previous studies. By using the 
Themescape tool, specific nanotechnology-related terms were analysed to identify the dominant 
technology clusters and to see how technology linkages are formed, their intensities and their various 
usages. It can be seen which domains have significant relevance within the nanotechnology field, for 
example, the linkage between the cluster of nanotubes-nanowires-polymers and the cluster of 
nanowire-semiconductor-optical applications identifies a nanoelectronics domain. Some of the 
dominant domains become very apparent and this leads to the identification of general fields such as 
chemical science (powders-nanoparticle-aqueous), optoelectronics (semiconductors-laser-quantum 
dots), biotechnology (protein-molecules-nanoparticles), and nanotools (probe-microscope-scanning). 
The involvement of academia is found to be more dominant than corporate actors in China and 
Russia, as academia has been given a greater funding share. In particular, in China, a politically 
driven patenting system gives considerable support and motivation to academia to file patents, while 
corporate actors’ involvement is higher than that of academia in the US, the UK, Germany and Japan, 
as large corporate players are located in these regions. With respect to the involvement of key actors 
in the nanotechnology field, the electronics industry’s ownership of patents is dominated mostly by 
12 
 
large organisations. Also a considerable heterogeneity was found in patenting activity. There are two 
main reasons for this. Firstly, large organisations have the capability to provide the large investment 
necessary for R&D activities and they are aware of the benefits of these technologies in terms of their 
efficiency and for bringing about incremental innovation characteristics. Secondly, they collaborate 
with academic organisations, such as universities, to benefit from their inventions as well. The second 
point is not found in every national innovation system, but of those where there are such 
collaborations, for example, Korea, the US and Japan the systems appear to be the most effective. 
The results also show the regional strengths and weaknesses in competence building processes. An 
interesting outcome of this research is that it shows that Asian players over the last few years have 
had a huge involvement in this area. It appears that South Korea and China are now catching up with 
Japan and are close to the US in terms of the number of nanotechnology patents granted. To gain an 
understanding of comparative dynamics, we have compared the relative technological advantages of 
Europe, the US and the Asian regions. This indicates that the US has maintained its leading position 
in the Technology pole with a high share and high RTA in all periods, revealing its strong 
competitiveness in the nanotechnology field. Relative to other regions, the nanotechnological 
competencies in Japan started losing strength in the mid-2000s and have continued to fall behind in 
recent years. A similar trend was observed in the case of top European players (e.g. Germany and the 
UK). The decline in RTA may be due to the entry of other Asian countries (especially the exponential 
growth of South Korean firms) into nanotechnological activities. As China has a relatively low 
percentage share in the Technology pole, its distinctive advantage in nanotechnology is still low, but 
promises to be greater in the future.  
6 Conclusion 
6.1 Contribution of the study 
This study has discussed how this research, its methodological approach and its findings have reduced 
the identified gaps and improved on weaknesses in this research field. Furthermore, it points out 
practical and theoretical contributions to the field and reports key findings related to research 
objectives. Practical contributions consist of descriptive and analytical findings based on various 
different types of categories such as actors’ performances and regions’ strengths and competencies 
that offer specific determinants for linkage mechanisms in the nanotechnology field. The case of 
Tsinghua-Foxconn represents successful practice in this field, and its study has increased the depth 
and quality of the findings. The outcomes of this study were also found to be useful for other 
innovation-related collaborations. The theoretical contributions of this study are the theoretical 
frameworks that have been adapted and tested in this research. The technology linkage model allows 
the identification of technology clusters and their linkages to application or market domains. 
13 
 
Accordingly, this model could be adapted to different fields such as biotechnology or with other types 
of data such as publications. 
Apart from the practical and theoretical contributions, there are also methodological contributions 
from this research. As explained in the research design section, this study has greater validity than 
other studies due to its large sample size and greater accuracy of its patent search query, which used a 
combination of both patent classification codes and lexical queries. Using only patent codes has a 
weakness in that unrelated patents appear in the patent data due to errors in their classification, but 
this was one of the common approaches adopted by other studies. This study offers an effective 
method of patent data gathering when compared to other methods and could be considered to be 
reliable as technological links were checked with multiple sources and supported by Themescape 
mapping and interview data analysis that extended the findings in the nanotechnology field.  
With regard to the TEN model, networks and clusters within the nanotechnology innovation system 
showed that boundaries of interactions are not limited to the national level and there are interactions 
between different types of organisations, so it is not possible to limit this field into certain sectors. 
However, an identified weakness is that the linkage between the Science pole and Market pole is not 
strong enough in terms of innovation processes. There are some strong linkages, such as between 
Tsinghua-Foxconn, but these types of linkages are rare overall. The weakness in collaboration 
between the Science and Market poles may be why the nanotechnology field is not in its highly 
commercialised stage and one of the reasons can be related to its collaborative innovation process. 
This is because there are many radical level patented inventions that are owned by academic actors 
but the majority of these technologies have not yet transferred to industry.  
6.2 Implications and future research 
The implications of this study are the following:  
1) The substantial increase in patent generation by Asian organisations leading to their catching up 
major players such as the US, especially South Korea and China, is having a great impact in the 
nanotechnology field.  
2) Mapping of mature and emerging technologies within the nanotechnology field indicates future 
commercial applications.  
3) Even though some nations such as the US are strongly involved in the nanotechnology field in 
general, it was very apparent that the key capabilities of each country and various organisations were 
widely divergent. This implies that nations and organisations should provide and have targeted funds 
and R&D to accelerate development in this field.  
4) Governments should encourage (i.e. by funds, special policies and targeted intermediaries) their 
active or potentially active organisations to become involved in the nanotechnology field to gain 
14 
 
competitive advantage and help establish clusters or networks to adapt and develop nanotechnology 
rapidly.  
5) Active or potentially active organisations should become involved in this field to gain competitive 
advantage.  
6) Management in intermediaries and fund providers should focus on linking academic and industrial 
organisations together and the majority of funds for innovative activities should be targeted towards 
collaborative research. 
 
To take this study further, there are many other relationships that could be looked at within the sub-
fields of nanotechnology. Future studies could look at specific technology domains, such as 
nanomaterials, nanodevices and nanofabrications. As was mentioned above, there are some 
organisations and inventors that hold a high number of patent documents, but the question is whether 
they are highly influential patents in terms of citations, commercial potential and quality. Interviews 
and surveys collected from academic and non-academic organisations could be used to gain a more 
in-depth understanding of the topic. A statistical analysis of the relationships pertaining between 
commercialised patents and the latest patents granted could be carried out to examine various 
relationships between inventions and innovations.

ABSTRACT  
 
Since a significant time ago, although time runs very fast, nanotechnology 
transformed from one of the most promising scientific hopes in 
uncountable human domains into a marvelous certainty. Innumerable 
scientific studies in several areas of knowledge were made since nanoscale 
emergence, carrying their contribution to the nanoscience development, 
leading to a great development of technical and scientific knowledge but 
also raising numerous problems in the ethical field. In this chapter, 
nanotechnology is discussed both in terms of ethics and in terms of borders 
that nanotechnology applications must satisfy and concluding notes are 
presented, highlighting the results of the analysis. Significant 
considerations are made on the close connection between ethics and the 
nanotechnology and the effects over the society and values.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Bearing in mind that nanotechnology is the skill to work at the atomic, 
molecular and supramolecular levels (at a scale of approximately 1 – 100 
nm), the enormous possibilities raised by the work of nanomaterials can be 
easily understood. The creation and the use of these material structures, 
devices and systems with essentially new properties and functions result 
from their very small structure, with applications in several areas, such as 
bioprocessing in industries; molecular medicine, considering physical, 
chemical, biological, and medical techniques used to describe molecular 
structures and mechanisms, often referred as personalized medicine; 
analyzing the health effect of nanostructures in the environment; improving 
food and agricultural systems; in summary: improving human performance 
at many fields, considering the different branches of science and the 
applications at many dimensions and scales. 
Indeed nanotechnology, for instance, supplies the tools and the 
technology, allowing that researches lead to the transformation of biological 
systems, to the extent that biology provides models and bio-assembled 
components to nanotechnology. 
Another relevant example: nanoscales, used in biosystems, contribute to 
enhance very innovative and promising results in medical area; 
improvements in telemedicine and on health may be expected with new 
systems operation and new nanotechniques, much less invasive and 
therefore much less uncomfortable for patients.  
However, ethical as far as legal and social implications are postured. 
This discussion is as old as the issue itself but the boundaries are too much 
large, even large enough to find out the difficulties on finding definitive 
answers to this discussion. In the next section this issue is approached in 
general terms. Follow a section on ethical human dignity and in the next two 
sections are approached the themes of nanotechnology and  
 
Ethical Considerations on Nanotechnology 3 
environment, first, and of ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace. Then 
a framework for ethical analysis in nanotechnology is presented and this 
work finish with a concluding remarks section. In the end a short 
bibliography on these subjects is presented. 
 
 
ETHICS AND NANOTECNOLOGY  
 
Computers have brought an increase in the ability to type and made 
handwriting more and more superfluous, even obsolete. Mobiles and their 
miniaturization brought the ability to generally communicate from anywhere 
with anybody, making more and more useless the traditional phones. 
Nanotechnology, because of the negligible dimension of devices this 
technology proportionate, will spread the use of devices that now are 
nuisance. For instance, the pacemaker that presently is used like a “last 
resource”, certainly soon will be used in a much larger scale because it is 
hopeful that will be possible to design it at a nanoscale level. 
However ethical questions quickly rise with the development of 
nanotechnology: 
 
 What are the borders for this kind of progress?  
 Until where it is admissible and wise to go?  
 What are the implications in a later phase of development – 
obviously unknown - of these technologies? 
 
Global discussion has begun about this theme since the beginning of the 
discoveries about this subject. Legal, ethical and social implications are 
irreversible and the discussion is usually asked to be hard and not pacific, 
needing urgently great clarifications. 
Vanessa Nurock - see citation in Bensaude-Vincent (2010)- questions 
the standard view of an ethics for nanotechnology. She argues that none of 
the current trends in the discipline of ethics would qualify for application to 
nanotechnology. Then considering that neurotechnology – a rapidly  
 
Manuel Alberto M. Ferreira and José António Filipe 4 
growing field in the intersection between nano and biotechnology – can 
affect moral capacities of the brain, she suggests that ethics itself may be 
affected by nanotechnology. And she leaves as open the question of a co-
construction of ethics and bionanotechnology. In short: new approaches 
must be considered, but which ones? 
In Freitas (2005) it is affirmed that the society should be “able to muster 
the collective financial and moral courage to allow such extraordinarily 
powerful medicine to be deployed for human betterment, with due regard to 
essential ethical considerations”. 
At EU, there are some important concerns and discussion about the 
development of the integration of human beings and artificial 
(software/hardware) entities. A funded project in this area (ETHICBOTS) 
was created to promote and to coordinate a multidisciplinary group of 
researchers into artificial intelligence, robotics, anthropology, moral 
philosophy, philosophy of science, psychology, and cognitive science, with 
the common purpose of identifying and analyzing techno-ethical issues 
concerned precisely with the integration of human beings and artificial 
(software/hardware) entities. 
Next generations, in the perspective of nanomaterials utilization, will 
obtain many benefits in all these issues: health, economic, environmental, 
etc. By using this kind of advanced technology, with many more applications 
and much welcoming using, the conditions this technology offers will be 
very environmental friendly as well as already seen.  
Actually, there are irreversible and long-term impact consequences for 
forthcoming generations and for the environment. However, there are risks, 
as well. But in truth there are incredible potential advantages. And the 
discussion is all over the place. That borders must be considered is, of 
course, evident and there has to be an achieved balance between the path 
found to the new dimension of knowledge and the contours specific for the 
problem. The rub of the question is exactly in what measure criticisms may 
have into account the technology potential. 
 
 
Ethical Considerations on Nanotechnology 5 
Ethical Human Dignity 
 
Despite the high feasibility for the economy and the environment, there 
are some considerations regarding the ethical, human dignity and moral 
borders on nanotechnology that should be taken into account.  
It is interesting to have a look to the definition of human dignity and its 
connection to moral conveyed in the “opinion of the European Group on 
ethics in science and new technologies to the European Commission”, 2005, 
when discussing the ethical aspects of information and communication 
technologies (ICT) implants in the human body. The group makes allusion 
to the EU’s draft Treaty that Establishes a Constitution for Europe, stating 
that “Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected” 
(Article II-61), and goes on to explain that “the dignity of the human person 
is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis of 
fundamental rights” (Declaration concerning the explanations relating to the 
Charter of Fundamental Rights). This group declares yet that this 
explanation does not strictly define human dignity and that many writers 
have attempted to fill this gap. One such attempt suggests that human dignity 
is defined as follows: “the exalted moral status which every being of human 
origin uniquely possesses. Human dignity is a given reality, intrinsic to 
human substance, and not contingent upon any functional capacities which 
vary in degree. (…) The possession of human dignity carries certain 
immutable moral obligations. These include, concerning the treatment of all 
other human beings, the duty to preserve life, liberty, and the security of 
persons, and concerning animals and nature, responsibilities of 
stewardship.” 
The introduction of new devices to go further above the natural 
capabilities of the human being brings lots of alarms to scientific 
community. Desires, challenges but also concerns are always present… 
What are the consequences? To human beings, to life itself, to other living 
beings, to environment, to biodiversity, to progress, to the civilization as a 
whole... 
 
Manuel Alberto M. Ferreira and José António Filipe 6 
Which are the consequences about the limit for the human being as 
human? Are humans creating a new being? Are humans prepared to get 
different, biologically and to become another thing? Are humans creating 
further “nano-digital devices” between humans that have access to these 
advanced technologies and humans that have not access? This discussion is 
recognized but probably the ethical discussion has not been enough 
promoted. And possibly no one is enough prepared to participate effectively 
and wisely on it. Much reflection, study and information is still needed. 
 
 
Nanotecnology and Environment 
 
In the long term, which are the consequences that nanotechnology has 
in the environment? Is it possible to predict that less damage in nature can 
be done if nanomaterials are considered instead of large equipment are used? 
Besides, once the need of inputs to produce these devices is lesser, probably 
there is an additional advantage on this perspective for nature preservation. 
But what is the reverse of the medal? 
Let’s have a look on the following situation: 
 
 There is a growing consensus today that it is considered priority 
should be given to the development of alternative energies over the 
classical energies. It turns out that the classic energies price of 
production is cheaper than that of the alternative energies. But in the 
case of solar energy, produced with nano-photovoltaic panels, the 
price, though higher, is already comparable to, say, hydroelectric 
energy. In this case, this difference in costs can be compared with 
the environmental damage caused by the construction of dams. And 
even with the damage due to the pollution produced by the operation 
of the fuel oil plants. There is here an ethical problem in which one 
balances between paying a little more and preserving the 
environment or paying less and destroying it, in which the interests 
installed with the classical energies will hardly abdicate their 
positions without struggle, see (Ferreira et al., 2014). 
Ethical Considerations on Nanotechnology 7 
Really, the implications and directions of nanotechnology need 
further discussion. The consequences of avoiding the discussion 
may be severe for society, considering rejection or fear of the 
effects. So it is pertinent to ask:  
 Is there a need for a regulatory authority?  
 Which kind of mechanisms are needed to regulate the 
nanotechnologies developments area? 
 
 
ETHICS AND NANOTECNOLOGY IN THE WORKPLACE 
 
A theme urgently needing study and reflection concerns the potentially 
harmful effects on workers’ health due to their exposure to nanoparticles in 
companies dealing with nanotechnology. Indeed, very little, to say nothing, 
is known about these harmful effects. 
In similar situations the harmful effects on workers’ health were only 
identified after long periods of activity, with the occurrence of real disasters 
in sanitary terms. One has to learn from history and try to avoid situations 
such as, for example, atomic energy in which, only relatively late, the 
harmful effects of radiation have been noticed. And only then were the 
necessary preventions taken, after the damage to health occurred in the 
workers of the plants and in the neighboring populations. And today 
humanity, in general, is not very confident on those preventions. However, 
atomic energy was initially used for war purposes which helps explain, but 
by no means excuse, this late reaction. The same is not true for  
nanotechnology, so it is natural that the attitude towards the problem is 
different. 
Thus, in the absence of scientific knowledge on the potentially negative 
health effects of workplace exposure to nanoparticles, it is necessary to 
establish guidelines for decision making regarding risks and controls. 
Identifying the ethical issues involved certainly helps with proper 
decision-making. It is therefore imperative for the decision-makers, 
particularly the employers, the workers, the investors, and the health 
authorities, to be aware of these issues. As the primary objective of 
Manuel Alberto M. Ferreira and José António Filipe 8 
occupational safety and health is the prevention of accidents and diseases in 
workers, the situations with the ethical implications that affect those most 
will be, see (Schulte &Salamanca-Buentello, 2007): 
 
(a) Identification and communication of hazards and risks by scientists, 
authorities, and employers, both from the perspective of each of 
these groups and from a global perspective; 
(b) Awareness and acceptance of risks by workers; 
(c) Adequate choice and strict implementation of controls; 
(d) Establishment of medical screening programs; 
(e) Investment in toxicological research; 
(f) Investment in control research. 
 
Ethical issues involve the independent and impartial determination of 
risks, implacability, autonomy, justice, preservation of privacy, and 
promotion of respect for people. Their identification and implementation 
will make the options for decision-makers more evident. And company-wide 
discussions on the workplace hazards of nanotechnology can be reinforced 
by a special emphasis on small businesses and the adoption of a global 
perspective. 
Ethical questions about nanotechnology in the workplace arise from the 
state of knowledge about the dangers of nanomaterials and the hazards and 
risks they may pose to workers’ health. As this knowledge is still incipient, 
it is imperative to carry out a provisional assessment of the hazards and risks. 
Workers can exercise their autonomy only if the processes leading to hazard 
identification and risk assessment are transparent, comprehensible, and 
credible. Employers will be in accordance with the principles of autonomy, 
beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, privacy, and respect for persons, as 
far as, see (Schulte & Salamanca-Buentello, 2007): 
(a) Portray hazards and risks without any omission; 
(b) Address risks from a social security perspective;

FRAMEWORK FOR ETHICAL ANALYSIS  
IN NANOTECHNOLOGY 
 
A methodology for conducting an organized and coherent discussion 
about ethics in this subject is to subdivide it by the following topics of 
analysis (see Mnyusiwalla et al., 2003): equity, privacy, security, 
environment, and metaphysical when discussing the relationship in the 
human-machine binary. About each one of them some considerations may 
be made. So, assuming these topics, and trying to go as far as possible in the 
analysis: 
 
 
Equity 
 
The classical dichotomy of developed and developing countries raises a 
new topic for discussion. Indeed, technology and development are closely 
correlated. Examples of great worries for developing countries are: 
 
 People poverty reduction,  
 Energy problem,  
 Water problem, 
 Health problem, 
 Biodiversity maintenance. 
 
 
Nanotechnology would help these countries to better conditions of 
population health and way of life. But it is costly to implement any project 
in this area and more often there are no financial resources available. 
Developing countries will be lesser benefited with these advances than 
Manuel Alberto M. Ferreira and José António Filipe 10 
developed countries. The main problem happens with the access to the 
benefits of technology considering the poorest and the richest people inside 
any country. Who may effectively reach the advances of science and take 
benefit from them? Anyway, it is true that poor people, whatever they are, 
may benefit, in some measure, from these advances. It may depend on the 
will of politicians and on the investments capacity (one way of overcoming 
countries’ lack of investment capacity is their indebtedness which, as many 
current cases show, is nevertheless a generator of future and sometimes very 
serious financial problems)of some of these countries, for example. A result 
would be lower needs for energy and a cleaner energy production as well as 
other environmental benefits: a safer drug delivery, the improvement on 
health through for example better prevention, diagnosis and treatment. 
 
 
Privacy 
 
At this level, it is to consider the enormous innovations which can be 
reached, by improving surveillance devices or other devices that restrict 
human privacy. An individual may be facing situations of “invisible” 
microphones and cameras. This is a real problem if privacy is intended to be 
assured. Wireless monitoring provides healthcare providers and patients to 
be mobile and being able to exchange data when needed. But there is the 
reverse of the medal: privacy violation? It is true that wireless 
communication and new physiological sensors bring enormous implications 
in e-health. One point needed is about the necessary discussion on privacy 
and security. 
 
 
Security 
 
Surely new powerful weapons will be available very soon, as far as 
“invisible” microphones and cameras will be available. Will this ensure new 
ways of security or will be added to a potential “arsenal of bio-terrorism and 
techno-terrorism or even nano-terrorism?” (see Mnyusiwalla et al., 2003). 
Ethical Considerations on Nanotechnology 11 
Mnyusiwalla et al., 2003 also ask “who will regulate the direction of 
research in defensive and offensive military NT [nanotechnology]? How 
much transparency will be necessary in government and private NT 
initiatives to avoid misuses? There are also very interesting legal questions 
involving monitoring, ownership, and control of invisible objects”. 
 
 
Environment 
 
This topic was already approached above in the section 
“nanotechnology and environment” due to extreme importance of the 
subject there considered: the production of electrical energy through 
nanophotovoltaic panels versus the production through classical means. 
Obviously this does not exhaust the subject. So, going on, new materials 
(fullerenes, carbon nanotubes) are now available. No one knows what will 
be the precise effects when this kind of nanomaterials goes into the 
environment (and also the effects on health). What are the dangers? Where 
are they put in the end of their mechanical lives? Will some medical devices 
be kept inside human body? What are the consequences? Or will be given 
another destiny to them? Is it possible to predict any kind of effects caused 
to the environment? Jacobstein (2006) refers that it is important to make an 
analysis on the risks associated to passive compounds in the less than 100 
nanometer size range. There is the possibility, for example, of being 
introduced inadvertently in human bodies. There is in fact the concern with 
their ability to be inhaled,  
 
 
absorbed through the skin, or to pass through biological compartment 
barriers such as the blood brain barrier. This kind of dangers pose a real 
range of potential health and environmental risks that are associated to their 
potential toxicity or mutagenicity in their interactions with biological 
systems (note the analogy of this situation with the considered above in 
“ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace”). While the range of effects 
vary, most of the risks may be addressed by advanced industrial hygiene and 
Manuel Alberto M. Ferreira and José António Filipe 12 
environmental health practices and techniques that seek to characterize the 
specific risks, exposure patterns, and control methods and enforce them 
through a combination of practitioner education, industry self-regulation, 
monitoring and government regulation. This is an important emerging field 
in the environmental and health sciences, since most of the existing 
legislation on environmental, safety, and health risks may cover particulates, 
but do not take the change in physical and biological properties at the 
nanoscale into account. It is reasonable to assume that passive nanoscale 
particle risks, although potentially serious if not addressed, will be 
characterized and addressed systematically under new versions or 
extensions to existing occupational, industrial hygiene, environmental, and 
medical regulations. 
 
 
Metaphysical 
 
The incorporation of implants in human body, this is, the incorporation 
of artificial materials or machines into human systems may conduct to a 
concern around the human values and principles; will a human being be 
more than a human being? The borders are unknown. What kind of being 
and what kind of consequences. How this process may be controlled and 
accessed? One of the main issues is the “autonomy” of nano-bots, that is: 
robots whose components are at or near the scale of a nanometre 
(10−9meters), if they are able or not to move and to take decisions 
autonomously. Are they able to communicate each other and with the 
external environment? How can human beings ensure to “retire” them at the 
end of their “missions”? This is a very demanding question. The 
modification made on human bodies and living systems may create new 
realities. This is already a very real concern on the society, being in general 
the society often very skeptic about developments in this area. Catherine 
Larrère, see citation in Bensaude-Vincent (2010), discusses “the recent 
trends in nanoethics which anchor ethics in metaphysics or theology by 
emphasizing the emergence of new relations of men to nature and to God. It 
is defended that the moral issue raised by the project of enhancing human 
Ethical Considerations on Nanotechnology 13 
performances does not really lie in going beyond the boundary of human 
knowledge and condition. It is more a question of the moral choice 
underlying this new form of hubris”.  
Now in another although similar recording, nano-bots, or in general the 
“convergence” of bio-nano-info-neuro technologies, requires a new contract 
between science and society; society should not be seen as an afterthought 
only for making technology assessments, for social acceptability, etc. 
However, they should be really involved in the process; “converging 
technologies” - like syn-bio - should not be developed “inside the walls” of 
research labs only by highly specialized scientists, such challenges should 
be introduced requiring a cross-disciplinary approach, where project teams 
include anthropologists, sociologist, philosophers, and ethicists ... with a 
“precautionary principle” in mind... 
Researchers in ethicbots project in EU, which was finished in 2008, 
worked in order to identify techno-ethical case-studies on the basis of a state-
of-the-art survey in emerging technologies for the integration of human and 
artificial entities; to identify and analyze techno-ethical issues concerned 
with the integration of human beings and artificial entities, by means of case-
studies analysis; to establish a techno-ethically aware community of 
researchers, by promoting workshops, dissemination, training activities, as 
well as by the construction of an internet knowledge-base, on the subject of 
techno-ethical issues emerging from current investigations on the interaction 
between biological and artificial (software/hardware) entities; to generate 
inputs to EU for techno-ethical monitoring, warning, and opinion generation 
(see Capurro et al., 2005-2008). 
Rodotà & Capurro (2005) show the limitations on ICT implants in the 
human body as deriving from an analysis of the principles contained in 
various legal instruments. They say that they should be assessed further by 
having regard to general principles and rules concerning the autonomy of 
individuals, which takes the shape of freedom to choose how to use one’s 
body, “I am the ruler of my own body”, freedom of choice as regards one’s 
health, freedom from external controls and influence. 
 
 
Manuel Alberto M. Ferreira and José António Filipe 14 
CONCLUSION 
 
Ethical, legal and social implications in this context show the 
importance of nanotechnology to the society and the consequences that the 
development of nanotechnology possibly will bring to mankind in the future. 
The irreversibility and long-term impact of these new developments enforce 
to have in mind that it is necessary to take into account also the rights of 
future generations and the planet (like Hans Jonas’ “Principle of 
responsibility”). 
Indeed, the future is there and came quick and loudly. Even before the 
right time. The innovations are going fast and sprout from everywhere. And 
although the endemic crisis, mainly economic but also social and politic, 
will bring some restrictions to the investments in health and research areas 
in many countries, new developments in this area will prevail and many 
discoveries will be made. The machine is very well assembled and perfectly 
lubricated: innovations are growing and development is there, as much as 
the will to go faster and further in many domains of scientific investigation. 
The research on this subject gets new results every day and new challenges 
have to be faced. Some work is going on this way and it is intended, in a 
forthcoming occasion, to analyze some data in order to detect and study the 
impact of the actual crisis on nanotechnology and mainly on applications to 
medicine and industry. The crisis may bring some restrictions, but there is a 
strong will to face the challenges and a new beginning is there.  
Ethics concerning nanodevices and the borders of human beings 
considering nanotechnology in general and applied to medicine (where these 
concerns assume usuallya more dramatical aspect) also need a new research 
to be developed next. This debate of the borders of the human being 
regarding the application of nanotechnology may be also enlarged in order 
to have a study of the impact into telemedicine and e-health. 
The ethical issues related with the themes “nanotechnology and 
environment” and “nanotechnology in the workplace” are extremely critical, 
difficult to approach subjects whose development is hard to predict, due to 
the lack of knowledge of the situations. It can only be filled in the future 
after observing the practical situations. However, it all requires the try to 
Ethical Considerations on Nanotechnology 15 
create credible scenarios that can frame future decision-making processes. It 
is also urgent, in both theses cases and the above referred, to think about 
what kind of authorities, possibly with a regulatory vocation, will need to be 
created to supervise the activities that will appear in the field of 
nanotechnology.

13. ABSTRACT (maximum 200 words)  
 
Presently, the regulatory framework for nanotechnology consists of regulating entities addressing 
concerns about nanotechnology under existing rules and laws. This thesis answers this question: How can 
regulatory decisions of policymakers regarding the framework of nanotechnology regulation be informed 
by a map of the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology and a review of the regulatory frameworks for the 
aviation and biotechnology industries? 
To make recommendations about the appropriate regulatory framework for nanotechnology, this thesis 
reviews the existing regulatory frameworks of aviation and biotechnology and maps the regulatory landscape 
in the United States by examining stakeholders, regulatory entities, and applicable legislation. The landscape 
map and review of existing regulatory frameworks reveal that the established regulatory framework could 
be sufficient for the current state of nanotechnology if the limitations of technical expertise are addressed. 
This expertise can be provided by advisory committees of technical and industry experts to the 
Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Consumer Product Safety Commission, 
and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

ABSTRACT 
Presently, the regulatory framework for nanotechnology consists of regulating 
entities addressing concerns about nanotechnology under existing rules and laws. This 
thesis answers this question: How can regulatory decisions of policymakers regarding the 
framework of nanotechnology regulation be informed by a map of the regulatory landscape 
of nanotechnology and a review of the regulatory frameworks for the aviation and 
biotechnology industries? 
To make recommendations about the appropriate regulatory framework for 
nanotechnology, this thesis reviews the existing regulatory frameworks of aviation and 
biotechnology and maps the regulatory landscape in the United States by examining 
stakeholders, regulatory entities, and applicable legislation. The landscape map and review 
of existing regulatory frameworks reveal that the established regulatory framework could 
be sufficient for the current state of nanotechnology if the limitations of technical expertise 
are addressed. This expertise can be provided by advisory committees of technical and 
industry experts to the Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, and National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Technological advancements are an important part of human existence. From the 
dawn of humans’ emergence as the dominant species on earth, the ability to create and use 
tools has been a primary accelerator of that dominance. Tools have been used to make life 
easier but also to make even better tools and later machines, which eventually led to 
complex computing. Each of these advancements has led to new plains of discovery, 
capabilities, and achievement, but also to new and unexpected dangers.  
As new technologies are developed, there are some that affect only a minute section 
of the world’s population, but others are revolutionary and have the potential to directly or 
indirectly affect every human on earth and even the earth’s ecology. Many scientists 
suggest that nanotechnology is one of these revolutionary technologies. The idea that 
nanotechnology represents revolutionary change leads many to believe that regulating this 
emerging technology is of paramount importance. 
Presently, the regulatory framework for nanotechnology consists of existing 
regulating entities addressing concerns about nanotechnology under current rules and laws. 
If nanotechnology does develop to be the dramatic influence many predict it will be, it is 
fair to question whether existing agencies, rules, and laws are sufficient to address 
regulation, product approval, policy advice, and industry monitoring for the emerging field 
of nanotechnology. 
A. OBJECT, METHOD, LIMITS, AND OUTPUT 
The objective of this thesis is to aid and inform the regulatory decisions of 
policymakers by mapping the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology, reviewing current 
regulatory frameworks, and making recommendations on the appropriate regulatory 
framework for nanotechnology. This thesis identifies the relevant federal stakeholders in 
relation to nanotechnology, gives a brief description of the state of the technology, analyzes 
applicable laws related to the technology that have already been enacted, and examines the 
regulatory framework of aviation and biotechnology. This thesis is aimed primarily at those 
delivering regulation in national agencies, regulatory policymakers, and other concerned 
 xviii 
stakeholders and citizens focused on the safe development and production of new 
technologies.  
Additionally, this research advances the establishment of a regulatory framework 
for nanotechnology. As the technology matures, policymakers will be faced with unique 
regulatory challenges. Now is the time to begin identifying the best regulatory framework 
for nanotechnology; it is important not to wait until a crisis occurs. 
The method used to achieve these thesis objectives was an investigation into the 
background, current state, and future projections of nanotechnology development, a federal 
stakeholder analysis, a review of current nanotechnology-related policy and legislation, 
and an examination of the regulatory framework in the aviation and biotechnology 
industries. The researcher generated a list of stakeholders based on organizational 
publications, stated interest in nanotechnology, membership to nanotechnology 
organizations such as the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), and implied interest 
in nanotechnology. The scope of this research is focused on mapping the regulatory 
landscape of nanotechnology and reviewing current regulatory frameworks. The research 
describes the background, current state, and future projections of some leading minds in 
the field of the technology, but it does not attempt to predict future advances in 
nanotechnology. However, it does relate realistic probabilities based on research. The 
output of this research is a set of recommendations for policymakers and other 
nanotechnology stakeholders. The goal for these recommendations is that they will serve 
as a starting point for establishing a regulatory framework for nanotechnology in the United 
States. 
B. FINDINGS 
Mapping the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology has revealed several key 
findings:  
1. The regulatory landscape of nanotechnology is vast and has many 
stakeholders and potential pitfalls to regulation. 
2. There is very little consensus on many aspects of nanotechnology. 
Researchers disagree on the definition, rate of technological advancement, 
proper regulation, potential dangers, future state, or end use of the 
 xix 
technology. The one thing nearly everyone agrees on is that nanotechnology 
will potentially be one of the most important technologies of this century.  
3. The scope of nanotechnology’s influence reaches across several industries 
and sectors of society. As it matures, there will likely be no part of society 
untouched by this emerging technology. 
4. The current state of nanotechnology is a robust one, with more than 1,800 
products known or thought to be using the technology.1 Despite this 
proliferation, the environmental, health, and safety implications of 
nanoengineered materials throughout a nanotechnology product’s life cycle 
remain largely unexplored.  
5. The current regulatory approach to nanotechnology is to address it under 
existing laws; however, these laws may not be sufficient to address the 
future challenges of nanotechnology. For instance, the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, which is tasked with ensuring products are safe for 
consumers, lacks the funding and personnel to properly address 
nanotechnology in products already in the marketplace. 
6. Nanotechnology is important to the long-term health of the U.S. economy. 
The U.S. government has invested significant resources in the advancement 
of nanotechnology research. For instance, the NNI has received nearly $24 
billion in federal funding since 2001.2 
7. There have been many pieces of legislation directly or indirectly related to 
nanotechnology. Most legislation focuses on research and development, not 
on regulation.  
8. Despite their very disparate missions, many federal agencies are involved 
in nanotechnology research, development, and regulation. 
9. Aviation and biotechnology have different regulatory frameworks that can 
inform the recommendation for nanotechnology’s regulatory framework.  
C. RECOMMENDATIONS 
The recommendations of this thesis come as a result of identifying obstacles to 
regulation and determining, based on stakeholder analysis and the regulatory landscape, 
which would be the best framework for nanotechnology regulation. The first 
recommendation is to follow the advice of Jeffrey Matsuura and “display confidence in

their existing regulatory systems by relying on those rules and processes to oversee the 
ongoing introduction of nanotechnology into additional commercial applications,”  while 
addressing the limitations of this approach.3 The primary limitation is the high level of 
technical expertise required for understanding the technology and therefore for 
recommending policy or enacting rules or regulations. The primary regulatory institutions 
should be those identified as high-power, high-interest on the stakeholder matrix: the 
Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Consumer Product 
Safety Commission (CPSC), and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. To 
ensure the appropriate level of expertise is available for regulatory decisions, it is 
recommended that each of these four agencies sponsor an advisory committee of technical 
and industry experts under the guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 
(Public Law 92-463). These advisory committees will provide relevant and objective 
advice which is open to the public for review. Following this recommendation would set 
up the United States for success regulating the nanotechnology now and in the future, no 
matter how it develops.  
The second recommendation of this thesis is to conduct, through the National 
Science Foundation (NSF), a multiyear comprehensive study to determine the 
environmental, health, safety risks, and impacts of nanoengineered materials. Without 
knowing the risks associated with the technology, one cannot reasonably determine what 
future regulation should look like. Once researchers identify the risks, policymakers can 
enact reasonable regulation. 
The third recommendation is to review funding for the CPSC. According to 
research, the CPSC is too undermanned and underfunded to accomplish its mission, 
especially in light of the many products now using nanoengineered materials.4 Congress 
should review this agency to identify to what extent funding and manning should be 
increased.

 xxi 
The fourth recommendation of this thesis is to increase public awareness of 
nanotechnology and promote public engagement through an education program providing 
government funded literature and public television/radio programming. An engaged and 
educated public is necessary to guard against the damage of misinformation regarding 
nanotechnology.  
The fifth recommendation is to fund a scholarship program, through the NSF, for 
students seeking advanced degrees in nanotechnology-related research fields. The research 
reveals how the United States is falling behind other developed countries in the science, 
technology, engineering and math fields of learning.5 A scholarship program designed for 
nanotechnology will not only help to address this problem, but also provide the expertise 
of the future needed to guide regulation as the technology matures. 
The sixth and final thesis recommendation is to continue funding nanotechnology 
research in the federal budget. This research shows agencies such as the NNI are playing, 
and will continue to play, an important role in the future of nanotechnology development.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Technological advancements are an important part of human existence. From the 
dawn of humans’ emergence as the dominant species on earth, the ability to create and use 
tools has been a primary accelerator of that dominance. Tools have been used to make life 
easier and to make even better tools and later machines, which eventually led to the creation

As new technologies are developed, there are some that affect only a minute section

indirectly affect every human on earth and even the earth’s ecology. Many scientists 
suggest that nanotechnology is one of these revolutionary technologies. The idea that 
nanotechnology represents revolutionary change leads many to believe that regulating this 
emerging technology is of paramount importance. As Doug Parr, chief scientist for 
Greenpeace in the United Kingdom asks, “If it will dramatically affect everyone, shouldn’t 
everyone have a say in what developments take place—with what impacts, under whose 
control, and with who benefiting (and losing)?”1 Perhaps the idea that everyone should 
have a voice is unachievable at this time, but it is reasonable that at the least some 
governing body should have oversight of the developing technology. Without sufficient 
oversight, we run the risk of repeating the mistakes of the past: a promising and 
advantageous technology applied swiftly and aggressively but without thorough testing, 
vetting, or limitation. Some examples would the public health risks created by the past use 
of asbestos and lead. 
Presently, the regulatory framework for nanotechnology consists of existing 
regulating entities addressing concerns about nanotechnology under current rules and

laws.2 If nanotechnology does develop to have the dramatic influence many predict, it is 
fair to question whether existing agencies, rules, and laws are sufficient to address 
regulation, product approval, policy advice, and industry monitoring for the emerging field 
of nanotechnology.  
There are many roadblocks to developing suitable nanotechnology regulation. One 
major roadblock for nanotechnology regulation stems from the lack of consensus on the 
definition of nanotechnology. It is difficult to construct an architectural framework for 
nanotechnology regulation when many leaders within the field cannot agree on what the 
term even means. According to Andrew Maynard, Professor in the School for the Future 
of Innovation in Society at Arizona State University and co-chair of the World Economic 
Forum Global Agenda Council on Nanotechnology, “a sensible definition [for 
nanotechnology] has proved hard, if not impossible, to arrive at.”3  
A brief perusal of nanotechnology stakeholders reveals a myriad of definitions upon 
which their interaction with the technology is based. For instance, nanotechnology is 
defined by the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative as  
the understanding and control of matter at dimensions between 
approximately 1 and 100 nanometers where unique phenomena enable 
novel applications. Encompassing nanoscale science, engineering, and 
technology, nanotechnology involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and 
manipulating matter at this length scale.4  
In 2010, the European Commission released this definition for public comment: “a material 
that consists of particles with one or more external dimensions in the size range 1 nm-100 
                                                 
2 Note: regulatory framework is the “existence of the necessary infrastructure which supports the 
control, direction or implementation of a proposed or adopted course of action, rule, principle or law.”

nm for more than 1 percent of their number;” and/or “has internal or surface structures in 
one or more dimensions in the size range 1 nm-100 nm;” and/or “has a greater than 60 m2/
cm3, excluding materials consisting of particles with a size lower than 1 nm, excluding 
materials consisting of particles with a size lower than 1 nm.”5 In the 2003 law 21st Century 
Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, the U.S. Congress defines 
“nanotechnology” as “the science and technology that will enable one to understand, 
measure, manipulate, and manufacture at the atomic, molecular, and supramolecular levels, 
aimed at creating materials, devices, and systems with fundamentally new molecular 
organization, properties, and functions.”6 The inaugural issue of Nature Nanotechnology 
in 2006 asked a wide array of researchers, industrialists, and scientists what 
nanotechnology means to them. Unsurprisingly, the 13 different individuals queried 
yielded 13 different responses. This lack of a commonly agreed upon nanotechnology 
lexicon makes regulation difficult. 
Another roadblock arises because nanotechnology is still an emerging technology. 
When establishing regulation, the regulating entity and those empowering the regulation 
assume that the regulating entity has the knowledge of what “good behavior” in an industry 
should be.7 This assumption is somewhat flawed because predicting the way a new 
technology will be developed and adopted is very difficult. Therefore, predicting what 
“good behavior” in an industry will look like is also very difficult.8 This challenge of 
regulation does not mean regulation should be ignored until the technology is mature, but 
rather that it is necessary to implement a regulatory framework that can both address

problems as they arise and attempt to prevent future problems by exercising foresight into 
what the near-term and long-term technological developments may be. 
Next, the properties of engineered nanomaterials make categorization of these 
materials difficult under current regulatory definitions. For example, according to the 
National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), at the nanoscale, a particle’s properties such as 
“melting point, fluorescence, electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, and chemical 
reactivity change as a function size of the size of the particle.”9 Additionally, according to 
the NNI “nanoscale materials have far larger surface areas than similar masses of larger-
scale materials. As surface area per mass of a material increases, a greater amount of the 
material can come into contact with surrounding materials, thus affecting reactivity.”10 
These physical properties provide much of the basis for why the technology has the 
potential to be revolutionary. However, according to Beaudrie, Kandlikar, and Satterfield, 
“not enough is known about the relationship between nanomaterial physicochemical 
characteristics and behavior to anticipate risks. The result is a serious lack of predictive 
analytical capacity to anticipate harmful implications.”11 
Also problematic is that nanotechnology research and development encompass 
many different fields of science and across several sectors of society. These sectors include: 
energy, electronics, defense/homeland security, chemicals, communications/information 
technology, manufacturing, government, food and agriculture, pharmaceutical/health 
companies, transportation, education, and commerce/economics. This broad range of 
potential application blurs the lines of regulatory responsibility across different regulatory 
agencies. Also, each of these sectors contains stakeholders who have differing concerns 
and interests in the technology and are often competing with one another for the funding 
of research and development.

As scientists, lawmakers, and concerned citizens approach the seemingly 
intractable task of nanotechnology regulation, it would be useful to have a comprehensive 
map of the current landscape for nanotechnology regulation in the United States, including 
a federal government stakeholder review, description of the state of the technology, and 
applicable laws that have already been enacted related to the technology. That information 
is presently distributed across diverse industries and stakeholders. This thesis aggregates 
and analyzes this information to inform the decisions of those who will be making 
regulatory decisions on nanotechnology development.  
A. RESEARCH QUESTION 
The emerging field of nanotechnology presents very difficult challenges to 
policymakers and those interested in guiding its research and development in a responsible 
way. This thesis maps the regulatory landscape in the United States by examining 
stakeholders and regulatory entities and reviewing component elements of legislation and 
policy to provide those with an interest in nanotechnology regulation with a common entry 
point. This thesis answers the question: How can regulatory decisions for policymakers 
regarding the framework of nanotechnology regulation be informed by a map of the 
regulatory landscape of nanotechnology and a review of existing regulatory frameworks? 
B. OBJECT, METHOD, LIMITS, AND OUTPUT 
The objective of this thesis is to aid and inform the regulatory decisions of 
policymakers by mapping the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology, reviewing current 
regulatory frameworks, and making recommendations on the appropriate regulatory 
framework for nanotechnology. This thesis identifies the relevant federal stakeholders in 
relation to nanotechnology, gives a brief description of the state of the technology, analyzes 
applicable laws that have already been enacted related to the technology, and examines the 
regulatory framework of other industries. Additionally, this thesis is aimed primarily at 
those responsible for regulation in national agencies, regulatory policymakers, and other 
concerned stakeholders and citizens focused on the safe development and production of 
new technologies. Furthermore, this research will advance the establishment of a regulatory 
framework for nanotechnology. As the technology matures, policymakers will be faced 
 6 
with unique regulatory challenges. Now is the time to begin identifying the best regulatory 
framework for nanotechnology; it is important not to wait until a crisis occurs. 
The method used to achieve these objectives was an investigation into the 
background, current state, and future projections of nanotechnology development, a federal 
stakeholder analysis, a review of current nanotechnology-related policy and legislation, 
and an examination of the regulatory framework in the aviation and biotechnology 
industries. This researcher generated list of stakeholders based on organizational 
publications, stated interest in nanotechnology, membership to nanotechnology 
organizations (such as the NNI), and implied interest in nanotechnology. The scope of this 
research is focused on mapping the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology and reviewing 
current regulatory frameworks. The research describes the background, current state, and 
future projections of some leading minds in the field of the technology, but it does not 
attempt to predict future advances in nanotechnology. However, it does relate realistic 
probabilities based on research. The output of this research is a set of recommendations for 
policymakers and other nanotechnology stakeholders. The goal for these recommendations 
is that they will serve as a starting point for establishing a regulatory framework for 
nanotechnology in the United States.  
C. OVERVIEW OF CHAPTERS 
Following the introduction to research on this topic, Chapter II provides 
background information on nanotechnology including the history of the technology, the 
current state of the technology, and where some predict the future of the technology lies as 
it matures. The information in Chapter II forms the foundation of the thesis. Chapters III–
V are the pillars on which the conclusion is formed, and recommendations made. Chapter 
III examines the regulatory and legislative spaces around nanotechnology. It discusses 
relevant regulatory theory and examines differing viewpoints on the future of 
nanotechnology regulation. Additionally, Chapter III contains a look at the legislation that 
directly relates to nanotechnology. Chapter IV includes a federal nanotechnology 
stakeholder analysis intended to identify relevant stakeholders and demonstrates how each 
organization’s disparate mission provides the impetus for involvement in nanotechnology 
 7 
research, development, and regulation. Chapter V examines the regulatory frameworks for 
the fields of aviation and biotechnology. Finally, Chapter VI reviews the findings of the 
previous chapters and gives regulatory framework recommendations for nanotechnology.

II. NANOTECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND 
This chapter provides background information on nanotechnology, including the 
history of the technology, the current state of the technology, and where some predict the 
future of the technology lies as it matures. This background information gives a 
foundational understanding of nanotechnology and explains how far the technology has 
advanced in a relatively short amount of time. This background information also reveals 
why nanotechnology regulation needs to be addressed. Additionally, it shows the potential 
for future advancements which further highlight the need for a regulatory framework to 
address regulation, policy advice, product approval, and industry monitoring. 
In December 1959, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman delivered his 
groundbreaking talk “There’s Plenty of Room at The Bottom” at the California Institute of 
Technology.12 During the few minutes Feynman spoke, he introduced many of the 
foundational concepts of nanotechnology; however, in 1959, the sophistication of 
microscopes precluded research into these revolutionary concepts. Nanotechnology 
remained theory until the development of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981. This 
new microscope allowed scientists to “see” at the atomic level.13 Thus, began the age of 
modern nanotechnology.  
As scientists realized the implications of manipulating matter at this minute level, 
a vast array of potential applications for nanotechnology began to spring forth from their 
imagination. In 1986, K. Eric Drexler published Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of 
Nanotechnology. This book set forth several concepts and views of the future that were at 
once groundbreaking, controversial, and frightening to some. Drexler’s work is 
controversial. He carried on an open debate from 2001–2003 with Nobel Laureate in 
chemistry Richard Smalley about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers—a 
concept fundamental to many of Drexler’s assertions.14 Despite the controversy, he is cited

as one of the leaders in the field of nanotechnology, as his work acted as a catalyst for 
others to speculate about nanotechnology, draw conclusions, and envision applications. 
A. APPLICATIONS AND CURRENT USES OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 
Nanotechnology has the potential to affect nearly every aspect of human life, from 
clothing to transportation, agriculture, computing, energy, water treatment/filtration, 
infrastructure, and healthcare. Below are just a few examples of the many potential 
possibilities of nanotechnology when the technology reaches maturity. 
1. Cancer Detection and Treatment 
In 2016, cancer took the lives of 595,690 people in the United States.15 The ability 
to detect cancer in its earliest stages is paramount to effective treatment. The National 
Cancer Institute (NCI), Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer has been working to 
leverage advancements in nanotechnology to drastically improve how cancer is diagnosed, 
treated, and hopefully prevented.16 Since its inception in 2004, the NCI Alliance for 
Nanotechnology in Cancer has generated more than 3,000 peer-reviewed publications, 
filed more than 220 disclosures and patents, formed more than 85 companies directly 
associated with the alliance to commercialize technologies developed in academia, and 
conducted 17 cancer related clinical trials from testing eight alliance-affiliated 
therapeutics.17 The alliance hopes the progress of this research will eventually lead to the 
eradication of cancer. 
With many others, alliance scientists are working on the technology to construct 
sensors that are able to pinpoint specific biomarkers, including unusual genes, which might 
be the harbinger of later cancer development.18 Additionally, the development of nanoscale

cantilevers, which bend in the presence of cancer causing biomarkers, could be used by 
doctors for early detection. Nanotechnology cannot only improve the accuracy of initial 
diagnosis, but it can allow these diagnoses to be made sooner using molecular contrast 
agents and materials.19  
To more effectively treat cancer, researchers are developing multifunctional 
targeted devices able to deliver “multiple therapeutic agents directly to cancer cells.”20 
Researchers are also working on engineered nanoshells that would concentrate at cancer 
lesion sites and release a small energy source, such as a near infrared light, to destroy cancer 
cells.21 Another potential treatment involves delivering tiny amounts of chemotherapy 
drug directly to cancer cells, thereby limiting the damage done to healthy non-cancerous 
cells.22 Researchers are also working on developing nanoparticles capable of crossing 
biological barriers to improve therapies for cancers that are currently very difficult to 
treat.23 These examples are just a very small sample of the many exciting possibilities for 
cancer detection and treatment using nanotechnology. 
2. Energy 
In the 21st century, it has become clear that existing methods of sourcing, 
distributing, storing, and consuming energy have put enormous strains on the earth’s 
ecology. Primary energy sources include hydroelectric, fossil and mineral fuels, and

23 An example of a biological barrier is the blood-brain barrier. According to May Bates, “The brain is 
the only organ known to have its own security system, a network of blood vessels that allows the entry of 
essential nutrients while blocking other substances. Unfortunately, this barrier is so effective at protecting 
against the passage of foreign substances that it often prevents life-saving drugs from being able to repair 
the injured or diseased brain.” May Bates, “The Blood-Brain Barrier,” Brain Facts, July 2, 2014,

nuclear sources.24 Research has shown these are destructive to the environment as they 
have been linked to global warming, the destruction of the biosphere and geosphere, 
pollution, the depletion of the ozone layer, and ecological devastation.25 To address these 
issues, scientists have begun researching ways to optimize the production of renewable 
energy using nanotechnology based solutions.26 Additionally, according to Dr. Wolfgang 
Luther of VDI Technologiezentrum GmbH (Germany) in the study titled Application of 
Nanotechnologies in the Energy Sector, “Nanotechnologies provide the potential to 
enhance energy efficiency across all branches of industry and to economically leverage 
renewable energy production through new technological solutions.”27 See Figure 2. 
Examples of enhanced energy production include nanoscale semiconductor 
catalysts intended to improve the process of using sunlight to produce hydrogen from 
water, nanostructured solar panels which use a broader spectrum of sunlight to improve 
efficiency in transforming sunlight into electricity, and carbon nanotubes (using carbon 
nanotube fibers) that can potentially reduce energy transmission losses by one percent.28 
This reduction of energy transmission losses would be equivalent to saving 24 million 
barrels of oil annually within the United States alone.29

3. Water and Food 
Nanotechnology has the potential to be used to fulfill the basic human needs for 
clean water and food. As the world population continues to expand, it is rapidly depleting 
precious natural resources. In his book Water: The Epic Struggle for Wealth, Power and 
Civilization, the journalist Steven Solomon lays out convincing arguments that water will

Water desalination and filtration systems that use nanotechnology may provide 
clean water solutions to the vast portions of the earth in desperate need of clean water. 
These filtration systems could be portable, affordable, and scalable, granting universal 
access to clean water.33

researching, developing, testing, and in some cases, already actively applied in food 
technology.34 Though the following list is quite extensive, it is not exhaustive.

4. Nanosensors 
Nanosensors can be engineered to detect particles like pathogens, bacteria, toxins, 
explosives, or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).36 Recently, researchers have made a 
breakthrough in the detection of trinitrotoluene, more commonly known as TNT. The new 
nanosensor technology may allow for not only the detection of the explosive material but

also to determine how much of the material is present.37 This enhanced sensor may 
eventually replace bomb sniffing dogs.38 Sensor technology as a means to detect chemical 
and explosive threats is one of the primary areas of interest for the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate.39 Additionally, nanosensors may 
also be used to detect airborne chemicals for pollution monitoring, for medical diagnostic 
purposes, to monitor in a more detailed way physical parameters such as temperature, 
displacement, flow, etc., and as accelerometers in micro-electro-mechanical devices, such 
as airbag sensors.40 Additionally, according to Hahm and Lieber in 2004, the development 
of “detectors for DNA and other biological macromolecules has the potential to impact 
basic biological research as well as screening in medical and bioterrorism applications.”41  
5. Information Technology 
Research into nanotechnology may be used to further miniaturization of computers 
and simultaneously make them more powerful. Forming nanoscale components through 
self-assembly may be the next evolution in low cost yet highly effective microscale 
integrated circuits and possibly replace the use of silicon chips as the standard for 
computing devices.42 Nanotechnology applications in the storage of data may offer 
solutions for the storage of big data. In Nanofuture: What’s Next for Nanotechnology, Hall

suggests it will be possible to store up to 500 terabytes of information on a device the size 
of a fine grain of sand.43 
A 2013 experiment using the K computer at the Riken research institute in Kobe, 
Japan, the world’s fourth fastest supercomputer, demonstrated the difficulty of replicating 
the computing power of the human brain. After 40 minutes, the supercomputer, using 
82,944 processors, produced just one second of human brain processing time.44 Despite 
the difficulty replicating the human brain’s computing capacity, computing power 
leveraging nanotechnology may lead to artificial intelligence that matches and eventually 
surpasses the capabilities of the human brain. The implications of such a development are 
as widespread as the imagination allows.  
6. Reverse Aging/Anti-aging 
In a 2006 interview for Computerworld, Ray Kurzweil, recipient of the National 
Medal of Technology and Innovation (nation’s highest honor for technological 
achievement), presented his beliefs that within the next 40 years, widespread use of 
nanotech devices will allow humans to overcome disease and aging as well as to reach a 
state of near immortality.45 Kurzweil is not alone in this belief. J. Storrs Hall, author of 
Nanofuture: What’s Next for Nanotechnology, describes the process whereby nanorobots 
are introduced to the body either topically, orally, or by injection. These nanorobots would 
then perform the functions of cell maintenance and cell repair.46 Theoretically, these 
nanorobot treatments would eliminate aging; some have suggested one could get yearly 
treatments to restore to any biological age desired. Additional nanotechnology

breakthroughs in medical detection and treatment of diseases are expected to dramatically 
increase lifespans, even if the more radical ideas of youthful restoration remain out of 
reach. 
7. Nantotech Manufacturing/Assemblers 
In the popular television show Star Trek: The Next Generation, which won 18 
primetime Emmy awards from 1987–1994, Captain Jean-Luc Picard can often be seen 
walking over to a replicator within a wall and saying, “Tea, Earl Grey, hot.” The device 
then produced the tea.47 Some believe it may actually be possible to create this futuristic 
device of science fiction and that each household will one day have at its convenience one 
of these devices capable of assembling whatever a person desires. These devices would 
theoretically provide the functionalities of 3D printing but with much more precision and 
flexibility. The desktop nanomanufacturing machine may one day be as prevalent as the 
modern-day desktop or laptop computer. 
The idea of nanotech assemblers is one of the more controversial possibilities of 
nanotechnology. In his 1986 book, Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of 
Nanotechnology, K. Eric Drexler, in a section called “Engines of Destruction,” warned,  
Tough omnivorous “bacteria” could out-compete real bacteria: they could 
spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to 
dust in a matter of days. Among the cognoscenti of nanotechnology, this 
threat has become known as the gray goo problem.48  
“Grey goo” has been a boon to science fiction (sci-fi) writers who have used it as a theme 
for end-of-the-world plots in sci-fi novels such as Michael Crichton’s The Prey.49 
Nanotechnology in general has been used often over the last 30 years in many science 
fiction stories, such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day by Randall Frakes, The Diamond Age 
by Neal Stephenson, Stel Pavlou’s Decipher, and Robert Ludlum’s The Lazarus Vendetta,

as well as a host of films and television episodes.50 One consequence of this is that many 
in the general public view nanotechnology as either a source of fear or with scorn as simply 
a sci-fi fantasy. Some have even expressed concern that this negative perception may 
impede progress of the emerging field as unfounded fears grow into demands for 
moratoriums on nanotech research.51 
B. FROM HYPE TO THE CURRENT STATE OF NANOTECHNOLOGY 
Similar to other technologies, nanotechnology underwent a stage of hype wherein 
promoters oversold the technology’s near-term capabilities. From a business perspective, 
this unrealistic enthusiasm cost many investors significant sums of money. However, 
nanotechnology has emerged from the period of hype as a viable and robust technology, 
even if some oversold its short-term impact. This section details nanotechnology’s growth 
from an over-hyped technology to a robust field of study with many uses for current 
consumer products. 
As the ideas promoted by Drexler and others have trickled into the mainstream 
consciousness, they captured the imagination of many, but also, many believe, sparked an 
unprecedented amount of hyperbole and aggressive timelines for technological maturity. 
In Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz, David M. Berube states, “to 
justify government spending and media interest in this area [nanotechnology], people at 
the nanofront have engaged in exaggeration and hyperbole to repackage this idea as 
something new and exciting.” At the same time, he explains that some engage in “equally 
perverse exaggerations of doom and gloom. It is the inherent linkage with hyperbole of all 
sorts that has made nano such an incredibly difficult sell.”52

After the Dot-com market crash in the early 2000s, investors were still hungry for 
the next big technology boom. “Nanotechnology” became a buzzword for bringing in 
money and signified to some the technology of the 21st century.53 Many companies that 
had nothing to do with nanotechnology saw their company valuations rise dramatically. 
Nanometrics, a company established in 1975 well before the popularization of the term 
“nanotechnology” and which, according to its chief financial officer, “has nothing to do 
with nanotechnology” nevertheless saw its stock share price inexplicably increase by 25 
percent in one month during Wall Street’s nanotech craze.54 Many startups saw the money 
flowing to “nano” companies and started adding “nano” to their name in an effort to secure 
funding. Other companies simply changed their name to take advantage. For example, 
Sulight Systems became NanoPierce Technologies, and Covalent Materials became 
Nanomix. As a result of changing their names, many of these companies had vastly inflated 
market cap compared to revenue (see Table 1).55 Today, many of the companies listed in 
the table are traded as penny stocks or have declared bankruptcy.

After President Bush signed the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and 
Development Act on December 3, 2003, which authorized $3.4 billion in federal nanotech 
spending over fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the investment hype began to crescendo.57 
In 2006, Businessweek predicted nanotechnology would represent a $2.6 trillion industry 
by 2014.58 Unfortunately, that prediction overestimated the industry’s potential by at least 
$2.5 trillion as the actual technological development that occurred over the next few years 
severely underdelivered.59  
Some, such as David M. Berube who served on the steering committee for the 
International Council on Nanotechnology, believe the hype surrounding nanotech has led

to unrealistic expectations on the part of the public and policymakers and at one time 
actually threatened to derail legitimate research into the field.60 It is important to manage 
expectations and recognize that it is nearly impossible to accurately predict the timeline for 
the field to mature. Many have identified possible applications for nanotech, but these may 
be years, even decades, away.  
Despite these setbacks, nanotechnology research and breakthroughs are occurring 
at the cross-section of many different fields of science (see Figure 5).61 This research has 
lead and is leading to a diverse set of applications across many sectors of society. With 
these diverse applications come problems formulating a single strategy for nanotechnology 
regulation.

Though nanotechnology is still considered an emerging technology, its current state 
is that of a robust industry and research field. It would be a mischaracterization to speak of 
its applications as only futuristic. In fact, using the nanotechnology definition of “control 
of matter at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers,” medieval stained-
glass artisans used nanotechnology to create their art by adding gold chloride during 
vitrification to generate the ruby red color in the windows.62 Thus, nanotechnology can be 
simultaneously characterized as a very old technology, a robust current technology, and an 
emerging technology. 
As an enabling technology, the introduction and proliferation of nanotechnology 
products in the marketplace is not dependent on the development of entirely new products 
or new markets.63 Rather, existing products can be greatly enhanced by leveraging 
nanotechnology in the manufacturing process.64 Therefore, over the last several years, the 
use of nanotechnology in consumer products has grown rapidly. In 2005, the Woodrow 
Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies 
created the Nanotechnology Consumer Products Inventory (CPI) in an attempt to document 
current products introduced into the commercial marketplace.65 The CPI lists 1800 plus 
products from 600 plus companies in 32 countries (see Table 2 for a partial list).66 Each of 
these companies is a stakeholder for any nanotechnology regulation. The numerous and 
diverse applications of nanoscale products (see Figure 6) again raise the questions about 
the safety of these products throughout the product life cycle.

III. REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE SPACES 
This chapter examines the regulatory and legislative spaces around 
nanotechnology. The first section reviews some of the literature about regulation theory 
and details prevailing viewpoints on how best to regulate nanotechnology. The second 
section shows what legislative actions have been taken regarding nanotechnology. 
Conspicuously absent from the legislative space are laws or rules for nanotechnology. 
Legislation signed into law thus far has been intended to fund research rather than to create 
rules or laws to govern nanotechnology. 
A. REGULATION THEORY AND NANOTECHNOLOGY SPACE 
In their book, Understanding Regulation: Theory Strategy and Practice, Robert 
Baldwin, Martin Cave, and Martin Lodge suggest that when considering whether or not to 
regulate, “the market and all its failings, should be compared with regulation and all its 
failings.”70 This comparison forms a foundational analysis for determining whether or not 
governments should pursue regulation.71 
There is no consensus legal or economic definition of regulation.72 Baldwin, Cave, 
and Lodge offer three definitions. Regulation is alternately described as 1) A “specific set 
of commands” given and whereby the agency dictating rules is committed to the purpose 
of enforcement of these rules; 2) as a “deliberate state influence” encompassing all 
government action designed to influence the actions of individuals or businesses; and 3) as 
“all forms of social or economic influence” whereby all instruments of influence affecting 
conduct are considered regulation—whether the instrument be government, markets, or

other influences.73 Johan den Hertog took the term regulation to “mean the employment of 
legal instruments for the implementation of social-economic policy objectives.”74 
A more general conceptualization of regulation is that regulation is a rule or set of 
rules designed to restrict bad behavior and/or promote good behavior.75 However, to 
promote good behavior or restrict bad behavior, the entity responsible for promotion or 
restriction must know what good and bad behavior looks like.76 The underlying assumption 
of this knowledge is that the regulating authority knows how the technology will develop 
and how it will be used; however, it is very difficult to accurately predict how a technology 
will develop and how it will be used. Therefore, it is difficult to determine precisely what 
good and bad behavior looks like without knowing exactly how this technology will 
develop in the future.  
Baldwin, Cave, and Lodge identified 13 primary reasons for regulation, including  
monopolies and natural monopolies, windfall profits [when a firm receives 
supply source drastically cheaper than available to competitors], 
externalities [the price of a product does not factor in the true cost to 
society—excessive pollution in manufacturing process etc.], information 
inadequacies [consumers lack adequate information to make informed 
decisions], continuity and availability of service, anti-competitive and 
predatory pricing behavior, public good and moral hazard, unequal 
bargaining power, scarcity and rationing, rationalization and 
coordination.77

Additionally, Baldwin, Cave, and Lodge identify five key characteristics of good 
regulation: 1) the regulating body has sufficient legal authority to regulate; 2) 
accountability for regulating body and regulated firms; 3) due process is observed; 4) the 
regulating body has expertise in the field they are regulating; and 5) the process is 
efficient.78 
Regulators have the difficult task to diminish the possibility of damage or injury to 
citizens, while simultaneously not restricting useful products or services. As Malcolm 
Sparrow puts it in The Regulatory Craft: Controlling Risks, Solving Problems, and 
Managing Compliance,  
Regulators, under unprecedented pressure, face a range of demands, often 
contradictory in nature: be less intrusive—but be more effective; be kinder 
and gentler—but don’t let the bastards get away with anything; focus your 
efforts—but be consistent; process things quicker—and be more careful 
next time; deal with important issues—but do not stray outside your 
statutory authority; be more responsive to the regulated community—but 
do not get captured by industry.79 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (an 
intergovernmental economic organization with 35 member countries), has identified four 
integral pieces to the regulation puzzle, as depicted in Figure 7.80 These and other 
principles of regulation are in the document Principles for the Governance of Regulators, 
which was discussed at the November 21, 2012 informal meeting of the Ad Hoc Network 
of Economic Regulators at the OECD, Paris and also at the April 22–23, 2013 meeting of 
the Regulatory Policy Committee at the OECD, Paris.81

Figure 7.  Necessary Elements of Better Regulatory Outcomes82  
There is little consensus across scholars of regulation as to even fundamental issues 
such as what regulation is, and much of the literature is based on often unproven hypotheses 
and theories. However, these theories often have value in explaining potential regulatory 
framework for nanotechnology as they show pitfalls in the regulatory process but do not 
offer conclusive evidence as to the best way to guard against these pitfalls. 
In their article “A Small Matter of Regulation: An International Review of 
Nanotechnology Regulation,” Diana M. Bowman and Graeme A. Hodge provide an 
overview of domestic and international regulatory frameworks for nanotechnology. They 
conclude “regulatory discussion, debate and development will grow on six frontiers—
product safety, privacy and civil liberties, occupational health and safety, intellectual 
property, international law and environmental law” and that “existing regulatory

frameworks will form the immediate basis for regulating nanotechnologies.”83 However, 
they also state, “there have been no nanotechnology specific regulatory responses thus far. 
As a result, a range of serious regulatory fissures are now emerging.”84 They argue that 
nanotechnology will likely follow the same regulatory path of genetically modified 
organisms: product based in the United States and process based throughout the European 
Union countries.85 Additionally, the authors believe this nanotechnology regulation will 
be undertaken in “a careful and targeted approach in the short to medium term rather than 
anything more comprehensive,” but they caution that the approach could change rapidly 
given an “industrial accident involving nano-particles and the knee-jerk regulatory reaction 
that would probably follow.”86 
Alternatively, in an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, Glenn 
Harlan Reynolds identified three possible futures for nanotechnology regulation. The first 
possible “future” he names “Relinquishment and Prohibition.”87 Reynolds submits that 
with any technology that brings radical change there will be calls for prohibition of further 
research, but acknowledges this scenario is highly unlikely due to the vast applications for 
nanotechnology.88 The second possible future is one in which nanotechnology research is 
restricted to the military sphere. Reynolds suggests that due to the high stakes involved, 
the U.S. government may pursue a policy of classification. He points out that many new 
technologies, from high-yield explosives to atomic energy, have been developed under 
high classification, which has made private research extremely difficult and nested largely 
within government research facilities or under government contracts.89 The third possible 
future Reynolds suggests is one of “Modest Regulation and Robust Civilian Research.” He

offers the field of biotechnology as a model for what nanotechnology regulation could/
should be: one of minimally intrusive regulation focused on safety concerns that allows for 
major civilian investment and research. Reynolds states, “As one might expect, this 
approach is championed by those who believe the benefits of nanotechnology justify 
development in the field.”90 
As articulated in a joint memorandum from the director of the Office of Science 
and Technology Policy, the administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs Office of Management and Budget, and the Chief Agricultural Negotiator Office 
of the United States Trade sent to the heads of executive departments and agencies of the 
U.S. government, the current U.S. government policy has been to temper concerns over the 
possible harmful effects of the technology as it has not been definitively proven these 
concerns are founded in reality.91 Also, the memorandum postulates that existing 
regulatory statutes provide an adequate framework for regulation and oversight of 
nanomaterials. This laissez-faire approach may be the best approach to regulation, but 
many also fear it leaves the United States vulnerable as existing regulations do not 
adequately address the unique properties of engineered nanomaterials. 
In his book Nanotechnology Regulation and Policy Worldwide, attorney Jeffrey 
Matsuura states,  
At present [2006] regulatory authorities simply do not know the full scope 
consequences associated with the ever-expanding range of nanotechnology 
uses…. Instead, governments should display confidence in their existing 
regulatory systems by relying on those rules and processes to oversee the 
ongoing introduction of nanotechnology into additional commercial 
applications.92

Conversely, in their book Nanotechnology and Homeland Security: New Weapons for New 
Wars, Daniel Ratner and Mark Ratner state,  
We [the United States] need an FNA (Federal Nanotechnology Agency) to 
complement the tremendous development efforts of the National 
Nanotechnology Initiative with appropriate regulation, policy advice, 
product approval, and monitoring. This agency should undertake 
development, adoption, and enforcement of statutory and regulatory aspects 
of nanotechnology and associated advanced technologies.93  
This approach offers a framework similar to the aviation industry in which a single agency 
(the Federal Aviation Administration) serves as the regulating entity for the entire field; if 
it flies, regulatory responsibility is nested within the FAA. This single entity solution is 
problematic for nanotechnology in that this technology crosses so many disparate sectors 
of society, but it would be difficult and extremely costly for a new agency to build up the 
institutional knowledge to address the many regulatory challenges nanotechnology 
presents.  
B. LEGISLATIVE SPACE 
The next step to understanding the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology is to 
examine laws that have been passed. Despite fears that U.S. policymakers may not be 
giving nanotechnology enough legislative attention, many government officials have 
indeed recognized the need to address nanotechnology. Since 1999, 185 pieces of 
legislation either directly or indirectly relating to nanotechnology have been introduced to 
Congress; however, most of this legislation never passed committee consideration, let 
alone made it to a congressional vote.94 This section highlights the legislation that has been 
passed into law. This legislation is focused primarily on funding research, rather than 
regulation or rules for industry.

1. Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 
Section 221 of the Carbon Cycle Research of the Agriculture Risk Protection Act 
of 2000 granted $15,000,000 to the Consortium for Agricultural Soils Mitigation of 
Greenhouse Gases, which is comprised of scientists from several institutions, to develop, 
analyze, and implement carbon cycle research at the national, regional, and local levels.95 
Among other things, the funds were to be used to “conduct research to improve the 
scientific basis of using land management practices to increase soil carbon sequestration, 
including research on the use of new technologies to increase carbon cycle effectiveness, 
such as biotechnology and nanotechnology.”96 
2. Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 
Section 314 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 made available $3 
million to the Marine Corps to pursue nanotechnology research related to consequence 
management.97 According to the Air and Space Power Journal, consequence management 
is defined as “those individual and organizational activities directed at halting the progress 
of disease or limiting the damage caused by injury and reducing the long-term social 
disability produced by any residual impairment.”98 Consequence management is used 
primarily in a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives environment. 
3. National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 
The National Science Foundation Act of 2002 appropriated $301 million dollars of 
the NSF budget for nanoscale science and engineering research and education programs.99

This act marks the first time NSF funds were specifically appropriated for nanoscale 
research. This appropriation was to support  
(A) research aimed at discovering novel phenomena, processes, materials, 
and tools that address grand challenges in materials, electronics, 
optoelectronics and magnetics, manufacturing, the environment, and health 
care; and (B) supporting new research and interdisciplinary centers and 
networks of excellence, including shared national user facilities, 
infrastructure, research, and education activities on the societal implications 
of advances in nanoscale science and engineering.100 
4. Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act of 2003 
Congress established the Defense Nanotechnology Research and Development 
Program under § 246 of the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act of 2003. The 
purposes of the program are to  
1) Ensure United States global superiority in nanotechnology necessary for 
meeting national security requirements. (2) To coordinate all nanoscale 
research and development within the Department of Defense, and to provide 
for interagency cooperation and collaboration on nanoscale research and 
development between the Department of Defense and other departments 
and agencies of the United States that are involved in nanoscale research 
and development. (3) To develop and manage a portfolio of fundamental 
and applied nanoscience and engineering research initiatives that is stable, 
consistent, and balanced across scientific disciplines. (4) To accelerate the 
transition and deployment of technologies and concepts derived from 
nanoscale research and development into the Armed Forces, and to establish 
policies, procedures, and standards for measuring the success of such 
efforts. (5) To collect, synthesize, and disseminate critical information on 
nanoscale research and development.101  
Section 240 of the fiscal year (FY) 2008 National Defense Authorization Act expanded the

comprise the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) began having regular meetings to 
discuss their agency’s nanotechnology plans and programs.103 In September 1998, this 
informal group became the Interagency Working Group on Nanotechnology (IWGN) under 
the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) to formalize this ongoing 
interagency dialogue.104  
As an outgrowth of this working group, the Clinton administration founded the NNI 
in January 2000.105 Congress approved funding for the NNI in 2001, and NNI has 
continued receiving bipartisan support from both the White House and Congress.106 As the 
NNI was commencing, the NSTC established the Nanoscale Science, Engineering and 
Technology (NSET) Subcommittee to replace IWGN. The NSET subcommittee 
coordinates planning, budgeting, program implementation, and review of the NNI, and it 
is comprised of representatives from the following 20 federal departments (see Table 3).107

In 2003, Congress passed the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and 
Development Act, and President George W. Bush signed it into law.109 This law placed 
the NNI on solid footing requiring, among many other things, the president to implement 
the National Nanotechnology Program. The law states this program’s activities are to 
include the following:  
(1) developing a fundamental understanding of matter that enables control 
and manipulation at the nanoscale; (2) providing grants to individual 
investigators and interdisciplinary teams of investigators; (3) establishing a 
network of advanced technology user facilities and centers; (4) establishing, 
on a merit-reviewed and competitive basis, interdisciplinary 
nanotechnology research centers;…(5) ensuring United States global 
leadership in the development and application of nanotechnology; (6) 
advancing the United States productivity and industrial competitiveness 
through stable, consistent, and coordinated investments in long-term 
scientific and engineering research in nanotechnology; (7) accelerating the 
deployment and application of nanotechnology research and development 
in the private sector, including startup companies; (8) encouraging 
interdisciplinary research, and ensuring that processes for solicitation and 
evaluation of proposals under the Program encourage interdisciplinary

projects and collaborations; (9) providing effective education and training 
for researchers and professionals skilled in the interdisciplinary 
perspectives necessary for nanotechnology so that a true interdisciplinary 
research culture for nanoscale science, engineering, and technology can 
emerge; (10) ensuring that ethical, legal, environmental, and other 
appropriate societal concerns, including the potential use of nanotechnology 
in enhancing human intelligence and in developing artificial intelligence 
which exceeds human capacity, are considered during the development of 
nanotechnology;…(11) encouraging research on nanotechnology advances 
that utilize existing processes and technologies.110 
The law also mandates the president form the National Nanotechnology 
Coordination Office and the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel comprised of 
leaders from academia and private industry to provide advice to the president and council 
members and establishes guidelines for a triennial review of the program.111 Also 
according the law, the panel will assess and report  
1) trends and developments in nanotechnology science and engineering; (2) 
progress made in implementing the Program; (3) the need to revise the 
Program; (4) the balance among the components of the Program, including 
funding levels for the program component areas; (5) whether the program 
component areas, priorities, and technical goals developed by the Council 
are helping to maintain United States leadership in nanotechnology; (6) the 
management, coordination, implementation, and activities of the Program; 
and (7) whether societal, ethical, legal, environmental, and workforce 
concerns are adequately addressed by the Program.112  
6. Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 
Under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 Title 
VII, Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014, Congress established 
the Network for Manufacturing Innovation Program.113 This program includes Centers for 
Manufacturing Innovation. These centers  
focus on a manufacturing process, novel material, enabling technology, 
supply chain integration methodology, or another relevant aspect of

C. LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS 
This review of the major legislative acts passed related to nanotechnology reveals 
the priority of the U.S. government thus far has been to promote and provide funding for 
the research and development of nanotechnology. There has been very little legislative 
effort on the regulation of nanotechnology. In fact, no laws have been passed that directly 
affect nanotechnology regulation. Perhaps this approach is the right one to take for 
emerging technologies; however, it does leave room to question whether this approach has 
allowed nanotechnology to develop in a bit of an oversight blind spot. This blind spot is 
caused by the lack of accumulated research to determine the safety of these nanomaterials. 
As nanotechnology proliferation within consumer products expands, a growing number of 
people are exposed to nanomaterials while society still does not yet completely understand 
the risks.  
Despite these concerns, this author does not recommend regulation through 
legislation as a solution for a regulatory framework because regulation through legislation 
is nearly always a hindsight 20/20 exercise. This means regulation through legislative 
action comes as a reaction to the discovery of a major risk or after a calamity. For instance, 
it is easy to see the oversight and regulation failures in the asbestos industry now; it was 
not so easy to parse out this deficiency when companies used asbestos in nearly all new 
construction. Because legislation on regulation usually only passes as a reaction to a 
calamitous event or overwhelming evidence, it is not be viewed as a viable element of the 
regulatory framework recommended by this thesis. 
The area legislators have done well in is providing funding for many areas of 
nanotechnology research. This thesis recommends this attention to nanotechnology

research be continued. Further research is vital to understanding the risks of the technology 
and leveraging the technology’s benefits to further U.S. interests. Much of this research is 
not possible without approved funding.

IV. FEDERAL STAKEHOLDERS 
The next pillar comes from the stakeholder analysis of federal stakeholders. As we 
examine each agency in relation to its mission and nanotechnology stakeholder status, we 
categorize each agency using the stakeholder analysis matrix mapped according to 
Mendelow’s power-interest grid and place them on the matrix shown in Figure 8.115 This 
section is important because it reveals which agencies are best suited to be a part of the 
recommendations for a regulatory framework for nanotechnology. This analysis also 
demonstrates the revolutionary nature of nanotechnology by showing the broad array of 
agencies with expressed interest in the technology. Additionally, it shows which agencies 
may seek to have a voice in the discussion of nanotechnology regulation based on each 
agency’s expressed interest in the technology.  
The stakeholder matrix is a broad overview of stakeholders grouped together based 
on their attributes, their interest in nanotechnology regulation, and their power to act on 
that interest. The matrix seeks only to broadly categorize agencies or groups. Within each 
group, there will obviously be individual agencies or persons who fall in different 
quadrants of the matrix. This stakeholder matrix is not meant to represent a qualitative 
analysis; that is, it does not intend to say whether each agency should be more or less 
interested or involved in the regulation of nanotechnology. Rather the goal is to show each 
agency’s demonstrated interest and their corresponding power to enact or influence 
regulation. This chapter is organized into four sections, and each section represents one of 
the four quadrants of the power-interest grid.

A. HIGH POWER, HIGH INTEREST 
The high power, high interest quadrant consists of those agencies with both a 
regulatory role that gives them the power to enact and enforce regulation (high power) and 
a demonstrated interest in nanotechnology regulation (high interest). This section 
summarizes those agencies that fall in the high power, high interest quadrant. 
1. Environmental Protection Agency  
The mission of the EPA “is to protect human health and the environment.”117 The 
EPA’s purpose is to ensure Americans are free from significant environmental risks by 
utilizing the most current scientific data to create regulation that aligns with its mission to 
“protect human health and the environment.”118 The EPA also seeks to ensure these laws

are enacted justly to all citizens and communities and promote the United States’ leadership 
role in global environmental protection.119 Pursuant to this mission, the EPA has sought to 
understand nanoscale materials and institute precautionary regulation. Thus, the EPA is a 
vital stakeholder for inclusion in any discussion of nanotechnology regulation. 
The EPA has long been at the forefront of nanotechnology regulation. The EPA’s 
regulatory approach to nanotechnology has been to leverage its authority granted under the 
Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.120 Under this authority, the EPA requires 
“manufacturers of new chemical substances to provide specific information to the Agency 
for review prior to manufacturing chemicals or introducing them into commerce.”121 This 
requirement allows the EPA to determine whether the new nanomaterials represent a 
substantial threat to humans or the environment. The EPA has considered more than 160 
notices for nanoscale materials since 2005.122 Additionally, the EPA issued an 
“information gathering rule” requiring reporting and subsequent recordkeeping on 
exposures and any other health or safety related observations regarding commercialized 
nanoscale chemical substances.123 Under this rule, companies engaging in the 
manufacture, import, or processing of identified chemical substances commercialized as 
nanoscale materials must notify the EPA of the following information: “specific chemical 
identity; production volume; methods of manufacture; processing, use, exposure and 
release information; and available health and safety data.”124 Despite these efforts, the EPA 
has come under fire for allegedly failing to adequately address nanotechnology concerns. 
The debate over nanoscale silver particles is a good example of the tension that 
arises over nanotechnology regulation. It is believed that as early as 400 B.C., Hippocrates

noted the healing properties of silver.125 And the EPA has long recognized silver as an 
effective biocide.126 However, since the development of the silver nanoparticle, companies 
have sought to leverage these biocidal properties by incorporating nanosilver particles into 
more than 250 products.127 This widespread proliferation has caused continuing concern 
among many nonprofit organizations as the long-term effects of this new technology has 
not been fully investigated or understood.128  
In 2008, the Center for Food Safety (CFS), in coalition with many concerned non-
profit organizations, filed a legal petition calling for the EPA to take swift and decisive 
action to regulate novel nanomaterial pesticides. Specifically, the action the CFS demanded 
of the EPA included classifying all products containing nanoscale silver particles as 
pesticides.129 If classified as pesticides, all products containing nanosilver particles would 
be subject to the rules of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. This 
stringent classification would significantly slow the rate of proliferation of nanosilver 
particles in new products and would likely cause the removal of these particles from 
existing products. The EPA did not immediately respond to this petition.  
In December of 2014, the CFS filed a lawsuit against the EPA claiming the agency 
failed to answer its petition, and that “the proliferation of nanomaterials in consumer

products continues unabated.”130 In addition to the CFS, other plaintiffs included the 
Center for Environmental Health, the International Center for Technology Assessment, 
Beyond Pesticides, Clean Production Action, and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade 
Policy.131 In a statement in December 2014, senior CFS attorney George Kimbrell 
criticized the EPA stating, “Six years ago we provided EPA a legal and scientific blue print 
to address to regulate these novel materials under its pesticide authority. The agency’s 
unlawful and irresponsible delay ends now.”132  
In March of 2015, the EPA responded to the CFS petition, only partially granting 
its requests.133 The EPA Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention noted that 
several agencies have joined the debate: American Chemistry Council, Crop Life America, 
the Environmental Defense Fund, the Copper Development Association, the National 
Association of Clean Water Agencies, Natural-Immunogenics Corporation, Purest 
Colloids, and several other concerned citizens and field experts.134 Each of these parties 
has offered a different viewpoint on how exactly the EPA should address the issue of 
classification and regulation of nanosilver particles. The EPA acknowledges that products 
containing nanosilver particles designed to be used as pesticides, as defined by the EPA 
and FIFRA, are indeed subject to these laws and regulatory controls; however, it explained 
in 2015, “The EPA does not have the foundation to classify all nanosilver ingredients or 
products containing nanosilver as pesticides.”135

As a result of this decision, the EPA ordered Nano Defense Solutions, Inc. in Saint 
Augustine, Florida to discontinue the sale of two pesticidal products: “BioStorm” and 
“NanoStrike.”136 These products both listed nanosilver particles in the active ingredients 
list and made claims these pesticides were extremely successful at countering various 
microbial pests, such as “bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae and yeasts.”137 The company 
subsequently pulled these products off the market.  
The EPA has a difficult responsibility to protect citizens’ health and minimize 
environmental impacts, while at the same time not imposing such restrictions as would 
unduly stifle innovation and industry growth. In this case, the EPA ruled in a reasonable 
manner, restricting only those companies whose products use nanosilver as a pesticide to 
be held to the standards put forth in the FIFRA. However, groups such as the CFS, the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, and the International Center for Technology 
Assessment continue to bring lawsuits concerning regulation of nanotechnology against 
the EPA.  
The EPA is one of the few agencies that has addressed nanotechnology regulation 
in a direct way. It also has the regulatory power and infrastructure to put in place and 
enforce regulation as it has already done on a small scale. Therefore, it falls in the high 
power, high interest quadrant of the matrix from Figure 8. 
2. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which created the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), also created the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH is a research agency focused on 
occupational safety and health and devoted to developing new knowledge in this field and 
transferring this knowledge into practice by empowering employers and employees to

create safe and healthy workplaces.138 In 2004, recognizing the rapid growth of the 
nanotechnology industry and seeing the potential for exponential future growth, NIOSH 
created the Nanotechnology Research Center (NTRC) to “identify critical issues, create a 
strategic plan for investigating these issues, coordinate the NIOSH research effort, develop 
research partnerships, and disseminate information gained.”139 
The NTRC has developed partnerships throughout industry, professional 
organizations, trade associations, other federal agencies, labor, and academia.140 Through 
research conducted by NTRC and input from partner groups, NIOSH pinpointed 10 crucial 
topics to focus research and recommendations on; they are  
• Toxicity and internal dose 
• Risk assessment 
• Epidemiology and surveillance 
• Engineering controls and personal protective equipment 
• Measurement methods 
• Exposure assessment 
• Fire and explosion safety 
• Recommendations and guidance 
• Global collaborations 
• Applications141 
Despite extensive research efforts, NIOSH’s findings thus far are inconclusive and 
suggest significant research is still required to understand the impact of nanotechnology 
and nanoengineered materials on human health. Until more conclusive data is available,

NIOSH cannot confidently make reasonable determinations regarding appropriate 
exposure monitoring and control strategies.142 As of November 2016, the NTRC maintains 
this cautionary stance, as evidenced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
statement that,, “the limited evidence available suggests caution when potential exposures 
to free–unbound nanoparticles may occur.”143 
The NTRC’s stance once again highlights the difficulty in determining whether an 
actual threat exists. Currently, the lack of conclusive evidence leads to cautious 
advancement of the industry with relatively little government oversight and specific worker 
protections, as it cannot be said for certain that precautions or protections are even 
necessary. The NTRC remains at the forefront of research endeavors seeking answers to 
whether exposure to nanoengineered materials actually poses any health risks. The problem 
then arises that the first indication of risk might come in the form of irreversible damage 
to workers and the environment. 
Based on its creation of the NTRC and its stance on nanotechnology, it is clear 
NIOSH falls into the high power, high interest quadrant. It believes more research is 
necessary before taking action but appears to stand ready to make regulatory decisions 
quickly once and if the research indicates there is a threat.  
3. U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) “is responsible for protecting the 
public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, 
biological products, and medical devices; and by ensuring the safety of our nation’s food 
supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation.”144 In its regulatory function, the FDA 
is accustomed to the challenges associated with balancing the frequently volatile

 49 
“combination of promise, risk, and uncertainty that accompanies emerging 
technologies.”145  
The FDA concedes it does not have a legal definition for nanotechnology; rather, it 
adheres to the general scientific size consensus as the dimensions between 1–100 
nanometers when referencing nanotechnology.146 Despite definitional irregularities, the 
FDA’s regulatory approach to nanotechnology follows a similar path to the one it has 
followed when dealing with other emerging technologies. This approach recognizes both 
the novel behaviors and unique properties that nanomaterials exhibit as differing from bulk 
material or products manufactured using traditional methods; however, the FDA does not 
broadly deem all products containing nanoengineered materials to be inherently dangerous 
or benign.147 According to the FDA, “The Agency is taking a prudent scientific approach 
to assess each product on its own merits, and does not make broad, general assumptions 
about the safety of nanotechnology products.”148 
The FDA’s approach to nanotechnology regulation is to utilize existing statutory 
authorities in accordance with applicable standards within each product type.149 According 
to the FDA, this regulatory approach has the following attributes: 
• FDA is maintaining its product-focused, science-based regulatory policy.  
• FDA’s approach respects variations in legal standards for different product-
classes.  
• Where premarket review authority exists, attention to nanomaterials is 
being incorporated into standing procedures.

consultation is encouraged to reduce the risk of unintended harm to human 
or animal health.  
• FDA will continue post-market monitoring. FDA will continue to monitor 
the marketplace for products containing nanomaterials and will take actions, 
as needed, to protect consumers.  
• Industry remains responsible for ensuring that its products meet all 
applicable legal requirements, including safety standards. 
• FDA will collaborate, as appropriate, with domestic and international 
counterparts on regulatory policy issues.  
• Both for products that are not subject to premarket review and those that 
are, FDA will offer technical advice and guidance, as needed, to help 
industry meet its regulatory and statutory obligations.150  
The FDA has communicated its nanotechnology regulatory posture through a series 
of guidances issued for industry. In June 2011, the FDA issued the draft guidance titled, 
“Considering Whether an FDA-Regulated Product Involves the Application of 
Nanotechnology.” This guidance details the FDA’s overall strategic framework to handle 
nanotechnology regulation in a product-specific manner.151 The FDA addressed the use of 
nanotechnology in the cosmetics and food industries through a draft guidance released for 
public comment in April 2012. After a period of public comment, the FDA considered 
these comments and issued the final three guidance documents in June 2014. In August 
2015, the agency issued a fourth guidance regarding the use of nanomaterials in food for 
animals. As stated on the FDA website, these final four guidances are: 
• Final Guidance for Industry: considering whether an FDA-regulated 
product involves the application of nanotechnology 
• Final Guidance for Industry: safety of nanomaterials in cosmetic products

• Final Guidance for Industry: assessing the effects of significant 
manufacturing process changes, including emerging technologies, on the 
safety and regulatory status of food ingredients and food contact substances, 
including food ingredients that are color additives 
• Final Guidance for Industry: use of nanomaterials in food for animals.152 
Rather than listening to the extremes from both sides of the nanotechnology regulation 
argument, the FDA has taken measured steps to fulfill its mission to protect the public from 
harmful products.  
Similar to NIOSH, the FDA has taken the stance that more research is necessary 
before taking action, but it appears to stand ready to make regulatory decisions quickly 
once and if the research indicates there is a threat. It has actively sought to establish 
guidance to industry on safe product applications of nanotechnology. The FDA falls in the 
high power, high interest quadrant.  
4. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is an independent 
government agency created through the Consumer Product Safety Act of 1972 and charged 
with “protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the 
use of the thousands [15,000+] of types of consumer products under the agency’s 
jurisdiction.”153 In 2005, after a commissioner vote of 3–0, the CPSC released a statement 
declaring its position that existing CPSC statutes and regulations are adequate to address 
any possible safety and health risks posed by nanomaterials.154 Additionally, it said that 
product risk assessments are not made until after the product is available for public use. 
Thus, nanotechnology may necessitate unique exposure and risk assessment strategies.155

In 2008, the CPSC received increasing pressure from both within and outside 
government to improve and expand oversight of nanomaterials within consumer products. 
In a detailed analysis report titled, The Consumer Product Safety Commission and 
Nanotechnology, E. Marla Felcher concluded,  
The agency [CPSC] lacks the budget, the statutory authority and the 
scientific expertise to ensure that the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the 
market…are safe. This problem will only worsen as more sophisticated 
nanotechnology-based products begin to enter the consumer market.156  
Recognizing the need to address nanotechnology in support of its mission, the 
USPC joined the NNI in 2011 and requested additional funding to collect data on the use 
of nanomaterials in consumer products. Since joining the NNI, as stated on nano.gov, the 
focus of programs for the CPSC are  
• Developing protocols to assess the potential release of airborne 
nanoparticles from various consumer products and to determine their 
contributions to human exposure.  
• Determining whether nanomaterials can be used for performance 
improvement in sports safety equipment such as helmets and kneepads 
without creating other health hazards.  
• Expanding consumer product testing using scientifically credible protocols 
to evaluate the exposure potential from nanosilver in consumer products, 
with special emphasis on exposures to young children.  
• Working across agencies to assure that shared common public health 
concerns are met in research studies to determine potential impacts on the 
public health of nanomaterial use in consumer products.157

In 2015, the CPSC co-hosted with the NNI a technical workshop in Arlington, 
Virginia, which brought together more than 200 people from across the exposure science 
community.158 The primary objectives of the workshop were to  
(1) assess progress in developing tools and methods for quantifying 
exposure to engineered nanomaterials across the product life cycle, and (2) 
to identify new research needed to advance nanotechnology environmental, 
health, and safety exposure assessment for nanotechnology-enabled 
products.159  
The resulting report, Quantifying Exposure to Engineered Nanomaterials from 
Manufactured Products: Addressing Environmental, Health, and Safety Implications fused 
the findings from the workshop. The overarching conclusion of the report is that science 
has achieved important advances over the previous 10 years, including ways to measure 
exposure, methods, and tools to characterize exposures and methods to simulate and model 
engineered nanomaterials exposures to determine possible harmful effects.160 The report 
recommends follow up actions and suggests areas, such as disease prevention by 
identifying the biomarkers of exposure that have been linked to the contraction of a disease, 
for the community to concentrate on.161 
The CPSC’s operating plan for 2017 included an additional $3 million to establish 
a nanotechnology center, in partnership with the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Science (NIEHS), focused on the environment, health, and safety.162 The proposed 
center would “conduct applied research on exposure to potential chronic hazards related to 
nanotechnology in consumer products.”163 As stated in the 2017 operating plan, CPSC will 
commence the following activities and programs:

• Collaborate with state and federal authorities, colleges and universities, and 
other stakeholders to expand the CPSC’s effectiveness and reach to address 
consumer exposures to nanomaterials throughout the life-cycle of the 
materials; 
• Work with the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to 
develop protocols to assess the potential release of nanoparticles from 
selected consumer products and determine their contributions to human 
exposure; 
• Maintain a nanotechnology consumer product database of products that 
claim to have or are believed to contain nanomaterials; 
• Continue to characterize the release of nanomaterials into indoor air and 
determine the potential exposures to consumers; 
• Collaborate with the NSF- and the EPA-funded Centers for Environmental 
Implications of Nanotechnology to investigate human exposures to 
nanomaterials, including those released from consumer products; and 
• Partner with NIEHS on a nanocenter focused on environment, health, and 
safety (pending new appropriations).164 
Moving forward, in its 2018 budget the CPSC requested funding to establish an advanced 
research center to develop methods to quantify consumer exposure and potential health 
risks resulting from the use of nanomaterials in consumer products and nanoenabled 
products.165 
This research indicates the CPSC has responded to the challenges presented by 
nanotechnology by transforming its approach to regulation of nanomaterials in consumer 
products from a reactionary approach to a proactive approach leveraging existing agency 
knowledge and extensively collaborating with relevant stakeholders. It remains to be seen 
how successful the CPSC will be in accomplishing its mission regarding nanotechnology; 
however, the new approach is more likely to yield positive results than the previous hands-
off approach. Due to CPSC actions taken to further research on nanotechnology and its 
incumbent responsibility of product safety, the CPSC falls in the high power, high interest 
quadrant.

B. HIGH POWER, LOW INTEREST 
The high power, low interest quadrant consists of those agencies/offices with either 
a regulatory role that gives them the power to enact and enforce regulation or a position to 
steer U.S. policy on nanotechnology (high power); however, they lack a demonstrated 
interest in nanotechnology regulation or deferment of the regulatory role to another agency 
(low interest).  
1. U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology 
In 1958, the 85th Congress created the House Committee on Science and 
astronautics, which would later become the present day Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology.166 The committee has broad jurisdiction over all federal scientific research 
including energy research, astronomical research and development (R&D), civil aviation 
R&D, environmental R&D, marine research, commercial applications of energy 
technology, the NIST, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), NSF, the 
National Weather Service, space exploration, scientific scholarships, and other aspects of 
scientific research.167 In this role the committee exerts oversight control over many entities 
within the federal government responsible for nanotechnology research, such as the 
National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). The committee conducts ongoing review of all 
taxpayer investments in scientific research to ensure all funds are spent prudently.168 
Nanotechnology is at the forefront of much of the research in the fields of artificial 
intelligence, additive manufacturing, bio-engineering, energy, computer and information 
science, and photonics.169

This committee falls into the high power, low interest quadrant. It would have 
significant power to sponsor legislation about nanotechnology regulation; however, to this 
point its members have shown little interest in doing so.  
2. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration  
Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and created 
OSHA. The mission of OSHA is “to assure safe and healthful working conditions for 
working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, 
outreach, education and assistance.”170 Although OSHA generally acknowledges there 
may be risks associated with engineered nanoparticles, it has not outlined specific 
guidelines regarding worker health and safety when working with these materials because 
potential health effects are not fully known.171 OSHA notes that most of the activities 
engaged in by companies researching, developing, and manufacturing nanomaterials fall 
under the “General Duty Clause” of the 1970 act.172The examples of standards that OSHA 
cites may apply to employees exposed to nanomaterials are general safety precautions, 
such as recording and reporting illness, eye protection, respiratory protection face 
protection sanitation hand protection, etc.173  
In 2013, OSHA published a fact sheet titled, Working Safely with Nanomaterials, 
with the intent to provide “basic information to workers and employers on the most current 
understanding of potential hazards associated with this rapidly developing technology and 
highlights measures to control exposure to nanomaterials in the workplace.”174 In this

document, OSHA reiterates that specific nanomaterial exposure limits do not exist with the 
exception of respirable carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and titanium dioxide 
(TiO2).175 OSHA recommends employers limit employee exposure to nanomaterials 
following established hazard control measures, such as those listed in the previous 
paragraph.  
OSHA has shown a hesitancy to make specific rules regarding nanotechnology. On 
its website, OSHA defers to NIOSH as “the lead federal agency providing guidance and 
conducting research on the occupational safety and health implications, and applications 
of nanotechnology.”176 This lack of specific guidance offered by OSHA highlights some 
of the uncertainty surrounding the potential hazards posed by nanomaterials. 
Despite having the power to make rules about nanotechnology, OSHA has not done 
so. Due to OSHA’s hesitancy to make specific rules or enact regulations regarding 
nanotechnology in the workplace, it falls in the high power, low interest quadrant.  
3. Office of Science and Technology Policy 
The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established in 1976 to 
advise the president and other national leaders within the Executive Office of the President 
on topics including “scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of the economy, 
national security, homeland security, health, foreign relations, the environment, and the 
technological recovery and use of resources.”177 With a mandate to inform policy on 
scientific matters, the OSTP plays a vital role in steering national nanotechnology policy. 
The OSTP leads interagency efforts to formulate science and technology policies and 
budgets and to collaborate with the private sector, state and local governments, scientific 
and academic communities, and international partners to meet this goal.178 The OSTP has 
a three-fold mission:

first, to provide the President and his senior staff with accurate, relevant, 
and timely scientific and technical advice on all matters of consequence; 
second, to ensure that the policies of the Executive Branch are informed by 
sound science; and third, to ensure that the scientific and technical work of 
the Executive Branch is properly coordinated so as to provide the greatest 
benefit to society.179  
In 2015, OSTP requested suggestions on the topic nanotechnology-inspired grand 
challenges for the next decade.180  OSTP requested the responses to contain “ambitious 
but achievable goals that harness nanoscience, nanotechnology, and innovation to solve 
important national or global problems and have the potential to capture the public’s 
imagination.”181 After receiving 100 plus responses, OSTP announced the following grand 
challenge, “Create a new type of computer that can proactively interpret and learn from 
data, solve unfamiliar problems using what it has learned, and operate with the energy 
efficiency of the human brain.”182 Nanotechnology research is essential to meet this 
challenge.  
With its role in steering national nanotechnology policy, the OSTP falls into the 
high-power half of the matrix. However, it has not shown high interest to take any action. 
Therefore, OSTP is in the high power, low interest quadrant. 
C. HIGH INTEREST, LOW POWER 
The high interest, low power quadrant consists of those agencies/programs with a 
high interest in nanotechnology regulation based on their role and mission (high interest), 
but they lack a regulatory role. This leaves them without the direct power to enact and 
enforce regulation (low power).

1. National Nanotechnology Initiative 
Since its inception in 2000, the NNI has functioned as “the U.S. Federal 
Government’s interagency program for coordinating research and development as well as 
enhancing communication and collaborative activities in nanoscale science, engineering, 
and technology.”183 This program was the first of its kind in the world; however, many 
countries have now established similar programs and have begun investing heavily in 
nanotech research.184 The vision of the NNI is a future in which applications of 
nanotechnology spark a revolution in industry and technology in ways benefiting 
society.185 The NNI is the highest priority funded science and technology effort since the 
race to put a man on the moon and is one of the highest priority multiagency research and 
development programs.186 The NNI is managed within the framework of a cabinet-level 
council, the National Science and Technology Council housed under the White House 
Office of Science and Technology Policy (see Figure 9).187The NNI has eight program 
components that provide the organizational framework for NNI activities (see Table 3).188

government is not doing enough to move the technology from the laboratory into the 
marketplace,” while others question the government’s effectiveness to protect the 
American consumer from the perceived possible harmful consequences of nanotechnology

in existing products.191 However, the NNI is not a regulatory agency. Regulation for 
nanotechnology falls to member agencies, such as the CPSC, FDA, NIOSH, and EPA.  
Nonetheless, funding for the NNI has grown from $464 million in FY 2001,  to 
approximately $1.4 billion for the NNI in the FY 17 federal budget (see Figures 10 and 
11).192 Since 2001, the NNI has received nearly $25 billion in federal funding including 
the 2018 budget request.193 Many argue this significant investment into nanotech research 
is essential for the United States to maintain its standing as a world superpower and prevent 
the United States from being left out of the next technological revolution.194

The NNI is comprised of many agencies that fall in all four quadrants of the power-
interest grid. However, the program itself has no power to enact regulation. Therefore, the 
NNI falls in the high interest, low power quadrant. 
2. U.S. Department of Commerce 
Congress created the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) in 1903 as the U.S. 
Department of Commerce and Labor (renamed in 1913).197 The mission of DOC is to 
“create the conditions for economic growth and opportunity” within the United States.198 
The DOC accomplishes this mission by ensuring fair and secure trade, providing the data 
necessary to support commerce, and fostering innovation by setting standards through the 
NIST and conducting foundational research and development.199

Section 7 of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act calls 
for the director of NIST to establish a program to conduct research into the possibilities 
and pitfalls of the development and manufacture of nanotechnology.200 Additionally, the 
law directs the secretary of commerce  to  
establish a clearinghouse of information related to commercialization of 
nanotechnology research…[to include] information relating to activities by 
regional, State, and local commercial nanotechnology initiatives; transition 
of research, technologies, and concepts from Federal nanotechnology 
research and development programs into commercial and military products; 
best practices by government, universities and private sector laboratories 
transitioning technology to commercial use; examples of ways to overcome 
barriers and challenges to technology deployment; and use of 
manufacturing infrastructure and workforce.201 
Accordingly, NIST conducts nanotechnology research to collect data and develop 
measurement and standards pertinent to a broad scope of private industry and government 
departments.202 Specifically, according to nano.gov, “NIST labs develop advanced 
spectroscopic methods needed to increase efficiency in advanced photovoltaics, and the 
standard reference materials and data necessary to accurately quantify and measure the 
presence and impact of nanomaterials in the environment.”203  
Additionally, NIST established the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology 
(CNST) in 2007 to assist commercialization of nanotechnology.204 CNST supports the 
U.S. nanotechnology enterprise by making available the most sophisticated equipment for 
nanoscale research.205 The CNIST fosters nanotechnology advances from the discovery 
point to production and marketplace introduction.

control and treaty compliance system and promoting continued U.S. strategic technology 
leadership.”206 The BIS collaborates with the NNI to remain informed of the latest 
nanotechnology research, which can be an opportunity for national defense industry 
investment and may reveal possible vulnerabilities of U.S. national defense.207 
Due to the potential economic impact of nanotechnology in the coming years, the 
DOC remains very interested in how the technology develops and what regulations will 
affect the industry’s growth. However, it does not have a regulatory role. Thus, the DOC 
falls in the high interest, low power quadrant. 
3. Department of Energy 
The oil crisis of 1973 highlighted the need for a consolidated U.S. energy policy. 
This need led to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, which created the 
Department of Energy (DOE). DOE’s mission is to “ensure America’s security and 
prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through 
transformative science and technology solutions.”208 Moving into the 21st century, DOE 
recognizes the critical role nanotechnology has to play in addressing the nation’s energy 
needs as well as in addressing climate change and national security challenges.209  
Section 8 of the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act 
directs the secretary of DOE to “establish a program to support, on a merit-reviewed and 
competitive basis, consortia to conduct interdisciplinary nanotechnology research and 
development designed to integrate newly developed nanotechnology and microfluidic tools

with systems biology and molecular imaging.”210 It also directs the secretary of DOE to 
“carry out projects to develop, plan, construct, acquire, operate, or support special 
equipment, instrumentation, or facilities for investigators conducting research and 
development in nanotechnology” and provided a $25 million budget from 2005 to 2008 to 
accomplish these directives.211 
The DOE Office of Science manages most of DOE’s programs that conduct cutting 
edge nanotechnology research and development designed to enhance DOE’s ability to 
fulfill its mission.212 These programs engender breakthrough discoveries across a wide 
array of scientific fields, such as “materials science, physics, chemistry, biology, 
computational science, and engineering.”213 According to DOE, the agency anticipates 
these discoveries to significantly advance future technologies in  
solar energy collection and conversion, energy-efficient lighting, stronger 
and lighter materials for transportation, improved chemical and biological 
sensing, low-energy catalytic pathways for fuel and chemical production 
and to break down toxic substances for environmental restoration, and 
advanced systems for stockpile stewardship.214  
In addition to the Office of Science, DOE has many other departments that fill a 
support role in nanotechnology research. These include the Office of Nuclear Energy, the 
Office of Fossil Energy, and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. 
Additionally, DOE also assists research activities in academia, private sector, and 
throughout its own laboratories.215 
Furthermore, the DOE funds five state-of-the-art nanoscale science research centers 
(NSRCs).216 These facilities for interdisciplinary nanoscale research are an important part

of DOE’s extensive portfolio for nanoscale science and technology. The NSRCs serve as 
the foundation of nationwide program covering new tools, new science, and new 
computing capabilities. Each center is unique in expertise for particular theme areas.217 
Like DOC, the DOE is very interested in how the technology develops and what 
regulations will affect the industry’s growth. However, it does not have a regulatory role. 
Thus, the DOE falls in the high interest, low power quadrant. 
4. National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been at the 
forefront of researching new technologies since its inception in 1958. To fulfill its vision 
to “reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind,” NASA 
needs to leverage advances in nanotechnology for future needs in computing, electronics, 
materials/structures, sensors, and advanced miniaturization of all systems.218 NASA’s 
nanotechnology focus also includes development of highly detailed simulations to enable 
fast-paced development, testing, and validation of new materials and devices (see Figure 
12).219  
NASA’s nanotechnology research efforts pre-date the formation of the NNI with 
the 1996 establishment of the Ames Research Center near San Jose, California. As of 
October 2012, these efforts have led to more than 350 nanotechnology-related scientific 
publications.220 In the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the president gave 
NASA a new mission focused on space exploration, which called for a return to the Moon 
and a manned mission to Mars; however, this new mission included no new funding, which

led to difficult budget decisions by NASA. NASA cut funding for many projects that did 
not directly support the new presidential direction. These funding cuts hindered NASA’s 
research efforts significantly, as research appropriations were cut by 75 percent; and about 
300 scientific programs were ended prematurely.221 The Ames Research Center was forced 
to cut its staff from a high of sixty scientists, down to approximately ten scientists.222 These 
funding levels improved somewhat during the Obama administration. NASA’s R&D 
budget rebounded to $10.1 billion in 2016; however, these massive fluctuations in NASA’s 
research budget reveal that the agency is vulnerable to the shifting priorities of presidential 
administrations and budget cycles.223 These shifts have caused projects to stop and start 
suddenly, resulting in incomplete projects and wasted resources.224   
NASA is very interested in how the technology develops and what regulations 
affect the industry’s growth. It is heavily involved in researching applications of 
nanotechnology. However, it does not have a regulatory role. Thus, NASA falls in the high 
interest, low power quadrant.

5. National Science Foundation  
In 1950, Congress created the National Science Foundation as an independent 
agency with a mandate to “promote the progress of science, to advance the national health, 
prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense...”226 The NSF serves an important 
role by supporting research and people to make discoveries to transform the future. This 
type of support serves to drive the U.S. economy, enhances national security, and advances 
knowledge to maintain global leadership.227 The NSF serves as the funding source for

nearly 24 percent of federally-supported basic research conducted by the nation’s colleges 
and universities.228 
This focus has led to keen interest in nanotechnology research by the NSF. 
Nanotechnology research requires sophisticated and expensive equipment. These costs are 
a barrier to research for many smaller universities and companies. Partially in an effort to 
address this barrier, in 2003 the NSF began funding the National Nanotechnology 
Infrastructure Network (NNIN) under a 10-year cooperative agreement.229 The NNIN 
consisted of several facilities working in partnership to enable rapid research advancements 
by allowing cost efficient access to nanotechnology infrastructure.230 On September 1, 
2014, funding for the NNIN ended. 
Following the conclusion of the NNIN, the NSF held a competition to select the 16 
sites from 50 competition proposals that would comprise the National Nanotechnology 
Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI).231 The NNCI serves as the successor to the NNIN and 
builds upon its framework.232 The NSF chose 16 sites from across the country (see Figure 
13). The NNCI sites “provide researchers from academia, small and large companies, and 
government with access to university user facilities with leading-edge fabrication and 
characterization tools, instrumentation, and expertise within all disciplines of nanoscale 
science, engineering and technology.”233 The NSF gave out the initial awards, with an 
initial period of five years, in September 2015. In April 2016, the NSF chose the Georgia

The NSF is keenly interested in how the technology develops and is highly involved 
in researching applications of nanotechnology. However, it does not have a regulatory role. 
Thus, NSF falls in the high interest, low power quadrant. 
D. LOW INTEREST, LOW POWER 
The low interest, low power quadrant consists of those agencies/programs that have 
an interest in nanotechnology based on how it can help the agencies accomplish their 
missions but have little interest in the regulation of nanotechnology (low interest). These

agencies also lack a regulatory role, which leaves them without the direct power to enact 
and enforce regulation (low power).  
1. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Science and Technology 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is dedicated to safeguarding the 
American people. This huge responsibility requires a commitment to seeking out 
technological advances to determine how these advances can benefit the department in 
accomplishing the mission of securing the homeland. This job of finding and leveraging 
technological advances falls to the DHS Office of Science and Technology. A 
representative from the DHS Office of Science and Technology also serves on the NSET 
subcommittee for the NNI.   
In fiscal year 2016, much of the proposed 17-million-dollar nanotechnology budget 
was used to conduct extensive research in areas related to explosives and the detection of 
explosives. These areas include: 
• Explosive/polymer interactions. 
• Understanding heterogeneity of energetic materials.  
• Multifunctional nano-electro-optical-mechanical sensing platforms.236 
While it may be surprising to categorize an agency as large as DHS with the budget 
it has as a “low power,” in this instance the low power designation seems appropriate 
because it has no regulatory authority. Perhaps because of this lack of regulatory role, DHS 
has shown little to no interest in regulation. Therefore, it falls in the low power, low interest 
quadrant of the matrix.  
2. Department of Defense 
The mission of the Department of Defense is to provide military forces necessary 
to protect the United States and deter war. This mission requires the utmost attention to 
technological developments, including nanotechnology. The DoD views nanotechnology 
                                                 
236 “Department of Homeland Security,” National Nanotechnology Initiative, accessed June 19, 2017, 
https://www.nano.gov/node/592.  
 74 
as an enabling technology requiring the highest attention from leadership.237 Congress 
created the Defense Nanotechnology Research and Development Program under § 246 of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2003.238  
The DoD view of nanotechnology as an enabling technology with force multiplying 
attributes requires extensive research and development necessary to meet national security 
goals and avoid technological surprises.239 This technology is essential for DoD to remain 
at the forefront of military capabilities.  
Many component organizations within DoD are responsible for research and 
development projects and programs related to nanotechnology. These include:  
• Air Force Office of Scientific Research  
• Army Engineering R&D Center  
• Army Research Laboratory  
• Army Research Office  
• Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  
• Office of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering  
• Defense Threat Reduction Agency  
• Office of Naval Research.240 
As it investigates ways to leverage nanotechnology for the nation’s warfighters, the 
DoD must maintain careful attention to how this technology may interact with the 
environment and change the landscape of warfare itself. There must be oversight to ensure 
the primary aim of DoD’s nanotechnology is not only maximum lethality for weapons, but 
that it also retains cognizance of the societal effects of advanced nanotechnology.

Similar to DHS, it may be surprising to categorize an agency as large as DoD and 
with the size of its budget as a “low power;” however, in this instance, the low power 
designation seems appropriate because DoD has no regulatory authority. Perhaps because 
of this lack of regulatory role, DoD has shown little to no interest in regulation. Therefore, 
it falls in the low power, low interest quadrant of the matrix.  
3. Department of Education 
Congress established the Department of Education (ED) in 1980 with a mission to 
“promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering 
educational excellence and ensuring equal access.”241 As nanotechnology and other 
technologies become more advanced, it is vitally important that the U.S. education system 
keep up with these educational demands of the 21st century. Education, especially in the 
fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), is crucial for the 
United States to maintain international competitiveness; however, currently, the United 
States is indeed falling behind other countries in terms of graduates in the STEM fields 
(see Figure 14).242

Famed theoretical physicist and City College of New York Professor Dr. Michio 
Kaku has said that the scientific establishment in the United States is facing collapse due 
to its poor education system and has only avoided this collapse due to the H1B visas 
program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers with specialized skill sets 
into difficult to fill positions.244 Clearly, the ED has many difficult challenges to fulfill its 
mission of preparing the next generation of Americans to be globally competitive. In an 
effort to meet these challenges, specifically nanotechnology education, through the NNI, 
ED has collaborated with other relevant agencies, such as DOL (which tracks workforce

needs), and the NSF, which provides funding for nanotechnology research and funds 
nanotechnology education.245 
The research for this section reveals a necessity for a strong focus on expanding the 
nation’s focus on STEM education and leads to the recommendation to create a scholarship 
program for students seeking advanced degrees in nanotechnology-related research fields 
(see Recommendations Section). The ED is focused primarily on the technology itself, not 
on regulation. The low power designation is also appropriate because DoD has no 
regulatory authority. It is in the low interest, low power quadrant. 
4. Department of State 
Created in 1789, the Department of State (DOS) was the first U.S. executive 
department.246 DOS mission is to “shape and sustain a peaceful, prosperous, just, and 
democratic world and foster conditions for stability and progress for the benefit of the 
American people and people everywhere.”247 To aid with this mission, DOS fosters 
international collaboration on advanced technologies. As a member of the NNI, the DOS 
assists other member agencies to establish partnerships with counterpart agencies in other 
countries. These partnerships facilitate the exchange of scientific data including results of 
experimental research. Additionally, it allows for protection of intellectual property rights 
and promotion of scientific information sharing by facilitating access for researchers.248  
The DOS Office of Space and Advanced Technology ensures that bilateral and 
multilateral science activities support overall U.S. foreign policy objectives, safeguard 
national security interests, promote economic interests, and enhance U.S. technological

competitiveness.249 The office heads the interagency effort to coordinate U.S. international 
nanotechnology activities.250 
DOS collaborates on international nanotechnology efforts with organizations such 
as the United Nations’ environment Programme Strategic Approach to International 
Chemicals Management, the OECD, and the International Organization for 
Standardization, and leads U.S. participation in the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development’s Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy and 
its subsidiary Working Party on Bio-, Nano-, and Converging Technologies.251 These 
efforts help advance international commercialization of nanotechnology products, promote 
innovative ideas, and endeavor to create an international marketplace which encourages 
the development of nanotechnology while acknowledging and addressing safety 
concerns.252  
The DOS has low interest in nanotechnology regulation. The low power 
designation also is appropriate because DoD has no regulatory authority. It is in the low 
interest, low power quadrant. 
5. Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice 
The Department of Justice (DOJ) mission is to enforce the laws of the United States 
and defend its interests according to national law.253 The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 
is the research, development, and evaluation branch of the DOJ. The NIJ “is committed to 
improving the knowledge and understanding of crime and justice issues through 
science.”254 To that end, the NIJ sponsors scientific research to provide tools to inform the

justice.255 This includes investments in nanotechnology research. 
The DOJ has little interest in nanotechnology regulation, or power to enact 
regulation, though it may be called upon to prosecute violators of regulation. It is in the 
low interest, low power quadrant. 
6. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey 
The Department of the Interior (DOI) is responsible for protecting and managing 
the nation’s natural resources as well managing hundreds of millions of acres of land, 
including national parks through the National Parks Service and rangelands through the 
Bureau of Land Management.256 The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) serves as the only 
science agency of the DOI. The USGS mission is to serve the United States “by providing 
reliable scientific information to describe and understand the Earth; minimize loss of life 
and property from natural disasters; manage water, biological, energy, and mineral 
resources; and enhance and protect our quality of life.”257  
The USGS is involved in many aspects of nanotechnology research. Currently, 
scientists are investigating the unique properties of exotic element nanoparticles to identify 
possible applications to science and industry.258 USGS also performs toxicological studies 
to understand the effects of nanoparticles at different levels biological organization.259 In 
keeping with its role of evaluating potential risks of resource degradation, USGS is also 
studying the long-term effect naturally-occurring and engineered nanomaterials have on 
the environment.260

The DOI has low interest in nanotechnology regulation. The low power designation 
also is appropriate because DOI has no regulatory authority on this matter. It is in the low 
interest, low power quadrant. 
7. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration 
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is the agency within the Department 
of Transportation tasked with the mission to “improve mobility on our nation’s highways 
through national leadership, innovation, and program delivery,” and it supports state and 
local governments in the design, construction, and maintenance of the U.S. highway 
system.261 This task is becoming increasingly difficult as the number of vehicles on the 
nation’s roads has increased from 65 million in 1955 to an estimated 246 million in 
2008.262 This traffic and the effects of age and weathering are deteriorating road systems 
faster than local, state, and federal road crews can perform maintenance. This increased 
volume of traffic and state of the nation’s highways has heightened the need for high-
performance, long-lasting materials for roadway pavements.263 The FHWA has funded 
targeted research to identify nanotechnology solutions to meet these needs. 
In March 2009, FHWA’s Exploratory Advanced Research Program sponsored a 
workshop involving nearly two dozen experts from academia and other federal programs 
to share their understanding of nanoscale research and to learn about vital highway research 
issues such as infrastructure, safety, operations, and the environment. The FHWA remains 
committed to addressing these issues with a long-term strategy of continued targeted

nanotechnology research community to leverage new discoveries for improvements to the 
nation’s transportation systems.264

The FHWA has little interest in nanotechnology regulation. The low power 
designation also is appropriate because the FHWA has no regulatory authority on this 
matter. It is in the low interest, low power quadrant. 
8. Department of the Treasury 
According to the NNI, the Department of Treasury (DOTreas) interest in 
nanotechnology involves monitoring the subsets of “nanotechnology that could most 
effectively assist the execution of its role as the steward of the U.S. economic and financial 
systems, and as an influential participant in the global economy.”265 Additionally, 
DOTreas looks to leverage nanotechnology research in the execution of its role in “advising 
the President on economic and financial issues, encouraging sustainable economic growth, 
and fostering improved governance in financial institutions.”266 The DOTreas may also 
investigate the possibilities of nanotechnology in the production of currencies that are more 
difficult to counterfeit.267 
The DOTreas has low interest in nanotechnology regulation. The low power 
designation also is appropriate because DOTreas has no regulatory authority on this matter. 
It is in the low interest, low power quadrant. 
9. U.S. Intelligence Community 
The U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) is a federation of 16 separate agencies 
working individually and collaboratively to conduct intelligence activities necessary to 
maintain national security and enhance foreign relations.268 In terms of devices used to 
collect intelligence information, the smaller, more lightweight, energy efficient, durable, 
and sophisticated the device is, the better for the IC agency deploying the device. Intense

research into novel applications of nanotechnology is necessary to reach maximum 
efficiency in each of these areas. The IC is also keenly interested in the collection of data 
on the capabilities of other nations.  
To reach IC research objectives and other areas of technological interest, the Office 
of the Director of National Intelligence created an organization designed to increase the 
speed of technical developments and establish a synergy between all members of the IC.269 
This organization, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) was 
modelled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. IARPA does not deploy 
technologies directly to the field, but rather it collaborates across the IC to facilitate the 
transition of research from the laboratory to operational application.270  
The IC has low interest in nanotechnology regulation. The low power designation 
also is appropriate because the IC has no regulatory authority on this matter. It is in the low 
interest, low power quadrant. 
10. U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture  
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was established by President Lincoln 
in 1862.271 The mission of USDA is to provide government “leadership on food, 
agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on 
sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management.272“ In 1862, 
more than half of the country’s population lived and worked on farms.273 As the nation’s 
economy changed, USDA has evolved with it. USDA has recognized the importance of 
new technologies, such as nanotechnology, in fulfilling its agricultural leadership mission.

The Farm Bill of 2008 authorized the establishment of the National Institute of 
Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NIFA administers federal funding through grants provided 
to Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) to address pressing agricultural issues 
impacting the lives of the U.S. populace.274 Through collaboration with scientists, experts, 
policymakers, and educators, NIFA has made important progress toward finding solutions 
to many of the most time critical local and global problems. In March 2016, the AFRI 
administered $5.2 million in grants to 11 universities to support research on ways 
nanotechnology can improve the safety of food, increase efficiency of renewable fuels, 
improve crop yields, and help manage agricultural pests, among other research topics.275 
In July 2017, AFRI awarded 13 grants worth $4.6 million to fund projects supporting 
nanotechnology-based solutions, which will improve food production, food safety, 
nutrition, and sustainable agriculture.276  
The USDA NIFA has low interest in nanotechnology regulation. The low power 
designation also is appropriate because the USDA NIFA has no regulatory authority on 
this matter. It is in the low interest, low power quadrant. 
11. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
Congress created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as an independent 
agency under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to replace the Atomic Energy 
Commission (AEC).277 The NRC began operations in January, 1975. The NRC mission is 
to “ensure the safe use of radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while

plants and other uses of nuclear materials.”278 
The NRC’s research focus is largely to “verify the safe application of new 
technologies in the civilian nuclear industry.”279 The agency’s nanotechnology focus is to 
keep abreast of advancements that may affect the nuclear industry and/or assist the NRC 
in the execution of its mission.280 
The NRC has low interest in nanotechnology regulation. The low power 
designation also is appropriate because the NRC has no regulatory authority on this matter. 
It is in the low interest, low power quadrant. 
12. U.S. International Trade Commission 
The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) is “an independent, 
quasi-judicial federal agency with broad investigative responsibilities” on issues relating 
to international trade.281 The USITC has a five-fold mission: to  
(1) administer U.S. trade remedy laws within its mandate in a fair and 
objective manner; (2) provide the President, USTR, and Congress with 
independent analysis, information, and support on matters of tariffs, 
international trade, and U.S. competitiveness; and (3) maintain the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the U.S.282  
In 2016, the USITC released The Year in Trade 2016, its 68th report on the 
operation of U.S. trade agreements.283 This report includes updates on the Transatlantic 
Economic Council meetings held each year to strengthen economic cooperation between 
the U.S. and the European Union. One of the highlighted topics discussed was

V. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF AVIATION AND 
BIOTECHNOLOGY REGULATION 
This chapter examines the current regulatory framework for the aviation industry 
and for biotechnology. The author chose aviation and biotechnology as case studies 
specifically because their regulatory frameworks are very different. The aviation industry 
is regulated by a single agency, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). If it flies, the 
FAA has the regulatory responsibility over it. Conversely, biotechnology is regulated by 
three agencies (EPA, FDA, and USDA) based on the attributes of the product. These 
different frameworks provide an interesting contrast to examine. 
A. AVIATION REGULATION 
When the Wright brothers made the first successful flight of a self-propelled, 
heavier-than-air, aircraft in December 1903, they could scarcely have envisioned the major 
airline industries or the other significant technological, social, and environmental changes 
that grew out of the beginnings of their successful flight.285 Nor could they have envisioned 
the major regulatory entities such as the FAA that would be created to enforce rules of 
behavior on aviators, airlines, and aviation customers. 
From the early days of manned flight to today’s complex web of international flight 
routes, aviation regulation has been continually changing to meet the shifting landscape of 
the aviation industry. According to the FAA, the aviation industry promoted the idea of 
government regulation out of the belief that the airplane could not reach its full commercial 
maturity without federal action to enforce safety standards.286 This attitude toward 
regulation was unique, as aviation industry regulation came mostly as a response to 
requests from the industry for oversight.287 President Herbert Hoover wrote in 1921, “It is

interesting to note that this is the only industry that favors having itself regulated by 
government.”288 The aviation industry has largely maintained this embrace of government 
regulation through the present day. The first major piece of legislation regulating aviation 
was the Air Commerce Act of 1926.289 This new legislation gave the secretary of 
commerce the responsibility to license pilots, enforce rules of air traffic, maintain 
navigational aids, promote aviation commerce, certify airplanes, and establish air routes.290 
By the 1930s, pressure for federal regulation strengthened in the aftermath of 
crashes that killed high-profile individuals such as University of Notre Dame football 
coach Knute Rockne and New Mexico Senator Bronson Cutting.291 To address these 
concerns, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed into law the Civil Aeronautics Act 
in 1938. This act created the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA), with responsibilities to 
investigate aviation mishaps as a means to formulate recommendations to prevent future 
accidents. Additionally, the CAA was given the authority to regulate airline fares and 
regulate the routes individual airlines served. After a mid-air collision in uncongested 
airspace over the Grand Canyon, Senator A. S. “Mike” Monroney introduced legislation 
that created the FAA with a broad-scoped mission to ensure the safe and efficient use of 
U.S. airspace.292  
The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 served to eliminate regulation on airline 
routes and fares. This opened the door for many new entrants into the airline industry. 
Consequently, the workload of the FAA increased dramatically, as it was responsible for 
reviewing the hundreds of applications for new airlines and making a decision on their 
respective ability to operate. Deregulation of the airline industry led to many benefits for

the consumer, including a reduction in airline fares, and the number of destinations 
increased for several years.293 
In 1988, 10 years after the Airline Deregulation Act, the Office of Technology 
Assessment released its report titled, Safe Skies for Tomorrow: Aviation Safety in a 
Competitive Environment. This report was the result of analysis conducted to determine 
the effectiveness of existing regulations, safety policies, and technologies to address the 
U.S. government’s responsibility for maintaining safety in commercial aviation. The study 
reached many important conclusions and recommendations. One of the most important 
conclusions was that despite an exponential increase in the FAA’s workload, airline safety 
did not diminish in the aftermath of deregulation despite the entrance of many new airlines 
into the marketplace. Rather, airline security increased slightly as crashes decreased over 
the final four years preceding the study.294 
The FAA is the sole responsible agency for all air traffic regulation within the 
United States. If it flies in U.S. airspace, it is regulated by the FAA (see Figure 15). As new 
technologies and innovations emerge, such as drones, the FAA maintains responsibility for 
regulation. Mark Ratner and Daniel Ratner suggest nanotechnology may be regulated using 
a single agency, just as the FAA handles all aviation regulation.295 Under this framework, 
if a product utilizes nanotechnology, it would be regulated under a new federal agency.

B. BIOTECHNOLOGY REGULATION 
Biotechnology has seen radical technological breakthroughs and has also been the 
source of controversy and debate.296 In 1986, the Office of Science and Technology Policy 
released the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology.297 This policy 
dictated the U.S. government’s approach to regulation of biotechnology. This framework 
utilizes a risk-based approach to regulation of new biotechnology products.298 Regulation 
for biotechnology is based on the attributes of the product. There are three primary agencies 
that assume responsibility for regulation of biotechnology based on the area of

responsibility of each agency. These agencies are the Environment Protection Agency 
under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services’ FDA, and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (see Figure 
16). Each of these agencies relies on communications with the others to ensure regulatory 
issues and potential regulatory issues are addressed properly.299  
Biotechnology companies accept that regulation is a part of the cost of doing 
business. However, delays in regulatory approval directly affect a business’s net returns 
and therefore significantly influence investment decisions.300 Because regulatory costs 
subtract from the company’s profits, industry generally views regulation negatively, 
though they are rarely openly opposed to regulation.  
The regulatory framework for the biotechnology industry is structured very 
differently from the aviation industry. Regulation for biotechnology is based on the 
attributes exhibited by the product. Examining this structure reveals possibilities for a 
similar structure for nanotechnology regulation. If the product utilizes nanotechnology and 
is primarily designed for health benefits, it would be regulated by the FDA; if the product 
has telecommunication applications it would be regulated by the Federal Communications 
Commission; CPSC would address new products; EPA would address environmental 
concerns, etc.

Biotechnology regulatory framework consists of three primary agencies which assume responsibility for 
regulation of biotechnology based on the area of responsibility of each agency.  These agencies are the

and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).
 
Figure 16.  Biotechnology Regulation Framework 
C. AVIATION AND BIOTECHNOLOGY REGULATION ANALYSIS 
Both of the aviation and biotechnology frameworks present pros and cons if 
implemented for the regulation of nanotechnology. Under the aviation framework, one 
benefit would be the centralization of expertise on the technology. However, the current 
state of nanotechnology development does not warrant this type of singular oversight 
structure. Additionally, the cost to create a new agency and bring together the requisite 
expertise would outweigh the benefits added to regulatory decisions at this point. Under 
the biotechnology framework, each existing regulatory agency maintains its regulatory 
responsibility under existing rules and regulations. This is a prudent approach to regulation; 
however, the problem is that none of these agencies has the requisite expertise to 
specifically address the unique challenges of nanotechnology regulation.   
 93 
VI. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
This thesis was designed to map the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology by 
examining the background of the technology, reviewing the relevant legislation and 
regulatory spaces, and conducting a nanotechnology stakeholder analysis of federal 
stakeholders. The researcher categorized these stakeholders based on the power-interest 
grid. Next, the research included a comparative analysis of the aviation and biotechnology 
regulatory frameworks. The findings of this research provided the foundation on which to 
make recommendations for the regulatory framework of nanotechnology.  
A. FINDINGS 
Mapping the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology has revealed several key 
findings, as listed below.  
1. The regulatory landscape of nanotechnology is vast, with many 
stakeholders and potential pitfalls to regulation. 
2. There is very little consensus on many aspects of nanotechnology. 
Researchers disagree on the definition, rate of technological advancement, 
regulation, potential dangers, what the technology will look like, or how it 
will be used in its mature state. The one thing nearly everyone agrees on is 
that nanotechnology will potentially be one of the most important 
technologies of this century.  
3. The scope of nanotechnology’s influence reaches across several industries 
and sectors of society. There will likely be no part of society untouched by 
this emerging technology. 
4. The current state of nanotechnology is robust, with more than 1,800 
products known or thought to be using the technology. Despite their 
proliferation, the environmental, health, and safety implications of 
nanoengineered materials throughout the product life cycle remain largely 
unexplored.  
5. The current regulatory approach to nanotechnology is to address it under 
existing laws; however, these laws may not be sufficient to address the 
future challenges of nanotechnology. The Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, which is tasked with ensuring that products are safe for 
consumers, lacks the funding and personnel to properly address 
nanotechnology in products already in the marketplace. 
 94 
6. Nanotechnology is important to the long-term health of the U.S. economy. 
The U.S. government has invested significant resources in the advancement 
of nanotechnology research. The NNI has received nearly $24 billion in 
federal funding since 2001. 
7. There have been many pieces of legislation directly or indirectly related to 
nanotechnology. Most legislation focuses on research and development, not 
on regulation.  
8. Despite their very disparate missions, many federal agencies are involved 
in nanotechnology research, development, and regulation. 
9. Aviation and biotechnology have different regulatory frameworks that can 
inform the recommendation for nanotechnology’s regulatory framework. 
Both industries view regulation differently.  
B. RECOMMENDATIONS 
These recommendations come as a result of identifying obstacles to regulation and 
determining, based on stakeholder analysis and regulatory landscape, the best framework 
for nanotechnology regulation. 
The first recommendation is to follow the advice of Jeffrey Matsuura and “display 
confidence in their existing regulatory systems by relying on those rules and processes to 
oversee the ongoing introduction of nanotechnology into additional commercial 
applications,” while addressing the limitations of this approach.301 The primary limitation 
of this is the high-level of technical expertise required for understanding the technology 
and therefore for recommending policy or enacting rules or regulations. The primary 
regulatory institutions should be those identified as high power, high interest on the 
stakeholder matrix: the EPA, FDA, CPSC, and NIOSH. To ensure that the appropriate level 
of expertise is available for regulatory decisions, this thesis recommends that each of these 
four agencies sponsor an advisory committee of technical and industry experts under the 
guidelines of the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 (Public Law 92-463). These 
advisory committees would provide relevant and objective advice, which would be open 
to the public for review. Following this recommendation would set up the United States 
for success regulating the nanotechnology now and in the future, no matter how it develops.  
                                                 
301 Jeffrey H. Matsuura, Nanotechnology Regulation and Policy Worldwide (Norwood, MA: Artech 
House, Inc., 2006), 4. 
 95 
The second recommendation is to conduct an NSF-funded, multiyear, 
comprehensive study to determine the environmental, health, and safety risks and impacts 
of nanoengineered materials. Without knowing the risks associated with the technology, 
one cannot reasonably determine what future regulation should look like. Once researchers 
identify the risks, lawmakers can enact reasonable regulation. 
The third recommendation is to review funding for the CPSC. According to 
research, the CPSC is too undermanned and underfunded to accomplish its mission, 
especially in light of the many products that now use nanoengineered materials. Congress 
should review this agency to identify to what extent funding and staffing should be 
increased.  
The fourth recommendation is to increase public awareness of nanotechnology and 
promote public engagement through an education program that provides government- 
funded literature and public television/radio programming. An engaged and educated 
public is necessary to guard against the damage of “hype” regarding nanotechnology.  
The fifth recommendation is to fund a scholarship program, through the NSF, for 
students seeking advanced degrees in nanotechnology-related research fields. The research 
reveals how the United States is falling behind other developed countries in the STEM 
fields of learning. A scholarship program designed for nanotechnology would not only help 
to address this problem but also provide the future expertise needed to guide regulation as 
the technology matures. 
The sixth and final recommendation is to continue funding nanotechnology 
research in the federal budget. The research shows agencies such as the NNI are playing 
and will continue to play an important role in the future of nanotechnology development.

This thesis answers this question: How can regulatory decisions of policymakers regarding the framework of nanotechnology regulation be informed by a map of the regulatory landscape of nanotechnology and a review of the regulatory frameworks for the aviation and biotechnology industries? To make recommendations about the appropriate regulatory framework for nanotechnology, this thesis reviews the existing regulatory frameworks of aviation and biotechnology and maps the regulatory landscape in the United States by examining stakeholders, regulatory entities, and applicable legislation. The landscape map and review of existing regulatory frameworks reveal that the established regulatory framework could be sufficient for the current state of nanotechnology if the limitations of technical expertise are addressed. This expertise can be provided by advisory committees of technical and industry experts to the Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Consumer Product Safety Commission, and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.http://archive.org/details/aregulatoryframe1094558356Assistant Senior Watch Officer, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Operations CenterApproved for public release; distribution is unlimited","['Thesis', 'nanotechnology', 'regulation', 'regulatory framework', 'stakeholder analysis', 'power-interest grid', 'nanomaterials', 'nanoscale', 'consumer protection', 'National Nanotechnology Initiative', 'National Science Foundation']",disabled
