RESEARCH ARTICLE 
Developing a Cryptocurrency Assessment 
Framework: Function over Form 
Andrew Burnie,*† James Burnie,‡ Andrew Henderson§ 
Abstract.  The rise of cryptocurrency as a new sui generis asset class creates a need for a 
new classification scheme to cover the wide range of functionality for which tokens can be 
used. By differentiating tokens based on their functional attributes, cryptocurrency tokens 
can be categorised into crypto-transaction tokens (which act as a cash substitute); crypto-
fuel tokens (which underpin generic blockchain applications); and crypto-voucher tokens 
(which can be exchanged for a predefined asset). This classification is applied to identify 
important issues when considering whether to participate in a cryptocurrency system, such 
as the impact of potential forks, token supply expectations and the level of dependence on a 
few operators (entity-dependence). For crypto-transaction tokens (and crypto-fuel tokens if 
used in a similar or overlapping role) it shows the importance of the token being seen as a 
“better” form of money. For crypto-fuel tokens, the popularity of blockchain applications 
and the utility of the crypto-fuel system in application development is vital. For crypto-
voucher tokens, the value of the underlying asset, the token’s exchangeability for that asset 
and the importance of a digital representation should be considered by participants. The 
interplay between fundamentals and speculation as drivers of price is considered. 
 
1. Introduction  
The number of cryptocurrencies has increased rapidly from one to over 1350 cryptocurrencies 
as of 18 December 2017.1 This has been accompanied by increasing diversification, in terms 
of purpose, technology and governance, resulting in a highly variable range of applications. 
Whilst Bitcoin focused on providing an electronic cash substitute, subsequent 
cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology can now be used to raise funds through 
Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), to underpin a decentralised network, and as a mechanism to 
facilitate other applications, 2  including those across the engineering space and for social 
purposes.3, 4   
Whilst the variation in tokens facilitates a range of possible applications and benefits, it 
also leads to a lack of clarity in how to assess the suitability of a token for a particular 
purpose. This makes cryptocurrency harder to oversee for regulators and difficult for investors 
to evaluate. The resulting regulatory uncertainty has been cited as the main obstacle to 
adoption by application developers and network operators.2

One of the first regulators to formally assess how cryptocurrency should be regulated was 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which split tokens into fully regulated 
security tokens and lightly regulated utility tokens. Differentiating between these is not 
without difficulty; 5  in particular, determining whether a token involves ‘reasonable 
expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,’ 
and so is a security.6 The Swiss regulator FINMA follows a similar approach except tokens 
that represent ‘assets’ are regarded as securities.7 The issue is further complicated by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) view that all virtual tokens are subject to 
their oversight as either commodities or derivatives.8 There are no lists provided to show how 
different cryptocurrencies are allocated into these groups, which makes it difficult for 
stakeholders to be sure as to which regulations apply to specific cryptocurrencies. 
As a general rule, globally, regulators have so far tended to avoid making special rules or 
providing specific guidance to create a regulatory framework for operating cryptocurrencies.9 
In the United Kingdom and Singapore, for example, regulators have explicitly stated that 
cryptocurrencies do not fall within a specific part of the regulatory framework, but that a 
cryptocurrency will be regulated if it takes on sufficient characteristics of another regulated 
asset to be treated as that asset.10, 11 This approach is also reflected in the new regulatory 
regime for regulated financial instruments which came into force across the European Union 
on 3 January 2018, which lists those asset classes which are regulated, but does not mention 
cryptocurrency.12 
This ambiguity may also explain why, despite the number of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin 
remains dominant, with over half of the market capitalisation as of 18 December 2017.1 
Participants may be deterred from exploring alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) that are 
poorly understood, particularly since, for example in the United Kingdom, the lack of a 
specific regulatory framework is often accompanied by regulators warning that there are 
increased risks when investing in cryptocurrency, compared to other asset classes.10, 13 This 
may also explain why some thought leaders have questioned whether cryptocurrency 
represents a legitimate form of investment that provides participants a genuine source of 
value,14, 15 why some regulators have chosen to ban ICOs,16 and the observed high volatility in 
cryptocurrencies (Appendix A), fuelled by speculation.17, 18 
The previous ‘ontological’ classification approach proposed by Herbert and Stabauer in 
2016 encompassed three (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple) out of the twenty-one 
cryptocurrencies currently considered the most financially significant (Sections 2 and 3), and 
does not take into consideration the proliferation of new token types since that study.19 It 
further does not cover recent developments fundamental to most new financially significant 
cryptocurrencies, e.g. the use of ICOs.  
This article proposes a new classification approach based on the function of the token, 
rather than the underlying form of the protocol. This classification framework provides a tool 
for understanding and assessing a given cryptocurrency, which enables cryptocurrencies to be 
interpreted and understood by a broader, less-technical readership. This is particularly 
important given the continuing creation of new cryptocurrencies marketed to a public 
audience.  It is consistent with the outcomes-focused approach deployed by regulators, for 
example the SEC characterising the operation of DAO tokens when determining them as a 
security, rather than commenting on the underlying Ethereum blockchain.6  
The methodology used (Section 2) is to first identify the most financially significant 
cryptocurrencies, and to classify them by applying criteria which consider the underlying 
differential characteristics of their tokens. The resulting classification (Section 3) is then

applied as an assessment framework for identifying the underlying fundamentals for each 
cryptocurrency type, from which stem important questions around whether cryptocurrencies 
are a better type of money, the impact of forks, token supply, and entity-dependence (Section 
4). Speculation is considered (Section 5) as this may produce high volatility, obscuring the 
impact of the underlying fundamentals which would normally constitute the basis for valuing 
an asset.20   
 
2. Methodology 
Scope—The cryptocurrencies considered are those where the token is: (i) an entirely digital 
store of value, (ii) publicly available, and (iii) supported by a blockchain. Publicly available 
cryptocurrencies are likely to have the most available data, whilst the support of the 
blockchain has been seen as a differentiating characteristic of cryptocurrencies.21, 22 Using this 
scope, the most financially significant cryptocurrencies are selected for the dataset. 
 
Determining financial significance—The metrics routinely available publicly are: market 
capitalisation, price, circulating supply, and liquidity.1, 23-28  
Comparisons based on price alone can be misleading because if token supply is low, 
buyers are forced to offer higher prices to acquire tokens even though there is a limited user 
base. 
Market capitalisation is the price of a token multiplied by the circulating supply of tokens. 
It is favoured because it directly measures the amount held in each cryptocurrency, and so 
focuses on the most financially significant cryptocurrencies. Price is measured as the average 
price weighted by the different volumes traded in different markets, to account for variations 
in price. Circulating supply deducts from total supply the amount of publicly unavailable 
tokens, such that market capitalisation is the amount held by the general public in the 
cryptocurrency.29 A limitation to existing metrics of market capitalisation is how to account 
for inaccessible tokens resulting from owners losing access to their wallets or hoarding. 30 
Such scenarios could lead to market capitalisation giving a misleading impression of the 
amount invested in a given cryptocurrency. 
Liquidity is important, as a low liquidity means that users can only move in and out of a 
cryptocurrency system slowly, at great cost, which can inhibit the adoption of a 
cryptocurrency.30, 31  It is considered here because it is indicative of the prevalence of 
inaccessible tokens: the fewer tokens that are for sale, the lower the transaction volume is 
likely to be for a given market capitalisation. Liquidity is measured by the transaction volume 
over the last 24 hours.  
For robustness, two metrics from three websites are examined at three timepoints.1, 23-28 
Lists of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation and liquidity were collected from 
coinmarketcap.com at 14:27 on 4 October 2017, 15:48 on 30 October 2017, and 10:27 on 18 
December 2017. Examining coincap.io at 15:58 on 30 October 2017 and 10:28 on 18 
December 2017 corroborated with coinmarketcap.com, whilst examining onchainfx.com led 
to similar results, except that this website did not include Tether in its rankings. Where two 
lists disagree, cryptocurrencies from both rankings are included.  
The top five ICOs by amount raised as of 18 December 2017 are also included.32 To 
mitigate against the risk of cryptocurrencies failing to launch, coinmarketcap.com was used to

restrict the list to where either the tokens or futures exchangeable for the tokens could be 
bought.  
 
Criteria—Applied to each cryptocurrency: 
(1) What is the purpose, the functionality, and the rights associated with the token? 
(2) How is the supply of tokens determined over time? 
(3) How is the cryptocurrency related to other cryptocurrencies? 
These questions characterise the fundamentals of each cryptocurrency, i.e. the characteristics 
that bring value to owning a token other than anticipation of a price increase. This is 
analogous to Shiller’s (2003) argument that speculative bubbles form when irrational investors 
are drawn by rising prices.33  
Information on each cryptocurrency was sourced from whitepapers, official websites, and 
third-party commentary.

Ethereum Classic, Tether, Qtum, Zcash, Cardano, Bitcoin Gold, EOS, AirSwap, Filecoin, the 
Bancor Protocol, Qash, and Kin (Appendix B).  
The veracity of the information released by BitConnect has been questioned,27, 34  and 
similarly Tezos is involved in accusations of dishonesty.35, 36 Both are excluded.

Crypto-transaction—is defined as cryptocurrencies that are designed primarily for transacting 
value, i.e. to be a form of ‘electronic cash’.38 
Crypto-transaction tokens are usually designed to be easily transferrable, with minimal 
barriers to acquisition. Value is not derived from some underlying asset, but rather it is 
determined by a network of users (see Section 4). Among the cryptocurrencies examined 
(except Monero), this value was further supported by fixing the total amount of tokens that 
will ever be created. Examining the websites of crypto-transaction systems suggests that the 
availability of exchanges and/or merchants who will accept the tokens is an important 
consideration. Electronic cash is only useful if it can be exchanged directly for goods or 
services, or if exchange can occur easily through some other currency. 
Crypto-transaction tokens were the first form of cryptocurrency, beginning with Bitcoin in 
2009. Despite this, new systems are still being created, such as Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, 
Qash, and Kin in 2017. The development of a new codebase usually focuses on resolving 
perceived limitations in a previous attempt to create electronic cash (typically Bitcoin). The 
underlying code is often an amended copy of that of an older token, except for Qash and Kin. 
Even Bitcoin was developed to remove a perceived limitation, specifically the dependence of 
previous electronic cash systems on a central governing entity. 38 
Improvements focus on speeding transactions; 39 - 42  changing the mining algorithm to 
prevent centralisation; 40, 41, 43, 44 improving scalability; 41, 45 and enhancing liquidity. 37 There is 
a distinct subgroup that is concerned with privacy (Dash,39 Monero,41 and Zcash 43, 46), a 
finding corroborated by other researchers.31,47,48 There is a second subgroup where the crypto-
transaction token was developed to support a specific platform that can provide a suite of 
financial (Ripple 49 and Qash 37) or social media (Kin 50) services. Dash is unusual in seeking 
to change the governance structure through enabling network participants to vote on 
governance and budgeting proposals.39 How improvements are prioritised and the strategies 
pursued to implement a given enhancement is system-specific.  
 
Crypto-fuel—This term applies to cryptocurrencies that intend to enable developers to create 
blockchain-supported applications. They are typically launched with a blockchain platform 
that is designed to enable the token to be used as a fuel for the created applications to operate. 
It is a term sourced from the Ethereum whitepaper.51 
The blockchain platform often has smart contract functionality, which enables the creation 
of accounts that behave in a pre-programmed, rule-based way in response to changes in the 
network, and so forms the basis of decentralised applications.51-56 
The blockchain platform can be used to facilitate ICOs, explaining the popularity of basing 
ICOs on crypto-fuel systems, e.g. with Etherparty, the Bancor Protocol, and CoinDash all 
based on Ethereum, and Ecobit on NEM. The blockchain platform can, however, also be more 
broadly applied to create a new crypto-voucher system (e.g. the Bancor Protocol discussed in 
the next section), or some other type of network that runs independently of a central authority. 
Crypto-fuel development usually starts as a fresh project (e.g. Ethereum or NEM) or as a 
fork from some other crypto-fuel’s codebase (e.g. Ethereum Classic). They rarely evolve just 
from a crypto-transaction system. The new codebase typically focuses on improving the 
process for creating blockchain applications over a prior cryptocurrency. This can mean 
simplifying the creation of applications; 51, 53-58 raising flexibility; 55, 58 improving scalability; 53, 
55, 56 easing regulatory compliance; 55 preventing subsequent changes to the code; 52 or 
reducing the costs of usage.56

29 
The underlying architecture behind crypto-fuels varies significantly both from the 
perspective of the experience of the developer in creating an application to how the 
cryptocurrency is created and distributed. Developers may have to learn a new programming 
language,51-53, 55 or be able to use a preferred language,54, 56, 58 whilst cryptocurrency supply 
might be fixed,58 increase indefinitely,51 or increase up to a fixed cap.52 
 
Crypto-voucher—This term is used to describe cryptocurrencies whose tokens carry the right 
to a predefined asset.  
The asset to which the token-holder has rights varies. For example, USD Tether is 
exchangeable one-to-one with USD (or equivalent spot value in Bitcoin);59 tokens on the 
Bancor Protocol are exchangeable at fixed ratios with other cryptocurrencies;60 and Filecoin 
tokens will be transferrable for data storage space.61  In AirSwap, the token is temporarily 
locked up to register signals to peers of an intention to buy or sell Ethereum-based tokens.62 
As well as depending on the demand for an underlying asset, crypto-voucher tokens are 
also often dependent on one or more external blockchains. In the case of Filecoin, this 
dependence means the existence of bridges that enable participants to exploit the functionality 
of multiple other blockchains.61 In contrast, the Bancor Protocol and AirSwap are run on top 
of the Ethereum blockchain,60, 63 whilst Tether uses the Omni Layer protocol, which runs on 
the Bitcoin blockchain.59 
Crypto-voucher systems are usually not the most dominant cryptocurrencies from the 
perspective of liquidity or market capitalisation (except for Tether), but are more prevalent 
among recent ICOs (AirSwap, Filecoin, and the Bancor Protocol). 
 
Hybridisation—The distinction between crypto-fuel and crypto-transaction cryptocurrencies 
can be complicated by market forces turning crypto-fuel tokens into a store of value, in this 
respect taking on the properties of a crypto-transaction token; conversely, in some cases, the 
creation of new protocols is used to give additional crypto-fuel functionality to a crypto-
transaction cryptocurrency. The extent to which such ‘hybridised’ cryptocurrencies fulfil an 
alternative role determines the extent to which the considerations associated with that other 
role are relevant (Figure 1). For example, Bitcoin was designed for transacting value and thus 
put in the crypto-transaction group.38 Subsequently, the Omni Layer was developed so that 
Bitcoin could acquire crypto-fuel functionality. 64  However, the primary function for the 
Bitcoin token continues to be in transacting value and so it remains in the crypto-transaction 
group. Ethereum is in the crypto-fuel group but market forces have sometimes used it to 
purchase goods and services from merchants, although, in practice, this is very difficult.65 The 
Ethereum whitepaper continues to describe ether as a ‘crypto-fuel’.51 
 
Overlap—Linked to hybridisation is the issue of overlap, in particular between crypto-fuel 
and crypto-transaction tokens. Determining which cryptocurrency falls within each of these 
categories will therefore require a determination of the primary function of the relevant 
cryptocurrency. The starting point for forming this judgement, used in this article, was how 
the functionality of the token was explained within its whitepaper, as this is the best evidence 
of the original design over the token. As tokens evolve, a value judgement may be required to 
determine the primary function of the cryptocurrency in question. This involves a 
consideration of how market participants are actually using the cryptocurrency, and the effect 
of changes to the design, for example as a result of votes on its use, or changes shown by later 
whitepapers. This capacity for evolution may be part of the original code used for a

cryptocurrency, for example OP codes were baked into the original Bitcoin design which, 
although not part of the original function, were later reactivated in Bitcoin Cash, making it 
both spendable and compatible with smart contracts. Activation events such as these may alter 
the classification of the cryptocurrency and reinforces the fact that different market 
participants may legitimately come to different conclusions of how a cryptocurrency is to be 
categorised, based on a different judgement of the primary function of a given cryptocurrency. 
These differences in view point will reflect the fact that, for some cryptocurrencies, the 
primary function changes depending on the scenario in which it is used and, therefore, a 
cryptocurrency may have multiple concurrent uses. However, in this case the distinction 
between crypto-fuel and crypto-transaction cryptocurrencies is still important to analysing a 
particular use. 
 
4. Applying the Classification Scheme to Identify Fundamentals 
 
Figure 1 (below) provides a framework for the main questions which might be relevant to 
assessing a given cryptocurrency. This is not intended to cover all the potential risks and 
opportunities that may be associated with a cryptocurrency. Instead, it demonstrates the value 
of the classification scheme in identifying the underlying fundamentals behind different types 
of cryptocurrency. 
 
The application of questions highlighted in Figure 1 in assessing a cryptocurrency is mostly 
self-evident.  However, some of the questions raised require further elucidation to ensure the 
applicability of the framework for a broad audience. These issues are discussed below. 
 
Determining a “better” form of money—Two-thirds of cryptocurrency payment companies’ 
transactions were found to be between national currency and cryptocurrency,66 underlining the 
importance of national currencies as a competing form of money. Hence, following Hileman 
and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney,22, 67 cryptocurrency and national currencies are 
compared regarding each of the economic functions of money, to determine whether a given 
cryptocurrency has the potential to truly represent ‘The Best Money in the World.’ 45  
 
 As a long-term store of value: 
o The paper notes underpinning the value of bank accounts deteriorate and must 
be replaced. The Federal Reserve is forecast to spend USD 726.6 billion on 
new paper notes in 2017,68 about 85% of which replaces deteriorated paper 
notes,69 which typically last about 6-7 years.70 Cryptocurrencies’ digital form 
does not deteriorate over time.  
o Investors cannot be sure to recover the value invested in highly volatile 
cryptocurrencies; the continuous creation of new systems of cryptocurrency 
means there is a risk of previous systems becoming obsolete and so losing 
value; flaws in the underlying code may suddenly render the cryptocurrency 
valueless. For some cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, the process for 
verifying and recording transactions (mining) could in theory become 
dominated by a single entity, who could then spend the same token many times 
and/or block all transaction validation (though the risk of such a so-called ‘51% 
Attack’ is demonstrably smaller in established proof-of-work-based

31 
cryptocurrencies due to their increased size). 71  Hence, crypto-transaction 
systems often seek to prevent miner centralisation. 
 As a unit of account: 
o A paper currency cannot measure value in fractions of a coin, whereas a digital 
currency is infinitely divisible, suggesting cryptocurrencies could be 
particularly valuable for micropayments. 
o The high volatility of cryptocurrencies undermines its use in the consistent 
measurement of the value of goods or services.22 
 As a medium of exchange: 
o Cryptocurrencies facilitate global transactions without an intermediary, 
potentially offering faster and more private transactions. 
o Paper currencies are more valuable as a medium of exchange because they have 
a much larger userbase than cryptocurrencies. This could explain why 
scalability is an issue for some crypto-transaction systems: lack of scalability 
constrains the potential userbase. This also suggests the importance of liquidity: 
the easier it is to enter and exit a cryptocurrency, the more useful it is as a 
medium of exchange.31 
 
Forks—When the codebase of a cryptocurrency forks, it effectively splits into two versions: 
the original and a new version that implements perceived improvements. Unless all users and 
miners then switch to one version, the result is two distinct cryptocurrencies.72 If the original 
transaction data is copied across, the owners of the original cryptocurrency may receive free 
tokens of the new cryptocurrency. This occurred when Ethereum Classic forked from 
Ethereum, and when Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin. A tendency for investors to purchase 
cryptocurrencies intending to benefit from such events has been observed.73 
 
Token Supply—There is likely to be an inverse relationship between the price and the 
expected supply of tokens in circulation. Potential participants should therefore consider how 
new tokens will be created over time and their distribution mechanism. For many 
cryptocurrencies,38-41, 51, 52 the total supply over time is determined formulaically by the 
codebase. 
  
Entity-Dependence—Entity-dependent cryptocurrencies are characterised as when the system 
becomes dependent on a small number of operators.74 This can be by design, such as with 
Tether controlling the creation and destruction of tokens,59 or by evolution. For example, a 
few market participants could potentially hoard a significant proportion of a cryptocurrency in 
circulation, giving them power over its price. The importance of who controls the verification 
and recording of transactions has been particularly emphasised.74 A widely held concern with 
Bitcoin is whether a miner could have sufficient computing power to instigate a 51% attack,71 
enabling them to block all transactions and to spend the same tokens repeatedly.40, 41, 43 
Participants should thus consider the implications of entity-dependence.

5. Problems with Fundamentals as Investment Criteria 
The problem with using the identified fundamentals (Section 4) to price cryptocurrencies is 
that speculation can act as an important factor that obscures the effect of these fundamentals.33 
There is econometric evidence to support cryptocurrencies as an asset class affected by 
speculation.17,.18 This makes it difficult both for participants and investors to anticipate future 
price dynamics using the fundamentals suggested by this article. A similar issue was observed 
with Internet companies during the “Dotcom Bubble” where valuations were often based on 
speculation rather than profitability. Demers and Lev (2001) found that when these valuations 
fell during the “Dotcom Bust”, those Internet companies with the strongest fundamentals were 
the most resilient.75 This suggests that the fundamentals highlighted by this article may be 
particularly important for investors in identifying cryptocurrencies with mid- to long-term 
value.

The presence of less predictable speculation is particularly problematic given the high 
volatility in cryptocurrency prices, illustrated by the charts in Appendix A (Figures 2-6). 
Throughout  2017, extreme  increases  in  prices  have  been  observed,  particularly  with  
Bitcoin,76-78 in absolute terms, but also with the hundred-fold increases in Ethereum and Dash, 
and over three-hundred-fold increases in NEM and Ripple (Figures 3 and 5). This trend seems 
to be reversing with Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, and Monero reducing to less than 
half, and Dash, NEM, Ripple, and Zcash reducing to less than a third of their value in 2018 up 
to 10 April (Figures 4 and 6). Figure 2 illustrates a similar pattern in 2014 when even more 
severe declines were observed. Litecoin’s price fell to less than a tenth in less than a year. 
Investors and participants risk entering at the peak of a speculative boom to see their holdings 
greatly reduce in value.  
Volatility is worsened by the nascent nature of the trading infrastructure, with exchanges 
facing difficulties in handling surges in demand, denial-of-service attacks, and theft.79 The 
threat of losing access to cryptocurrency holdings may trigger investors to sell even if the 
cryptocurrency’s fundamentals are strong, contributing to the high price variation. 
Infrastructure difficulties may explain why prices can differ across exchanges, with Bitcoin 
prices varying by USD 4000 on 8 December 2017.79 
6. Conclusion 
A new classification has been developed which reflects the functional diversity of 
cryptocurrencies, by categorising them into three broad types: crypto-transaction, crypto-fuel 
and crypto-voucher tokens. Applying this classification can be used to identify the different 
fundamentals inherent to the different cryptocurrency types. This provides both a framework 
for investors and participants to assess whether a cryptocurrency could fulfil its purpose, and a 
basis for regulators to start to assess whether a cryptocurrency is properly designed to meet 
investor expectations, as part of fulfilling their investor protection function.  
At the beginning of 2018, a severe reversal of cryptocurrencies’ previous rise in value has 
been observed, possibly indicative of a sustained downturn that could have profound 
consequences for token-holders. The future of cryptocurrencies beyond this reversal is 
unclear. Their fate could follow that of equities after the “South Sea Bubble,” where the new 
asset class became banned for 100 years and the money invested lost. 80  Alternatively, 
cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals could parallel Internet companies with strong 
fundamentals, such as Amazon and Google who survived the collapse in equity prices in the 
Dotcom Bust and came to be dominant forces in the Internet world. An important difference 
between these bubbles is that equities in the South Sea Bubble were dominated by fraudulent 
claims,80 whilst Internet companies often solved real, important problems.81 
Contrary to much of the negative commentary around cryptocurrencies,14, 15 fundamentals 
can be articulated. The results of this article suggest that in this changing landscape, 
cryptocurrencies that serve a real purpose will dominate the cryptocurrency market, but 
whether this continues to be predominantly Bitcoin is yet to be determined. There are other 
forms of electronic cash (crypto-transaction) that offer perceived improvements; furthermore, 
crypto-fuel and crypto-voucher tokens offer additional functionality and thus potentially 
added value for the user. 
This article has articulated the purposes of crypto-transaction, crypto-fuel, and crypto-
voucher tokens, but whether these resolve real, important problems will be observed as these 
technologies and their use-cases mature. By analogy to the Dotcom Bubble, as the market

34 
matures and speculation becomes less of a dominant force in driving up cryptocurrency 
values, cryptocurrencies with stronger fundamentals underlying them are likely to be the most 
resilient to any downturn in the market. 
A limitation of this article’s analysis is that cryptocurrencies are a rapidly developing asset 
class, and so how they are used could unpredictably change over time, requiring amendment 
to this classification. This is particularly a concern with crypto-fuel tokens, because their wide 
range of potential applications suggests that their primary use could vary substantially (as has 
been discussed for Ethereum). Cryptocurrencies also offer new sociological models, such as 
relating to political governance,82 and so participants may be more interested in joining a 
system to support a given philosophy, rather than based on speculation or the underlying 
fundamentals, in which case different issues may be relevant.   
Future research could examine to what extent the identified fundamentals and/or 
speculation are the drivers of cryptocurrency values for each of the three different 
cryptocurrency types, as more data becomes available.

Appendix A 
The below charts illustrate the variation in different cryptocurrencies’ prices over time. Prices 
are divided by the price at the start of the series, such that a value of 2 indicates that prices 
have doubled since the beginning of the period. Baselines equalling one are included to ease 
comparison. Charts were created using R packages ggplot2 83 and cowplot, 84  using data 
sourced from www.coingecko.com, which had a broad coverage and provided historical data 
in CSV format.

By differentiating tokens based on their functional attributes, cryptocurrency tokens can be categorised into crypto-transaction tokens (which act as a cash substitute); crypto-fuel tokens (which underpin generic blockchain applications); and crypto-voucher tokens (which can be exchanged for a predefined asset). This classification is applied to identify important issues when considering whether to participate in a cryptocurrency system, such as the impact of potential forks, token supply expectations and the level of dependence on a few operators (entity-dependence). For crypto-transaction tokens (and crypto-fuel tokens if used in a similar or overlapping role) it shows the importance of the token being seen as a “better” form of money. For crypto-fuel tokens, the popularity of blockchain applications and the utility of the crypto-fuel system in application development is vital. For crypto-voucher tokens, the value of the underlying asset, the token’s exchangeability for that asset and the importance of a digital representation should be considered by participants. The interplay between fundamentals and speculation as drivers of price is considered.

ABSTRACT 
This research project was conducted to look into what sort of frauds can be committed 
to steal unsuspecting investors’ cryptocurrencies. The inspiration for this research came 
in the form of the fact that millions of dollars are lost to cryptocurrency fraud each day, 
and many of these frauds are successful due to the public’s naivete towards the dangers 
of investing in cryptocurrencies. After researching many different cryptocurrency fraud 
cases, the frauds could be categorized into four major categories. These categories 
include Ponzi schemes, fake initial coin offering schemes, pump and dump schemes as 
well as cryptocurrency theft.

 I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Britton McKay for all her help and guidance 
while completing this project. I could not have completed this project without her 
mentorship and enthusiasm concerning my topic. I would have gone in a totally different 
direction with my research had I not been inspired by an anecdote concerning shady 
activities that could be conducted with cryptocurrencies in her A.I.S. class last spring 
semester.

The inspiration for this research project stemmed from the idea that not enough 
people are educated on the dangers of cryptocurrencies. Many crypto-investors lose large 
amounts of capital every day to fraud committed with cryptocurrencies and I have 
theorized that this is due in part to the public’s naiveté towards all of the fraudulent 
activity that can be conducted with cryptocurrencies. I conducted research on the subject 
to test the hypothesis that a typical group of college students would not be able to 
correctly answer a majority of questions pertaining to cryptocurrencies and frauds that 
can be committed with them. The survey was administered in introductory business 
classes at two universities and included 125 students from 18 to 26+ years of age. The 
survey included many topics ranging from basic questions pertaining to how 
cryptocurrencies function, to basic financial frauds that could be committed with 
cryptocurrencies as well as questions designed to ascertain the students’ level of 
understanding of unsafe crypto-trading procedures (fig. C). The results proved my 
hypothesis that college students could not successfully answer a majority of questions 
correctly pertaining to cryptocurrencies. The findings go to show that exactly 50% of the 
questions asked in the survey were answered correctly by a majority of participants, thus 
proving my hypothesis that the students could not answer a majority of the questions in 
the survey correctly. (fig. B). It is also interesting to note that that when asked about to 
what degree they believed that cryptocurrencies were safe investments utilizing a scale 
from 1-7, a majority of the participants fell within the 2-4 range. When asked about their 
familiarity concerning cryptocurrencies using the same scale, most participants fell 
within the 1-3 range. These findings prove that more people need to be educated about 
the potential dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies before they invest in them.

Ever since Bitcoin began the cryptocurrency craze when it was introduced in 
2009, many investors have flocked to cryptocurrencies believing that they can be newest, 
hippest way to ‘get rich quick’. Many crypto-investors have experienced massive payouts 
from investing in cryptocurrencies as well as enjoyed the perks of having capital in a 
decentralized exchange. However, there is a dark side to this budding cryptocurrency 
market. As they have for centuries, fraudsters and con men have evolved with the times, 
finding new ways to defraud unassuming crypto-investors every day. This new 
generation of fraudsters has found ways to perpetrate Ponzi schemes, create fake initial 
coin offerings, pull exit schemes, coordinate pump and dump schemes as well as concoct 
many different schemes to steal investors’ cryptocurrencies out from under their noses. 
More and more people lose money to these frauds as the popularity of cryptocurrencies 
rises. A recent survey conducted by Bitcoin.com News found that crypto-investors lose 
$9.1 million a day on average to cryptocurrency fraud (Shobhit, 2018). This statistic just 
goes to show that the public needs to become more educated on the many ways one can 
lose money when investing in the proverbial ‘wild west’ of investments. 
 Ponzi schemes are frauds in which perpetrators pay off old investors’ dividends 
with new investments from new investors. Most of the time, the perpetrator’s investment 
firm will not even own a single share of stock. New investors are wrangled in by falsified 
reports, unrealistically high return rates and the recommendations of older investors. 
Many are familiar with this fraud scheme due to the publicity that the Bernie Madoff case 
elicited. However, due to the general public’s naiveite concerning cryptocurrencies, most 
may not be familiar with Ponzi Schemes that can be committed with cryptocurrencies. 
Probably the most infamous ‘Crypto-Ponzi Scheme’ would be the scheme perpetrated by 
5 
 
Bitconnect. On the surface, Bitconnect seems like a perfectly legitimate 
cryptocurrency/exchange with a user-friendly website complete with a fun, animated 
video explaining its supposed perks. However, Bitconnect perpetrated a Ponzi scheme 
that relieved thousands of investors of their cash. Initial investors were promised returns 
of up to 120% in the early days of the cryptocurrency. Investors were told by Bitconnect 
that they would earn ‘interest’ on their BCC’s if they stored and traded them on 
Bitconnect’s native cryptocurrency exchange thus rendering 95% of BCC transactions to 
occur on said exchange (Buntinx, 2018).  Another red flag was that any purchases of 
Bitconnect Coin (BCC) had to be paid in Bitcoin. This was most likely due to the fact 
that cash purchases are easier to trace as opposed to purchases using Bitcoin or any other 
cryptocurrency. Bitconnect supplied investors with earnings reports that would show how 
much they had gained in interest. The ‘interest’ was no doubt earned through the funds 
coming from new investors; the textbook definition of a Ponzi scheme (Jenkin, 2018). As 
of January 17th, 2018, many believe that Bitconnect’s Ponzi scheme has come to a halt. 
The price of BCC had decreased drastically by 80% in a short amount of time falling 
from a lofty $400 per BCC to a mere $27 per BCC (Buntinx, 2018). This rapid decline is 
no doubt in response to many crypto-investors’ realizations that they were most likely 
being scammed out of their money and had no chance of recovering their funds. 
Unfortunately, the perpetrators of the scheme covered their tracks very well. By operating 
anonymously and requiring that all BCC purchased be made be bought with Bitcoin, they 
made it nearly impossible for investigators to track them down. Some estimate that 
anywhere between 1 and 10 million dollars were stolen as a result of this fraud (cryptick, 
et al). Regardless of what the scope of the damage of this Crypto-Ponzi scheme actually 
6 
 
was, the fraud was prominent enough to make many potential crypto-investor wary of his 
or her next crypto-investment. Another notable ‘Crypto-Ponzi Scheme’ would be the one 
that a company by the name of Bitfinex perpetrated. Bitfinex started out as legitimate 
‘Crypto-company’ that took in investors just as any public company would. The scam 
began when Bitfinex servers were hacked and thieves made off with $72,000,000 worth 
of customer investments. In an attempt to minimize the effects of the theft, Bitfinex 
executives encouraged investors to convert their shares into equity within the company 
thus creating value from nothing at all. Once most of the investors had converted their 
investments to shares, Bitfinex then encouraged them to sell their equity as shares to new 
investors. Once enough people had fallen for the fraud, they used the new investors’ 
funds to pay off the hack victims’ hold outs, in effect, creating an effective Ponzi scheme 
(Bitfinexed, 2017). The cryptocurrency Tether is yet another example of a Ponzi scheme 
committed with cryptocurrencies. Tether is a type of cryptocurrency that is purposefully 
set to an equal exchange rate. Theoretically, this allows Tether to act as a safe medium 
for investors who are constantly trading one cryptocurrency for another. Tether claims 
that for each Tether on the marketplace, there will be one U.S. dollar to back it up. Red 
flags manifest when you look into the numbers for yourself. On the open exchange at the 
time this research was conducted, Tether has approximately 2,830,109,970 Tethers in 
circulation (www.coinmarketcap.com). According to Tether’s last audit at the time of this 
research, which occurred on May 23rd, 2017, auditors could only account for 
$44,771,061.81 in U.S. dollars which is not even close to the figure of Tether in 
circulation (Crypto Investor, 2017). Many crypto-investors believe that Tether is 
perpetrating a Ponzi scheme since the amount of cash that they are supposed to have to 
7 
 
back up their cryptocurrency is nowhere close to the amount of cryptocurrencies on the 
market as there should be. Along with the numbers not matching up, many crypto-
investors are also wary of a few other red flags surrounding Tether’s business practices 
such as the business ties with the aforementioned Bitfinex, the disintegration of 
relationships with many prominent banks, lawsuits against said banks, the tendency of 
Tether to withhold crucial information from investors as well as Ronn Torrosian’s (head 
of public relations for Tether) past association with a company that had committed a 
Ponzi scheme in the past (BitcoinExchangeGuide,2017). Fraudsters are famous for their 
craftiness and ingenuity, so it is no surprise that they have adapted an age-old scheme to 
cryptocurrencies. 
 Another typical fraud associated with cryptocurrencies would be the fake ICO 
scheme. In the world of cryptocurrencies, ICO’s or Initial Coin Offerings are similar in 
many aspects to Initial Public Offerings for stocks. Typically, a cryptocurrency company 
will release a predetermined number of coins to the open market in the same way stocks 
are issued when a company goes public. Many ICO’s are in fact legitimate 
cryptocurrencies that have potential to make the investor a profit like any other security. 
However, there is a substantial portion of ICO’s that are deemed fraudulent since the 
executives of these companies attempt to coerce investors to invest in cryptocurrencies 
that do not actually exist in an attempt to relieve them of their money in a quick and 
efficient manner. These con artists capitalize on potential investors’ FOMO, or ‘fear of 
missing out’ on the next big cryptocurrency payout (Zhu and Zhang, 2018). Researchers 
from a ‘Big 4’ accounting firm, Ernst & Young, estimate that more than 10% of the $3.7 
billion invested in ICO’s thus far have been stolen due to fake ICO schemes such as these 
8 
 
to date (Zhu and Zhang, 2018). Fake ICO perpetrators will attempt to entice potential 
investors to become ensnared in their scheme by fabricating exorbitantly high return 
rates, lying about the numbers of investors and how much they had invested as well as 
advertising novel features in an effort to make their non-existent cryptocurrency 
irresistible. A fake ICO scheme under the guise of a fake cryptocurrency by the name of 
Plexcoin did just this. Plexcoin’s executives promised unbelievable returns of up to 
1,354% in the first 30 days, which of course cannot be a number that any feasible security 
could guarantee (Levine, 2017). Plexcoin also brought in investors by suggesting that 
they were in the process of developing a credit card like instrument deemed ‘Plexcard’. 
Supposedly, this fictitious card was designed to draw Plexcoin out of ATM’s as well as 
“be used anywhere in the world and [would] be connected directly to [a] PlexWallet. It 
will give you the opportunity to spend your money in a totally confidential way” (Levine, 
2017). In addition to the ridiculous statements concerning the fake cryptocurrency, 
Plexcoin’s website and business plan were also worryingly vague. It turns out that the 
fake ICO scheme perpetrated by Plexcoin was the brainchild of a repeat fraudster, 
Dominic LaCroix. The S.E.C. was able to prosecute LaCroix since fake ICO’s fall under 
securities fraud (Levine, 2017). Unfortunately, LaCroix was still able steal over $15 
million before his arrest (Lee, 2017). Another interesting example of a fake ICO scheme 
would be the REcoin scheme. REcoin was a fictitious cryptocurrency created by a 
fraudster by the name of Maksim Zaslavskiy. Zaslavskiy pedaled his ‘revolutionary’, new 
cryptocurrency as being the first ever cryptocurrency to be backed by real estate. One 
article described REcoin as a great investment vehicle for investors wary of the world of 
cryptocurrency since, unlike any other cryptocurrency, the “proceeds from the initial sale 
9 
 
of tokens will be invested in the highly regulated real estate market in virtually all 
jurisdictions while reinforcing the holders' and investors' confidence in the REcoin 
“(Zaslavskiy, 2017). Zaslavskiy also perpetrated the same fraud with another fake 
cryptocurrency with the designation of DRC for Diamond Reserve Club. The theory 
behind DRC was similar to REcoin, but instead of proceeds being invested in real estate, 
proceeds were supposedly invested in diamonds (Morris, 2017). However, it seems as 
though Zaslavskiy never did invest any proceeds from REcoin into any real estate or any 
proceeds from DRC into diamonds. According to an investigation conducted by the SEC, 
it was discovered that neither REcoin or DRC had any operations (Morris, 2017). 
Zaslavskiy and LaCroix are just a few of many fraudsters that have attempted to 
perpetrate fake ICO schemes. The S.E.C. believes that this problem is so prevalent that 
this is such a prevalent issue for potential crypto-investors, that they have even made a 
mock, fake ICO website in order for them to consult when wondering whether or not 
invest in a cryptocurrency (Liao, 2018). The S.E.C.’s website can be reached at 
www.howeycoins.com and should be consulted by any and everyone who is on the fence 
about the legitimacy of a cryptocurrency (HoweyCoins, 2018).  
 The next scheme to be discussed is exit schemes. According to Investopedia, an 
exit scheme is “a fraudulent practice by unethical cryptocurrency promoters who vanish 
with investors’ money during or after an ICO” (Shobhit, 2018). Sometimes, exit schemes 
may be able to start out as legitimate enterprises. However, due to adverse economic 
conditions, poor business planning or a combination of both, future perpetrators of exit 
schemes may attempt to vanish into thin air in an attempt to escape the consequences of 
overseeing a failing business, making off with all the investors’ funds in the process. This 
10 
 
sort of scheme has become popular with cryptocurrency start ups seeing as anonymity is 
easy to maintain when all a business’s operations are virtual. A crypto-company by the 
name of Giza perpetrated a scheme just like this. Investors believed Giza to be a 
legitimate company since it had announced a partnership with a Russian tech firm, Third 
Pin LLC. Giza contracted Third Pin to aid in the creation of a secure device that could 
store cryptocurrencies. Giza in turn raised over 2,100 Ethereum coins, an amount equal to 
roughly $2.4 million at the time. Investors began to worry when Third Pin announced that 
they had cut ties with Giza. Around February of 2018, all of the investors’ funds were 
transferred out of the known Giza wallet, supposedly by the mysterious and anonymous 
C.E.O. of Giza, Marco Fike. No one has been able to track down Fike (if that is even his 
real name) since his LinkedIn profile contained falsified information such as the fact he 
attended Oxford University when Oxford has no record of his attendance (Kharpal, 
2018). Giza has now become synonymous in the crypto-trading community with exit 
schemes. A similar exit scheme was perpetrated by the crypto-company, LoopX. LoopX 
told investors that it had developed a complex crypto-trading software that contained an 
algorithm that would earn investors weekly profits. Contrary to the payouts that they 
were expecting, investors were instead relieved of 276 Bitcoin and 2,446 Ethereum in 
January 2018. It appears as if LoopX decided to pull an exit scheme when they decided 
that they would not be able to convince investors that they were unable to come up with a 
software that could do everything that they promised. There are no traces of LoopX’s 
website or the type-o riddled white paper anywhere on the internet seeing as the 
fraudsters wiped every trace of LoopX’s existence from the internet (Mix, 2018). Even 
though some crypto-companies may pull an exit scheme to escape a business plan gone 
11 
 
wrong, there are many more fraudsters perpetrate the same scheme with no intention of 
ever delivering anything for their customers or investors. One of the biggest exit schemes 
that fits into this category would be the one pulled off by CabbageTech. Patrick 
McDonnell, C.E.O. of CabbageTech pulled his exit scheme by offering customers crypto-
investment trading advice in exchange for payments of cryptocurrency. CabbageTech 
claimed that with their service, one could expect as high as a “300% return on an 
investment in less than a week” (Cheng, 2018). However, McDonnell never delivered the 
service to his customers, and attempted to simply exit the business with approximately 
$1.1 million worth of customers’ Bitcoin. However, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have filed charges against 
McDonnell and CabbageTech to thwart ever growing cryptocurrency fraud in America 
(Cheng, 2018). The CabbageTech fraud is not alone by any stretch of the imagination. 
Benebit was supposed to be a novel cryptocurrency company that would use benefits to 
incentivize customers to invest. Benebit also claimed that it would the rewards system 
would work like racking up frequent flyer miles from your airline. However, investors 
began to question Benebit’s authenticity when they discovered that the photos of the team 
members were fake. Soon after the allegations were brought up, the scammers exited 
with estimated funds of $2.7 to $4 million before ever even bringing their novel 
cryptocurrency idea to the market (Kean, 2018). A cryptocurrency by the name of Opair 
has a very similar story. A mysterious developer who went by Wasserman offered a 
cryptocurrency that supposedly would act as a sort of “decentralized debit card system 
using its own token, XPO” (Kean, 2018). The cryptocurrency brought in an estimated 
$2.9 million before the fraudsters exited with all the funds after investors noticed that the 
12 
 
team’s LinkedIn profiles were fake. To date, nobody knows the true identity of 
Wasserman, or where the money from Opair has gone to (Kean, 2018). Not all exit 
schemes have to be as elaborate as the previous examples do. Probably the most 
ridiculous exit scheme was perpetrated by the ironically named PonziCoin. PonziCoin 
raised over $250,000 before the perpetrator vanished with the funds. Apparently, the 
cryptocurrency openly marketed itself as a scam, however, gullible investors were still 
drawn to invest money into what they must have thought was a legitimate cryptocurrency 
(Kean, 2018). With the ever-increasing amount of exit schemes that are uncovered every 
day, prospective crypto-investors must remain careful to research the legitimacy of these 
cryptocurrencies and businesses now more than ever.  
 Pump and dump schemes have been around for ages and have proven to be fairly 
lucrative schemes for fraudsters to perpetrate. According to Investopedia, pump and 
dump schemes can be defined as a fraud “that attempts to boost the price of a stock 
through recommendations based on false, misleading or greatly exaggerated statements” 
(Investopedia, 2018). In other words, fraudsters will pump up the price by buying 
substantial amounts of the stock as well as propagating fake news through fake celebrity 
tweets or fake articles to entice others to help them inflate the price of the security, then 
dump it all in one single coordinated effort to make a profit. This may seem like a 
victimless crime, but one must consider the amount that investors who are purchasing the 
‘dumped’ securities are purchasing them at an artificially inflated price under the false 
pretenses of the scammers. These new investors will no doubt lose significant amounts to 
the scam. Pump and dump schemes have been popular ever since the 1920’s and remain 
relevant today almost 100 years later. Fraudsters have now taken to perpetrating these 
13 
 
schemes with cryptocurrencies. Due to cryptocurrency’s markets inherent qualities of 
volatility and unpredictability, crypto-investors’ extreme fear of missing out on the next 
big cryptocurrency as well as the ability to remain completely anonymous using the 
internet, pump and dump perpetrators have found it relatively easy to make a quick profit 
off budding cryptocurrencies. Usually these scams are started by only one or a handful of 
people. These ‘investment groups’ (as many pump and dump groups like to refer to 
themselves) coordinate their efforts through anonymous messaging apps such as Discord 
and Telegram and recruit new members through means of shameless social media 
advertising and member recruitment. Recruitment is vital to the success of these pump 
and dump schemes since the biggest contributing factor to how much the price of the 
cryptocurrency can be inflated is based solely on how many coins are bought up by how 
many investors. Members are enticed to recruit new members with the incentive of being 
promoted to higher ranks within the group based on how many new members that they 
have invited. The advantages of being of a higher rank means that you will get anywhere 
0.5 to a 3.5 second earlier notification when to dump your coins to get a higher return on 
an investment since you will be selling before a majority of the group does. This means 
that the higher rank you are within the group, the better opportunity you will have to 
make the highest possible profit. However, this logic backfires for most of the members, 
in effect, scamming the scammers. Only the top of the group sees any real profit while 
the ones who lost are left to rationalize their loss based on the assumption that they 
simply sold too late (Martineau, 2018). As these scams have become more and more 
popular over the past couple years, the government has decided to step in to try to 
regulate them. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has announced that they 
14 
 
will focus on “detecting and deterring fraudulent activities, such as pump and dump 
schemes, while not stifling early innovation in the crypto space” (CFTC, 2017). The 
CFTC and SEC can prosecute pump and dump schemes under the Securities Act of 1933 
(SEC, 2017). However, due to the anonymity of the message groups, it is hard to discern 
who is involved in these schemes. This is the reason for the CFTC offering rewards of 
$100,000 or up to 30% of the sanctions recuperated by the fraudsters for whistleblowers 
who expose the heads of these pump and dump schemes (Crypto Insider, 2018).   
 In addition to the aforementioned schemes that can be committed with 
cryptocurrencies, there are a few schemes that I have categorized simply as 
‘cryptocurrency theft’. Due to the inherent nature of cryptocurrencies being a virtual 
currency, hackers have attempted to relieve unsuspecting investors of their 
cryptocurrencies for years. I have chosen to categorize the following frauds as 
cryptocurrency theft since they all involve some sort of perpetrator stealing 
cryptocurrencies from an unsuspecting holder. Most financially literate individuals will 
be familiar with the infamous ‘Nigerian Prince’ or 419 fraud (labeled 419 due to the 
section of Nigerian law that makes it illegal). This scheme is a type of advance fee 
scheme that involves a scam artist, stereotypically from Nigeria, that entices someone to 
wire him or her a small sum of money in order to clear a large sum in which the scammer 
claims can be split between both the con-man and the conned. However, all these stories 
are fictitious, and the investor usually never sees any of their investment ever again. 
These scammers are now perpetrating these same 419 scams, but now with 
cryptocurrencies. In addition to scamming citizens abroad such as us in America, these 
Nigerian scammers have also taken to scamming their own countrymen. The goal is to 
15 
 
convince unsuspecting Nigerians to wire over naira; the local, Nigerian currency, for 
phony cryptocurrencies such as ‘billion coin’ (McDonnell, 2018). In addition to these 
crypto-Nigerian schemes, hackers have also become prevalent threats to the security of 
investors’ cryptocurrencies. These hackers will use many different tactics to steal 
cryptocurrencies. Despite the many safeguards that blockchain technology can offer to 
help protect investors from hackers, they still manage to steal cryptocurrencies every day. 
One man in a suburb of Los Angeles lost his life savings to crypto-hackers. Chris Dejrit 
lost over $22,000 to hackers posing as technicians for the exchange that he was using. 
The requested that Dejrit give them his personal logins so that they could fix some bugs 
in his profile. The next time Dejrit logged in, he noticed that his entire stash of Bitcoin 
was gone without a trace (CBS Los Angeles, 2017). Another type of cryptocurrency theft 
that has become more and more popular over the past couple years are ransomware 
schemes. These schemes have caught the entire crypto-world off guard. Fraudsters 
perpetrate these schemes by utilizing ransomware to take over people’s computers and 
vow only to unlock them once a payment of untraceable cryptocurrency has been made to 
the fraudster’s e-wallet. In 2015, it was estimated that CryptoWall, a specific type of 
ransomware virus, made off with over $18 million worth of cryptocurrencies (THE 
DATA TEAM, 2017). Ransomware, another prominent ransomware virus, also swept 
across Europe in May of 2017 causing considerable damage to all those affected. The 
impact was so great that many European legislators attempted to make cryptocurrencies 
illegal so that scams such as Ransomware would not be allowed to persist (Coleman, 
2017). However, the most egregious cryptocurrency thefts that the world of 
cryptocurrency has ever seen would have to be the hacks of Mt. Gox and Bitfinex. Mt. 
16 
 
Gox and Bitfinex are both what the cryptocurrency community refers to as exchanges. A 
cryptocurrency exchange acts as a market place where cryptocurrencies can be stored and 
traded. These exchanges hold massive amounts of the world’s cryptocurrencies and are 
trusted by their customers to provide a safe trading environment. Mt. Gox was not hacked 
once, but twice. The first hack occurred in 2011 when the hacker gained access to the 
exchange by using an auditor’s credentials that were supposed to be kept confidential. 
The first hack made off with 2,609 Bitcoins, a miniscule amount compared to what was 
lost during the second hack. The second hack, which occurred in 2014, relieved Mt. Gox 
of 750,000 Bitcoins which is the equivalent to around $350 million, an amount equal to 
over 70% of Bitcoins in circulation at the time. With the second hack, all of Mt. Gox’s 
customers had lost all faith in the company, and it filed for bankruptcy shortly afterwards 
(Khatwani, 2017). Along with the Mt. Gox hack, hackers were also able to do 
comparable damage to the Bitfinex exchange. Hackers were able to exploit a weakness in 
Bitfinex’s authentication controls and steal 120,000 Bitcoins from investors making it the 
second biggest cryptocurrency theft since Mt. Gox (Khatwani, 2017). Along with Mt. 
Gox and Bitfinex, other popular exchanges such as Bitfloor, Poloniex and Bitstamp, 
rendering the aforementioned examples to not be isolated incidents (Khatwani, 2017). It 
is important to note that all the hacks were made possible due to negligence or oversight 
by those in charge of the exchanges and not simply investor error such as some other 
examples mentioned earlier.

 ABSTRACT 
 Blockchain has emerged into one of the most promising technologies for the future. Its most 
successful implementation in the form of cryptocurrency has shifted many existing paradigms 
where financial instruments were limited by locations or jurisdictions. While blockchain is touted to 
offer many significant and promising features on the other hand it also increases the difficulty level 
in the taxation area as well as digital forensics. We investigated the issues and explores the real-
world situation and how taxation and digital forensics can cope with these technology challenges. 
 
Blockchain telah berkembang menjadi salah satu teknologi yang paling menjanjikan di masa 
mendatang. Implementasi blockchain yang paling sukses saat ini, mata uang kripto, telah mulai 
memberikan dampak perubahan paradigma yang ada, di mana instrument keuangan tradisional 
terbatas pada waktu dan yurisdiksi. Blockchain digadang-gadang dapat menawarkan fitur-fitur 
yang signifikan dan menjanjikan, namun di sisi lain dapat meningkatkan kesulitan dalam bidang 
perpajakan dan juga forensik digital. Kami menginvestigasi persoalan ini dan mengeksplorasi 
kondisi nyata yang ada, termasuk pula mempelajari bagaimana perpajakan dan forensic digital 
dapat beradaptasi terhadap tantangan teknologi ini.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The launch of Bitcoin in early 2009 marks the birth of the cryptocurrency 
industry. The field has grown rapidly in the last few years that now its market value 
reaches several hundred billion US dollar1. Bitcoin as a brand has been known 
globally as it has been in the spotlight of mainstream media platforms as well as 
other media managed personally. Its staggering price increase motivates people 
to trade Bitcoin for fiat currencies such that new cryptocurrency exchanges are 
now a profitable business.  
Although it is now extremely popular, the original writer of Bitcoin’s 
whitepaper as well as its first version of the codes is only known by the name 
Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym. He improved the existing idea of implementing 
cryptographic techniques into a payment system without any central party as 
written in the whitepaper (Nakamoto 2008). He also coined the term Bitcoin as well 
as the first to “mine” Bitcoin when creating the first block referred as genesis block. 
The success of Bitcoin has sparked a massive development in the 
cryptocurrency area. Currently, there are more than 1,600 cryptocurrencies 
                                                             
1 Total Market capitalisation of US$212B according to Coinmarketcap on 6 November 2018 
available in the market2, each with its uniqueness, strengths, and weaknesses. 
This new technology is also expected to affect financial industry as well as taxation, 
where the digital asset can be utilized not only to store value but also to send 
payments.  
Our Contribution. First, we start with explaining the technology and develop 
classifications of cryptocurrencies based on their characteristics. Then we explore 
cryptocurrency usages and relate the matter in taxation area. We also explore how 
digital forensics can be done to gather information regarding cryptocurrency 
activities. Lastly, we suggest several steps to enhance cryptoforensics which are 
tailored for law enforcement agencies such as Directorate General of Taxes. 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
This chapter describes the background knowledge of our paper, which 
consists of three parts, namely cryptocurrency, taxation, and digital forensics. 
2.1. Cryptocurrency 
2.1.1. Overview 
Instead of relying on a central authority to control and run the whole system, 
cryptocurrency lets anyone to conduct data verification on a publicly available 
distributed ledger. To enable the feature, several cryptographic techniques are 
implemented in the system, making it fully run by the automated protocols. 
Cryptocurrency runs on the Internet, where traditional boundaries such as 
working hours, geographical locations, and jurisdictions are eliminated. 
International money transfers can be done through cryptocurrency network which 
can be verified within minutes. The success of Bitcoin has caused a rapid adoption 
of cryptocurrencies across the world. 
2.1.2. The Technologies Behind Cryptocurrency 
In recent days, there is a huge collection of technologies being implemented 
in various cryptocurrencies. However, there are several core technologies that are 
used in (almost) all cryptocurrencies. 
Public Key Cryptography (PKC). PKC is a cryptographic technique which 
utilises two keys: public key and private key. As the name implies, the public key 
is intended to be publicized (shared) to other parties, while the private key needs 
to be kept secret by the owner. Both keys are different but having a 1-to-1 
relationship. This technique enables the cryptocurrency users to prove the 
ownership of the coins without revealing their real identities by the help of digital 
signatures. 
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). DLT is a public ledger where the 
information stored in the ledger is shared among system participants. The 
                                                             
2 Based on information published by Coinmarketcap.com on 6 November 2018 
information inside DLT is constructed such that stored data is infeasible to tamper. 
DLT is an append-only database; consensus method is applied to determine which 
participant can write the next data. There are at least two major types in DLT, 
namely blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). In DLT, new data is first 
collected and then stored once every predetermined period (epoch), constructing 
a sequential historical data. The way it is stored in the existing storage is by linking 
it to the previous data: the hash of the previous data is included in the new data. 
While blockchain can only have one main branch in the system (Nakamoto 2008), 
DAG allows multiple branches when storing information (Popov 2016). In this 
paper, blockchain and DLT will be used interchangeably to refer DLT as a general 
concept. 
Hash functions and Merkle Tree. Hash function is an algorithm to convert 
an arbitrary length data into a value which has a constant length over the same 
hash function. One of the main roles of hash function is to represent data without 
mentioning the data at all, hence it acts as the commitment of the represented 
data. Merkle Tree is a form of binary tree where anyone can verify the correctness 
of any data within its leaves without the need of knowing all the leaves. The Merkle 
Tree is often used as an authenticated data structure (ADS) where it is easy to 
verify the integrity of its leaves. 
2.1.3. Various Types of Cryptocurrency 
Classifying cryptocurrencies is important in digital forensics as it will 
determine the tools and methods during the investigation, or even determine how 
difficult the investigation will be. Based on its characteristics, we can classify the 
cryptocurrencies into several types. The naming convention is coined based on 
Bitcoin as the standard cornerstone, hence we also use the blockchain technology 
in our classification. 
Blockchain 1.0. The cryptocurrencies in this class are those 
cryptocurrencies following the identical (or with minor changes) protocols of 
Bitcoin. Litecoin and Dogecoin are two most popular cryptocurrencies other than 
Bitcoin. This class is marked by its legacy protocols such as Nakamoto Consensus, 
pseudo-anonymity, and input-output transactions. The main function of these 
cryptocurrencies is payment method. 
Blockchain 1.1. This class is for those cryptocurrencies that have evolved 
from version 1.0 by embedding additional features on their systems. The 
cryptocurrencies in this class are NXT, Ardor, NEM, Waves, and others. Not only 
as payment methods, these cryptocurrencies also provide rich features such as 
peer-to-peer marketplace, child chains, digital asset management, electronic 
voting, and so on. 
Blockchain 1.2. The need of stronger anonymity motivated people to embed 
extra anonymity features on cryptocurrencies. The members of this class are 
known to be more difficult to analyse than Bitcoin, such as Monero, Zcash, and 
Dash. Several other cryptocurrencies such as Verge claimed that these products 
are anonymous, despite it is still unclear how their proposed protocols can provide 
a strong anonymity to the data and to their users. 
Blockchain 2.0. The development of Ethereum has expanded the scope of 
blockchain from merely storing data into a system that enables its users to run 
programs on its virtual environment which is in sync to its permanently-stored data. 
Blockchain 2.0 offers smart contract capability to its users, where the users are 
given the flexibility of creating complex algorithms using the provided software 
development tools. Not only providing a payment scheme, the smart contract can 
be utilised to develop decentralized applications (dApps) with unlimited features 
which will be run directly on the blockchain (Wood 2014). 
Token. This class exists due to the popularity of smart contract. In a smart 
contract platform, a developer can create a contract which contains values, or 
tokens. These tokens can be set to be transferred from their owners to receivers. 
Token can be treated as a different class of cryptocurrency, but it can also be a 
derivation of smart contract. The most popular token platform at the time of the 
writing is Ethereum, where ERC20 (Vogelsteller and Buterin 2015) is the most 
known standard when creating tokens. By implementing the ERC20 standard, a 
token can be traded with other tokens in a peer-to-peer token market as they have 
identical functions and characteristics. This type of token is also commonly called 
as ERC20 token. 
2.1.4. Activities Related to Cryptocurrency 
As a system, several activities are closely related to cryptocurrency. These 
activities are: mining/staking, transacting, trading, and providing services. Mining 
and staking are activities related to cryptocurrency’s open consensus. In a 
cryptocurrency implementing a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, a miner uses 
computing devices such as computers and Application-Specific Integrated Circuit 
(ASIC). The miners compete to compute mathematical questions, where the 
winner can write the next block. Stakers are participant of any cryptocurrencies 
implementing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where coins are being 
staked and raffled to determine who has the authority to produce the next block. 
Both miner and staker are motivated by the prize coin promised to be rewarded by 
the protocol as well as the right to claim the transaction fees paid by the 
cryptocurrency users. 
While mining requires investment in the form of computing power and staking 
requires a huge amount of money to acquire a significant portion of the coins, 
creating transactions can be done by anyone. The two requirements for creating a 
transaction are a wallet and a fraction of coin. Creating a transaction in a 
cryptocurrency system means the user utilises the wallet application to construct a 
digital information which expresses the coin movement from the payer to the 
payee(s). This information will be authorized by using digital signature(s) which will 
validate that the payer owns the coin(s) to be sent to the payee(s). It is feasible to 
send a fraction of a coin only if the amount exceeds the minimum amount (if 
determined by the cryptocurrency system) and sufficient to pay the transaction fee. 
Cryptocurrency trading activity is a logical result of the emerging digital asset. 
As the cryptocurrencies were getting more valuable and usable in daily life, 
cryptocurrency trading facilitates supply (ask) and demand (bid). While the trading 
platform will receive trading fees, the traders expect to make profits from their 
trading activities. 
As a valuable intangible asset, it is possible that the cryptocurrencies are 
used as a payment method, as most of them were intended to be. However, until 
now the Indonesian government do not facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies as a 
legal tender, where Currency Act 2011 defines Rupiah as the only legal tender in 
Indonesian jurisdiction. The statement is further clarified by Indonesian Central 
Bank through a press release on 13 January 2018 (Press Release No. 
20/4/DKOM) with a lengthy explanation through a FAQ document3. 
2.1.5. Cryptocurrency-related Tools 
In general, a cryptocurrency system is entirely run by its set of protocols. The 
protocols are implemented in one or more application (software) bundles, where 
there will be multiple and separated parties are running the main application, 
usually called as a node. Each node manages a copy of the blockchain containing 
the entire transactions from the genesis block to the newest block. It also validates 
new transactions, (re)publish transactions to its connected peers, and lets wallets 
request information about the blockchain data which will be responded with the 
requested information by the node to the requesting wallets. 
A wallet is a client-side application which helps a user to create transactions, 
manage private keys, and compute the remaining coin balance. The wallet does 
not store any information about the blockchain, hence it relies on the node when it 
requires certain information. There are multiple types of wallet, namely mobile 
wallet which runs in smartphones, desktop wallet in computers, web wallet which 
can be accessed through web browsers and hosted by service providers. There 
are also special wallets such as hardware wallet which contains secured storage 
to protect the private keys and paper wallet which stores private keys in a piece of 
paper.  
Most wallets (excluding paper wallet) are SPV-wallets (Simplified Payment 
Verification wallet) which only store the blockchain header. The correctness of the 
information received from the node it is connected to will be checked by using the 
blockchain header it manages. Merkle tree and the chained blocks structures help 
the data integrity checking. The relationship between nodes and wallets can be 
expressed in Figure 1.

Figure 1. An illustration of a Blockchain system with multiple nodes (daemons) and several wallets 
connected to one of the node (Wijaya, et al. 2018). 
A blockchain explorer is an application which will help the users to explore 
the content of a blockchain. Normally, every cryptocurrency provides at least one 
blockchain explorer as a way to prove the transparency of the system. However, 
popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have many options of 
blockchain explorers which are provided for free by multiple parties. 
2.1.6. Indonesian Cryptocurrency Markets 
Indodax4 (previously known as Bitcoin Indonesia) is the first cryptocurrency 
exchange in Indonesia and the only cryptocurrency exchange for several years. 
Due to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in Indonesia, now there are 
more platforms for cryptocurrency trading (with order book), such as Luno5, 
Tokocrypto6, Coinone7, and Tokenomy8, including over the counter (OTC) 
platforms such as Triv9.  
Indodax provides two types of markets, namely IDR (Indonesian Rupiah) and 
BTC (Bitcoin). In IDR market, the users can buy or sell the paired cryptocurrency 
by using Rupiah, while in BTC by using Bitcoin. Tokenomy supports four markets 
(TEN, BTC, ETH, and USDT). Luno pairs Bitcoin with several currencies such as 
EUR (European Euro), IDR, MYR (Malaysian Ringgit), NGN (Nigerian Naira), ZAR 
(South African Rand), and ETH (Ethereum). Tokocrypto only sells Bitcoin and 
Ethereum where both are paired to IDR, while in Coinone Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, 
Litecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Qtum, Ripple, and Vexanium are traded 
with IDR. As an OTC platform, Triv only sells and buys BTC and ETH. Complete 
lists of cryptocurrencies traded in Indodax and Tokenomy are provided in the 
Appendix. 
Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) procedures 
are commonly implemented in those cryptocurrency exchanges, including those

operating in Indonesia. Users are free to create new accounts, but they need to 
provide real identities (as well as other validation methods such as signatures and 
self-photos) before the new accounts are activated. The KYC and AML procedures 
allow the service providers to store the users’ identities and ID cards on their own 
local storage. 
2.2. Taxation 
Taxation plays an important role in Indonesia State Budget. In financial year 
2018, at least 85% of the total revenue for the national budget comes from tax 
(Kementerian Keuangan Republik Indonesia 2018). This figure shows the 
importance of taxation for the country. Self-assessment policy has been 
implemented as a part of the first Indonesian tax reform in 1981 to replace the 
legacy tax administration system which was highly inefficient and low compliance 
(Prasetyo n.d.). 
However, the self-assessment policy does come with a cost. Tax avoidance 
cases could happen as the taxpayers tend to minimize their tax due. Tax audits 
will be established to measure the compliance, and when preliminary proofs are 
found, the case can be escalated into tax fraud case, which is an offense according 
to Taxation Act 2008. 
2.3. Digital Forensics Techniques 
Digital forensic has multiple branches according to various medium to store 
or to compute digital information. Nevertheless, disk-based forensics and network 
forensics are popular due to their wide scope and usefulness in during the 
investigation. In the disk-based forensics, the focus of the analyses includes but 
not limited to operating system analysis, deleted file analysis, password recovery, 
and user-related data. While the network forensics’ focus is on how multiple 
computers communicate through computer networks, including how network 
protocols are utilized to carry information from the sender to the receiver. 
Digital forensic activities are supported by various forensic tools in the form 
of hardware and software. In accordance to the activities, there are also protocols 
and standard procedures to be followed such that the digital information gathered 
during acquisition process is well-preserved, hence it can be presented as a valid 
evidence in the court. 
 
3. CRYPTAXFORENSIC: CRYPTOFORENSICS FOR TAXATION 
PURPOSES 
In this chapter, we describe cryptaxforensics in details. We coined the term 
cryptaxforensic to define cryptoforensic activities in the taxation area. Data 
collection methods, challenges, and proposed methods to enhance 
cryptoforensics are covered in this chapter. 
 
3.1. The (Potential) Role of Cryptoforensics in Directorate General of 
Taxes 
Cryptoforensic techniques have increased in demand and popularity in 
recent years due to the massive increase of cryptocurrency use. While 
cryptocurrency was not created for ill-purposes, people always find ways to utilize 
the medium in legal offences. Tax offense and other financial fraud cases, 
unfortunately, are not unfamiliar cases in cryptocurrency area, for example in 
(Pearce 2018). Moreover, cryptocurrencies are considered as tax havens due to 
their technologies (Marian 2013). 
While traditional tax fraud cases will be one of the main concerns for 
Directorate General of Taxes, cryptocurrency-related cases must also be on the 
list. Cryptoforensics as digital forensics methods and procedures can be useful in 
collecting information related to cryptocurrency activities. 
3.2. Data Collection in Cryptoforensics 
We have identified several methods for data collection in cryptoforensics, 
including disk-based cryptoforensics, network cryptoforensics, blockchain 
cryptoforensics. Wallet seizure will be discussed in a separate subchapter as it 
serves a different purpose. 
3.2.1. Disk-based Cryptoforensics 
Disk-based cryptoforensics focuses on the examination of wallet applications 
which can be used to manage their coins and/or create transactions. As it has been 
described that there are various types of wallet, multiple digital forensics 
techniques are also needed to gather information. The desktop wallets are 
generally compatible with multiple operating systems such as Windows, OSX, and 
Linux. Moreover, multiple wallets store information in different methods.  
However, it is almost certain that the database file to store the private keys 
and transaction details is encrypted and password-protected. Despite the difficulty 
to read the private keys, it is advisable to collect all information from the application 
folders as well as other locations such as home folder and application data folder 
to investigate the log files. Passwords, PIN keys, or seed words might need to be 
obtained from the users through any appropriate procedures. 
Web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome are also good 
places to search. Two most popular Ethereum wallets, MyEtherWallet10 (MEW) 
and Metamask11 provide web browser addons for their clients. In MEW, addresses 
are visible without login to the wallet, as shown in Figure 2. 
                                                             
10 https://www.myetherwallet.com 
11 https://metamask.io 
 
Figure 2. MyEtherWallet shows several addresses it manages. 
Once the Ethereum addresses are known, the balance will be easily defined 
by the help of any Ethereum explorer, for example Etherscan12. Not only the 
balance, their associated ERC20 tokens can also be concluded by using the same 
tool. 
3.2.2. Network Cryptoforensics 
As with other standard network forensic methods, network cryptoforensics 
also can be done through packet capture techniques. In most cryptocurrency 
systems, there will be two types of network packets, namely RPC and P2P 
connections. RPC is the protocol for the connection between a node and a wallet. 
The wallet sends requests by using RPC interface, and the responses will be sent 
by the node, either in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or BIN (binary) formats. 
 
Figure 3. Captured network packets showing RPC communication. 
                                                             
12 https://etherscan.io 
P2P (peer-to-peer) protocol, on the other hand, is used to exchange 
information between nodes. The protocol’s packets are identified by its “packet 
magic” as a fingerprint. Every cryptocurrency system has its own packet magic, or 
often called as “magic bytes”. An example is shown on Figure 4.  
 
Figure 4. Captured network packets showing P2P communication. 
 
3.2.3. Blockchain Cryptoforensics 
The increase use of cryptocurrency motivated the development of blockchain 
analyses. Taint analysis is commonly used in Blockchain 1.0, where all related 
addresses can be concluded. Taint analysis13 shows other addresses and 
transactions that are directly and indirectly related to a specific address. However, 
the taint analysis will eventually produce a cluster which contains a massive 
number of related addresses, as they are mostly using “haircut” method 
(Greenberg 2018). Several companies such as Chainanalysis14, Coinfirm15, and 
Ciphertrace16 use the method to track bitcoins (Greenberg 2018). Furthermore, 
clustering analyses have been developed and being used to check the information 
stored in Bitcoin’s blockchain (Meiklejohn, et al. 2013) (Ron and Shamir 2013). 
A recent research describes a novel approach which was based on a British 
legal system (Anderson, Shumailov and Ahmed 2018). The new approach 
describes First-In-First-Out (FIFO) method instead of taint analysis, which results 
in a shortened list of related address. 
3.2.4. Wallet/Coin Seizure 
Unlike any other digital assets or financial instruments where user IDs are 
required to transact, cryptocurrencies only require private keys to move coins to 
other addresses. When the private keys are seized from the users or suspects, it 
                                                             
13 An example of Bitcoin taint analysis can be seen in https://www.walletexplorer.com 
14 https://www.chainanalysis.com 
15 https://www.coinfirm.io 
16 https://ciphertrace.com 
is advisable that the information is carefully managed such that anyone having 
access to the private keys cannot easily move the digital assets. The event where 
rogue law enforcement agents moved seized bitcoins has happened in the past 
(Redman 2017) 
The way the problem can be mitigated is to create a new wallet with 
multisignature feature. Several cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin has this feature, 
although unfortunately not all cryptocurrencies have implemented it. In a 
multisignature wallet, each transaction requires more than one valid signature 
which implies that every transaction is approved by multiple parties. Of course, it 
is assumed that the new multisignature wallet’s private keys are held by different 
parties. 
3.3. Challenges 
We identify several challenges for cryptoforensics activities. Sometimes, 
they are not straightforward as its counterparts. Some of these challenges are 
pseudonymity, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, and worldwide markets. 
3.3.1. Pseudonymity 
Although the public blockchains utilized by the cryptocurrencies are 
transparent and accessible through blockchain explorers, it does not mean that 
determining the owners of the coins being transacted in the blockchains is trivial. 
Pseudonymity is a default characteristic in those public blockchains, where the 
users are identified by their addresses. However, complications occur because one 
user can create unlimited number of addresses. A quantitative analysis has 
successfully determined the activities conducted by a cryptocurrency thief (Ron 
and Shamir 2013), however the same technique cannot be applied to other cases. 
3.3.2. Privacy-preserving Cryptocurrencies 
Privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Zcash have 
implemented extra cryptographic techniques such that several information in the 
blockchain is obfuscated. Monero is using ring signature method where the real 
signer is obfuscated by using decoys or false addresses. Moreover, the 
implementation of Ring Confidential Transaction (RingCT) encrypts the amount of 
coins such that it cannot be seen by anyone but the payer and the payee (Noether 
and Mackenzie 2016). Several studies have discovered the weaknesses in Monero 
system (Moeser, et al. 2018) (Kumar, et al. 2017) (Wijaya, et al. 2018), and since 
then Monero has gone through several updates to improve its security. 
Different compared to Monero, Zcash is using zero knowledge proof (ZKP) 
technology, zk-SNARKS to be specific, where transaction history is completely 
obfuscated and relationships between coins are hardly identified (Ben-Sasson, et 
al. 2014). However, recent finding discovered the weakness of the implementation 
of Zcash (Quesnelle 2018) (Kappos, et al. 2018) due to the extensive computing 
requirements for its wallet which hinders its users from using the secure mode, 
namely z-addr. Despite this finding, it is difficult to say that Zcash technology has 
been broken, as the problems found are in the system level. 
3.3.3. Worldwide Markets 
Although there are already exist several cryptocurrency markets in 
Indonesia, it does not mean that all Indonesian cryptocurrency users are only using 
them when conducting trading. A trader is motivated to open accounts in as many 
exchanges as possible, where it is free to create them; all she needs to do is to 
provide a username and password followed by identity verification. 
Cryptocurrency market is unique and totally different compared to stock 
market, such that there will be multiple prices in different markets. A skilled trader 
can leverage the opportunity by buying on the lowest price market and selling on 
the highest price market. By doing this, it is expected that she could gain significant 
profits. 
However, this so-called opportunity for the traders could become a significant 
obstacle for law enforcement agencies. Unlike any fiat currencies where their 
transactions are limited by regulations and boundaries, cryptocurrencies do not 
share the same limitations. A user can send payments through cryptocurrency to 
the other side of the world in a matter of several minutes. As there are many 
cryptocurrency markets in the world, a trader can store her digital assets not in the 
local cryptocurrency exchanges but in any exchanges beyond the reach of any 
local law enforcement agencies.  
3.4. Enhancing Cryptoforensics 
After identifying several challenges for cryptoforensics, we propose methods 
to enhance cryptoforensics. Our proposed methods are not about enhancing 
technical capabilities, but mainly about legal instruments, collaboration, and 
extensive research. 
3.4.1. Legal Instruments 
We propose the use of any available legal instruments to support 
cryptoforensics activities. The legal instruments could ensure that information 
related to cryptocurrency activities within the country’s jurisdiction can be acquired. 
This includes but not limited to enforcing KYC/AML procedures for onboarding new 
customers of cryptocurrency-related businesses. 
3.4.2. Collaboration 
Collaboration is important in cryptoforensics, especially for gathering a 
proper information. The main actors for collaboration in this matter are 
cryptocurrency markets or exchanges. They hold important information about the 
users, as the users provided their real identities to the markets and this information 
can be utilized to connect cryptocurrency-related activities with the persons doing 
them. 
An important scheme developed in the Monero community called EABE 
shows the importance of cryptocurrency exchanges (Holmes 2017). EABE stands 
for Exchange-Alice-Bob-Exchange. In this scheme, Alice purchases several 
cryptocurrency coins from an exchange, then she transfers the coins to Bob. Bob 
then sells the coins to an exchange (not necessarily the same exchange where 
Alice purchased the coins) to get the local currency. In the scenario, although 
normally it is infeasible to determine who Alice and Bob are, with the help of two 
cryptocurrency exchanges, it is now possible to map the transactions and identify 
two parties, Alice and Bob. 
3.4.3. Extensive Research 
With the rapid development in cryptocurrency technology, digital forensics 
need to keep up with the pace, hence extensive research in cryptoforensics field 
need to be conducted. The research focuses on finding relevant artefacts that can 
help law enforcement agencies to track down illicit activities. Not only in technical 
area, research can also be conducted on social science, public policies, and 
economy which will help investigating the correlation between cryptocurrency 
transactions with real world situations. 
 
4. CONCLUSION 
We have described cryptaxforensics, a term to express a combination of 
cryptocurrency, taxation, and digital forensics. The massive adoption of 
cryptocurrency, the growing number of new technologies that have brought new 
products into the markets, and the significant rise in the prices could shift the 
taxation problem from its traditional landscape into a global, broader, and more 
complex ecosystem as in the cryptocurrency. 
We also have described the recent development in both areas: 
cryptocurrency and digital forensics, including how existing digital forensic 
methods can be utilized to explore digital evidences with regards to 
cryptocurrency-related activities. We then discussed challenges in the areas, 
including proposals to enhance cryptoforensics.

 This article looks at the application of present Indian payment system 
policies and regulatory model on virtual-currency in India. In fact, 
simply banning cryptocurrency in India would not serve the purpose 
of legislature and Reserve Bank of India (RBI); rather it will boost 
cryptocurrency frauds in India due to absence of any law. The present 
article analysis shows that there is an ample scope within the present 
models and policies with necessary amendments to facilitate the 
regulation of virtual-currency in India. The analysis also suggests 
new model regulation on cryptocurrency which shall constitute the 
basic model regulations in India to govern cryptocurrency technology 
and products. Author uses the Banking Regulation Act as a model, 
regulating all types of new fintech products such as cryptocurrency, 
Bitcoin & business activity, its intermediaries, exchanges, customer 
protection in robust and transparent fashion in India.

1.  Introduction  
The time has come to start thinking on future technological financial products and 
services that are growing rapidly in recent years. Some of these products and services 
are Cryptocurrency, virtual money and Bitcoin which are commonly known as 
electronic version of currency notes and coins. This new financial products and 
services are posing great challenges such as monetary and financial stability, protection 
of customers, costs and benefits of allowing these new forms in existing payment 
system before legislators and regulators. This has prompted other nations and India to 
see regulatory aspects that could be adopted to regulate virtual-currency, service 
providers in the form of intermediaries, exchanges, rights, duties, and liabilities in 
doing business and also protection to customer in payment system in India.  
As law follows technology, crafting a new regulation of any new technology is a 
cumbersome task. It is the future that will answer, whether the virtual-currency will 
gain widespread acceptance and was it worth to spend public resources on a new 
technology. Nevertheless, this approach is also not good to buy as there are utmost 
chances that these types of new financial technological innovations, if allows to operate 
freeways may bring a significant problem to the existing financial system and

ultimately the customers who will be the losers in the form of financial loss to them. 
However, in today’s techno-savvy world, new techno-financial products and services 
are becoming necessity and getting central stage in financial transactions as a way of 
doing business transaction and creating a pool of money that brings much needed 
financial funds for the upcoming decade’s developments.  
With these backgrounds, Section 1 of the Article briefly explains what 
“cryptocurrency"" (also known as Computer based algorithm mathematical based 
currencies) are and its operation in business. Section 2 is a Comparative Chart of 
selected countries across the world to understand the policy view and status of 
regulators on cryptocurrency regulations. Section 3 talks about some case laws related 
to Bitcoin pending before Court of law and some cases under police investigation. 
Section 4 is about the Policy and Circulars issued by RBI on the stand taken on virtual 
currency as of now and Central Government response in the form of setting up 
Committees for Policy directions. Section 5 is analysis of existing Indian Acts and 
regulatory schemes that could be brought to bear upon Cryptocurrency technology. 
This assessment of regulations also looks at various rationales for regulation for public 
law purposes such as Constitution of India, Banking Regulations Act, Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, Tax Law, Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 
Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms, Securities Laws etc. and review existing 
regulation schemes in India. Section 6 discusses Model Draft Regulation on 
Cryptocurrency especially focusing on Uniform Regulation of Virtual-Currency 
Businesses Act.  
Hence, some of the common primary framework such as few important definitions and 
key words are taken into consideration along with present RBI Guidelines to 
consolidates and suggest cryptocurrency regulation in India. In conclusion, offers some 
principles with the hope that will guide the development of new regulations for 
governs of cryptocurrency market in India and customer protection requirements 
coming out of cryptocurrency transactions.  
 
2.  Cryptocurrency; Definition and Scope  
The term cryptocurrency is an intangible form of non-legal tender which can be used in 
place for legal tender 1 and existed in electronic/ digital form used between 
online/Cryptocurrency members community. 2 Virtual currencies are a subset of 
cryptocurrencies. ""Bitcoin” is a subset of virtual-currency where value of a particular 
unit is validated through cryptography. virtual-currency generally requires consent of 
buyer and seller to a transaction.3 When a cryptocurrency is not backed by any 
precious metals but backed by government via giving “legal tender” status then such a 
cryptocurrency becomes fiat currency and not a ""commodity-based currencies"" or non-
legal tender currency which is simply a cryptocurrency.4 Therefore fiat cryptocurrency 
status of cryptocurrency5 transaction would then fall back under the dominion of 
traditional money transfer regulation.

Cryptocurrency is also known as Bitcoin with virtual presence and unknown 
ownership maintained in a peer-to-peer network by entries in an enormous database 
called ""block chain,"" and transactions takes place by participants keys known as 
crypto-credentials as a signature and validated by network i.e. signatures the 
transaction of sender and receiver being updated and reflected by block chain. This 
transaction is validated decentralized way by miners who maintain block chain. Some 
economist has termed Bitcoin as ""fiduciary currency,” because of no inherent value, 
and derive value in exchanges either from regular currency backed by government or 
accepted online by others. 
In contemplating above situation, it seems logical before we think of regulating virtual 
currencies; we must understand what and when to regulate virtual currencies, which 
we are going to see subsequently in article.  
  
3.  Overview of Selected Countries Regulations on Cryptocurrencies  
As virtual-currency market and transactions are sky rocking and these digital monies 
are non-legal tenders with different standards in most of the jurisdictions. Global 
regulators are divided on how to responses on it. As of now there is no international 
regulator to regulate virtual-currency. Following Chart shows there are two policy 
views on virtual-currency i.e., either it is legal tender or it is illegal, acts those are 
governing it and present policy status as of now (Table 1).

4. Overview and Application if any of Indian Acts on Cryptocurrency and Industry 
After going through aforementioned policy stand, let us see what are the laws may be 
applicable to cryptocurrency technology and its various products in India and 
understand whether Bitcoin falls under the review of Central Government.    
 
4.1. Constitution of India Act, RBI Act and FEMA 
Article 246 of Constitution along with Entry 36 and 46 of List I of the VII Schedule list 
out the subject matter to legislate currency, coinage, legal tender, foreign exchange and 
bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes and other like instruments respectively by 
Center and State governments in India. Test is whether Bitcoin fulfill any condition of 
aforementioned instruments so Central government can legislate. Coming to the term 
of currency we need to understand the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act. Interestingly 
definition of currency is not defined by RBI Act rather it is defined by Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) stating in Section 2 (M) that “all currency 
notes, postal notes, postal orders, money orders, cheques, drafts, travelers’ cheques, 
letters of credit, bills of exchange and promissory notes, credit cards or such other 
similar instruments, as may be notified by the Reserve Bank”. Under the Currency 
Ordinance 1940, One rupee and Notes issued by RBI is defined as a legal tender and as 
far as Bitcoin is concerned since it is not legal tender thus falls out of this category. This 
analysis is also supported by Section 22 which enumerates the right of issuance of bank 
notes solely rest with RBI and bank notes are legal tender in India as per Section 26 of 
RBI Act. As per this analysis Bitcoin are not currency but having several features of a 
currency or legal tender thus qualify as “such other similar instruments” defined by 
Section 2(h) of RBI Act and to be notified by RBI. Thus, it is policy question before the 
RBI whether to recognize medium of certain electronic records claiming to be 
“Decentralized Digital Currency” or “Virtual Currency”, such as, Bitcoin, litecoins, 
bbqcoins, and dogecoins etc. as such other similar instruments. 
 
4.2. Payment System Rules and Operating Standards in India  
S. 18 of the Payment System and Settlement Act (PSSA) 20076 empowers RBI to 
regulate7, supervise8 and clear or settle payment among payer and beneficiary under 
the payment system9. Due to operational feature of peer-to-peer payment system of

Bitcoin cannot clear or settle transaction thus cannot be treated as payment system10 
under PSSA.       
As per RBI directions, instrument11 carries the value stored in it and said value be paid 
by holder in transaction. In contrast, Bitcoin trade does not have these obligations 
while transacting and value of Bitcoin is speculative determined by market which keep 
fluctuate12 and fails to fulfill aforementioned criteria.  
 
4.3. RBI Pre-paid Payment Instruments Regulation13 
RBI has permitted three types of pre-paid payment instruments as Closed, Semi-closed 
and Open system payment instruments14. In contrast Bitcoin is generated by users 
through software and does not come under any category mentioned above. 
Aforementioned instruments value is up to INR 50,000 and validity is six months only 
from the date of issuance to the holder15. Therefore, those banks that complies these 
conditions can issue all three instruments. Non-Banking Financial Companies 
(“NBFC”) and persons authorized by RBI can issue only semi-closed system payment 
instruments16. As Bitcoin is issued by software or server does not fit in the definition of 
person17 and thus cannot be consider under pre-paid instruments.  
Further minimum Rs. 1 Crore capital adequacy compliance and RBI permission is 
required by any issuer and is allowed to issue pre-paid instruments.18 RBI has allowed 
specific banks only to provide mobile based pre-paid payment instruments such as m-
wallet and m-accounts.19 This infers that even mobile app base bitcoins do not come 
under aforementioned regulations as they are not circulated by and lack permission 
from RBI.

4.4. Deposit Taking and Deposit Insurance 
As per S. 5(b) of Banking Regulation Act, 1949 accepting deposits is a highly regulated 
business in the India. When bank is failed or unable to repay full amount of deposit, 
then up to Rs. 1 lakh is guaranteed to retrieve from the depositors’ deposit, irrespective 
of the higher amount deposited by depositor in his account with bank. 20 The amount 
hold in Cryptocurrency could be treated as deposits as represented virtually through 
technological advancement fail to fulfill condition of RBI as Bitcoin is not issued and 
hold by bank. Thus, above regulation do not cover the amount hold or represented by 
Bitcoin as it is non-legal currency and can be hold by non-bank entity.    
 
4.5. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing 
Financial security is core concerned at international and national level at all time due to 
access and misused by criminals for various purposes. To curb these activities global 
enforcement agencies are working closely together. In India there is Prevention of 
Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002 & PMLA Regulations, 2008 that has established 
mandatory21 on all authorized payment system operators and service providers to 
follow the know your customer guidelines22and report if there is any suspicious 
transaction to nodal agency called The Financial Intelligence Unit - India (FIU-India)23. 
In contrary to above, the structure of Bitcoin system bypasses this requirement and 
ensures to hide the identity of seller & buyers. Hence Bitcoin system fails to comply 
above regulations which mandate customer information for opening & operating 
account thus left the Bitcoin customer at vulnerable system to abuse and carrying out 
AML, KYC compliance becomes next to impossible. 
 
4.6. Remittance Transfers & Cross Border Transfer of Bitcoin 
As per Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)24 a sender in the India sends funds to a 
person located outside the India for those purpose only which are listed & authorized 
by RBI25. This scheme is not available to the corporate, partnership firms, HUF, Trusts, 
etc. Coming to the Cross-border transfer of Bitcoin it is the FEMA that controls capital 
flows coming and moving out of India. As per S. 326 of FEMA, only authorized persons 
are allowed to deal in or transfer any foreign exchange, security to any person under 
this section or permitted by RBI in this regard.27 Thus, inference can be drawn that 
there is no violation if resident Indian purchase Bitcoin from foreigner through

transferring money from legitimate bank channel to purchase Bitcoin. But it will be 
violation if resident Indian sales Bitcoin to foreigner and RBI can look into this aspect.     
 
4.7.  Fraudulent E-banking Transaction and Limited Liability and Protection to 
Customer28 
Due to surge of customer grievances in online transactions customer protection has 
become the major concern. RBI has mandated to place in robust systems & procedure 
dealing on safety & security, risk management, detection and curbing of frauds so to 
make a customer feel safe & secure in doing e-banking transaction. Also, RBI has frame 
guidelines to protect customers against the liabilities arising out of fraudulent e-
banking transactions in the form of zero liability to limited liability on the financial 
institution based upon situations enumerated by RBI. The Bitcoin payment system is 
framed in such a manner where once transaction is initiated it cannot be reverted back 
and Bitcoin is permanently lost. Thus, customer is left at venerable situation and there 
is no central authority to report and take care of customer grievances.   
 
4.8.  Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Compliance Requirements and 
Cryptocurrency Broker-Dealer Registration  
One of the forms of regulating exchanges of Cryptocurrency is considering those 
people who facilitate exchanges of Cryptocurrency as a broker-dealer in share market. 
SEBI roles come in to picture when Cryptocurrency held separately for investment 
purposes or share dividend is being paid in the form of Cryptocurrency. Or broker-
dealer are holding customer investment to be invested in share market is in the form of 
Cryptocurrency will requires to following SEBI Act 1992 & Securities Contracts 
Regulations (SCRA) 1996. As SEBI (Stock-Brokers & Sub-Brokers) Regulations 199229 & 
SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992 (as amended in 2006) required to make 
sure of investor protection, rights & liabilities of parties involve in transactions, dispute 
redressal mechanism for investors and all standard procedure and compliance 
requirements under PMLA Rules such as to maintain vigorous program of customer 
identification, anti-money laundering30 and economic sanctions. Thus, it can be infer 
that if Bitcoin exchanges want to give services of Bitcoin for investment purpose or 
share dividend then need to fall under the said regulations and need to comply with it.  
 
4.9. SEBI Regulations on Online Wallet Operators and Exchanges 
Online wallet payment and online Cryptocurrency exchanges for payment against 
security transaction in share market are not allowed in India. Recently SEBI has 
allowed to trade by way of instant access facility (IAF) through online mode and use of 
e-wallets for investment only in Mutual Funds (MFs) worth up to every year 50,000/- 
or 90% of folio value, whichever is lower. Redemption of investments made through e-
wallet, however, can be done only through a bank account of the unit holder and into

the bank account of the investor.31 However, investment in MFs through the e-wallets 
is allowed subject to the condition that the said e-wallets are tie-ups with payments 
banks having RBI approval.32  
This present regulation of RBI followed by SEBI can be extended to Cryptocurrency E-
wallet operators and exchanges with objective to customer protection and are not 
exposed to higher credit and liquidity risks. Such a regulation will help to overcome 
from the situation where the customer suffered a loss due to failure of the Mt. Gox 
exchange in 2014 or aforementioned situations (emphasis added) on protection of the 
customer Bitcoin’s and places security norms to be followed by Cryptocurrency market 
participants engaged in securities transactions including exchanges33 In furtherance of 
the SEBI jurisdiction is concerned, we need to examine important question i.e. whether 
Cryptocurrency is qualifying as ""securities"". 
The way Cryptocurrency is functioning it cannot be treated as a security, but it does 
not mean that, it cannot be promoted as an investment option and utilized as a 
medium of exchanged commercially. If virtual currencies offered and consider as a 
security in the form of investment by investors then their promoters will fall under the 
jurisdiction of SEBI. But if promoter issues Cryptocurrency in the form of Initial Coin 
offerings (ICO) then promoters can offer and sale Cryptocurrency without triggering 
SEBI Regulations. Only the equity token, a subcategory of ICO can fall under the 
regulations of SEBI as these types of token are offered against representing ownership 
of an asset like debt or Company stock. Startups through block chain & smart 
Contracts could issue tokens in the form of shares & voting rights and can also raise 
debt in the form of token or coin from share markets. It is also interesting to note that 
this new method could be alternate and bypass to the SEBI Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2017. If we consider this form of 
Cryptocurrency as a security then it can be brought under the present SEBI regulations 
as nature of Cryptocurrency is raising fund from public in a same way Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) does. As it become imperative to SEBI to protect the investor, detail 
information about the product, risk associated with it and a wide array of remedies 
such as private rights, criminal & civil actions that can be brought against them.   
 
4.10. Commodities Trading Regulation 
Most of the Countries have treated virtual currencies as a commodity and not foreign 
currencies. The idea of Cryptocurrency future contract is to provide a derivative to 
hedge risk for miners who then develop gradually other cryptocurrencies. If we 
consider this form of cryptocurrencies, future contract and trading are similar to the 
existing Commodity Derivatives Market Regulation of SEBI which focuses on market 
safety, efficiency, transparency and integrity and reducing cost of transaction, Risk 
Management System and various intermediaries and their Regulations. The definition 
of Commodity derivative as per S. 2 (bc) of SCRA is, its value, that is derived from

prices or indices of prices of such underlying goods or activities, services, rights, 
interests and events in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future 
dealt in. As per section 44(D)(1)(c) of SCRA Securities Exchanges and Clearing 
Corporations Regulation (SECC) 2017 is triggered by the trading of a commodity. If 
trading is occurring or about to occur section 44(D)(1)(c) imposes obligations to 
regulate or control the business of buying, selling or dealing in commodity derivatives 
under the oversight of the Commodity Derivatives Market Regulation Department 
(CDMRD) of SEBI. As per the said SEBI regulation trading, clearing and settlement in 
market operation environment will not be seamlessly unless there is robust cyber 
security framework and compliance. Thus, with necessary amendment in present 
regulation, SEBI’s CDMRD jurisdiction can be extended to cover the cryptocurrencies 
commodities trading. 34  As SEBI present regulation on the Commodities market 
participants such as Commodity Derivatives Exchange, National Commodity 
Derivatives Exchange 35  and ""E-trading facility, audit 36  and Investor Grievance 
Redressal system and arbitration mechanism are already in place as per SEBI 
CIR/CDMRD/DIECE/02/2015 circular.  
 
4.11. Taxation Law on Cryptocurrency 
Ministry of Finance through Department of Revenue has begun to regulate 
Cryptocurrency for taxation purposes. When we focused on “Income from Capital 
Gains (both short term and long term) and income from other sources” attracts the 
application of the Income Tax on trade in virtual currencies and gain out of it will be 
taxable. If you buy and sell cryptocurrencies frequently, the gains from such trading 
must be considered as income from trading when you file your Income Tax Return 
(ITR). If you do not trade in such currencies, the tax treatment may be different. Just as 
all other investment instruments, on more than three years investment taxed are 
charged as per a flat rate 20% with indexation benefits (inflation-adjusted) on Long-
term capital gains. Moreover, investments less than three years should be considered 
as short-term capital gains and taxed as per your income tax slab. 
Since the RBI is still to recognize these cryptocurrencies as a currency, they are neither 
legal nor illegal. The moment RBI declares it to be a currency; any trading in it will be 
subject to FEMA & Regulations under it. It is just unclear if they should be considered 
as an asset as they are owned and owner earns profits from the increase in its value or 
should they be considered a long-term investment instrument. When Bitcoin is 
purchase for investment purpose it could be treated as capital asset as per S. 2 (14) of 
Tax Act, means any kind of property and every possible interest that can be acquire, 
hold or enjoy. If you buy and sell cryptocurrencies frequently, the gains from such 
trading must be considered as business income from trading when you file your

income tax return (Form ITR 2). If selling of a Bitcoin is treated as business income 
treated as capital gain for tax purpose then it will be further classified as short-term or 
long-term. However, this classification will be depending on the period of holding of 
Bitcoin as mentioned in earlier.  
Another issue is, does Bitcoin earned by mining process are taxable as business profits 
under capital asset. The difficulty here is that how to ascertain the cost of earning of 
Bitcoin from mining process to be classified as self-generated capital assets. Due to 
absence of Bitcoin acquisition cost, it results into failing of computation of capital gains 
thus no capital gains can be levied on transfer of such assets (as per Supreme Court 
judgment in the landmark case B. C. Srinivasan Setty, 1981) and Bitcoin earned by 
mining process may be exempt from tax. We also need to see the other issue associated 
with tax, is sale of Bitcoin by NRI on Indian exchanges and GST applicability on Bitcoin 
and Mining of it. The NRI sale of Bitcoin on Indian exchange is concerned, Bitcoin is 
intangible asset and income accruing from it is outside India and person is not residing 
in India. Therefore, it can’t be taxed in India. Coming on Goods and Services Tax (GST) 
2017 and Rules applicability is concerned, we need to answer first the policy question, 
is Bitcoin transaction is goods or service.  
There are two views among the scholars; first view is Bitcoin could be considered as 
currency and if it so then it does not qualify for definition of goods, so no GST on Sale 
and Purchase of it. As per S.2 (52) the definition of goods in GST is every kind of 
movable Property other than Money and Securities. But if Bitcoin is not considered as a 
currency then GST on Sale and Purchase of Bitcoin will require paying. Logic behind it 
is, as per Rule 32 of Central GST Rules, when currency rate is not available, the value 
shall be 1% of gross amount of Indian rupees provided or received by the Person 
Changing the Money. Second view is Bitcoin could consider as service (trading in 
financial services and exchange), if so then GST at 12% to be charged as service charge 
by Exchanges and brokers for providing only service of sales and purchase of Bitcoin. 
 
5.  Model Draft Regulation on Cryptocurrency in India 
The aim and objective of this regulation is to overcome from uncertainty on 
cryptocurrency technology and minimize the risk to individuals, to cryptocurrency 
businesses, and to government agencies. The Scope of Regulation is to govern the 
facilitation platform provided by centralize/decentralized Blockchain technology and 
service provider, transfer, exchange, and services of cryptocurrency and clearing 
houses on such platform. This facilitation is regulating the manner Licensure, 
Supervision, and user protections are affordable. They shall be treated as authorized 
person engaged in cryptocurrency business. The RBI Act and Banking Regulation Act 
will be superseding on this regulation and at all the time provisions of these Acts will 
also be applicable on person/entity all the time.  
There are some definitions which will help RBI to define and bring cryptocurrency 
under its jurisdiction. RBI has to take a policy decision on what to regulate i.e. is it a 
virtual currencies or Cryptocurrency Business Activity in India. We submit here that it 
will be prudent to control the medium of transaction and providers of cryptocurrencies 
transaction rather controlling cryptocurrency itself. This will help legislature to tailored 
assured, fair and predictable regulatory mechanism to cryptocurrency business and its 
intermediaries such as Broker, Bitcoin miners and Exchanges at par with traditional 
payment system and financial products in India. Accordingly, the propose regulation 
shall regulates Cryptocurrency business payment system with objective to provide 
P-ISSN: 2442-9880, E-ISSN: 2442-9899 
156 
 
Licenses, Procedures, Risk Management, Customer Protection and Dispute Redressal 
Mechanism on wherever possible in compliance with Banking Regulation Act, PMLA, 
terrorist funding activities and KYC norms.  
The regulation shall be applicable to both forms of the Cryptocurrency that are control 
i.e. in centralized and decentralized form.37 Any regulation without defining the key 
words becomes futile in its governance. Therefore, following are some definitions 
which shall help in understanding and application of the proposed regulation.  
Cryptocurrency/ virtual-currency means a digitized representation of unit of account 
or store value and is not a legal currency and denominated in legal currency, used as a 
medium of exchange; except a) in a transaction where value is merchant grants as a 
reward program, remains with merchant and can’t be exchange against legal tender or 
bank credit b) digitized value used in online game issued by publisher of the game and 
used solely in the same game. 
Let us see the definition of “Cryptocurrency and Cryptocurrency Business Activity” means: 
a) issuing or providing services or operating or administering in Cryptocurrency by 
way of control, holding, exchange, transfer, storing, directly or by agreement with 
service vender b) legal tender or bank credit converted in to digital representation 
outside the online game offered by publisher form which original digital 
representation of value was received. 
To be covered by this regulation, the activity must involve “Cryptocurrency” and 
“Cryptocurrency Business Activity,” as crucial definitions depends on key words and 
interpretation of control, exchange, store, and transfer. These active verbs application 
and definitions will help RBI to bring under its jurisdiction the Cryptocurrency activity 
as well as those who are engaged in this business will also be fall in line with the RBI 
mandates for doing banking related business in India. Word control can be defined as 
prevent indefinitely a virtual-currency transaction or authorized to execute 
unilaterally; word Exchange can be defined as a person authorized momentarily by the 
owner of Cryptocurrency to trade or convert for legal tender, bank credit, in other form 
of virtual currency. Word Store means authorized by owner of virtual currency to 
maintain control in the form of holding and taking deposits. Word Transfer means: 
crediting, moving or relinquish control of the Cryptocurrency from one account holder 
to another.  
For assistance, let us understand how this four words works in defining 
Cryptocurrency business activity:  
“Storage” of a Cryptocurrency means fund depositing with a bank in an electronic-
wallet or online form as a third-party Cryptocurrency business provider who act as an 
intermediate. This enables the owner to safely keep its currency in a safe deposit with 
the Cryptocurrency provider/ Storage Company who holds this currency on behalf of 
the owner of the Cryptocurrency and get some credentials. Owner sends the 
instruction to the storage company to transfer some Cryptocurrency to the seller 
against the purchase of the goods, services, or real estate from seller.

“Transfer” of a Cryptocurrency means transaction execution under ordinary systems of 
banking the way we transfer the money from one person to another person. The 
provider i.e. server running the distributed ledger which keeps and verifies of the 
computer code completes transfer transactions. The process is generally the amount 
and the computer code for specific amount is only known by the seller and buyer who 
direct the server of distributed ledger to transfer the coin against the transaction.  Once 
server updates the completed transaction on ledger, that movement onward coin/ 
token belongs to seller. If buyer tries to sell/spend fraudulently same coin to others, 
server automatically detects and refuses, as buyer is no longer owner of that 
coin/token.     
“Exchange” can understand the way we normally exchange the amount for purchase 
some good or food items in restaurant. Let assume you want to buy a pizza in 
restaurant with Bitcoin. Here you can easily transfer Bitcoin to the pizza restaurant in a 
direct P-to-B transaction where the server validates transaction on ledger, if valid, gets 
updated and reflects pizza restaurant as an owner of Bitcoin change of record of 
ownership is reflected on public ledger. The merchant gets its money and you get your 
pizza. 
“Control” is the key factor in Bitcoin and these regulations, which decide the ownership 
as well as have an effect of the cyber security and fraud i.e. stealing of your Bitcoin 
private key. Here control is defined with the help of a product or service known in 
Bitcoin purchase and selling community as multiple signatures or better known as 
“multi sig.” as it requires more than one key to authorize transaction. So another two 
key holders should also allow the said transaction, thus it provides must more security 
to the E-wallets while transacting. Nowadays, due to lot of frauds in Bitcoin 
transactions, Bitcoin networks are getting upgraded with much more complicated 
transaction that require the signatures of multiple people before the funds can be 
transferred known as M-of-N transactions. Thus, multiple people and software 
programs are involved and cooperation is required to do Bitcoin transaction. 
 
License- The major condition is the server should be located in India so there is no 
problem of cross border jurisdiction. RBI is the final authority to issue license only after 
self-satisfying on the security, net worth, and reserves that need to be fulfilled by 
applicant. This is left for the RBI to finalize it. This regulation is not intended to 
derogate from any of RBI compliance requirements. This will help licensees to conduct 
operations and have sufficient funding available to wind up its operations due to 
unavoidable circumstances. This will also help RBI to keep check on licensees and 
protect the interest of customers in paying back their money. Renewal of license will be 
depending upon among other things are fully audited financial statement, compliance 
report, cyber security audit report and report of resolution of customer grievances. The 
license is not assignable or transferable to anyone. At any point of time if licensee 
wishes to allow merging with, consolidate with, or acquire another business which 
result in change in control need prior approval of RBI and RBI decision shall be final 
and binding on licensee. This condition will help to minimize the risk and frauds. RBI 
will issue different licenses to the exchanges, custodian and brokers with different 
conditions and norms keeping in mind the requirement of the volume of business 
carried by each of these entities.

Real time Centralized Transaction Repository (RCTR) and RBI Vigilance 
Department- RBI shall be having its own real time centralized transaction repository 
and all licensees shall be required to keep all real time transaction information and 
KYC information relating to each transaction linked with this repository. Thus, RBI 
will be having control on all the transactions and KYC information relating to such 
transactions which shall help RBI to have real time vigilance & tampered free record of 
each transaction. RBI will have vigilance department to control and vigilance on 
suspicious transaction, money laundering and terrorist funding activity which might 
be taking place.  
 
Examination- Power to examine records, data inspection and compliance of norms is 
rest with RBI. Licensee is required to maintain the KYC Norms of transaction holder 
and complete information as per AML Act including date, time and instruction given 
by transaction holder for next five years. Total number of transactions taken place in 
financial year, aggregate number of transaction form of virtual currency into legal 
tender or other types of cryptocurrency, complete audit report comprising assets, 
liability, capital and expenditure of licensee, report of resolution of customer 
grievances, Book of Registry containing all transaction & customer information, 
reporting of suspicious transactions Book and action taken against such transactions, 
report of fail transactions and reason of it and any other information desired by RBI. 
The Bankers Books Evidence Act, 1891 will be applicable on licensee under this 
regulation. Licensee is bound to cooperate, coordinate, consult, and share records and 
other information with the other central regulatory agencies along with RBI.  
 
Enforcement- facilitation of cryptocurrency business shall be taking place only after 
permission of RBI otherwise it will treat as illegal business. The offence related to 
cryptocurrency will be treated as banking fraud and shall be treated at par and with 
same provisions of existing civil and criminal laws which are applicable to banking 
frauds. RBI may take administrative action in the form of suspend or revoke a license, 
restraint licensee to participate in business, impose penalty, recovers money from 
security deposit, conditional approval to do business, appoint RBI Administrator as 
care taker, take appropriate recourse through court of law etc. There shall be 
applications of other laws wherever it is appropriate such as Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act, Company Act, SARFAESI Act, AML Act, PSSA, FEMA etc.  Civil 
penalties shall be the equivalent amount of fraud or three times the amount of profits 
made out of cryptocurrency trading, whichever is higher and/or may declared as 
willful defaulter by RBI in case licensee absconded from India. The criminal penalties 
shall be imprisonment up to five year and lifelong banned on licensee.  
 
6.  Conclusion  
Increasing popularity and involvement of more Indian in cryptocurrency trading, it is 
high time for India to take a firm decision on Cryptocurrency trading and bring 
regulation to regulate it. The regulation is talking about regulating the technological 
platform models that are being used by cryptocurrency and intermediary while 
facilitating various services. Whether cryptocurrency be treated as a legal tender and 
allowed to exchange against fiat currency is the policy decision and is left out for the 
RBI and Central Government to decide. RBI should not treat Cryptocurrency industry 
as a problem to the Banking system keeping in mind that it is having a valuable 
innovative technological solution and its potential applications to the banking system.

Rather RBI must explore how to harness Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for 
Financial Services and overall benefit to the economy in India. The application of 
Blockchain in trading, financing, lending and other financial services will be opening a 
new era of fintech products & services in Indian economy. Thus, this technologically 
innovative platform i.e. centralized or decentralized distributed ledger is having 
potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system in India. 
Cryptocurrency platform will boost up society which is digitally empowered, boost up 
to the digital India Program and knowledge economy.  
This move will be a thrust to ensuring E-Governance covering electronic services in 
banking industry, user friendly products, devices, job opportunities to the youngster 
and overall inclusive growth of Indian economy. This payment ledger system is 
opportunity for India to overcome barriers of socio-economical in society and give 
wide financial access.

Abstract 
 
In summary, this study has applied TAM model to examine cryptocurrency payment adoption in 
Taiwanese hotels, examining the factors that are more likely to affect the behavioral intent. The 
empirical results suggest that intent to adopt cryptocurrency payments is affected by perceived 
usefulness, and perceived ease of use of these payments. In turn, perceived usefulness is affected by 
trust towards these payments. Interestingly, perceived usefulness was not shown to be significantly 
affected by different types of risks associated with cryptocurrency payments, including financial risk, 
technological risk, and social risk. Perceived ease of use, in turn, is affected by convenience of 
cryptocurrency payments; and is not shown to be significantly affected by trust. 
 
Keywords: cryptocurrency payment, cryptocurrency acceptance, technology acceptance, blockchain 
economy.  
 
 
Introduction 
 
Over the last decade, new technology and payment systems have altered business activities in 
various ways (Cabanillas et.al, 2014). Adoption and implementation of Internet, social networks, 
mobile and electronic payments, block chain technology and digital currencies are a driving force and 
strategic asset for many organizations. Hospitality industry is particularly proactive towards acceptance 
and use of new technologies (DiPietro and Wang, 2010). Technology contributes to hospitality 
organizations performance, competitive advantage and success (Nyheim et al., 2004; Wang and Qualls, 
2007). There is a lot of research on technology adoption and diffusion in hospitality industry (Heart 
and Pliskin, 2002; DiPietro and Wang, 2010). As world is as interconnected as ever and travelling 
experience is a priority for many people, especially for younger generation acceptance and adoption of 
new technology has become an important aspect for hospitality industry businesses. Leisure and 
business travellers are spending more of their budget on international trips and it is important to keep 
up with technology and guest demands in order to stay competitive (Paul, 2005). Digital technology 
savvy millennial generation of consumers (Lou and LI, 2017) are adept at the use of new technology 
and are eager to bring that into their travelling experiences (DiPietro and Wang, 2010).  
Digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, Etherium, Litecoin, Ripple and hundreds of others, have 
emerged as an alternative form of money, mostly unregulated and unbound to traditional money 
(Gilbert and Loi, 2018). There are over 900 cryptocurrencies with an exstimated value of USD 342 
billion, which is around 0.3 percent of Global GDP (WorldCoinIndex, February, 2018). 
Cryptocurrencies represent new payment technology, which allows payers and payees to directly  
send value to each other electronically and anonymously without the need to use the services 
of trusted third parties, like financial institutions (ex. banks) (Nakamoto, 2008). Digital currency is 
both a virtual and a cryptocurrency (with computer encryption protecting coin supply and ownership 
(Gilbert and Loi, 2018). Cryptocurrency is defined as currency that is stored and transferred 
electronically (Wagner, 2014) and is a medium of exchange that rely on cryptography, in order to 
secure transactions and control the creation of new units (Christou & Kassianidis, 2002; Roussou and 
Stiakakis, 2016). Throughout this paper, we use term cryptocurrency (virtual, digital, encrypted). 
Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being one of the most famous one, is the 
new business model which aims to compete with traditional financial services (Lou and LI, 2017) and 
could even affect the functioning of the monetary system (Halperin, 2013; Stevens, 2017). 
Decentralized cryptocurrencies have the potential to drastically change the existing retail system and it 
is important to understand factors that influence their adoption (Jonker, 2018).  
Technology innovations may help organizations achieve competitive advantage, improves 
performance and competitiveness (Wang and Qualls, 2007; Roussou and Stiakakis, 2016). It has been 
stated that perceived relative advantage positively affect intention to use innovation (Shih, 2007; Lee, 
2007). For example, technology adoption was found to add value on guest service and customer 
relationship management in hospitality industry (DiPietro and Wang, 2010), reduce costs (Folkinshteyn 
and Lennon, 2007), increase competitive advantage (Cho and Olsen, 1998; Morone, 1989; Nyheim et 
al., 2004) and customer and competitor orientation (Han et al., 1998). Businesses, including hospitality 
industry may achieve competitive advantage via the provision of cryptocurrency payments to 
customers and the issue associated with appropriate cryptocurrency payment usage is the important 
research topic for exploration (Roussou and Stiakakis, 2016). Acceptance of digital currencies as an 
additional payment option could be a marketing tool and help companies to stand out (Roussou and 
Stiakakis, 2016). There is a need to investigate whether digital currencies will be accepted and adopted 
as a trading instrument with or without traditional currencies and the conventional payment systems 
(Roussou and Stiakakis, 2016). Younger generation of travellers have an expectation of using more 
technology in their business interactions, examples include commonplace of having television, wireless 
connection in hotel rooms (DiPietro and Wang, 2010) as well as being able to book and pay for the 
hotel room online.  
The adoption of cryptocurrency payment is increasing rapidly, with companies such as 
Microsoft, Paypal, EBay, Dell, and Expedia now accepting Bitcoin payments (Ussel, 2015). Rapid 
advancement of cryptocurrency market has a strong potential on business and individuals payment 
transactions choice behavior. This paper focuses on a recent innovation for which acceptance and 
adoption behavior is poorly understood- cryptocurrency payment. The purpose if the present study is 
threefold. First, authors aim to provide insight into the factors that influence hospitality industry 
organizations to express intention to use cryptocurrency payment. Second, from the theoretical 
perspective, we examine widely used Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to develop and test an 
integrated model which is better able to predict hotel owners intention to use an innovation technology 
in the form of cryptocurrency payment. Third, this research integrates strong predictor of technology 
acceptance external variable- perceived security, which considered a strong predictor for new payment 
technology adoption (Folkinshtein and Lennon, 2017; Khalilzadeh et al. 2017; Liao and Cheung, 2012; 
Cheng et al. 2006) into the established model. We suggest that perceived security is crucial to 
understanding and predicting adoption of cryptocurrency payment, however it is not yet explored in the 
literature in the context of cryptocurrency payment or hospitality industry.  
There are paucity of papers regarding cryptocurrency payment adoption and usage (Jonker, 
2018; Polasik et al., 2015; Schuh and Shy, 2015; Tsanidis et al. 2015; Silinskyte, 2014). There are no 
studies available on the adoption of cryptocurrency payment among hospitality industry. This paper 
fills that gap. Another novelty is that this paper contributes to new payment technology adoption and 
hospitality industry related research by examining integrated technology adoption model in Taiwan 
hotel industry. Taiwan provide a good setting for this research as it has a well-developed technological 
infrastructure and is welcoming to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.  
The paper is structured as follows. The first section introduces overview of technology 
adoption models and factors influencing adoption decisions of new payment technology. Second, we 
provide the background of cryptocurrency payment technology. We then develop hypothesis, explain 
methodology and data collection and conclude with discussion of the findings and their implications 
for theory and practice.  
 
 
 
 
Literature Review  
Theoretical background / Technology acceptance theories  
 
There are several social psychology based classical models of behavioral decisions and 
behavioral intentions which analyze people’s behavior when faced with something novel (Pavloy, 
2002a). Theory of reasoned actions (TRA) is a general model explaining person’s behavior based on 
the relationship between the variables beliefs-attitude-intention-behavior (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975). 
This model takes into consideration the attitude towards behavior and the person’s subjective norm as 
an explanation factors for intention. TRA became a base for Technology acceptance model (TAM) 
which aims to explain information technology and information systems adoption behavior (Davis, 
1989; Davis, Bagozzii and Warshaw, 1989, Munoz, 2008). TAM it is a well-established, influential and 
widely used model of IS usage and IS acceptance behavior and is applied to a variety of information 
technology and information systems studies (Lymperopoulos and Chaniotakis, 2005; Kim, 
Mirusmonom and Lee, 2010,) such as e-mail, spreadsheets, microcomputer usage, group support 
systems, expert systems, e-payment, mobile payment, block chain technology (Chen, 2008; Lin and 
Nguyen, 2011; Kim et al., 2010; Cabanillas et al., 2014; Lou and Li, 2017). TAM states that adoption 
behavior is determined by the intention to utilize a particular system determined by the perceived 
usefulness and ease of use. TAM states that information technology users act rationally during their 
decision whether to use technology or not. User’s intention to use new technology depends on their 
beliefs of perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) of the technology. PU is defined 
as the degree to which a person perceives that adopting the system will boost his/her performance. PEU 
is defined as the degree to which a person believes that adopting the system will be effortless. TAM 
model is relevant as it provides a framework by which the effect of the external variables on a system 
usage can be assessed. TAM became the base for several models of innovation technology acceptance. 
For example TAM was extended to TAM2 which includes social and organizational variables 
(subjective norm, image, job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability) which are shown to have 
direct impact on PU (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000). UTAUT (Venkatesh, Morris, Davis and Davis, 
2003) proposed four key constructs (performance expectancy=PU, effort expectancy=PEU, social 
influence and facilitation condition) as direct determinants of usage intention and behavior and 
introduced moderating constructs (gender, age, experience and voluntariness of use) for the impact of 
four key constructs on usage intention and behavior. TAM and UTAUT Models continued to be 
explored and improved in new research (Luarn and Lin, 2005).There are TAM3 (Venkatesh and Bala, 
2008), MOPTAM- Mobile Phone Technology Acceptance Model (Renaud and Biljon’s, 2008).  
Research on new technology acceptance by different user types is ever more relevant and 
necessary in the era of disruptive innovation technologies. TAM provide a core elements and could be 
developed and expanded differently in line with the IT and IS innovations (Venkatesh and Morris, 
2000; Lin and Nguen, 2001).  
There are several primary constructs that have been recognized to strongly influence 
technology acceptance in the past research. The most important predictors of innovation adoption are 
individual differences (Zmud, 1979, Nelson, 1990, Agarwal and Prasad, 1999; Venkatesh, 2000, 
Mallat, 2007; Ondurus and Pigneur, 2006), new technology characteristics (Ostlund, 1974; Tornatzky 
and Klein, 1982; Gatignon and Robertson, 1985; Davis, 1989; Moor and Benbasat, 1991; Rogers, 
1995) and social influences (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975; Moore and Benbasat, 1991; Venkatesh and 
Davis, 2000; Lucas and Spitler, 2000; Venkatesh and Baia, 2008; Fennolar and Cuestas, 2010). In 
relation to financial interactions and new payment system acceptance perceived Security (security, 
risk, trust) is especially relevant in the context of financial transactions (Khalilzadeh et al., 2017) and 
would be of critical importance for the present cryptocurrency payment adoption study.  
 
Cryptocurrency Payments  
 
Established payment card networks (e.g., Visa and Mastercard) and a broad range of so-called 
―alternative paymentsǁ including eWallets (e.g., Paypal, Google Checkout, and WebMoney), direct 
debit systems (typically via ACH, such as eBillMe), money transfer systems (e.g., Moneygram) etc . 
are all explicitly identify the payer in transactions, and are centrally or quasicentrally administered 
(Pomarole et al., 2013). In other words the user provides his account information to the merchant, and 
trusts the merchant and the processor to withdraw only the agreed-upon (Folkinshtein and Lennon, 
2017). On the other hand cryptocurrency payment is pseudo anonymous, it do not explicitly identify 
the payer or the payee, transactions are irreversible but requires third party, a global peer-to-peer 
network, mediation which makes all transactions completely transparent (Pomarole et al., 2013). 
Cryptocurrency is a ―push-basedǁ payment system—the user creates a transaction transferring a 
specific amount to the merchant and without specific further action on the part of the user in creating a 
new transaction, no other amount can be taken. To make an analogy to the world of cash, with 
cryptocurrency you take some cash out of your wallet and hand it to the merchant. With the bank/credit 
card system, you give your wallet to the merchant and ask him to take out the amount you agreed upon, 
while you turn your back and do not look (Sigala & Christou, 2006; Folkinshtein and Lennon, 2017).  
Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency and widely recognized by the scientific and 
business community as a pioneering technological innovation which contributes to the shaping of a 
new market and network (Roussou and Stiakakis, 2016). On the one hand cryptocurrency, such as 
Bitcoin has been negatively associated with use in the illicit dark web commerce sites (Barratt, 2012; 
Trautman, 2014) on the other hand Bitcoin (every transaction is recorded on the publicly viewable 
block chain, the legitimacy of transactions is verified by comparing the transmission with the previous 
history of transactions as recorded on the block chain, ensuring provenance and validity) is by design 
aims to increase trust (Brito and Castilo, 2013; Nakamoto, 2008a,b; Folkinshtein and Lennon, 2017). 
Growing popularity of crypto currencies is influenced by decreasing public confidence and trust in the 
credibility of financial institutions as well as leading to new ways of transactions, without third party 
mediation (Roussou and Stiakakis, 2016) which is very popular among millennial generation (Lou and 
LI, 2017). For example Bitcoin currency is considered the first application of block chain innovation 
which gradually changes the current organization and structure of the market and the financial system, 
displacing previous value systems (Antonopoulus, 2014).  
Cryptocurrency payment involves fast, secure, anonymous, person to person payment via 
internet, without time or space limitation. As block chain technology increases in popularity, 
cryptocurrency payment continue to facilitate secure electronic commercial transactions between 
organizations or individuals. This paper focuses one the important innovation that is steadily gaining 
popularity for which adoption processes are not yet understood- cryptocurrency payment. Block chain 
is a decentralized public transaction ledger, it is transparent and immutable technology which has a 
potential of fast, cheap, peer-to-peer financial transactions (Folkinshtein and Lennon, 2017). 
Cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin is an entirely digital distributed currency, not dependent on any 
particular national currency or geographic location (Folkinshtein and Lennon, 2017).  
 
Research Model and Hypothesis  
 
Previous research has identified three principal external variables of the TAM - namely 
individual differences, technology characteristics and social influence (Davis, 1989; Moor and 
Benbasat, 1991; Agarwal and Prasad, 1999; Venkatesh and Davis, 2000; Venkatesh and Baia, 2008). 
There are several primary constructs that have been recognized to strongly influence technology 
acceptance in the past research. The most important predictors of innovation adoption are individual 
differences (Zmud, 1979, Nelson, 1990, Agarwal and Prasad, 1999; Venkatesh, 2000, Mallat, 2007; 
Ondurus and Pigneur, 2006), new technology characteristics (Ostlund, 1974; Tornatzky and Klein, 
1982; Gatignon and Robertson, 1985; Davis, 1989; Moor and Benbasat, 1991; Rogers, 1995) and social 
influences (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975; Moore and Benbasat, 1991; Venkatesh and Davis, 2000; Lucas 
and Spitler, 2000; Christou & Sigala, 2001, 2002; Venkatesh and Baia, 2008; Fennolar and Cuestas, 
2010). In relation to financial interactions and new payment system acceptance perceived Security 
(security, risk, trust) is especially relevant in the context of financial transactions (Khalilzadeh et al., 
2017) and would be of critical importance for the present cryptocurrency payment adoption study.  
In this paper, authors adopt TAM as the robust and widely used theoretical foundation for 
understating one of the latest technologies of cryptocurrency payment adoption. We therefore propose 
to include several constructs at the same time the study of cryptocurrency payment.  
Based on the Technology acceptance model (TAM) several factor in relation to block chain 
technology and cryptocurrency adoption were identified: Perceived Risk (viability, security risk, third 
party service failure risk, risk of user error, risk of privacy loss, risk of counterparty fraud, risk of illicit 
association), Perceived Ease of Use (free participation, instant transfers, simple interface, linkage to 
traditional currencies, relative complexity of bitcoin trading) and Perceived Usefulness (control own 
money, disintermediation, high speed of transfer, low cost of transfer, high transaction security, limited 
supply, international scope, lowers merchants cost, increase customer trust requirements, higher price 
volatility) (Folkinshtein and Lennon, 2017). Following TAM sequential approach authors add attitude 
construct as a mediator of the impact of perceived usefulness and ease of use on behavioral intention 
(Davis, Bagozzi and Warshaw, 1989). Sequential approach of TAM model logic has a potential to 
enhance the explanatory power of the current study research model. Integrated research model 
proposed in this study focuses on cryptocurrency characteristics and perceived security constructs 
influence on behavioral intent.  
With an empirical test of this model, this paper seeks to achieve three research purposes: 1) to 
extent the explanatory power and predictive accuracy of TAM model in technology acceptance studies; 
2) to investigate integrated effect of technology, individual and social characteristics on business 
owners intention to use cryptocurrency payment technology in hotels; 3) to address differences in 
determinants of block chain technology based cryptocurrency acceptance in hotels. The paper is 
organized as follows: first theoretical background of the study is presented, then hypothesis are 
developed and a conceptual framework is introduced, third research method, analysis and results are 
explained and finally the findings, implication, limitations and contributions of this study are discussed.  
 
Perceived Security (security, risk, trust)  
Security  
 
Perceived Security is ―the degree to which a customer believes that using a particular mobile 
payment procedure will be secureǁ (Shih, 2009, p.1346). Security is the degree defined as the 
protection of security threats, for example in relation to cryptocurrency it is the loss/hijack of digital 
wallet, money loss due to privacy volatility, etc. (Roussou and Stiakakis, 2016). Perceived security 
positively affects behavioral intent (Shih, 2009). Security has been found to have strong direct and 
indirect effect on intention to use new payment technology in restaurant and play a vital role in the 
context of a new digital environment (Khalilzadeh et al. 2017). Perceived security has been found to be 
a significant antecedent of trust in e-commerece and online shopping studies (Flavian and Guinallu, 
2006; Kim, Ching and Lee, 2011).  
Hypothesis: Perceived Security of using cryptocurrency payment has positive influence 
on intention to use cryptocurrency payment.  
Hypothesis: Perceived Security of using cryptocurrency payment positively and directly 
influence perceived trust.  
 
Perceived Risk (PR)  
 
Perceived risk is defined as ―the consequence of a decision reflecting the variation of its 
eventual resultsǁ (gefen, Rao and Tractinsky, 2003) and as ―the possibility that the use of innovation 
could not be safeǁ (Gerrard and Cunningham, 2003). Risk and uncertainty are the main reasons which 
cause users to avoid new technology adoption (Pikkarainen and Pikkarainen,  
Karjaluoto and Pahnila, 2004; Worthington, Edwards, 2000). Perceived risk was found to 
affect Behavioral Intention (Cheng et al. 2006). Previous research on new payment services adoption 
highlighted the importance of taking into consideration both perceived risk and perceived trust as a 
major concern that the risk of financial loss influence adoption or not of payment service (Liebana-
Cabanillas et al., 2014). For example previous research about mobile payment system adoption has 
shown that risk is a strong influencer on user’s trust, and as a result reduces intention to use the new 
payment service (Chen, 2008; Yang et al., 2012). The issues of security and privacy was found to be an 
important variables for perceived risk (Christou, 2006, 2007, 2011; Tan, Eze, and Chong, 2009; Wang, 
Wang, Lin and Tang, 2003). Perceived risk is considered as an attribute of Perceived Usefulness (Liao 
and Cheung, 2012). In relation to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology Perceived Risk (viability, 
security risk, third party service failure risk, risk of user error, risk of privacy loss, risk of counterparty 
fraud, risk of illicit association) is considered to be one of three most influences factors influencing 
adoption long with PU and PEO (Folkinshtein and Lennon, 2017).  
Hypothesis: Perceived Risk of using cryptocurrency payment has a negative influence on 
intention to use cryptocurrency payment.  
Hypothesis: Perceived Risk of using cryptocurrency payment has a direct negative 
impact on perceived security.  
Hypothesis: Perceived Risk of using cryptocurrency payment has a direct negative 
impact on perceived trust.  
Hypothesis: Perceived Risk of using cryptocurrency payment negative influences 
Perceived Usefulness.  
 
Perceived Trust  
 
In virtual electronic transaction trust is defined as ―the psychological state leading to accept 
the vulnerability of a trustor, based on positive expectations of the trustee’s actionsǁ (Singh and 
Sirdeshmukh, 2000) and ―the willingness of the parties to be vulnerable to the actions of a virtual 
partyǁ (Mayer et al., 1995; Van Der Heijden, Verhagen and Creemers, 2003; Valachis et al., 2009; 
Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2019). Perceived trust positively affects behavioral intent (Shih, 2009). Trust is 
an important construct in determining acceptance of new technologies such as e-commerce (Goles, 
Lee, Rao and Warren, 2009; yang, Chandlrees, Lin and Chao, 2009 ) and mobile payment adoption 
(Misra and Wickamasinghe, 2004). Trust was found to influence the attitude and intention to use a 
mobile payment (Chandra et al., 2010; Shin, 2009; LU, Yang, CHau and Cao, 2012). Trust is also an 
antecedent of the ease of use (Chircu, Davis, and Kauffman, 2000; Pavlou, 2003). Technology 
experience people, for example advanced internet users show higher levels of trust in the online 
application (Ruiz, Izquierdo and Calderon, 2007; Flavian and Guinaliu, 2007).  
 
Hypothesis: Perceived Trust of the use of cryptocurrency payment has positive influence 
on intention to use cryptocurrency payment.  
Hypothesis: Perceived Trust of the use of cryptocurrency payment has positive influence 
on attitude towards the use cryptocurrency payment.  
 
Data Analysis Results and Discussion  
 
Data on various aspects of cryptocurrency payments were collected from several hotels in 
Taiwan using a questionnaire during the summer of 2018. The variables employed in this analysis are 
all related to cryptocurrency payments and include convenience, trust, technological risk, financial risk 
(security), social risk, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intent. Data were 
collected from 101 respondents working at various positions in the hotels. The respondents’ were 
presented with multiple questions for each variable, with answers in the form of a likert scale ranging 
from 1 to 7.  
The number of questions used in the construction of each variable is as follows: convenience 
– 4; trust – 7; technological risk – 7; financial risk (security) – 4; social risk – 2; perceived usefulness – 
6; perceived ease of use – 4; behavioral intent – 4. The reliability of the data pertaining to each variable 
is acceptable, as indicated by Cronbach’s alpha. The alphas for each variable are as follows: 
convenience – 0.93; trust – 0.97; technological risk – 0.95; financial risk (security) – 0.954; social risk 
– 0.9; perceived usefulness – 0.85; perceived ease of use – 0.95; behavioral intent – 0.95.  
Figure 1 below shows the model that illustrates the hypothesized relationships between the 
variables. The model describes the following assumed relationships. Perceived usefulness and 
perceived ease of use affect behavioral intent to use cryptocurrency payments. Trust, bint 0.8156

Table 1 below shows the correlation coefficients between the variables. In general agreement 
with the model illustrated above, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are highly correlated 
with convenience and with trust. However, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are not 
highly correlated with different risk types. Also in general agreement with the model, behavioral intent 
is highly correlated with perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

In the formulas above, the variables on the left-hand side are dependent variables. The 
variables listed on the right-hand side are independent variables. The list of constants includes a0, b0, 
and c0. The list of coefficients includes a1 – a4, b1, b2, c1, and c2. The list of error terms includes u, 
e, and m.  
The regression result of the model in formula (1) above is shown in the table 2 below. The 
overall fit of the model is relatively good. Adjusted R-squared equals 0.57, meaning that 57% of the 
variance in the dependent variable is explained by the variance in the independent variables. However, 
individually, not all independent variables seem to be useful in predicting the dependent variable. The 
P-value is below 0.05 only for the constant (intercept) and trust variable. Trust in cryptocurrency 
payments has a P-value of 0.000; hence, trust is statistically significant in affecting the perceived 
usefulness. All of the risk related variables have a P-value much greater than 0.05. the P-values for 
financial risk, technological risk, and for social risk are 0.403; 0.853; and 0.43. Hence, the effect of all 
of these risk related variables on perceived usefulness is statistically insignificant. One possible reason 
for the regression results to show no statistical significance of the risk related variables is 
multicollinearity. Table 1 shows that financial risk is highly correlated with both the technological and 
social risk, with the correlation coefficient above 0.7 in both cases.  
 
 
The regression result of the model in formula (2) above is shown in table 3 below. The overall 
fit of the model is relatively good. Adjusted R-squared equals 0.61, meaning that 61% of the variance 
in the dependent variable is explained by the variance in the independent variables. However, 
individually, not all independent variables seem to be useful in predicting the dependent variable. The 
P-value is below 0.05 only for the constant and convenience variable. Convenience of cryptocurrency 
payments has a P-value of 0.000; hence, convenience is statistically significant in affecting the 
perceived ease of use. The P-value is above 0.05 for technological risk variable, P-value equals 0.279. 
Hence, the effect of technological risk on perceived ease of use is statistically insignificant.  
 
The regression result of the model in formula (3) above is shown in table 4 below. The overall 
fit of the model is relatively good. Adjusted R-squared equals 0.71, meaning that 71% of the variance 
in the dependent variable is explained by the variance in the independent variables. The P-values of the 
independent variables are below 0.05. Both the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a 
statistically significant effect on behavioral intent to use cryptocurrency payments in the hotels.  
 
 
 
Conclusion  
 
In summary, this study has applied TAM to cryptocurrency payment adoption in Taiwanese 
hotels, examining the factors that are more likely to affect the behavioral intent. The empirical results 
suggest that intent to adopt cryptocurrency payments is affected by perceived usefulness, and perceived 
ease of use of these payments. In turn, perceived usefulness is affected by trust towards these 
payments. Interestingly, perceived usefulness was not shown to be significantly affected by different 
types of risks associated with cryptocurrency payments, including financial risk, technological risk, and 
social risk. Perceived ease of use, in turn, is affected by convenience of cryptocurrency payments; and 
is not shown to be significantly affected by trust.  
Admittedly, this study has some limitations, including a relatively small sample size of 101 
respondents and a relatively simple empirical test. Future research needs to re-examine current results 
with employment of a larger sample size and more rigorous analysis of that sample.

Fall 2018] Assessing the Evolution of Cryptocurrency 75
Despite its price drop in 2018,10 the cryptocurrency market in 2017 experi-
enced unprecedented growth driven by improved ease of access, speculation, 
familiarity, media attention, network effects, mining activity, distrust of tradi-
tional banking, global instability hedging, and a demand effect from the initial 
coin offering (“ICO”) market. The market correction in 201811 strengthens the 
speculation that 2017 prices were an asset bubble. Nevertheless, the future of 
cryptocurrency is impossible to predict. Although it is unlikely that cryptocur-
rency will eliminate trusted intermediaries or replace sovereign fiat altogether, it 
has numerous latent value propositions and long-term use cases. These include 
distributed ledger technology (“DLT”) and blockchain innovations (particularly 
in financial payments, settlements, clearing, supply chain, agriculture, and vot-
ing), identity and data protection mechanisms, crowd-funding, and decentral-
ized business applications and services.
There may also be long-term benefits to a bubble, including “long tail” suc-
cesses, hype-financed research and development in DLT and blockchain infra-
structure (that wouldn’t have otherwise received funding in a reticent market), 
and consumer familiarity benefits.12 The regulatory response to date has largely 
been enforcement-based (emphasizing fraud detection and criminal deterrence), 
with public statements and interest across a diverse range of regulatory bodies, 
rather than unified rules. There are, however, inherent difficulties in regulating 
the cryptocurrency market, which will be discussed in detail in this Comment.
I. HOW DID WE GET HERE? DEMAND FACTORS AND 
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
A. Cryptocurrency and the Historic Price Run
Cryptocurrency is “digital money” secured through cryptology and running 
on a “blockchain”—a distributed, decentralized ledger where individuals can 
anonymously transact and maintain records without an intermediary.13 Bitcoin 
is the most widely known14 (and currently the most valuable)15 cryptocurrency.

There are many others, most notably Ether, the token that powers the popular 
Ethereum blockchain (the technology behind smart contracts),16 and Litecoin, a 
cryptocurrency designed for smaller payments.17 Cryptocurrency is “divorced 
from governments and central banks”18 which makes it “decentralized” and 
immune from inflation (and deflation) and some believe a “quicker, cheaper and 
more reliable form of payment.”19 In 2017, the value of cryptocurrency surged 
with Bloomberg calling the initial price run “staggering” and noting that its run 
was larger than the dot.com boom in technology stocks.20 In 2018, the market 
values of popular cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin) experienced a steep de-
cline.21  Nevertheless, current market prices are still significantly higher than 
those of late 2016 and early 2017.22 So what exactly has driven the demand for 
cryptocurrency?
B. Familiarity, Ease of Access, Speculation, and Network Effects
The ease of purchasing cryptocurrency23 combined with increased media at-
tention has led to an influx of new, less sophisticated buyers,24 and there is an

November 16, 2018, the market cap is just under $100 billion. See Cryptocurrency Market Capitali-

active effort underway to make the market less opaque.25 Universities around 
the world are starting to offer courses on cryptocurrency,26 and Netflix27 and 
Khan Academy28 series have increased public familiarity with cryptocurrency, 
DLT, and blockchain.29 Demand is also amplified by a “network effect,” where 
a technology becomes more valuable simply because more people are using it.30
For example, Coinbase (the largest Bitcoin exchange in the United States) add-
ed over 100,000 customers in one day after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
announced it would launch Bitcoin futures.31  There has also been significant 
mining and development activity as well as purchases of cryptocurrency as a 
hedging substitute for gold or the U.S. dollar.32
C. The Initial Coin Offering Market
Another factor driving demand is the initial coin offering (“ICO”) market 
(which was red hot in 2017), where a company issues digital coins or tokens 
that provide access to a service (called a “utility” or “app” token) or that repre-
sent an investment opportunity (like a traditional security).33 ICOs generated in 
excess of $1.2 billion of start-up capital in 2017, and many see them as a work-
around traditional venture capital.34 OVERSTOCK.COM recently announced a

$500 million token sale (which would be the largest ICO ever).35 Also, partici-
pation in an ICO generally requires Bitcoin or Ether.36 So, as the economic 
principle of supply and demand dictates, greater demand for ICOs means great-
er demand for Bitcoin or Ether (hence the price rise).
D. Regional Instability and Post-Financial Crisis Institutional Distrust
Another demand factor is the continuing, post-financial crisis distrust of the 
traditional banking sector.37 Some investors (mostly outside of stable monetary 
systems) view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against volatile lo-
cal currencies and geopolitical risk (for example the large “mining” activity in 
Venezuela, despite the physical risks).38 As long as some countries support 
Bitcoin, there will be continuing demand for it.39 Some investors are taking the 
position that it is a “new gold” given its fixed supply.40 This belief is starting to 
gain traction, and there is currently “more money trying to get in than out”—
increasing demand even further.41

Fall 2018] Assessing the Evolution of Cryptocurrency 79
E. Criminal Activity and Regulation Through Enforcement
How have regulators in the U.S. responded to this historic price run? For the 
most part through fraud detection, enforcement, anti-money laundering, and 
general criminal deterrence. Congress is aware of the dangers of cryptocurren-
cy.42 Bitcoin is a known criminal haven, and a way of facilitating nefarious ac-
tivity like “donating to Wikileaks.”43 A recent study by Omri Marian suggests 
that cryptocurrencies are “super tax havens” and that they could become the 
“weapon of choice for tax evaders.”44 Cryptocurrency is also utilized by hack-
ers45 because of anonymity and the ability to convert it into cash (or “wash” it) 
in the “darknet” (where developers take a “cut” for “cleaning” the money).46
One recent report noted that banks have even started to “hoard Bitcoin” as a 
purse for future ransom attacks.47
The SEC has applied enforcement or cease and desist orders48 used in tradi-
tional securities matters (like fraud, illegal trading, or pump and dump49) for 
digital currency.50 It has also rejected applications for cryptocurrency-based ex-
change-traded funds.51 Also, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
(“CFTC”) recently cracked down on an alleged Ponzi scheme orchestrated 
42. Congress has proposed legislation to amend the Bank Secrecy Act to add issuers of digi-
tal currency, and digital currency exchanges to the definition of “financial institution.” See Combat-
ing Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017, S. 1241, 115th Cong.

tive in enforcing these laws in the cryptocurrency market.64
F. Regulatory Challenges, Overlapping Jurisdiction, and Resultant Costs
Regulating cryptocurrency is difficult65 because the rules were not designed 
for it,66 and it is hard to keep pace with new business models and innovation67
(for example, AirSwap, a decentralized exchange framework powered by smart 
contracts).68 Regulators want to avoid the “cobra-effect”—where a solution to a 
problem makes the problem worse.69 Also, there is uncertainty about what 
cryptocurrency actually is—is it a currency, a commodity,70 a payment mecha-
nism,71 property,72 an asset, or a combination of these?73 An example of the un-

certainty is the SEC determination made on July 25th, 2017 (citing the “Howey 
test”74 and other cases75), which stated that a public offering of digital tokens 
known as “the DAO” was an offering of securities that was subject to federal 
law.76 The ruling provided clarity to token issuers who were offering “profit-
based” coins: they would need to comply with securities laws.77  However, it 
also created uncertainty because it did not address “underlying utility” tokens 
that were not profit-based but rather granted the holder a right to a service (like 
data storage).  This led some to believe that such tokens are unregulated.78 Sim-
ilar developments have taken place in Canada79 and Australia.80
Cryptocurrency exchanges trigger money transmission laws on a state level 
(wherein laws tend to vary widely), creating high costs of compliance for com-
panies and hampering the speed of innovation.81 With the introduction by the 
New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) of the Virtual Curren-
cy Regulatory Framework82 and the granting of trust charters to virtual currency 
exchanges,83 there is potential relief to the extensive state-to-state registration

House of Representatives on Sept. 7, 2017 that would amend the Internal Revenue Code and allow

G. Public Statements, Backdoor Rulemaking, and Goodhart’s Law
Another regulatory development is the interplay of public statements (which 
provide some guidance but are not formal laws with notice and public com-
ment) and policy through enforcement. In 2017, in relation to the cryptocurren-
cy market, the SEC issued public statements on celebrity promotion of ICOs,88
retail investor protection and cybersecurity,89 and public companies making 
ICO related claims.90  LabCFTC, an initiative launched by the CFTC in May 
2017 to facilitate “market-enhancing financial technology (“FinTech”) innova-
tion, fair market competition, and proactive regulatory excellence and under-
standing of emerging technologies” recently issued a Primer on Virtual Curren-
cies91 which discussed various “use cases” for cryptocurrency and the CFTC’s
role in oversight and jurisdiction.92 Based on the CFTC primer, virtual currency

currency,93 and the definition of “commodity” in the Commodity Exchange Act
(“CEA”) is broad enough to include both “currency” and “all services, rights, 
and interests . . . in which contacts for future delivery are presently or in the fu-
ture dealt in.”94
Even if a utility token is not a “security” under the Howey Test, or other-
wise triggers the criteria set out in the SEC’s DAO determination, it may still 
fall within CFTC jurisdiction.95 A utility token might be classified by the 
CFTC as a currency or a contract for the future exchange of services, rights, or
interests and thereby subject to the jurisdiction of the CEA.96 Utility token is-
suers would undoubtedly challenge such an interpretation (and would argue 
their offering is akin to a prepaid service or expense). Nevertheless, there are no 
bright lines in the primer—only general guidance that the CFTC considers cryp-
tocurrencies to be commodities and that it is actively monitoring this market.97
This approach has been described as “making policy about financial technology 
through enforcement actions rather than traditional rulemaking”98 and denying 
public notice and comment.99 This is not the first instance in which the CFTC 
has been accused of regulating through the “backdoor.”100 Current SEC Com-
missioner Hester Pierce argues that the CFTC has engaged in extensive back-
door policy making (like staff letters, long policy statements, guidance and en-
forcement actions) in relation to implementing its mandate under the Dodd-

Frank Act.101  This makes understanding the CFTC’s actions difficult for the 
public and (arguably) violates the Administrative Procedure Act.102
When considering the trend to regulate by enforcement, one is reminded of 
the famous “Goodhart’s Law” (named after economist Charles Goodhart).  Pro-
fessor Lawrence Baxter has summarized this phenomenon as follows: “target 
regulation is inherently self-defeating because strategic action will be taken to 
work around the targets.”103 Goodhart’s Law is often cited in relation to finan-
cial regulations that “miss the mark” since market participants “game the sys-
tem” and act strategically around the regulations.104 Perhaps the regulatory ap-
proach currently identifiable in the cryptocurrency market—overlapping 
jurisdiction, rule making through enforcement, and application uncertainty—is 
intentional. It keeps ICO issuers on their feet (and continually consulting with 
their lawyers); otherwise, they are unable to “game the system.” Intentional 
ambiguity on the part of the regulators is unlikely; however, it might be a rea-
sonable short-term strategy given the new, and constantly evolving, market. But 
a time will come when regulators will have to set out clear-cut guidelines.

cy.”108 He created “Bit Gold,”109 the predecessor of Bitcoin, and some (actually 
many) believe that he is in fact the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto110 (the creator
of Bitcoin)—though Szabo has explicitly denied this claim.111 In his widely 
read blog Unenumerated, Szabo suggests that Bitcoin is “now in important 
ways the most reliable and secure financial network in the world”112 and that 
the true value in Bitcoin is in something he calls “social scalability.”113 Szabo 
says that to understand the concept of social scalability we must recognize our 
cognitive and institutional limitations.114 Technological advancements (like the 
Internet) and institutional progress (like the facilitation of open global markets) 
have “lowered cognitive costs” and created a world, previously unknown, 
where a single entity, at a low cost, can connect and transact with others across 
previously impenetrable barriers.115
According to Szabo, cyber security and information technology innovations 
reduce our “vulnerability” to each other (which is needed as the number of ac-
tive participants in this new world is constantly increasing) in a process he calls 
“trust minimization,” which in turn frees our “cognitive capacity.”116 We cur-
rently require “institutional” oversight (laws, regulators, etc.) because our cyber 
security protocols do not give us “complete guarantees when accounting for all

113. Id. (Szabo defines social scalability as “the ability of an institution – a relationship or 
shared endeavour, in which multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or 
other features which constrain or motivate participant’s behaviours – to overcome shortcomings in 
human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how 
many can successfully participate.”).

ments that move function from mind to paper or mind to machine, lowering cognitive costs while 
increasing the value of information flowing between minds, reducing vulnerability, and/or searching 
for and discovering new and mutually beneficial participants.”).
116. Id. (“A wide variety of innovations reduce our vulnerability to fellow participants, in-
termediaries, and outsiders, and thereby lower our need to spend our scarce cognitive capacities

intermediaries’ potential for harmful behaviour.”).

possible behaviors of all participants.”117 Bitcoin, smart contracts, and block-
chain technology, Szabo advocates, will increase social scalability on an elabo-
rate scale because, unlike the social scalability of the Internet (which he calls 
“matchmaking”118), the social scalability of blockchain, smart contracts, and 
cryptocurrency is “trust minimization,” which allows us to increase the scale of 
our social interactions while simultaneously reducing the need for institutional 
(or legal) oversight.119 In a podcast episode with popular author Tim Ferris,
Szabo (citing Ayn Rand and Atlas Shrugged) stated that digital currency advo-
cates are seeking a post-regulatory “Galt’s Gulch in the cloud.” 120
Szabo does, however, acknowledge that “utopian schemes” are not “viable 
options” and that we are much more likely to rework our regulatory and organi-
zational structures rather than “designing from scratch.”121 Nevertheless, he be-
lieves society is moving towards a state of affairs where we enforce “data integ-
rity via computer science rather than via ‘calling the cops.’ ”122 From an 
evolutionary perspective, Szabo’s views mirror, in many ways, those of histori-
an and futurist Yuval Noah Harari, whose best-selling books SAPIENS: A BRIEF 
HISTORY OF MANKIND123 and HOMO DEUS: A BRIEF HISTORY OF TOMORROW124
describes two jumps in human cognitive capacity: one through the collective 
adoption of “myths” shared by humans to allow “millions of strangers to coop-
erate and work towards common goals”125 and a second, modern cognitive evo-
lution by way of technology.126 According to Harari, we are now beginning in-

creasingly to look to technology rather than institutions to solve society’s prob-
lems.127
Much of the value speculation, uncertainty, derision, and even excitement in 
today’s cryptocurrency market is because the future is an unknown and very 
different world than the one that we currently occupy.128 Is it possible that our 
fears are misplaced simply because we cannot foresee the future, and this uncer-
tain tension gives rise to bias in favor of the status quo?129 The media discus-
sion surrounding Bitcoin usually compares it to traditional government fiat; 
however, this might be a false comparison—maybe cryptocurrency is not fiat at 
all but rather a “new asset class that enable[s] decentralized applications.”130 Or 
even grander—maybe it is a redefinition of the entire Internet, or, as Mike 
Orcutt puts it, “a new kind of Web in which we won’t have to trust banks, cor-
porations, or governments with our valuable data.”131
Perhaps we are not heading for a showdown between the sovereign and 
technological anarchists at all but rather an adoption by the sovereign of the un-
derlying technology powering Bitcoin for traditional fiat.  Several governments, 
including Sweden, Canada, Singapore, and China have begun testing cryptocur-
rency technology to be used in various central banking functions.132 A “Fed-

tion, however, is controversial because there are concerns about who would per-
form ledger verifications and whether its use would facilitate bank runs.134 Per-
haps the future will not involve a substitution of cryptocurrency for fiat but ra-
ther a “parallel currency” (that can only be used domestically).135 This is also 
controversial as the State could, in theory, use it as a mechanism of “social con-
trol” (restricting usage against certain commodities like guns, alcohol, sugar, 
etc.).136 Perhaps the Sovereign’s application will not be in retail at all but rather 
in the wholesale markets, in line with a recent article published by the Bank of 
International Settlements, allowing clearing and settlements in the wholesale 
market via cryptocurrency.137
B. Bubble Dynamics and the Inevitability of Market Cycles
There are many high-profile individuals like Warren Buffett,138 Ray Da-
lio,139 and Mark Cuban140 who are skeptical of cryptocurrency—particularly 
Bitcoin. In the words of Joe Kennedy, it is time to leave the market when “shoe-
shine boys give stock tips.”141 Angela Walch, Associate Professor of Law at St. 
Mary’s University, suggested that this was precisely the state of the market in 
2017: “[i]f you put the word ‘crypto’ or ‘token’ or ‘coin’ around an offering, it 
doesn’t matter what the substance or fundamentals behind it are, they are draw-
ing money, and that’s a dangerous situation.”142 Yale Economics Professor and 
Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller was one of the first to note the bubble dynamics 
of Bitcoin and stated that, like other bubbles, it was driven by “stories” rather

than “fundamentals.” 143 Investment manager and author Andy Kessler argued 
that there was no rational metric that explained the valuation of Bitcoin in late 
2017.  It is not a scarce commodity (like precious metal) but, because of the 
blockchain, is rather a “software as a service—transactions for a price, like 
credit cards.” Unlike credit card providers, however, Bitcoin has a fee structure 
that is “some 3000 times less than Visa.”144
Even if Shiller and others are correct (and the 2018 price correction pro-
vides support for their arguments) does this mean that the underlying technolo-
gy (or idea for that matter) will forever disappear? The Internet bubble burst, 
and it did not lead to the extinction of the Internet—quite the opposite. Perhaps 
we are heading for a showdown between the sovereign and those who would 
prefer to live in “Galt’s Gulch in the cloud.”145 Or perhaps, as former SEC 
Chairman Arthur Leavitt, Jr., put it, cryptocurrency is “here to stay.”146 It is al-
so possible that we are asking the wrong question. Perhaps, instead of speculat-
ing about whether the cryptocurrency bubble will decline even further, we 
should just accept its inevitability and instead look for the most appropriate re-
sponse (including non-intervention).  Devotees of Hyman Minsky’s “financial 
instability hypothesis” (which came to some prominence in the aftermath of the 
2008 global financial crisis) would argue that bubbles are inevitable,147 and that 
“stretches of prosperity,” bull market booms, and price run-ups just “sow the 
seeds of the next crisis.”148 Minsky’s framework is based on a view that “capi-
talist economies exhibit inflations and debt deflations which seem to have the

Fall 2018] Assessing the Evolution of Cryptocurrency 91
C. The Systemic Implications of a Cryptocurrency Price Collapse
The “pre-sale” offering dynamics of an ICO allow for significant “pump 
and dump” risk to retail investors (reminiscent of the IPO tech bubble). Institu-
tional investors will often come in at a much lower pre-ICO price and ride the 
“hype” to a quick cash out; less sophisticated investors are then “left holding the 
proverbial bag.”151 There is no question that the ICO market is rife with hype, 
speculation—even fraud—and that a lot of people are positioned to lose mon-
ey.152 Should the regulators take a more aggressive stance on the market in 
light of the bubble dynamics that are developing?
The question of more aggressive intervention is usually a function of the 
systemic risks inherent in a bubble, and in the case of cryptocurrency those 
seem (at the moment) to be contained.153 Professor Robert Wolcott of North-
western University’s Kellogg School of Management, suggests cryptocurrency 
is not a “too big to fail” scenario because it (intentionally) operates “outside of 
incumbent financial systems.” 154 As a result, it does not pose “at-risk participa-
tion” threats (the extent that broad sectors of the market are participating in a 
risky behaviour) or “interdependence” risk (the extent that basic financial sys-
tems have “multiple dependencies” on the market in question).155  This could 
change, however, with institutional participation in the Bitcoin futures market. 
Wolcott suggests we should hope for a bubble bursting soon to “mitigate the 
cost of learning to the economy.”156
When you look at cryptocurrency through the framework of the recent 
global financial crisis you see other differences. The Financial Crisis Inquiry 
Commission (“FCIC”), in its final report on the causes of the financial crisis,157
identified many factors—in addition to interdependence and contagion—that 
contributed to the crisis. These included—but were not limited to—a general 
environment of deregulation,158 a belief (by former Federal Reserve Chairman

crashes,159 the mismanagement of government-sponsored entities in pursuit of 
executive bonuses,160 growth in shadow banking161 and high risk derivatives,162

predatory lending practices,165 a disregard of prudent underwriting standards 
and quality control for mortgages,166 errors made by rating agencies,167
manipulation of accounting standards,168 extreme executive compensation,169
and moral hazard.170 Really, the only similarly with cryptocurrency, at least at 
this point, is greed and a period of rapid growth.
D. Public Trust in a Changing Financial World
If cryptocurrency is to become viable in the long-term, it must generate the 
same trust as traditional fiat. One could argue that much of the “fear monger-
ing” coming from the traditional banking sector is due, in large part, to the 
threat cryptocurrency represents to core banking business sectors.171 However, 
uncertainty could also be attributed to the cyber-security risks noted above, with 
one recent study going as far as to label it a “substantial danger in terms of 
criminal enterprise.”172 Another study labelled cryptocurrency a “threat to do-
mestic and international security” and advocated for making the entire market 
illegal.173 Further, there are no government guarantees, like deposit insurance, 
in the case of cryptocurrency. Independent of a stable regulatory environment, 
the general consumer must become comfortable with it to be sustainable long 
term. There have been many “high profile” cryptocurrency hacks over the past 
several years, calling its safety into serious question. The most notable include 
the infamous “Mt. Gox” digital currency exchange breach (which resulted in a

Cryptocurrency may be ushering in a completely new business and legal 
framework—the “decentralized business model”179—and wholesale changes to 
long-established systems give people pause.  Cryptocurrency technology is al-
lowing companies to create and sell their own tokens which can serve a number 
of purposes including “utility” or usage rights, as well as profit participation 
through crowd funded ICOs. With this technology, it is now possible to con-
template a world of business without centralized control or board of director 
driven fiduciary oversight.180
E. Cryptocurrency’s Long-Term Value Proposition
Not everyone shares Jamie Dimon’s view of Cryptocurrency.  Goldman 
Sachs is considering dedicating a trading operation to digital currencies.181
Bitcoin, despite its popularity, has drawbacks, like high mining fees,182 but 
maybe a better cryptocurrency will replace it, or a sovereign will adopt their 
own cryptocurrency altogether? Internationally, government reception of cryp-
tocurrency has been varied.  Japan has embraced it, officially recognizing 11

could rise even further given the fact that Bitcoin for example cannot be deval-
ued by “centralized monetary policy” because it is more like gold with a fixed 
quantity.191 Philips also states that new “use cases” for digital currency are add-

ing to its stickiness, citing examples such as regulatory arbitrage and “open 
source software of distributed storage networks.”192 Cryptocurrencies like 
Bitcoin will continue to have value (as both a medium of exchange and store of 
value) when there is a lack of stability in a local government’s fiat—and the re-
cent popularity of cryptocurrency in Venezuela is a robust case study for this 
proposition.193 Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, Jr., suggests the issue is 
not whether cryptocurrency is better than “established systems” (like the United 
States and Western Europe) but rather how it impacts “the 2.5 billion people 
excluded from the established system?”194 Levitt also believes that holding 
cryptocurrency can be preferable to local currency in many places and notes 
that in the U.K. there was a run up in Bitcoin holdings in light of Brexit uncer-
tainty.195 In politically unstable regions it can be held as an “alternative curren-
cy.”196 There is also underlying value in DLT as applied to cryptography and 
peer-to-peer networking.197
F. Long Tail Successes, Hype-Financed Infrastructure, 
and Research and Development
Bubbles can have an “important upside” as a financial engine for “innova-
tion and growth.”198 Without a bubble, as suggested by William Janeway, 
Managing Director at the Venture Capital firm Warbug Pincus, “many produc-
tive technologies and companies would otherwise struggle to find financing.”199
As a result, bubbles may be more than what NEW YORKER writer John Cassidy 
calls a “destructive sideshow.”200 A recent JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
study, by Ramana Nanda and Matthew Rhodes-Kropf (2013), looked at “seed or 
series A investment” of technology start-ups from 1985 to 2004 (12,285 firms). 
It showed that venture capital (“VC”) activity in the United States during “hot 
markets” led to risky investing by VCs but also “a mindset of experimentation 
and a willingness to fail” that led to funding which may not otherwise have

happened.201 An interesting note is what happens in the “tails of the distribution 
of outcomes” of start-ups that obtain funding during bubbles.202  The authors 
report that although companies who were started during a “hot period” are “sig-
nificantly more likely to go bankrupt than those founded in periods when fewer 
start-up firms were funded,” other companies ended up being “extremely suc-
cessful and innovative.”203 In other words—a bubble extends both sides of the 
distribution “tail”—there is not only more failure but also more “extreme suc-
cess.”204 Moreover, a company that “succeeds” (the authors define success as 
an “IPO or acquisition”) will “simultaneously create more value.”205
Daniel Gross, the author of the book POP! WHY BUBBLES ARE GREAT FOR 
THE ECONOMY,206 suggests that a bubble has a detrimental effect only when 
“resources are allocated efficiently and investors and consumers behave ration-
ally.”207 Gross believes that bubbles create “infrastructure” which is then con-
solidated and put to long-term use.208 Bubbles also create “mental infrastruc-
ture”209 because of “marketing, advertising, promotion, hype and brand 
awareness.”210 This applies to cryptocurrency as we see the development of an-

also highlight that changes in capital availability that are unrelated to the investment opportunities 
seem to exacerbate our results, suggesting that one mechanism through which hot markets could 
lead to riskier investments is that it makes investors more willing to experiment, and thereby fund 
more novel, risky investments.  This finding is consistent with Nanda and Rhodes-Kropf (2012), 
who demonstrate how increased funding in the venture capital market can rationally alter the type of 
investments investors are willing to fund toward a more experimental, innovative project. Accord-
ing to this view, the abundance of capital associated with investment cycles might not only be a re-
sponse to the arrival of new technologies, but could also play a critical role in driving their creation 
and commercialization. That is, the abundance of capital can change the type of firm investors are 
willing to finance in these times. Financial market investment cycles can therefore create innovation 
cycles.”).

access to finance and the amount of research and development that firms, par-
ticularly young ones, carry out.”215 A blockchain expert Peter Van Valken-

it “allocates capital to long-shot paradigm shifting innovation.”216
CONCLUSION: ASSESSING THE FUTURE
What does the future of cryptocurrency entail? This question is impossible 
to answer, but there are signs pointing in several directions.  Cryptocurrency, in 
some form, is likely here to stay,217 but so is government fiat.218 New forms of 
cryptocurrency will emerge to fill value gaps, and today’s leaders (like Bitcoin 
and Ether) will pressure major banks and tech players (like Amazon, Facebook, 
and Dropbox) to improve their products and services.219  In addition to smart 
contracts innovations, DLT may improve global payments,220 equities clearing 
consumers and businesses to spend their money in fundamentally different ways.  The telegraphs 
slashed per-word rates to compete with the mail and with each other. The railroads slashed freight 
rates to compete with canals and rivers, and with each other. In the 1990s, the entire e-commerce 
sector spent furiously to persuade consumers and businesses to take the leap of faith and buy stuff—
stocks, books, airline tickets, pet food, groceries, diamonds, chemicals, you name it—online.”).

Fall 2018] Assessing the Evolution of Cryptocurrency 99
transparency can be positive for the cryptocurrency space because they provide 
public familiarity, credibility, and simplicity to an otherwise opaque market.231
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), which has an internal 
Office of Innovation,232 recently announced a special purpose banking fintech 
charter,233 which has been contested at the state level.234 However, because the 
OCC’s special purpose charter proposal is focused on “core banking,” Con-
gressman David Schweikert, (R-Ariz.) has suggested that it does not do enough 
to support crypto and digital currency companies.235 It is also uncertain whether 
cryptocurrency will ever be substitutable for wage payment given its current 
treatment by the IRS and its inherent price volatility.236
Perhaps the most interesting development will be whether cryptocurrency, 
on its own, can become a mainstream payment mechanism, or whether the fu-
ture is simply in the blockchain.  Some countries ban it outright as a form of 
payment;237 yet payments continue to surface—including lawyer’s fees, Mon-
tessori school tuition, real estate, and even a Lamborghini Huracan.238 Also, a 
new “Bitcoin Visa” is in the works by London Block Exchange (a British cryp-

ABSTRACT 
 
ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING IN CAMBODIA 
SHOULD CAMBODIA REGULATE OR BAN CRYPTOCURRENCIES 
 
By 
PHAT POMPISEY 
The new technology of payment, Cryptocurrency have been discussed broadly through the 
global. The opportunities and risks have been considered by the government as well as by the 
regulator. Some countries regulate cryptocurrency while some countries prohibit and crack down 
the cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses. So what is the reasons behind the regulation of this 
new technology innovation? Do Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies relate with a criminal? Is it a 
new tool for laundering money? Consequently, the researcher will take this opportunity to find out 
these answers and make suggestions to Cambodia whether Cambodia should regulate or ban 
cryptocurrency.

INTRODUCTION 
The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was announced by a group of programmers using the 
pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009; it was invented as a peer-to-peer system for online 
payment that does not require a trusted central authority (Nakamoto, 2008).  In April 2018, there 
were more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies trading in cryptocurrency exchanges (Coinmarketcap, 
2018). Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency among other and follows up by Ethereum and 
Ripple. According to Andreas and Hunter (2016), Bitcoin started trading in 2009, with an exchange 
rate against the U.S. dollar of $0.0007 per Bitcoin (P.2). Frances  (2018), states that in November 
2013, the U.S. Dollar exchange rate for one Bitcoin rose more than fivefold, and the value of one 
Bitcoin, which had begun trading at less than five cents in 2010, exceeded USD 1,200 per Bitcoin. 
Whether Bitcoin’s value goes up or down, people around the world are asking the same question: 
What exactly is the potential of this cryptocurrency? What is the opportunities and traits of the 
Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin-related with criminality? Did criminals find a new tool to launder dirty money? 
The study of the opportunities and traits of cryptocurrency is a matter of current interest for 
policymakers; therefore, there are rapidly growing works of literature on this new technology 
innovation such as the risk and vulnerabilities of virtual currency by public-private analytic 
exchange program team (Everette, 2017),  the linking factors between cryptocurrencies, crime and 
enterprise cyber-attack by MWR Infosecurity (2017), the relationship of illicit fund with Bitcoin 
by Fanusie and Robinson (2018), and the regulation anti-money laundering on cryptocurrency by 
Daniel and Barbara (2018). Thus, it has shown that the trend of Bitcoin is a matter of concern in 
term of money laundering.  
While previous research mostly examines the risk and vulnerabilities of the cryptocurrency 
with criminality in the European and Western countries, I intend to examine the risk and 
 2 
 
vulnerabilities of the Bitcoin in Cambodia, a country located in Southeast Asia. Likewise, while 
most of the superpower countries have shown a positive attitude towards the Bitcoin and have 
decided to take control of the risk, most of the Southeast Asian countries have only released letters 
of warning. Furthermore, even the warning letter has been published by the head of the central 
authority; the investors are still involved with the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. This paper 
will be of benefit to the regulators, investors and scholars, and for the countries which are 
considering controlling or prohibiting cryptocurrency.   
The purpose of this paper is to describe the relationship between Bitcoin and money laundering 
through various countries’ experience. In particular, the researcher will study the countries which 
have regulated and banned cryptocurrency, analyze whether the risk of the money laundering is 
increased or decreased, and then draw assumptions. Consequently, this paper is a modest attempt 
to explore the likely impact of cryptocurrency on society and banking sector by determining if it 
should be regulated or banned and if it is an opportunity or a trait for money laundering.  
Furthermore, researcher aim to draw attention to Cambodia. 
The central concerns that researcher wish to examine are the history-line of the countries that 
have decided to regulate and prohibit, and the reasons behind the regulation, the trend after the 
implementation of the regulation, and whether the structure of Bitcoin, which does not require the 
identity of the owner is related or unrelated to the money laundering. This research is based on 
secondary data which are available on the KDI Library and K-Developedia1.

 Research Problem and Questions 
The current trend among government and regulators is interestingly related to the regulatory 
of cryptocurrency for anti-money laundering purpose. As a result, some countries have decided to 
regulate or ban cryptocurrency, and some countries in Southeast Asia such as Cambodia, the 
government has not decided on the inclusion of cryptocurrency in the financial system. So, it is 
worthy to ask whether Cambodia should regulate or ban cryptocurrency;   if cryptocurrency is an 
opportunity or a trait for the criminal; and the impact of cryptocurrency regulation on Anti-Money 
Laundering.  
 Research Objectives 
This paper aims to:  
- Explore the impact of cryptocurrency regulation on anti-money laundering based on 
country experience;  
- Draw lessons for other countries which are in the middle of the two extremes (regulate and 
prohibit); and  
- Make an observation whether Cambodia should regulate or ban cryptocurrency exchange. 
 The significance of the study  
This study will provide insights for the regulator, policymaker and financial industry leaders 
who want to get a better understanding of the regulation of cryptocurrency and the illicit finance 
risks arising from cryptocurrency as well as to formulate ways to enhance anti-money laundering 
compliance among cryptocurrency businesses. Moreover, this research will be helpful for 
countries which are considering making regulations on cryptocurrency.

CHAPTER I: OVERVIEW OF MONEY LAUNDERING AND CRYPTOCURRENCY 
A. Cryptocurrency, Digital Currency and Virtual Currency 
Currency means the money that serves as the national currency accepted by the government 
and people in its own country. Currency or money serves three functions such as the medium of 
exchange, store of value, and unit of account (N. Gregory Mankiw, 2016). Nevertheless, people in 
the developed countries rarely use money or cash for payment; the use of modern technology of 
payment such as visa or debit card are common (Runnemark, Hedman, and Xiao 2015). 
Interestingly, Cryptocurrency, digital money and virtual currency in the current technology of 
payment are misunderstood by many people. As a result, Bitcoin is a non-central bank digital 
currency and it is a new method of payment that uses peer-to-peer review and cryptography to 
secure financial transaction. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency created by a group of unidentified 
people called Statoshi Nakamoto (2008). Bitcoin is the anonymous group of people’s digital 
currency. Virtual currency is the currency that uses in the virtual life. It serves as a method of 
payment in online games, i.e., Pokemon game. Gamers use virtual currency for making a purchase 
in the game. Likewise, some other virtual game also accepts Bitcoin for in-game purchase such as 
World of Warcraft and Second life (Marsden, 2015). As a result, cryptocurrency, digital currency, 
and virtual currency refer to the same form of electronic payment.  
a. How Does a Bitcoin Work?  
Bitcoin is the latest technology of electronic payment that allows a user to send and receive 
Bitcoins as a payment instead of using a financial institution as an intermediary. The blockchain 
is a heart of Bitcoin. Likewise, it is an accounting ledger for the Bitcoin users since the user can 
perceive and verify every transaction on the blockchain (Nakamoto, 2008). Since the Satoshi 
Nakamoto created Bitcoin, it is not only a new technology innovation tool for payment, but it is 
 5 
 
also for trading. The Bitcoin or cryptocurrency exchanges are around the world so does the traders. 
Thereby, the price of Bitcoin raised like a skyrocket. The Bitcoin trader can get Bitcoin by two 
choices: (1) using a computer to mine Bitcoin; and (2) buy at the Bitcoin or cryptocurrency 
exchange market (Bitcoin, 2018).  
b. Bitcoin, the Perspective of the Policymakers across the Globe    
There are also growing arguments about the definition and function of the cryptocurrency in 
general or Bitcoin in particular. According to Satoshi Nakamoto (2008), Bitcoin serves as online 
payment based on cryptography. Most of the policymakers and regulators across the globe have 
been concerned about the regulation of the Bitcoin, after the skyrocketing increase in the price of 
the Bitcoin from its initial launch till now.  Policymakers and regulators are mostly concerned 
about the recognition and regulation without loophole; they want to make sure that Bitcoin and 
other Cryptocurrencies do not involve with criminal activities, cause financial risk, and create tax 
evasion. Likewise, in order to know more about the regulation of the policymakers and the 
regulators across the globe, the table below is brief information on Bitcoin regulation of randomly 
selected countries (Table 1).

Table 1: The brief information on the regulation of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies 
Country The Regulation 
Australia 
Australia’s government treats Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies as a commodity. Every transaction involves 
paying taxes and a report has to be filed if there is any 
suspicious transaction regarding laundering money to the 
regulator (ASIC, 2018). 
Belgium 
According to the report by the Law Library of Congress (2018), 
the Belgian Finance Minister has not thought about the 
further regulation of the cryptocurrency since they found out 
that Bitcoin did not present any problems with the price stability. 
Bolivia 
The central bank of Bolivia banned all the cryptocurrencies 
which were not issued by the central authority (Luther, 2017). 
Canada  
 
The Canadian Revenue Agency treated Bitcoin as barter 
under the anti-money laundering and counter of financial 
terrorism law and regulation by November 2013 (Ursula, 2014). 
Cambodia 
There has not had official banning or regulating Bitcoin and 
other Cryptocurrencies in Cambodia. National Bank of 
Cambodia, the Securities and Exchange Commission of 
 7 
 
Cambodia and the General-Commissariat of National 
Police released a joint warning statement that all 
cryptocurrencies in Cambodia are illegal because this 
propagation is not regulated by competent authorities and may 
cause potential risks (NBC, 2015). 
China 
The government of China has banned all the cryptocurrencies 
and not recognized as legal tender; the government also 
cracked down all the activities which is related to the 
cryptocurrencies in order to protect customer and prevent 
financial risk (Ursula, 2014). 
Colombia 
Bitcoin is not banned in Colombia, but it will not get legal 
recognition. Colombia’s Government determined Bitcoin as 
legal but neither a currency nor security (Legal,  2018). 
Iceland 
Residents in Iceland can own Bitcoin by mining, but not 
allowed to buy Bitcoin through Bitcoin exchange market. 
Likewise, the State of Iceland claimed that they decreed the 
banning of Bitcoin (Tatar, 2018). 
India 
The Reserve Bank of India has considered Bitcoin as illegal 
while the Finance Ministry in India was investigating the 
 8 
 
legalization and the regulation of the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 
(Kevin, 2017). 
Japan 
The Payment Services Act in Japan has already regulated the 
cryptocurrency exchange market since April 2017 (Ursula, 
2014).  
Laos 
The Central Bank of Laos has published a letter of warning 
against the use of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies (The 
Financial Time, 2018). 
New Zealand 
The regulatory on the Bitcoin moves slowly. Currently, there 
has not had any actions regarding regulating or banning 
Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies (RICHARD, 2018). 
Malaysia 
The central bank of Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia, has 
not recognized all cryptocurrency including Bitcoin. The 
central bank also warned the public about the associated risks 
with the Bitcoin (SALLEH BUANG, 2017). 
Mexico 
The Mexican Government banned Bitcoin after Ecuador and 
planned its own cryptocurrency following the structure of 
Bitcoin (Christina, 2018).  
 9 
 
Poland 
 
According to the Central Statistics Office of Poland, Poland 
has officially treated Bitcoin as an economic activity after 
Poland’s executive agency dealing with Polish Prime Minister 
(Shivdeep, 2017). 
South Korea 
South Korea’s government banned and cracked down the 
unidentified Cryptocurrency exchanges, anonymous traders 
and foreigner that involved with Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies (Gregor, Stuart and Hunter 2017). 
Thailand 
Thailand is the country that has back and forth experience with 
cryptocurrency market. In the past five years, Thailand was the 
first country in Southeast Asia that forced to shut down of the 
largest exchange market in the region, Bitcoin.co.th. in July 
2013, thereby becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to 
prohibit Bitcoin. However, in February 2014, Thai Official 
suddenly allowed the Bitcoin exchange market to reopen in 
order to use and trade Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies 
(CYBERIUS, 2018) 
Vietnam 
The State Bank of Vietnam, released a banning statement to 
the public that Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are not 
lawful means of payment (Simon, 2017). 
 
 10 
 
In addition, the governments and regulators across the globe have different perspectives 
regarding the regulation of the cryptocurrency exchange. Some countries prohibit, others consider 
it as a commodity, and others have no action. Meanwhile, it is fascinating that no matter how the 
government and regulators think about Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies and whether it is 
considered illegal or legal, the cryptocurrency exchange market operation is still active as shown 
in figure 1; the market cap of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies across the globe since April 2009 
to August 2018 through Coin Market Cap, Cryptocurrency Exchange Market Operation (2018).

c. Advantage and Disadvantage of Cryptocurrency 2 
Since the price of the cryptocurrency has fluctuated from the less than 5 cents per Bitcoin to 
more than 1,200 USD per Bitcoin, policymakers and academics have turned their attention to the 
reason behind this modern technological innovation. Some of these concerns are listed below:    
 Advantages of Bitcoin  
Transparency: it claimed that all the Bitcoin transactions are available in the blockchain. It is 
called shared public ledger for Bitcoin; the entire Bitcoin depends on the blockchain. It allows 
users to verify the transactions. It is the most attractive part of Bitcoin. So, by sharing record book 
together, it is believed that Bitcoin is the most transparent. 
Security: Bitcoin depends on blockchain and use the 256-bit which is designed by the U.S 
National Security Agency. The owner of the wallet has to make mathematical proof in order to 
protect their Bitcoin, so it means that no other can get the key to lock the wallet beside the owner. 
It is a cogent comment on the security of Bitcoin (Bunjaku, Gjorgiev and Miteva 2016) 
Lower transaction cost: Bitcoin is proving the lowest transaction cost than others. The average 
cost of Bitcoin is at 1% compared to 2-4% for the others like Paypal or Western Union (Say, 2014). 
Anonymity: Bitcoin is well-known by obscuring the identity of the users (Nakamoto, 2008).  
 
                                                          
2 According to the Coin Market Cap (2018), the world cryptocurrency exchange market operation 
shows that there were more than 1,500 of different cryptocurrencies including bitcoin on July 2018. 
Bitcoin is ranked number one following by Ethereum and XRP as third. Likewise, this research is 
focused only bitcoin. So, this information is referring to the only bitcoin. 
 12 
 
 Disadvantages of Bitcoin:  
Instability: Bitcoin has been very unstable throughout the trading history. In particular, the 
volume and the price of Bitcoin have been increasing rapidly in overall. If we compare the current 
price with the initial price, we would see the enormous growth (Coinmarketcap, 2018). However, 
the volume and price of the Bitcoin dropped immediately after the peak, i.e., according to the coin 
desk Bitcoin price index (Sinclair, 2018), the price of Bitcoin reached 17,549.67 per Bitcoin on 
December 11, 2017 at the peak;  two months later, the price of Bitcoin dropped to 7,964.42 on 
February 5, 2018. This showed the extreme instability of Bitcoin, just only in two months, the 
price of Bitcoin decreased by 120%. For this instability in price, the buyers and sellers will face 
the problem of verifying the price per Bitcoin in every transaction because the price of one Bitcoin 
always unpredictably increases and decreases. 
Lack of replicability: it is an actual thing of every Bitcoin user. The users of Bitcoin must have 
storing place for their Bitcoin whether from mining or buying. It is in particular called wallet. 
According to Bitcoin Organization (2018), the Bitcoin’s wallet includes desktop, hardware, 
mobile, and web. The users have to select one wallet to store and to make the transaction with 
Bitcoin. Likewise, the simplifying a complex problem of those wallets is about the losing. The 
owner of Bitcoin must make the security for their own. It can be a file on a computer or a mobile 
application. If the users lost the file or phone, then their Bitcoin is completely gone forever. It is 
very risky because all digital currencies hide the identity of the users, so when you lose your wallet, 
you will not get it back (ASIC, 2018). 
Hacking: this is a real concern regarding the cryptocurrency as it can be stolen or hacked by a 
computer hacker. The potential point is not on the blockchain but the cryptocurrency exchange 
market operation. Hacking is the sign for money laundering (Richet, 2013).     
 13 
 
Deflation: Bitcoin cause a deflation due to finite money supply (Mazer, 2015). 
Tax evasion and money laundering, the disadvantage of the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies 
are the core concerns of this research and will be discussed in the next following (section d and e) 
and Chapter III.  
d. Cryptocurrency: a new tool for laundering money  
Bitcoin is a virtual currency that most internet players use for making payment in the virtual 
game. Moreover, Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that is accepted in the virtual game, the 
other cryptocurrencies also going well in gaming activities. Consequently, Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies are believed as new tools for criminals to launder money. As a result, Bitcoin 
and other Cryptocurrencies already served criminal such as: 
 Blender  
Fergal and Martin (2013), Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are created for avoiding the 
central authority which makes it hard for the government to make specific regulations. They also 
claim that criminals used to mix money from more than one person with Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies for concealing the particular owner of them as well as it is hard for the regulator 
for searching the belonging, interestingly, when they mixed the money with Bitcoin which the 
transaction hid in the blockchain. Sara Ruiz Cabrera (2016), also states that “A ‘mixer’ is efficient, 
e.g., keeps hidden laundered money, when it has a lot of subscribers” (p.27). 
 Deep Web or Invisible Web 
Deep Web or Invisible Web is a portion of the internet which is not accessible in search engines 
like Google. Sara, Ruiz and Cabrera (2016), illegal information is storing in Deep Web; 
government and other cooperation data also appear in Deep Web. As a result, Deep Web is not 
 14 
 
only for the illegal grounds; it is also for legal purposes. Likewise, José Luis Espinosa, an expert at 
ABC NETWORKS (2015), claims that approximately 90 percent of current internet pages are 
Deep Web, and the Surface Web or Visible web only constitutes around 10% or 15% (Figure 2). 
 
Figure 2. Surface Web Vs Deep Web 
Source: (Sui, Caverlee, and Rudesill 2015) 
- What is the relationship between Deep Web, Cryptocurrency and Money Laundering? 
Trend Micro (2015), states an interesting fact on the internet’s hidden side and on how the 
criminal takes advantage by creating a place for selling illegal goods and services. He refers to 
Silkroad, the biggest black online market website that provides illegal goods and services. It was 
created in February 2011 for global trading illegal goods; the drug is one of the products. The 
Silkroad is hidden in the deep web; however, the users can access via TOR3 (Barratt, Ferris, and 
                                                          
3 Tor is a browser on the internet that allows the user to browse the Web anonymously.   
 15 
 
Winstock, 2014). The interesting fact is about the payment method in Silkroad. Cryptocurrency is 
accepted in this black market. The buyers use Bitcoin to purchase illegal products and they also 
call Silkroad as cryptomarket. According to Cabrera (2016), the US Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) closed down and arrested the founder of Silkroad on October 2013 after the 
FBI agent played a trap for buying cocaine at Silkroad market by using USD 7,000 in Bitcoin for 
a kilo of cocaine. The letter published by the FBI (2013), states that “the government’s 
investigation has revealed that, during its two-and-a-half year in operation, Silk Road has been 
used by several thousand drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of 
leukograms of illegal drugs and other illicit goods” (p.6). The report shows that the Silkroad market 
generates an equivalent to USD 1.2 billion for selling and around USD 80 million in commission. 
Likewise, the price of Bitcoin plummeted after the closure of the Silkroad black market, as shown 
in Figure 3.

e. Money Laundering and Bitcoin in Different Countries 
 Money Laundering & Bitcoin ATM (United Kingdom)  
The process of money laundering with Bitcoin ATM: one Bitcoin user, defined as person A, 
used to be under the influence drugs controlling made deposits frequently to the Bitcoin ATM. 
Person A also used the machine with multiple other subjects. This is believed as a money 
laundering process through Bitcoin ATM by National Crime Agency (NCA)-United Kingdom 
(Egmont, 2018). 
 Movement and Laundering of Funds using a Bitcoin ATM (United States) 
As we know that Bitcoin ATM or Kiosk allows the users to deposit money for the Bitcoin and 
vice versa. As a result, one of the Kiosk operators in the United States reportedly deposited cash 
300,000 USD roughly. The money smelled/smelt of marijuana. (Egmont, 2018). 
There were also twelve suspicious transactions related with DeepWeb Market and illegal 
Bitcoin exchange market reported by a Bitcoin Kiosk operator in the Eastern United States 
(Egmont, 2018). 
 Tax Evasion and Virtual Currency Exchange (Latvia) 
As we know that the government of Latvia has accepted cryptocurrency and taxed them 
(SunnySolomon 2018). However, the tax evasion has found later by the Office for Prevention of 
Laundering of Proceeds Derived from Criminal Activity; it pointed out that the Bitcoin exchange 
service that got an approval from the government for Bitcoin trading in Latvia registered in another 
country for avoiding taxation (Egmont, 2018). Both trader and cryptocurrency exchanges did not 
pay personal income tax and capital income tax. Besides, the working group of Egmont also 
 17 
 
pointed out that other regulations of Latvia also received defrauded funds and transferred to other 
accounts that subject for a bank account for Bitcoin and other financial transactions. 
 Laundering Proceeds and Bitcoin ATMs (United States)  
FinCEN, through cooperation with law enforcement, is aware of at least two instances of street 
level drug dealers using Bitcoin kiosks to purchase Bitcoin, which were subsequently used to 
obtain drugs on Darknet markets. Narcotics were eventually shipped to the dealer through the mail 
and sold on the street. The two drugs dealers buy Bitcoin via Bitcoin kiosks. The regulators believe 
that they will use Bitcoin to buy drugs on Darknet markets (Egmont, 2018).

 Illicit Activity Drug Trafficking Involving a Cryptocurrency Exchange (New Zealand) 
The Australian citizen, called person A, bought Bitcoins approximately NZD 5,000 amount 
six times per month. Person A also received significant profit from selling Bitcoin but did not 
make payments to Inland Revenue. This believed by the typology associated with the two 
suspicious transactions. First, person A is performing as an intermediary by buying Bitcoin from 
the cryptocurrency market abroad then person A makes a request and receives payment from 
customers into their bank account. When the fund is legitimate, person A will transfer Bitcoin from 
his wallet to his customers’ Bitcoin’s wallet. This was believed that drug dealing. Likewise, New 
Zealand Police Financial Intelligence Unit found out that banking account of the person A involved 
with many deposits transaction that related with the drug and unknowns deposit (Egmont, 2018).

B. What is Money Laundering? 
a. The Origin of Money Laundering 
 As a basic concept, the activities including transferring cash in or out of the country, making 
shell business, buying mental and precious staff that is easy to move and transfer are the methods 
 19 
 
that criminals use to perform money laundering (Schroeder, 2001). Allowing the criminal to 
unfettered payout and investment by the American Mafia has caused anxiety about the criminal 
and the state. Meyer Lansky, the most financially successful gangster in American history, buys 
real estate and legitimate business in order to block out the original source of fund (Matsuda, 
2007).  Meyer Lansky and another group of gangsters shown their legitimate profit by mixing the 
illicit earnings from illegal activities with gambling, extortion, prostitution and bootleg liquor. This 
is believed as the origin of the money laundering.  
b. Money Laundering Methods 
 The most important goal of a criminal is to generate the profit without being caught by the 
regulators. Criminals use many ways of cleaning the dirty money. However, the commons ways 
of laundering the dirty money remain in three stages: (1) Placement: is the process that criminal 
use financial institution by trying to inject illicit fund, deposit massive amount of money is one of 
the examples; (2) layering: is the way that criminal use to hide the original source of fund by 
diversifying dirty money to other financial institutions, transferring and buying financial products 
are the layering activities (3) integration: is the final stage that criminal use to integrate fund to the 
legitimate financial markets (Utvik, 2004). 
Besides these three principle methods, criminals still have plenty of schemes for laundering 
money. As a result, criminals are very diverse and vary in character. The table below is the process 
taken by the criminal to laundering money.

c. The Impact of Money Laundering on Society 
Naturally, money laundering is the convention of transforming black money into white money 
by the criminal. It has a very negative impact on the economy. If one country does not have law 
and regulation for combating money laundering, it seems like that country is encouraging people 
to conduct illegal activities. On the other hand, tax evasion is the first concern related to the money 
laundering. As we know, the government gets income by requiring tax payment from the public. 
Moreover, taxation or fiscal policy is a significant tool for the national government for 
controlling the economy in the short run, and monetary policy is under the monitoring of the 
 21 
 
central bank (Dr. Econ, 2002). The flow of dirty money from one country to other countries in 
terms of cleansing money is causing tax evasion. As a result, the government suffers from losing 
money and having harder control of the economic situation (Rui and Greens, 2013). Besides tax 
evasion, money laundering is threating economic and political stability by making volatile on the 
interest rates and exchange rate including inflation rate (Yikona, 2011).  Kumar (2012), 
ignoring money laundering creates a depression on economic growth by causing the diversion of 
resources to the less productive areas of the economy. Apparently, money laundering is illegal; 
this is entirely misdeed since money laundering is the activities that make crime pay.  According 
to Alweendo (2005), states that “money laundering has the potential to erode the political and social 
systems of a country and could affect stability and the general rule of law” (p.2).  
C. What is the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)?  
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is a law-enforcement agency at the national level that has an 
exclusive right to access all the relevant financial information. FIU is the result after the negotiation 
of the United Nations Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic 
substances in the mid-1980s (Aninat, Hardy, Johnston 2002). The purpose of FIU is to receive and 
analyze suspicious cash transaction reports, oversee the reporting entities, financial institutions, 
and ensure that FIU’s laws and regulations are being followed and complied.  FIU can be different 
in name by countries, but it has the same goal: ensuring that the criminal does not use the financial 
system for laundering the dirty money. Likewise, the final step of the FIU is to freeze the money 
or asset if it emanates from the criminal, and report to the police and other law-enforcement 
agencies. FIU is the body under the international organization called Financial Action Task Force 
(FATF). FIU must follow FATF recommendations in order to make standard laws and regulations 
in a country. 
 22 
 
 What is FATF? 
FAFT is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 during the G-7 summit in Paris. The 
essential goal of FAFT is to set the international standards of the anti-money laundering and 
financial terrorism around the globe. FATF serves as the policy-making body to generate the 
necessary political will to the regulators around the globe. FATF also promotes the effective 
implementation of legal, regulatory and other related policies to ensure the integrity of the 
international financial system. FAFT has developed a series of recommendations with the purpose 
of setting the standard for preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Moreover, 
FATF also cooperates with TJN-Finance Secrecy and US International Narcotics Control Strategy 
to ensure the financial system around the world comply with the Anti-Money Laundering and 
Countering of Financial Terrorism standard by contributing 65 percent to the evaluation process 
made by the Basel Anti-Money Laundering Index4 report. There are also 37-member countries 
under the FAFT regime. It includes two regional organizations representing the most dominant 
financial centers in all parts of the globe, as shown in Table 3.

CHAPTER II: LITERATURE REVIEW 
In this section, I will conduct the literature review on the relationship between Money 
Laundering and Cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was published on October 31th, 2008 by the 
anonymous person called Satoshi Nakamoto (2008). He pointed out that Bitcoin created for online 
payment allows the user to make payment without involving with the financial institution as the 
third party. Bitcoin is the most famous among cryptocurrencies. According to Coin market cap 
(2018), there were more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies in the cryptocurrency market platform by the 
end of April 2018. The first record of the Bitcoin’s price after nine months of launching was 0.08 
per Bitcoin (GRAF, 2014) then it was incredibly increased more than 1,200 USD per Bitcoin in 
2013 (Carter, 2017). According to Jaffee (2018), everyone can use Bitcoin without any concerns; 
they only need to have a mobile phone or computer which can access the internet. He says that in 
particular, an owner of Bitcoin has full responsibility of the risk; he/she could spend Bitcoin 
anytime and anywhere without involving any centralized authority. He also believes that Bitcoin 
will create a convenient and healthy economy in the future. In contrast, Jens Getreu (2015) asserts 
that the process offered by Bitcoin network in order to make payment without the requirement of 
national identity, and the way that Bitcoin network allows the user to transfer amount of Bitcoin 
as a payment, are useful signals for the criminal to launder dirty money. As a result, he claimed 
that Bitcoin is a trait for the future economy. Similarly, studies on the impact of the Bitcoin have 
shown that Bitcoin is considered the most used method by criminals for laundering dirty money 
(Rueckert 2016; Christopher 2014; Singh 2015; Carvalho 2011). Likewise, in the European 
countries, the connection between money laundering and Bitcoin are broadly discussed (Bryans 
2014; Cabrera 2016; Singh 2015). Bryans (2014), wrote an article about the way that criminals use 
technology to laundering money by mention the Bitcoin as a tool for laundering while Cabrera 
 25 
 
(2016), examined the relationship between money laundering and Bitcoin in European Country. 
Signh (2015), on the other hand, believes that Bitcoin causes the risk of money laundering to 
increase, so he aims to propose a refined regulatory framework to deter money laundering in 
Bitcoin. 
While previous researches have shown only the relationship between money laundering and 
Bitcoin in European Country, researcher intends to examine the same relationship of money 
laundering and Bitcoin in Cambodia which is located in Southeast Asia. Researcher intends to 
make observations for Cambodia whether Cambodia should regulate or ban Bitcoin.  What is the 
impact of Bitcoin on anti-money laundering in Cambodia? Then, researcher will consider the 
contemporary context and debate on the relationship between money laundering and Bitcoin in 
Cambodia. 
Correspondingly, before proceeding, it is necessary to know about the situation of money 
laundering and Bitcoin in Cambodia. According to Basel Anti-Money Laundering Report in 2016, 
with the weak financial sector, the lower of jurisdiction system and the pain of corruption, 
Cambodia ranks in third “highest-risk” country out of the total 147 countries in term of money 
laundering risk. In the same vein, US State Department’s 2016 International Narcotics Control 
Strategy report gives the full scope of money laundering risk, ten over ten because money 
laundering has been classified as a central concern in Cambodia.  
Moreover, Kunmakara (2017) concludes that cash-based dollarized economy lead 
vulnerability to money laundering in Cambodia. He also includes porous borders and inadequate 
oversight of casinos at border frontiers which are the good sign for criminal activities. 
Furthermore, Lewis (2013) and Di Certo (2012) claim that Cambodia is a right place for laundering 
money since the financial transparency and banking sector are deficient.  Due to the contemporary 
 26 
 
context above, it is clear that Cambodia is in need of a sharp improvement in money laundering 
prevention. So, should Cambodia regulate or ban Bitcoin?  
The purpose of this research does not focus on the relationship between money laundering and 
Bitcoin around the globe. Instead, this research is primarily focused on money laundering and 
Bitcoin in Cambodia. In particular, the researcher aims to analyze the trend of the countries which 
regulate and ban cryptocurrency, whether the risk of the money laundering is increased or decrease, 
and then draw an assumption. Consequently, this paper is a modest attempt to explore the likely 
impact of cryptocurrency on anti-money laundering whether cryptocurrency should regulate or 
ban and is it an opportunity or a trait for money laundering? Furthermore, the researcher aims to 
draw attention to policymakers in Cambodia whether Cambodia should take control or prohibit 
the cryptocurrency.

CHAPTER III: CASE STUDIES ON REGULATIONS OF VIRTUAL CURRENCIES 
There are several significant reasons that the researcher decide to research and examine these 
three countries. Firstly, the researcher takes Australia due to the availability and accessibility of 
the data. Australia’s government take the intense action and regulation on the cryptocurrency 
exchange. Secondly, the researcher chooses China due to the reason that China’s government is 
very protective of the outside technology. Likewise, China’ government prohibit everything 
related to the cryptocurrency and plan to create own cryptocurrency. So, this is a chance to study 
the story of the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies in China. Thirdly, the researcher prefers South 
Korea because the Korean Won is the third largest currency exchange in cryptocurrency exchange 
in the world.         
A. AUSTRALIA 
a. Introduction 
Australia is located in the continent of Oceania. This country has more than 24 million 
population with a surface land area of 7,682,3000 km2 (Australia, 2018). According to the World 
Bank Data (2018), the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was 53,799.94 US dollar in 2017. 
Australia’s economy depends heavily on coal and iron exports which are estimated around 29 
percent of the total export goods and services in 2014-2015. Concerning of technology innovation, 
Australia is not far different from other countries. Cryptocurrency exchange market is growing 
well in Australia so do the investors (Coinmarketcap, 2018). Like many other countries, the 
Australian government is concerned about this financial trend; it has done several actions regarding 
the regulation of the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.  
 28 
 
According to Buchanan (2018), the regulatory approach to the Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies has been considered by Australia government in the past few years. Since 2015, 
The Senate has been reviewing existing legislation and discussing with relevant agencies about the 
risk of money laundering and tax evasion related to Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.  This has 
started after the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) treated Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies as 
commodities and all the transaction s regarding these digital currencies as barter.  
Firstly, ATO has passed new laws and regulations about the tax treatment on the Bitcoin and 
other Cryptocurrencies which all the transactions which are related and considered about the tax 
revenue. Secondly, the Senate claimed that all the currency exchange business or cryptocurrency 
market must be under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering of Terrorism Financing 
(AML/CTF) legislation (Buchanan, 2018). Likewise, the regulator requires all businesses which 
are related with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies register with the regulatory body that 
implements AML/CFT. The regulation also requires the members to follow the financial 
regulation, consumer protection, and payment system regulation. Besides, the Australian Senate 
and ATO, the Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) also published guidance 
regarding the risk of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.  
Finally, it can assume that Australia decided to regulate the cryptocurrency market based on 
several grounds; the two main reasons, however, are (1) tax evasion and tax income and (2) 
AML/CFT. 
 
 
 29 
 
b. The Trend of Cryptocurrency Regulation in Australia 
 The Australian Parliament’s Senate Economic References Committee 
On August 2015, Australia Senate Economic References Committee published a report about 
the creation process of regulation on digital currency, the vital impact of the Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies on Australian Economy, and the benefit that Australian can take from the digital 
currency. The report was generated from public hearings, survey, and the delegation meeting 
abroad. Public hearings were conducted in order to develop an effective regulatory system.  
 The Australian Taxation Office (ATO)  
On 20 August 2014, ATO published a tax treatment on Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies as 
a draft and finalized on December 17, 2014. They ruled that all the transactions involving Bitcoins 
are barter arrangements and have similar taxing processes. The ATO also did not recognize digital 
currency as money or foreign currency. ATO treated Bitcoin and digital currency as asset for the 
incoming tax purpose (ATO, 2018).  
ATO published the ruling regarding on the digital currency as follow: 
 GSTR 2014/3— Goods and services tax implications of transactions involving with digital 
currency. 
 TD 2014/25—Income tax: is Bitcoin a 'foreign currency' for Division 775 of the Income 
Tax Assessment Act 1997 
 TD 2014/26—Income tax: is Bitcoin a CGT asset for Subsection 108-5 of the Income Tax 
Assessment Act 1997 
 TD 2014/27—Income tax: is Bitcoin trading stock for Subsection 70-10 of the Income Tax 
Assessment Act 1997 
 30 
 
 TD 2014/28—Fringe benefits tax: is the provision of Bitcoin by an employer to an 
employee for a fringe benefit on the purposes of subsection 136 of the Fringe Benefits Tax 
Assessment Act 1986. 
 The Reserve Bank of Australia  
Currently, the Central Bank of Australia does not regulate Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies. Generally, the Reserve Bank Act is based on the Payment System (Regulation) 
Act 1998.  
 The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC)  
ASIC does not consider Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies or digital currency as financial 
products and has published on its website the risks of the digital currency.   
 Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) 
Australia’s government remains concerned about Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.  It is 
very protective of any vulnerabilities and risk that may come from the cryptocurrency exchange 
market operation with banking and the remittance services due to the exchanged for fiat currencies, 
or vice versa. Australia’s government is concerned about 'closed loop' economy. As a result, the 
regulatory oversight has been appointed with the AML/CFT regime.36 and also under the 
monitoring of AUSTRAC, Australia's AML/CTF regulator. Likewise, every cryptocurrency 
trading by Australian citizens and foreigner have to report to International Funds Transfer 
Instructions (IFTIs) if the trading meet or exceed the threshold AUD 10,000 and other relevant 
currency that provide cryptocurrency exchanges. Moreover, form suspicious matter reports if 
reporting entities find any crime-related financial activities.  
 31 
 
c. The Situation of Cryptocurrency Exchange Market in Australia  
Risks and vulnerabilities are still hard to prevent even though Australia’s government have 
taken several actions on Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.  In 2017. There were more than 1,200 
complaints from investors in Australia regarding the Bitcoin scams (Hobday, 2018), and 1,289 
complaints about the lost in cryptocurrency exchange market operation equal to $1,218,206. As a 
result, Australian government and other related regulators (2018) reissued a warning letter to the 
public. A few months later, AUSTRAC called for the regulation of all the cryptocurrency exchange 
market operations and other activities that serve service for exchange Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies to real money and vice versa.  This aims to protect the investors and Australian 
citizens from losing money with the cryptocurrency exchange market operation, strengthen the 
anti-money laundering system, verify customers’ identities, and maintain records (Palmer, 2018). 
The following is the summary of AUSTRAC’s regulation on the cryptocurrency exchange 
market operation: 
 forming a regulatory procedure on 3 April 2018. 
 Providing only six weeks for the relating business with cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency 
exchange market operation for registration from 3 April to 14 May 2018 (Australia 
Government claims as a policy principles period).  
 Preventing the money laundering risk and terrorist financing for this regulatory by 
determined the risk-based approach on the services related to Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies, the transaction they made, investor’s profile.  
 The critical keys that AUSTRAC wants to implementation are: 
- Register (cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses) 
 32 
 
- Conduct a risk assessment 
- AML/CFT 
- Require reporting form all the entities (all the suspicious transaction, threshold 
transaction: more than 100,000 USD or equivalent to AUD and the compliant 
regarding with AML/CFT transaction). 
B. CHINA 
a. Introduction 
As we known China is a country that has a population of more than 14 billion (Worldometers, 
2018). According to the World Bank (2018), GDP in China keeps increasing from 309.488 billion 
in 1985 to 12.238 trillion in 2017. Likewise, China contributes around 14% of the total World 
GDP (2018). China’s economy is proliferating every year. Consequently, its technological 
capacities are interestingly growing. However, the Chinese government implements censorship on 
the Internet called the “Great Firewall” (Branigan, 2012). As a result, the popular social media 
such as Google, Facebook and Whatsapp are banned in China (SLC, 2018). The Chinese 
government does not allow their people to interact with the outside media technologies because 
they are non-Chinese in content and language. The government also wants to control the 
information by blocking all the non-Chinese websites that providing news or other information, 
i.e., The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and other most influential news 
websites (Bradsher, 2012; Taibi, 2014). Furthermore, new technology innovations for payment, 
Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies are banned in China (Hays, Stoeferle, and Valek 2017). Hence, 
the government has taken serious steps regarding the regulation of Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies by cracking down all activities and businesses related to this digital currency. 
China has halted operations of financial institutions and websites which serve as exchange market 
 33 
 
platforms for Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies  (Central Global, 2018). Dawkins (2018), the 
People’s Bank of China (PBOC) also released a statement to block all domestic and foreign 
cryptocurrency and including initial coin offering5 (ICO).  Accordingly, China’s central bank has 
already announced that they will establish their digital currency in the future.  
b. The History of Cryptocurrency in China 
 2013 
In pre-2013, China’s government did nothing regarding Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies 
trading. However, in December, the central bank of China with four other financial regulators 
released a discussion letter about the risks and vulnerabilities of cryptocurrency after the increasing 
number of scams and related crimes (Bloomberg, 2013). Thus, PBOC treated all the 
cryptocurrencies as a virtual commodity. The government permitted the public to make any 
transactions with cryptocurrency at their own risk (Panda, 2013). 
 2014 
The governor of PBOC released a statement that Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies will not 
be forbidden as Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies are treated as tradable commodities which do 
not harm the economy (Robin 2014; Pete, 2014). This has resulted in a dramatic rise of the price 
of Bitcoin to more than 18%.  
 
 
 
                                                          
5 ICO is the process of borrowed money to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies 
 34 
 
 2016 
Because of the cost-reducing advantages of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, the PBOC 
planned to establish their digital currencies. This idea comes from China’s struggle in capital flow 
and Yuan depreciation (Wendy, 2016).  
 2017 
On September 4, 2017, the PBOC with other six regulators6 from the central government 
released a statement warning the public about the financial risk from the ICO and stated that ICO 
is illegal. In that time, the central government also ordered the regulators to close down the Bitcoin 
exchange market operation or platform (Leng, 2018). 
 2018 
In January 2018, China’s internet-finance regulator guided the government in its crackdown 
of the businesses related with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies trading, including Bitcoin miners 
and domestic Bitcoin exchange platforms (Hsu, 2018). Apparently, these are due to several 
concerns such as fraud and money laundering (Bloomberg, 2013). However, even if Bitcoin and 
other Cryptocurrencies are banned in China, trading still continued. The investors in China use the

method by switching to foreign exchanges. Likewise, in order to protect other investors and 
financial institutions, PBOC had prohibited the financial institutions from all the activities relating 
to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies trading.   
c. The Current Situation of Cryptocurrency Exchange Market in China 
According to the statement issued by PBOC and the seven regulators from the Chinese central 
government, the Bitcoin exchanges in China is officially banned from converting legal tender into 
cryptocurrencies and vice versa. It is related to ICO rules. Moreover, it also prohibits all businesses 
that offer Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. The government has closed all websites, and online 
that fail to comply, remove the applications from application stores, or even suspend the platform’s 
business licenses.  
d. Case Study: Hacking Cryptocurrency Wallets in China  
Hacking is a criminal activity. It is a kind of activity in which an anonymous person breaks 
into other computer systems without permission and steals information, data, and documents for 
other purposes (Aseef et al, 2005). If we talk about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, the word blockchain 
comes after. The blockchain is a new technology innovation for storing data (Economist, 2015). It 
is decentralized and open for Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies users. Bitcoin is 100 percent 
dependent on blockchain since all of the transactions are recorded in blockchain (Investopedia, 
2018). It is also called accounting ledger or bookkeeping. Blockchain has been trusted and treated 
as the fastest and the safest for storing information Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies 
(Nachiappan, Pradan, Sanjeev and Vignesh, 2016). However, criminal still finds a way to access 
with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies by hacking the cryptocurrency exchange market platform.  
The total amount of Bitcoin reaches up to 21 million, and currently, it reached 80 percent of the 
total Bitcoin (Redman, 2018). As a result, if you want to be an owner of a Bitcoin, you have to 
 36 
 
spend more than 5 hours on mining from your computer. In the past, mining for one Bitcoin takes 
less than 1 hour, but since the price of Bitcoin keeps increasing, mining of Bitcoin has also become 
more difficult. Secondly, due to the current situation, most people still use cash and card for 
payment. Using Bitcoin as a method of payment is not yet common in some countries. Investors 
mostly buy and sell Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies at cryptocurrency exchange market 
platform. Likewise, they gain profit from buying Bitcoin at the lower price and sell at the high 
price. So does the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency’s price is volatile every day. These are the 
reasons why Bitcoin is not safe for the investor and can be used for money laundering. Hacker or 
criminals hack investor’s account and buy or sell the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies with the 
different price for their interest and purpose. They sometimes hack to the cryptocurrency exchange 
market platform to conduct transactions.  
On 20 August 2018, three hackers hacked into many accounts of the cryptocurrency user in 
cryptocurrency exchange market operation in China. The total money lost in this case was around 
600 million yuan which was approximately 87 million USD (Das, 2018). The Xinhua, China’s 
state-owned press agency, stated that these three men have stolen Bitcoin, Ethereum and other 
cryptocurrencies for the last six months which equal 100 of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies. 
C. SOUTH KOREA 
a. Introduction 
Heavily devastated by the Korean War, South Korea was among the poorest countries in the 
world during the 1950s (Robert, 1980). However, South Korea’s economy has seen a remarkable 
improvement. GDP per capita has grown from USD 158.237 in 1960 to USD 29,742.839 in 2017 
(World Bank, 2018). The most interesting part about South Korean economy was a five-
year economic plan by President Park Chung Hee.  He wanted to transform South Korea 
 37 
 
from the agriculturalist to industrialist. As a result, South Korea has transformed itself from one 
of the poorest countries to the eleventh largest powerful economic country in the world (CIVIC, 
2018). The rapid development in South Korea is unprecedented in world history. Interestingly, 
within the last four decades, the economic situation in South Korea is becoming stronger and 
stronger; South Korea’s Economy has been named as a high-tech industrialized country. 
Conglomerates such as Samsung, Hyundai, and Kia are the core of South Korea’s economy, 
exporting their products abroad. The Korean society is also moving forward. Most of the Korean 
citizens use credit or debit card and other electronic forms of money for payment than cash and 
coins. Yoon (2016), the central bank of Korea plans to create the cashless society in 2020. 
Simultaneously, Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies also became attractive to Korean investors 
and foreigners in South Korea. Consequently, the South Korean Won is ranked third after US and 
Japan for the most Bitcoin purchasing (Gregor, 2017). Nonetheless, the South Korea government 
still believes that using Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are illegal activities which cause illicit 
behaviors and harm the market. Therefore, South Korea’s government prohibited Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies in order to monitor the speculation and the non-controlling of the volatile in the 
market.   
b. The story-line of regulatory on cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea 
 2017 
On September 2017, South Korea’s Financial Service Commission (FSC) or Financial 
Supervisory Commission, checked up all the Cryptocurrency exchange markets operation and the 
businesses that provide ICO. FSC checked cryptocurrency exchange that provides ICO because 
South Korea’s exchange market is becoming overheated and has led to criminal deception. FSC 
also claimed that the banning of initial coin offering is in the consideration (Gregor, 2017). 
 38 
 
On December 2017, FSC was moving hard on making the proper regulation on the 
cryptocurrency exchange market operation by calling an emergency meeting with the related 
regulators and officials. That time, the Office for Government Policy Coordination (OGPC) has 
drafted taxation on the capital-gain from the Cryptocurrency exchange market operation. The 
primary purpose of the OGPC is to draft new law and regulation to monitor the financial system; 
however, the drafting does not require a timeline. According to Kim and Steven (2017), besides 
imposing taxation, the government also plans to prohibit high school students and foreigners in 
Korea to be involved with cryptocurrency exchange market operation.    
 2018 
On January 30 2018, the Vice Chairman of FSC, entirely banned the anonymous trading 
account on the domestic cryptocurrency exchanges. For instance, foreigners and minors are 
absolutely prohibited from involving with domestic cryptocurrency exchanges in Korea. Even if 
they already had account, they cannot increase their money to buy new cryptocurrencies (Kim, 
2018). Therefore, all the cryptocurrency traders have to change virtual accounts to real-name in 
their bank since the regulators required the cryptocurrency exchange market operation to provide 
customer information to the bank to share trader’s data. Likewise, the banks have to dismiss the 
virtual accounts that do not match name within the banking accounts. This guideline immediately 
became active a day after the announcement by the Vice Chairman. As a result, most of the existing 
virtual account was shut down. Informing about the enormous amount of withdrawal or deposit 
which are exceeding 20 million won per week to the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KOFIU) 
was mandatory for the banks as set by the FSC (Kim, 2018). This is for the prevention of money 
laundering. FSC also announced that sections would be given to non-complying banks because 
FSC wants to crack down on the growing speculative trading of crypto-assets by the public and 
 39 
 
this is a boundary created by the government for instance foreign injecting in cryptocurrency 
exchanges7 in South Korea. On the same day, NH Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, Shinhan Bank, 
Kookmin Bank, Woori Bank, and Korea Development Bank also launched an ID verification 
system for adult citizens to create new cryptocurrency account, while all the existing 
cryptocurrency accounts at exchanges are prohibited from trading (Christine and Kim 2018).  
c. The Current Situation of Cryptocurrency in South Korea 
After the guidelines released by the FSC, most of the founders of the cryptocurrency exchange 
market in South Korea have sanguine perspective to following the FSC as well as the regulators. 
Likewise, Julian Hosp, the co-founder and the president of the cryptocurrency start-up Tenx, 
claims that this was a good idea for cracking down on the some anonymous and the illegal use of 
the cryptocurrency (Ming, 2018); he also claims that “if, afterwards, investors and companies have 
more legal security working in the ecosystem, it's going to have some short-term downsides, but 
long-term, it's going to have a really, really big boost,"" (p.1). However, it was fascinating, as we 
already know that the Korean Won is the third currency which purchases in the cryptocurrency 
exchange market operation. The government has implemented laws and regulations in order to 
protect the financial system and prevent any risk of money laundering. Unfortunately, there are 
two most prominent cases of hacking in cryptocurrency exchange market operation in South Korea 
after the government released a regulation on the cryptocurrency exchange. Coinrail, the 
cryptocurrency exchange market in South Korea, lost USD 40,000,000 due to the hacking; and the

own by internet giant Kakao, partner with Industrial Bank of Korea while Cryptocurrency 
Exchange Coinone, partner with NH Bank (Ramirez, 2018). 
 40 
 
biggest cryptocurrency exchange market operation, Bithumb, was hacked on 20 June 2018 
(Wilmoth, 2018). Some of the cryptocurrencies valued about USD 30,000,000 were stolen. 
Because of this, all the accounts were transferred to cold wallets to prevent further losses.  
D. Overall Evaluation  
After examining the case studies of the storyline on the regulation process of cryptocurrency, 
the cryptocurrency is very popular for the investors and the regulators. Similarly, the regulators all 
around the globe have the different perspective regarding the regulatory procedure of this new 
technology innovation. Most of the countries have the negative perspective on the cryptocurrency 
as a new tool for money laundering. Correspondingly, Australia, China, and South Korea take 
several regulations on the cryptocurrency due to the three critical functions such as AML, financial 
stability and tax evasion and refer to table 4. The central bank of Australia does not recognize 
Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies as a national currency or foreign currency while ATO treats as 
commodity for the purpose of incoming tax. Australia’s government published law and regulation 
on the activity related with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency and controlling by the AUSTRAC 
and ATO published law and regulation related with the requirement tax on Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies. Similarity, the central bank of China does not treat Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies as currency; instead, China’s government prohibited all the activities related with 
Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies such as cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency businesses, 
and ICOs. China’s government wants to protect the financial and banking system, and the most 
important thing is that China’s government wants to create their own cryptocurrency.  Last but not 
least, the central bank of Korea does not recognize Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies as currency. 
The FSC of Korea takes serious regulation on banning all the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency 
exchanges but for the illegal cryptocurrency exchanges only. Correspondingly, Korea cracked 
 41 
 
down on the some anonymous and the illegal cryptocurrency exchange; also, banning the foreigner 
for involving with Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Likewise, the primary purpose of Korea’s 
government is similar to other countries; AML, tax evasion and financial protection are the core 
reason. So, it can be included that whether regulate or prohibit on the cryptocurrency exchange, 
the government and the regulator have the same perspective on the regulation. As a result, the 
government and regulator in every country want to protect their country from money laundering 
risk and for the financial protection. However, it can be assumed that no matter of regulation that 
government and regulator set on this new technology innovation, the risk of money laundering still 
happened. Hacking is existing, i.e., in Australia, after the government and other regulators studied 
and public a proper law and regulation to response the regulation on the cryptocurrency, the 
hacking happened and so did the complaint about the scams on the Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies. The hacking also happened in Korea. The investor in Korea is suffering from 
losing the huge amount of money after the government regulate on the Bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrency exchange. This show that the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency had a significant 
and powerful effect that every regulator and investors cannot protect and predict.

CHAPTER IV: OVERVIEW OF CAMBODIA, CAMBODIA FINANCIAL 
INTELLIGENCE UNIT, AND MONEY LAUNDERING RISK 
A. Background of Cambodia  
Cambodia is located in the Southeast Asia. Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam are neighboring 
countries with the population around 15 Million on the total land 181,035 km2 (Report, 2018). 
Cambodia is one of the developing nations in the world due to the decades of civil wars from 1970 
to 1990s. Especially, the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979. The Khmer Rouge government 
arrested, tortured, and killed the government official, scholar and many people. Khmer Rouge 
regime destroyed infrastructure, building and many governmental offices. This regime was 
ruthless and unusual punishment. The total suffering of the Cambodian is nearly four years. After 
the Khmer Rouge regime collapsed on 7 January 1979, Cambodia Economy was starting from 
zero. Cambodia has tried to develop many infrastructures from that suffering. The government has 
put many affords on many spheres that are ranging from the politic, administration and economic. 
As a result, by the supporting of government and citizens, Cambodia’s economic and many other 
sectors have grown dramatically. Even Cambodia was suffering from the war, and the economic 
is growing over the last decade. GDP grew at average over 8 percent from 2000 to 2017 and 
expected to remain strong around 7 percent this year (2018).  Cambodia started to use free market 
economy system in 1986 after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc and the reform of 
Vietnam’s economic policy, Doi Moi (Chhair and Ung 2015). Likewise, Cambodia joins with 
international economy to enhance country’s economic growth and development such as ASEAN 
community, World Customs Organization (WCO) and World Trade Organization (WTO). 
Consequently, Cambodia joins other international organization for enhancing the standard of law 
and regulation such as Egmont group, Asia Pacific group and others.    
 45 
 
B. Cambodia Financial Intelligence Unit (CAFIU) 
a. Background 
Cambodia financial intelligence Unit is an independent decision-making body under the 
National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) and the permanent secretariat of NBC. CAFIU was established 
in early 2008 due to comply with the international standard in order to AML/CFT. The mainly 
responsible of CAFIU is to protect Cambodia financial system from the use by the criminal to 
laundering dirty money and deny the supporting of terrorist activities. In the same fashion, CAFIU 
has assigned to receipt the suspicious transaction reports and cash transaction reports for evaluating 
and investigating whether the financial system in Cambodia is the matter of money laundering or 
use by the criminal (NBC_CAFIU, 2018).

C. Money Laundering Risk in Cambodia 
According to Basel Anti-Money Laundering Index report (Basel, 2017), Cambodia is ranked 
third over 174 countries as the high-risk country of money laundering and terrorist financing in 
2012. Comparing with neighbor countries Cambodia was the high-risk country. However, by the 
hardworking of the CAFIU team, Cambodia’s rank in Basel Anti-Money Laundering Index moved 
from third over 174 countries to ninth over 174 countries in 2017 (Basel, 2017). There are 14 
indicators for conducting the final result of the overall score. Consequently, in order to evaluate 
risk, each indicator is giving the zero as the low risk and ten as the high-risk and using a weighting 
scheme based on a qualitative expert assessment as show in figure 7 (Basel, 2017).

D. The Perspective of Centre Authority about Money Laundering in Cambodia  
How is Bitcoin in Cambodia? Deputy Governor of National Bank of Cambodia, Sum Sannisith 
provided a speech on the occasion of the 1st semester conference and targets for the 2nd semester 
of the year 2018 of National Bank of Cambodia that Cryptocurrency is popular because the lack 
of decentralized of the financial sector with the high interest of the hack and fraud. He also stated 
that “We cannot replace money with Cryptocurrency due to the lack of scalability and lack of 
guarantee of finality; cryptocurrency will have a significant and powerful effect to the conventional 
monetary and it will affect the financial sector” (p.1) (NBC, 2018). So, in order to protect the risk 
of cryptocurrency, the deputy governor asserted that the regulator should follow the Basel 
Committee. In the same vein, Director-general of National Bank of Cambodia, Chea Serey claimed 
that as a central authority in terms of banking and regulation, Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies 
which are not backed by the government are not recognized as a currency. The poor financial 
technology literacy and the lack of online law and regulation are the matter of concerns in 
Cambodia (Kunmakara, 2017).  She also asserted that “As a financial instrument they are high-
risk. We, as the financial authority, have not yet understood all the risks, so we all must be careful 
when accepting digital coins instead of physical currency,” (p.2). Even there is no official ban, 
NBC, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia and the General-Commissariat of 
National Police released a joint warning statement that all cryptocurrencies in Cambodia are illegal 
because this propagation is not regulated by competent authorities and may cause potential risks 
(NBC, 2015). The competent authorities wanted to know the public to be cautious of the 
cryptocurrencies which did not get the license from the competent authorities. However, even the 
letter of warning has been published, investors in Cambodia still find the way to involve with 
cryptocurrency (Coinmarketcap, 2018). Thus, the number of cryptocurrency businesses are 
 50 
 
snowballing well in Cambodia. Likewise, the exchange market operation is existing; LockCoin is 
the first and well-known Cryptocurrency exchange platform in Cambodia which is accepting a 
variety of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, while 
KHCoin and K-Coin are the first homegrown cryptocurrency (Times, 2017). In addition, NBC is 
not yet banned neither regulated the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.

CHAPTER V: CONCLUSION, IMPLICATION, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR CAMBODIA 
After reviewing the definition of the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin by the regulators in different 
countries, the researcher assumes that most of the country have the negative aspect on this new 
technology innovation. Some countries prohibited while some countries regulated cryptocurrency. 
Some countries set up their policy and regulation based on different diagnoses on the nature of the 
cryptocurrency or digital money and mainly focusing on the negative side of this modern 
technological breakthrough. They place different weights on the aspects of financial soundness 
(risk issue). Moreover, the risk of money laundering, the non-controlling of the volatile in the 
market, the dangerous in financial system, tax evasion and other negative hypes. However, if a 
financial instrument should be regulated due to the negative aspect or its riskiness and possibility 
of abuse for money laundering, should the equity stocks be regulated in the same fashion as the 
Bitcoin because they are risky and can be used for money laundering? The answer is yes; stock 
trading is regulated in a certain way, but differently from the regulation on the cryptocurrency. So, 
the regulators should not think only the bad side of the cryptocurrency; the positive view of the 
Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are highly recommended.   
Offering an efficient means of payment, providing intermediary of transaction, exchanging for 
commodities and services are the intrinsic value of the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. As a 
result, Bitcoin or cryptocurrency will be reached in the future by its intrinsic value.  
Similarly, in Cambodia, before we can response the question whether Cambodia should 
regulate or prohibit Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies; the regulators should broaden the 
perspective on this new technological innovation as we see an elephant as a whole rather than 
looking it piece by piece, trunk, legs or tail. So, when the regulator finds out the intrinsic value of 
 52 
 
the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, the regulators will know the appropriate policy to promote 
such positive role while preventing or minimizing the negative side.  
As a result, the researcher would like to make implications and suggestions for Cambodia. 
According to the overview of Cambodia, CAFIU and money laundering risk in Cambodia in 
Chapter IV and the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency, researcher would like to suggest that 
Cambodia should regulate cryptocurrency rather than prohibition. Firstly, it refers to the intrinsic 
value of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies; researcher believe that it will be fruitful in the future. 
Secondly, based on the reviewing about the global perspective of cryptocurrency and the case 
studies on the regulatory system; Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies should regulate rather than 
ban. Lastly, it depends on the money laundering risk in Cambodia. According to Chapter IV, 
Cambodia is ranked ninth over hundreds countries as a high-risk countries one the money 
laundering. This result due to the weak of the financial sector and the low of jurisdiction system. 
So, it is the best chance for Cambodia to take control of the regulatory on the Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies rather than prohibit. The loophole will happen if there is no regulation on the 
Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. It would be better for Cambodia, if Cambodia has a law and 
regulation to monitoring Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. It can be assumed as a method to 
prevent risks and vulnerabilities with Bitcoin in the future.   
In addition, Cambodia’s regulator should regulate this new technology innovation. According 
to the case studies in Chapter III; the following is the suggestion for Cambodia to considering, 
studying and preparing. 
 
 
 53 
 
The implementation and suggestion for Cambodia 
 Definition of Cryptocurrency 
The regulator should broadly define the definition of the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies 
by conducting a public survey from the organization and individual which are involving with this 
new technology innovation.  
 Cambodia Financial Intelligence Unit (CAFIU) 
- Cambodia’s government should assign a regulatory body to take control; following the 
case of South Korea, Cambodia’s government should give the opportunity to CAFIU 
to takes responsibilities. CAFIU is very suitable for this position. 
- Establishment or amendment the law and regulation on Anti-Money Laundering 
including the regulation and guideline on the Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies.  
- Calling the cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses to register with CAFIU and 
require to follow the AML/CFT obligation including: i-/ Identify and verifying the 
identities of the creator of the cryptocurrency exchanges and traders, ii-/ Require 
reporting form all the entities if the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies involving with 
the physical currency meet or over the threshold limit (CAFIU should determine the 
threshold limited) and form the suspicious report regarding with AML/CFT transaction 
and iii-/ keeping certain records.  
- Determination the risk-based approach on the services related to Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies, the transaction they made, investor’s profile.  
- Conduct a risk assessment and onsite visiting. 
- Forming a group to study on the trend of this new technology innovation whether the 
Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies cause other risks to the financial sector.  
 54 
 
 Others 
- Cambodia’s government should implement law and regulation which are related to the 
internet activities including the online activities involving with Bitcoin and other 
Cryptocurrencies.

Abstract
The current global financial market is witnessing the activation of cryptocurrency as 
a payment instrument and a means of accumulation. However, the risks of money 
laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion that cryptocurrency transactions im-
ply lead to the need to implement their state regulation, an important component of 
which is tax control.
Therefore, the purpose of the article is to substantiate the value orientations when 
forming the system of cryptocurrency transactions tax control in Ukraine taking the 
positive experience of developed countries into account. The scientific results of the 
study consist in the emphasizing structural, functional, systemic and institutional ap-
proaches to understanding tax control, which became the basis for identifying the fea-
tures of cryptocurrency transactions as a tax control object.
It was revealed that the lack of personalization of the agreement parties, the relatively 
high level of information security, free international turnover and a decentralized pay-
ment system are the factors of the cryptocurrency market further development. On 
the other hand, this leads to the loss of tax revenues for Ukrainian budgetary system, 
taking into account the forecasted trends in the development of the cryptocurrency 
market by 2022 through methods of sums, least squares and expert estimates. Given 
the institutional approach to the understanding of tax control, an institutional struc-
ture of the cryptocurrency transactions tax control in Ukraine is proposed.
It is established that domestic state institutions are able to carry out tax control over 
these transactions. It is also determined that introducing fiscal control will result in the 
receipt of additional revenues by budgets, reduction of shadow economy, counterac-
tion to cybercrime and terrorism financing.
The practical importance of the results is in the need to form an effective system of 
cryptocurrency transactions tax control as a function of public administration.
It has been determined that transactions on cryptocurrency supply, on the determin-
ing exchange rates and transactions on cryptocurrency disposal should be an object of 
tax control in Ukraine. Mining transactions, receipt of income (profits) in the cryp-
tocurrency are subject to general taxes, depending on the taxpayer’s legal status, in 
particular, personal income tax, corporate income tax and a unified social tax (UST). 
Taking into account the EU recommendations on the non-application of value added 
tax in the cryptocurrency transactions taxation, it is not appropriate to implement it 
in this area. Establishing tax control over cryptocurrency transactions will expand the 
powers of state authorities that are empowered to control observing financial discipline 
by economic agents in Ukraine and the financial capabilities of state and local budgets.

INTRODUCTION
Under the international trade intensification, cross-border capital 
movements and the information technology development, a gradual 
transformation of financial systems towards the use of electronic money 
is taking place. Currently, the world financial market is witnessing the 
circulation of cryptocurrency as a payment instrument and accumula-
tion means, which is due to the benefits for financial services consumers 
and a decrease in confidence to state institutions and, in particular, to

traditional financial intermediaries. The cryptocurrency development makes an innovative foundation 
for the transforming financial services market, creating new opportunities for investment, lending, insur-
ance, payments and money transfer. At the same time, the mechanism for the cryptocurrency transactions 
includes the risks of money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion. This necessitates their state 
regulation, an important component of which is tax control, which has recently been intensified in devel-
oped countries. Shaping the system of cryptocurrency transactions tax control and defining its objects and 
subjects will provide institutional modernization of the domestic tax system, increase the possibilities of 
the state and local self-government bodies to finance social and economic programs through additional 
tax revenues and working against negative phenomena such as shadow economy and cybercrime.
1. THEORETICAL BASIS
The analysis of Ukrainian scientific literature indi-
cates the lack of attention to cryptocurrency trans-
actions as a tax control object. At the same time, it 
allows for the emphasizing structural, functional, 
systemic and institutional approaches to the gen-
eral idea of tax control. Within the first approach 
(structural), tax control is considered as a kind of 
state financial control aimed at ensuring compli-
ance with tax and other legislation by taxpayers, 
identifying, eliminating and preventing tax of-
fenses (Melnyk & Leshchukh, 2015, p. 21) at the 
controlled object (Lopatovskyi & Demchuk, 2016, 
p. 115). As a result, the country’s economic securi-
ty is maintained (Baranovskyi, 2017).
Vasiuk (2015), Maryniv (2016) and Proskura 
(2014) are the functional approach representatives. 
With that, attention is drawn to the fact that fill-
ing the budget through full and timely payment 
of taxes and fees (Vasiuk, 2015, p. 89), as well as 
observance of the legislation on cash flow regula-
tion, settlement and cash operations, patenting, li-
censing and other legislation, the control of which 
is entrusted to supervisory authorities (Proskura, 
2014, p. 265) are the main objectives of tax control.
Tax control within the system approach is under-
stood as the multidimensional inter-sectoral sys-
tem of supervision of state controlling bodies on 
the financial and economic activity of taxpayers 
to provide the specified level of budget and set it 
in accordance with the current legislation require-
ments (Koretskyi, 2010). As an element of the tax 
administration system, tax control contributes to 
the development of measures to counteract tax 
evasion, the system of fines for violating tax laws 
(Shuba & Khymych, 2016, p. 137). Shevchuk (2012), 
Nasypaiko and Samsonova (2012), Ihnatyshyn 
and Troshchak (2014) support the institutional 
approach. According to this approach, tax control 
is the activity of the tax service officials to oversee 
the compliance of accounting of taxation objects, 
methods of calculating and paying taxes and tax 
payments with the current normative and legal 
documents, detecting tax offenses and defining 
their impact on tax liabilities. Given that, tax con-
trol includes organizational, methodological, an-
alytical and effective measures for the controlling 
bodies (Ihnatyshyn & Troshchak, 2014, p. 161). On 
the one hand, this is the basis for meeting fiscal 
obligations to the budgets of all levels. On the oth-
er hand, the institutional approach to understand-
ing tax control ensures:
• harmonization of interests of tax relation 
subjects;
• minimization of tax risks for all national 
economy subjects; and
• raising the tax culture of society.
Achieving these goals results in the modernization 
of both the activities of the State Fiscal Service of 
Ukraine and the actualization of taxation objects 
in accordance with changes caused by the finan-
cial technology development and the intensifica-
tion of globalization processes triggering the cryp-
tocurrency market development. The inclusion of 
cryptocurrency transactions in the tax control ob-
jects depends on domestic approaches to state reg-
ulation of the cryptographic market. Lansky (2018, 
p. 22) outlines six approaches to the regulation of 
cryptocurrency markets in individual countries:
• level 0 – ignoring;
• level 1 – monitoring;
91
Banks and Bank Systems, Volume 13, Issue 2, 2018
• level 2 – recommendation;
• level 3 – management;
• level4 – regulation;
• level 5 – interdiction or integration. 
However, there is an opinion on the existence of a 
liberal, conservative, and repressive models of reg-
ulating virtual currency schemes and an expecta-
tion model (Volosovych, 2016, pp. 72-73). Within 
the liberal and conservative regulatory models, 
the law provides for the presence of taxation ob-
jects, which stipulates:
• increase in state budget income; and
• avoiding financial flows in the cybercrime 
world that promote money laundering from 
cybercrime.
The preliminary determination of the cryptocur-
rency legal status, which belongs to virtual curren-
cies is the basis for the taxation of cryptocurren-
cy transactions. In February 2015, the European 
Central Bank proposed to consider the cryptocur-
rency as a digital representation of a value not is-
sued by a central bank, a lending institution or an 
e-money institution, which in some cases could be 
used as an alternative to money (European Central 
Bank, 2015). It has following features: fictitious 
currency without the official offer status; lack of 
proper regulation; issued by non-financial private 
companies; recognition, as a rule, only by specific 
virtual companies; lack of fixed offer and guaran-
tee of money return; insufficient control of oper-
ations (European Central Bank, 2012). Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF) has a similar approach 
to understanding the cryptocurrency. Features 
of the virtual currency as a means of turnover 
were emphasized: means of payment; means of 
accumulation, though without the legal payment 
means status (FATF Report, 2014).
The first attempts to determine the legal status of 
cryptography in Ukraine were made in November 
2014 by the National Bank of Ukraine, which de-
termined the cryptocurrency as a money surro-
gate without the possibility to use it as a payment 
means on the territory of Ukraine. In October 2015, 
this approach was changed when the National 
Bank of Ukraine has expressed interest in new 
cryptocurrency payment services, which have 
prospects of entering the domestic market subject 
to their safety. In October 2017, the Verkhovna 
Rada of Ukraine considered the bills “On the 
Cryptocurrency Turnover in Ukraine” (2017) and 
“On Stimulating the Market of Cryptocurrency and 
Their Derivatives in Ukraine” (2017). According 
to Article 1 of the draft Law (On Stimulating the 
Market of Cryptocurrency and Their Derivatives 
in Ukraine, 2017), cryptocurrency should be con-
sidered a financial asset for the purposes of legal 
regulation. Proposals come to imposing a tax on 
buy and sell transactions in the amount of 2% to 
the Pension Fund. At the same time, cryptocur-
rency mining transactions will also be subject to 
taxation, the size of which will depend on the en-
tity’s organizational form, which can be both indi-
vidual entrepreneur and legal entity.
The authors of the bills (On the cryptocurrency 
turnover in Ukraine, 2017; On stimulation of the 
market for cryptocurrency and their derivatives 
in Ukraine, 2017) propose to implement tax con-
trol of cryptocurrency transactions at the level of 
financial institutions that provide services on the 
cryptocurrency market. It is proposed to oblige 
such institutions to simultaneously execute the 
client’s request for the purchase/sale (exchange) 
of cryptocurrency, to charge and retain the fee for 
compulsory state pension insurance against the 
transaction amount, to keep a tax record of such 
transactions and to report to the Pension Fund 
bodies. However, most likely, this will lead to vir-
tual money market participants looking for other 
ways to convert the hryvnia into a cryptocurrency, 
or vice versa, possibly through European finan-
cial markets, where such transaction fees are not 
collected.
For example, in the United Kingdom, since 2014, 
cryptocurrency is recognized as a means of pay-
ment, and special tax regulations are not appli-
cable to transactions with their use. In 2013, The 
Danish Financial Supervision Authority stat-
ed that cryptocurrencies are not recognized as a 
means of payment, so there is no need to regu-
late them at all. In France, the taxation of cryp-
tocurrency transactions begins with a margin 
of 5,000 euros, which is justified by the need to 
92
Banks and Bank Systems, Volume 13, Issue 2, 2018
allow citizens first to try to invest and develop 
a business with this type of assets before taxing 
(Kuznetsov &Yakubov, 2016). However, in some 
countries, the taxation of cryptocurrency opera-
tions is being introduced, and mechanisms for tax 
control of the above-mentioned objects are being 
developed. These countries include Sweden, the 
USA, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Norway, 
Canada and others (Volosovych, 2016, p. 72).
Developing a tax control mechanism for crypto-
currency transactions will facilitate the identifica-
tion of entities, objects and a subject of transaction 
in a digital currency. As a result, this will allow 
determining what tax rate to apply to a particular 
cryptocurrency transaction and establishing com-
pliance or violation of the law on the cryptocur-
rency market by economic actors.
An analysis of the foreign experience of using 
tax audit tools shows that in France, tax control 
is carried out as tax declarations and documen-
tary checks. While in the United Kingdom, the 
USA, Japan, Canada, and Germany, tax assess-
ments are differentiated to check tax returns, au-
dit, and tax/criminal investigations (Shevchuk, 
2013). In Ukraine, tax control is carried out in 
terms of checks, revisions, investigations, super-
vision and inspections (Law of Ukraine “On the 
Basic Principles of State Supervision (Control) in 
the Sphere of Economic Activity”, 2007), but still 
the list of tax control objects remains unclear to a 
full degree, which becomes the reason for nondis-
closure of some uncontrolled cash flows associated 
with public administration (Bardash & Baraniuk, 
2016). This necessitates the harmonization of the 
interests and objectives of tax control participants.
Therefore, the purpose of the article is to substan-
tiate the value orientations when forming the sys-
tem of cryptocurrency transactions tax control in 
Ukraine taking the positive experience of devel-
oped countries into account.
To achieve this goal, the methodical techniques of 
quantitative and qualitative system analysis of the 
financial and economic development of the cryp-
tocurrency market, which consist in the study of 
state tax control in this market in the system of re-
lations arising between state and private economic 
entities; retrospective and comparative analysis of 
the capitalization of the most common cryptocur-
rencies; and methods of comparison and general-
ization were used. Also, forecasting methods were 
used to substantiate the expediency of tax control 
on the cryptocurrency market. Forecasts of the 
cryptocurrency market development are based 
on the methods of sums, least squares and expert 
estimates.
The forecast by the sum method was calculated ac-

To calculate the forecast values, information for 
the 2012–2017 period was used, where y is the 
volume of the cryptocurrency market capitaliza-
tion, and x is the period (in particular, the year 
2012 corresponds to the value of “1”, 2013 – “2”, ... 
2022 – “11”). Therefore, a and b are the predictive 
function variables; n and k are the corresponding 
number of periods. The equalities obtained by the 
methods of sums and the least squares allowed to 
determine the value of the forecasted market cap-
italization for the years 2018–2022 and their share 
in the GDP.
Forecast of the cryptocurrency market through 
the expert estimation method is based on the 
Michael Novogratz’s (ForkLog, 2017) statement 
that the cryptocurrency market will reach USD 5 
trillion by the year 2022. Accordingly, the differ-
ence between forecasted capitalization and the sit-
uation on the market at the end of 2017 is divided 
into five equal parts, which are added annually to 
the aggregate sum.

2. RESULTS
2.1. The development  
of cryptocurrency transactions as 
a prerequisite for their taxation 
system
The formation of the cryptocurrency market took 
place in 2008. This was caused by the 2008–2009 
global financial crisis, one of the factors of which 
was the crisis of centralization (Dyba et al., 2014, p. 
316). Nakamoto (2008) is the founder of the crypto-
currency. He considered Bitcoin as a decentralized 
digital currency payment system, consisting of the 
blockchain, open to general use account ledger. It re-
mains the most widespread cryptocurrency, and its 
blockchain technology has begun to be used in many 
industries (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016), in public admin-
istration, in the financial market services, in trade, 
which is influenced by its technological structure. 
Since the Bitcoin appearance, the number of types of 
cryptocurrency has increased and reached approxi-
mately 1.2 thousand types (RBC-UKRAINE, 2018). 
As of January 30, 2018, the market capitalization 
of cryptocurrency in the world amounted to USD 
538.4 billion, with 80% of this amount accounted for 
the top 10 leaders in the rating of digital currencies 
(RBC-UKRAINE, 2018) (Table 1).
As Table 1 demonstrates, four out of top 10 cryp-
tocurrencies in the world by the size of capitaliza-
tion appeared in 2017, which confirms the strong 
development of the cryptocurrency market.
For financial institutions, blockchain technology 
is the most secure way to store information about 
anonymity and confidentiality-based transactions. 
At the same time, its ongoing modernization takes 
place. Thus, the Blockchain 1.0 technology, which 
was incorporated in Bitcoin, was upgraded to 2.0 
version, resulting in the emergence of a new digi-
tal currency, Ethereum, whose principle of oper-
ation lies in the functioning of “smart contracts”, 
excluding the impact of the human factor on the 
transaction and the information preservation. 
Such contracts are concluded between two partic-
ipants (signatories), and a numeric key serves as 
a signature. At the same time, blockchain is the 
guarantor of the agreement implementation, that 
is, if the terms of the contract are observed, both 
parties receive the proper benefits (Ethereum 
Foundation, 2018).
In 2014, the Blockchain 3.0 was announced, which 
became the basis for cryptocurrencies such as EOS, 
Dfinity, Cosmos, Dashta, etc. The advantage, for 
example, of Dash currency compared to Bitcoin, 
is that it has lower energy costs during the mining, 
and absolute anonymity. If bitcoin transactions 
are identified when the wallet owner is detected, it 
is not possible to monitor transactions in the Dash 
system, since their data is not published in blocks.
Most modern types of cryptocurrencies are de-
rived from Bitcoin by modifying its code. However, 
there are cryptocurrencies, for example, Ripple, 
which principles are different from Bitcoin. The 
purpose of this cryptocurrency is to carry out safe 
and fast global financial transactions of any size

without refunds. The main function of Ripple is to 
increase the speed of transactions between bank-
ing operations. Ripple technology is already be-
ing used by large banks such as Bank of America, 
Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation, and 
Western Union. The latter is testing the Ripple 
protocols (ESPRESO.TV, 2017).
Currently, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, BitcoinSash, 
Litecoin are the most common cryptocurren-
cies. As of March 2018, the capitalization of each 
aforementioned cryptocurrency, according to 
CoinMarketCap, exceeds USD 10 billion (Figure 1).
Figure 1 shows that the capitalization of 
Ethereum and Ripple grows faster than that 
of Bitcoin. In particular, in the first quarter of 
2016, the capitalization of Ethereum grew more 
than 12 times, in the first and second quarters 
of 2017 it increased by more than 47 times. At 
the same time, in the third and fourth quarters 
of 2014, the capitalization of Ripple increased 
more than 24 times, and in the second quarter 
of 2017 – by 33 times. Litecoin demonstrated 
the rapid growth in the second quarter of 2017. 
Taking this into account, it can be assumed 
that in the future, cryptocurrencies such as 
Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin will have a larger 
market share than Bitcoin.
The change in the level of cryptocurrency capital-
ization is an expression of public confidence in this 
financial instrument. According to Citigate Dewe 
Rogerson (The Paypers, “One in five British temptn-
ed to invest in cryptocurrencies, study reveals”, 
2018), every fifth adult resident in the UK who nev-
er owned a cryptocurrency would like to buy it by 
2021. It should be noted that the intensive develop-
ment of the cryptocurrency market is more likely to 
occur in developing countries where there is a low 
level of trust in financial institutions and the state 
(The Paypers, “Barclays: crypto, blockchain need to 
be trusted to become truly mainstream”, 2018).
Now the share of cryptocurrency market capital-
ization reaches 0.7% of the world’s GDP and in-
creases annually (Figure 2).
Currently, a number of factors contribute to the 
cryptocurrency market development, including 
the lack of personalization of the parties to the 
agreement, information security, free internation-
al circulation and a decentralized payment system. 
According to Merkle Tree Limited (2018), more 
than 60 countries now intend to completely legal-
ize the cryptocurrency turnover.
Geopolitics, that is, the lack of a formal statement 
on the prohibition of using such assets is the cat-

alyst for the cryptocurrency popularity growth. 
When assessing the real effects of the growing 
popularity of cryptocurrency, one can state about 
its dollar-replacing role in the global financial sys-
tem. The economy dollarization embracing the 
modern world is a consequence of the dominant 
role of financiers of one country over others, while 
cryptocurrency is an alternative asset that can 
freely serve the economic actors: producers, trad-
ers and consumers.
In the last century, the US Congress set a course 
for transferring its role of the world manufactur-
er of goods to China, while for itself, confirmed 
the role of a financial regulator. However, the 
debt of the Federal Reserve System of the USA 
permanently grows. Since 2003, it has exceeded 
60% of the GDP, and 100% as from 2012 (Trading 
Economics, 2018). This debt refers only to debt 
securities of the US Federal Reserve System and 
does not include foreign currency liabilities. It 
should be noted that over the time elapsed since 
the Jamaican Currency Conference, the US dol-
lar devalued for more than 37 times in relation to 
gold, the prime cause of this is its uncontrolled 
emission. This allows the US government to pur-
sue a speculative policy, buying up products and 
raw materials, and pay such purchases through 
almost unsecured money. On the other hand, 
producers of goods and service providers had no 
other way but to sell products for unsecured US 
dollars and subsequently buy unsecured bonds 
from the Federal Reserve System. They did not 
have an alternative mechanism and a real fi-
nancial instrument that would be a world-class 
standard of value. Cryptocurrency provides 
these opportunities.
Currently, cryptocurrencies have integrated in-
to the world economy and their popularity is 
only increasing. The calculations using Bitcoin 
only daily for 2017 range at 1-5 million units, 
which at the rate of May 1, 2018, ranges from 
8.97 to USD 44.85 bln per day (Trade Block, 
2018), which already allows for a hypothesis 
about the possibility of serving at least 11.4% of 
the global GDP.
Under these circumstances, the domestic finan-
cial system requires institutional transforma-
tion, in particular, it concerns the expansion of 
the objects and powers of tax control entities. 
The need for tax control on the cryptocurren-
cy market is that the economy cryptocurrency 
predominance can occur in an environment 
free from regulation, resulting in the national 
currency depreciation and the financial system 
becoming uncontrolled.

2.2. Types of cryptocurrency 
transactions for tax control in 
Ukraine
Blokchain, which is the basis of the majority of 
cryptocurrencies functioning, complicates the 
market participant identification, which helps 
to avoid taxation by business entities and indi-
viduals. At the same time, Qatar University and 
Hamad Bin Khalifa University researchers de-
nied the statement of low retroactive operation-
al security for cryptocurrency. They were able 
to link 100 bitcoin transactions with buyer pub-
lic accounts, while in 20 cases, their real names 
and location were found. At the same time, based 
on the social networks analysis, the researchers 
found that 46 transactions were WikiLeaks dona-
tions and 22– Silk Road payments for drug supply 
(ANO “Innopolis Media”, 2018). On the one hand, 
this can be interpreted as non-compliance with 
the cryptocurrency transactions anonymity, and 
on the other hand, it indicates the possibility of 
controlling cryptocurrency transactions. In 2015, 
British researchers found that the risk of money 
laundering and terrorist financing associated with 
digital currencies is low, although it may grow in 
the future (HMTreasury, 2015). However, already 
in 2017, they emphasized that cybercurrencies are 
closely linked to cybercrime in obtaining a pay-
ment for kidnapping, cyberattacks, acquisition of 
illicit tools and services, money laundering of cy-
bercrime, etc. (HM Treasury, 2017).
On the other hand, the introduction of cryptocur-
rency transactions taxation may complicate the le-
gitimizing cryptocurrency operations in the econ-
omy. However, the liberal model of cryptocurrency 
market regulation, as well as the repressive mod-
el, are found not so often in the world. The Isle of 
Man, the Island of Jersey, Belarus, and Denmark 
are examples of the liberal model, while Algeria, 
Bangladesh, Bolivia, Vietnam, Ecuador, Indonesia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, and Nepal are the repres-
sive model representatives. At the same time, some 
countries abolished the cryptocurrencies interdic-
tion and began developing legislation on their reg-
ulation. This applies to countries such as Malaysia, 
Nigeria and Thailand. Other countries use either a 
wide range of administrative and financial meth-
ods, or use only certain regulatory elements. At the 
same time, a number of developed countries use or 
develop the cryptocurrency transactions taxation, 
in particular, Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, 
Israel, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, 
Singapore, the USA, Finland, and Japan.
From the standpoint of accounting and control, 
cryptocurrency transactions can be divided into

transactions related to the cryptocurrency receipt, 
revaluation and use (Figure 3). This distribution 
is important for crisis management and risk man-
agement in the cryptocurrency portfolio of the en-
tity’s balance sheet (Mazaraki & Kasianova, 2015). 
Accordingly, tax control should be specific to each 
of these groups of transactions.
It should be noted that the greatest attention in the 
implementation of tax control should be given to 
the cryptocurrency receipt operations. Since, once 
they are fixed, it is possible to further track the 
movement of cryptocurrency assets in the econ-
omy. This can be done on the basis of creating a 
database of electronic wallets’ numbers of crypto-
currency owners. As a result, this will give the pos-
sibility for tax authorities to monitor further trans-
actions using such assets. However, there is a risk 
that an entrepreneur may register yet another wal-
let. Therefore, states should be interested in creating 
additional favorable conditions for the digital assets 
circulation, but with increasing control activities.
From the list of cryptocurrency transactions that 
may be tax control objects, it is clear that the tax 
control subject is not the only body, but acts as their 
system. At the same time, depending on the specific 
cryptocurrency transaction, the system of tax con-
trol bodies may change, the competence of which 
will include the need for appropriate control meas-
ures. It should be noted that the control measures 
will also be different, their composition and content 
will be determined by a specific transaction using 
cryptocurrency. Therefore, in order to determine the 
possibilities of cryptocurrency transactions tax con-
trol, it is necessary to disclose their institutional and 
methodological features in terms of revenues, reval-
uations, and the disposal of cryptocurrency assets.
2.3. Determining the possibilities 
for the state tax control 
over transactions with the 
cryptocurrencies receipt and 
disposal
Cryptocurrency transactions on the receipt and 
disposal are characterized by their economic na-
ture similarity. That is, such transactions cause 
a certain movement of cryptocurrencies. In this 
case, it is necessary to distinguish between oper-
ations on the receipt or disposal of cryptocurren-
cies in a content that will affect the taxation terms.
Transactions on the cryptocurrency receipt 
through creating an additional unit of its physi-
cal volume, that is, operations such as mining or 
service, could be an object of the value added tax. 
This is due to the fact that the economic content is 
creating an added value. However, this value-add-
ed tax should be recognized as a liability and pay-
able simultaneously with the creation of a cryp-
tocurrency unit, without obtaining a tax credit. 
However, taking into account the European in-
tegration vector of Ukraine, it is worthwhile to 
abide by the EU tax regulations, where in 2015, 
according to the European Court decision, cryp-
tocurrency transactions were exempted from 
paying value added tax, which had an impact on 
the formation of national legislation in this area. 
However, the legal uncertainty about the need for 
cryptocurrency transactions taxation in Ukraine 
creates barriers to legalizing incomes thus ob-
tained by a country’s population that is an active 
participant in the cryptocurrency mining and 
servicing transactions related to its use. Therefore, 
nowadays there is a need for organizational and 
legal and methodological principles for the imple-
mentation of tax control over the cryptocurrency 
production.
The methodology of hypotheses and violations at 
the organizational-preparatory and technological 
stages of tax audit will ensure compliance with the 
entrepreneurs’ obligation to pay taxes on crypto-
currency extracted. The basis of this should be the 
formation of an integrated system of financial and 
legal norms, which will, on the one hand, facilitate 
the opportunities for deviations from them and 
types of deviations, and, on the other hand, will 
allow the development of mechanisms for their 
prevention. It optimizes the implementation of 
the preventive function of tax control and will en-
sure the recovery of unpaid taxes to the state and 
prevent tax offenses in the future.
A different approach to the cryptocurrency taxa-
tion should be applied to transactions on its pur-
chase and receipt as payments for goods, works, 
and services. The main interest of the tax control 
subjects for these operations should be the possi-
98
Banks and Bank Systems, Volume 13, Issue 2, 2018
bility of a tax levy on the result of such transac-
tions, that is, on the proceeds from the products 
sale.
It may be affirmed that the state should create con-
ditions for the formation of a domestic cryptocur-
rency market, which would provide a legitimate 
way to carry out cryptocurrency transactions. 
This opportunity can be provided by cryptocur-
rency brokers, which actually exist in Ukraine, 
and commercial banks. At present, it is necessary 
to expand the list of transactions that may be car-
ried out by commercial banks, through the per-
mission to trade in cryptocurrencies. Bobyl and 
Dron (2017, p. 87) point up this necessity. In their 
opinion, modern banks should use cryptocur-
rency together with traditional money. Although 
operations using cryptocurrency will be charac-
terized by a high level of investment risk, the use 
of traditional money is also a high financial risk 
(credit, liquidity, and market).
Tax control of cryptocurrency buying/selling 
in Ukraine can be institutionally arranged as in 
Figure 4.
Control of the Accounting Chamber and the 
State Fiscal Service of Ukraine is possible sub-
ject to the preliminary and current financial con-
trol exercised by the National Bank of Ukraine, 
the National Commission for State Regulation 
of Financial Services Markets and the National 
Securities and Stock Market Commission. This 
makes it possible to assert that tax control is 
preceded by the introduction of administrative 
regulatory instruments in the financial control.
Tax control for cryptocurrency transactions 
should be carried out as with other traditional 
currencies. However, according to Article 99 of the 
Constitution of Ukraine (The Law of Ukraine No. 
254k/96-vr, 1996), the domestic currency should 
be the only legal means to conduct transfers and 
settlements to be accepted by all individuals and 
legal entities without any restrictions on the terri-
tory of Ukraine.
The use of cryptocurrency by business entities 
should not be limited, as in the internation-
al trade, cryptocurrency is increasingly used 
to make payments. Therefore, cryptocurrency

agreements should be signed as those in for-
eign currency, that is, with the definition of 
their monetary equivalent in hryvnia, as Article 
533 of the Civil Code of Ukraine (The Law of 
Ukraine No. 435-XV, 2003) specifies. Then, the 
amount to be paid will be determined at the of-
ficial rate of the corresponding cryptocurrency 
to the hryvnia on the day of payment, unless an-
other procedure for its determination is estab-
lished by the agreement. In this case, between 
economic entities within the economic territo-
ry of Ukraine, the circulation of foreign mon-
etary units and monetary surrogates is prohib-
ited in accordance with the Law of Ukraine on 
the National Bank (1999). The only condition 
for the possibility of a cryptocurrency turnover, 
as well as other currencies, should remain the 
right to use them subject to calculations in UAH 
equivalent.
Concerning the purchase/sale of cryptocurren-
cy, these operations must be carried out on an 
organized financial market, through the provi-
sion of banks and cryptocurrency brokers with 
the right to perform cryptocurrency transac-
tions. This will allow expanding the range of 
banking services, will lead to obtaining addi-
tional revenues from banks, receive addition-
al revenues from local and state budgets of 
Ukraine, and reduce the level of shadow econo-
my. In particular, Article 6 of the Decree of the 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine “On the System 
of Currency Regulation and Currency Control” 
(1993) stipulates that foreign currency trade by 
legal entities on the territory of Ukraine is car-
ried out through authorized banks exclusively 
on the interbank currency market of Ukraine. 
While individuals have the right to sell/buy for-
eign currency in banks and other financial insti-
tutions or, through their intermediation, to oth-
er individuals. Accordingly, if cryptocurrency is 
recognized as a foreign currency, its conversion 
will be possible in financial institutions, which 
will increase the demand for such transactions, 
based on the trust and security principles.
To do this, it is necessary to recognize the cryp-
tocurrency transactions as being carried out us-
ing foreign currency, which will lead to econom-
ic benefits for both the state and other economic 
actors in the long run. First of all, such a decision 
will expand the trading opportunities for business 
entities, because they will be able to freely account 
for cryptocurrency, not hiding separate transac-
tions from fiscal authorities. Consequently, it is 
not possible to determine the amount of income 
or expenses in cryptocurrency, as the National 
Bank of Ukraine does not establish a cryptocur-
rency rate and their average commercial rate on 
the Ukrainian market is not set.
For tax control of cryptocurrency transactions, it 
is necessary that the National Bank of Ukraine 
determine the official rate of cryptocurrency in 
terms of the hryvnia on a daily basis, as well as its 
rate on the interbank and inter-exchange crypto-
currency markets. This will allow accounting and 
tax accounting of cryptocurrencies, their revalua-
tion, reflecting exchange differences, and, respec-
tively, exercising tax control.
2.4. Tax control of cryptocurrency 
revaluation transactions
The lack of cryptocurrency market regulation in 
Ukraine does not contribute to the legitimization 
of cryptocurrency transactions in the business 
environment. Business is ready to use it, manage-
ment accounting tools are capable of performing 
accounting, analytical and controlling functions 
for the management of cryptocurrency and liabil-
ities (Mazaraki & Fomina, 2016, p. 50), but there 
is no regulatory document that would allow ac-
counting and tax records. As a result, it is not pos-
sible to exercise tax control over cryptocurrency 
transactions and regulate this market.
The introduction of cryptocurrency legal regula-
tion will necessitate assets revaluation. Such re-
valuation for different dates will result in the ex-
change differences that, in accordance with the 
Regulation (standard) of accounting “21” (Decree 
of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No. 193, 
2000), will be displayed between dates:
• reflecting the transaction in the accounting 
(tax) and the actual calculations;
• reflecting the transaction in the accounting 
(tax) and doing accounting (tax) reporting for 
the reporting period;
100
Banks and Bank Systems, Volume 13, Issue 2, 2018
• preparation of accounting (tax) reporting for 
the previous reporting period and the actual 
calculation;
• preparation of accounting (tax) reporting for 
the previous reporting period and preparation 
of the accounting (tax) report for the report-
ing period.
A significant cryptocurrency market volatility will 
be the cause of the exchange differences. At the 
International Economic Forum in Davos, George 
Soros said that cryptocurrency cannot be consid-
ered a means of preserving value. It is impossible, 
for example, to pay wages to employees if currency 
fluctuations reach 25% per day (Bloomberg, 2018). 
Therefore, the presence of cryptocurrency on the 
balance sheet of an enterprise will lead to signifi-
cant changes in the balance sheet at the reporting 
date, at the date of delivery of products or at the 
date of settlement. Comparing quarterly changes 
in the rate of the most capitalized cryptocurren-
cies (see Figure 1), it should be noted that there is a 
tendency of a simultaneous growth of all curren-
cies rate or, vice versa, decline (Figure 5).
The analysis results presented in Figure 5 show 
that Ripple is the most volatile to time changes. 
This is due to the fact that its emission is controlled 
by the same founders of the project and there are 
no decentralized miners. Bitcoin Cash is also 
more prone to change rate. That is, among the five 
most popular cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, 
Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum) there is no 
one that would be able to maintain exchange rate 
stability.
Cryptocurrency exchanges are now functioning 
in Ukraine, the largest of which are BTC-trade 
(https://btc-trade.com.ua), BTCZoo (https://www.
btczoo.com) and Kuna (https://kuna.io). Moreover, 
the Ukrainian Exchange (www.ux.ua) has become 
the world’s first venue for tradable cryptocurren-
cy derivatives (ForkLog, 2016). This creates the 
basis for the capabilities of the National Bank 
of Ukraine, the National Commission for State 
Regulation of Financial Services Markets and the 
National Securities and Stock Market Commission 
to control cryptocurrency transactions.
Consequently, the growth of the cryptocurrency 
in Ukraine is facilitated by both the external fac-
tors of the cryptocurrencies entry and the internal 
structure of the financial market. Tax control of 
cryptocurrency transactions in the calculation of 
exchange differences is necessary and is possible 
taking into account the number of cryptocurrency 
exchanges on the Ukrainian market.

2.5. Consequences of cryptocurrency 
transactions tax control for 
Ukraine
The introduction of mining taxation, purchase/
sale or other cryptocurrency transactions will 
lead to a change in the cryptocurrency rate, since 
at the present price of a given unit of digital assets, 
there is a cost of their creation and maintenance 
(investment in computing power, risks associated 
with wear and tear, costs for electricity) and the 
desired profit of the computer technology owner. 
At the same time, as a result of taxation, there will 
be three consecutive stages that will significantly 
reduce its rate.
In the first stage, which will start from the date 
of taxation on the cryptocurrency market, its rate 
will increase as the tax will be added to the value 
of the unit, that is, the equilibrium point will shift 
from  to , due to the increase of the direct offer up-
ward in parallel. It means that the physical volume 
of the cryptocurrency market will not expand, but 
only the cost per unit of the digital asset (from  to , 
where T is a tax) will increase, and, as a result, the 
money supply will decrease by the amount of the 
withdrawn taxes ( to ), which will remain at the 
state’s disposal (Figure 6).
In the second stage, the weakening of its rate will 
actually take place at the point on the direct initial 
offer of the cryptocurrency (from 1A  to 2A ) with-
in the newly established volume 1Q . This is due 
to the fact that under such conditions, the trans-
fer of part of the cryptocurrency assets value will 
take place to the state through taxes, the outflow 
of both miners and consumers will be observed, 
due to lower demand for this type of assets. As a 
result, there will be a decline in the rate and physi-
cal volume of the cryptocurrency market.
In the third stage, there will be a need for the state 
to convert the withdrawn part of the cryptocur-
rency through tax, that is, the complete restora-
tion of the physical volume of the cryptocurrency 
market (from 1Q  to 0 )Q . The new equilibrium 
point will move along the direct demand from 2 À  
to 3 . A  At this point, it should be noted that its 
rate will finally decrease, accordingly, its capital-
ization will fall and crises will be expected on this 
market.
In order to prevent crisis phenomena on the cryp-
tocurrency market, countries whose governments 
decide to introduce cryptocurrency transactions 
taxation, should keep the accumulated portion of 
taxes from this market in cryptocurrency.
In determining the market equilibrium subject to 
synergistic effect of tax and administrative control 
(in the part of financial control), rapid decrease

in its price should be noted. Due to the introduc-
tion of the tax, the cryptocurrency market can be 
maintained if the state does not convert accumu-
lated funds from this market to other currencies, 
as this will lead to a significant drop in the cryp-
tocurrency rate.
The aforementioned may also cause miners to 
change their placement, with their computer 
equipment, to other countries where there are 
no such taxes. However, nowadays in Ukraine 
the most favorable conditions for cryptocurrency 
mining among all European countries are created. 
Ukraine occupies the 4th place in the world at cost 
of creating a unit of digital assets (TV Channel 
“24”, 2018). Cost of electricity made the basis for 
calculating the cryptocurrency profitability.
If Ukraine does not regulate the cryptocurren-
cy market now, the current favorable conditions 
will quickly become transformed into the miners’ 
outflow and transferring their capacities to oth-
er countries. This will not only bring the loss of 
potential tax revenues in the budgets, but also the 
loss of solvent consumers in the domestic market 
of goods and services. And this, in turn, will result 
in a surplus of goods in the economy, the econom-
ic downturn and the shadow economy growth.
3. DISCUSSION
The proposed approach to the tax control is based 
on the fact that cryptocurrency transactions serve 
as its object. In this case, state tax control of cryp-
tocurrency transactions should be considered as a 
control over its individual object, the widespread 
introduction of which in Ukraine will provide cer-
tain guarantees to society and business environ-
ment as to the safety and legality of such financial 
transactions with their strengths and weaknesses, 
threats and capabilities.
The strong points of the approach proposed are 
as follows: its compliance with the basic mod-
el of control in management, which will provide 
systematic scientific knowledge of control; iden-
tification of new facilities and control measures, 
which will ensure the coverage of cryptocurrency 
transactions; compliance with international re-
quirements for resisting terrorism financing, cy-
bercrime and tax evasion.
The weaknesses of the study include: fragmentary 
consideration of the research of the tax control ob-
ject and subject, which may have an impact on its 
organization and methodology.
Opportunities include the adoption of nor-
mative legal acts on the cryptocurrency mar-
ket regulation in Ukraine (On Cryptocurrency 
Turnover in Ukraine, 2017; On Encouraging 
the Market of Cryptocurrencies and Their 
Derivatives in Ukraine, 2017), taking into ac-
count the distinction between cryptocurrency 
transactions and those that cause their physical 
volume growth and those aiming at using cryp-
tocurrency; further development of the theory 
and practice of tax control over cryptocurrency 
transactions.
The threat is due to underestimation of the impor-
tance of tax control for the cryptocurrency mar-
ket development in Ukraine, which will result in a 
shadow economy growth and will not ensure the 
state and local budgets execution by revenues.
CONCLUSION
As a result of the research conducted, it was found necessary and expedient to implement tax control of 
cryptocurrency transactions on the basis of the preliminary determination of the cryptocurrency legal 
status, which would help prevent the use of cryptocurrency in terrorist financing, money laundering, 
tax evasion and ensure the filling of the revenues of the state and local budgets of Ukraine and other 
countries.
Cryptocurrency transactions, which should be the object of tax control in Ukraine, are determined. 
Among them: transactions on the cryptocurrency receipt, transactions on determining exchange rate 
differences, and transactions on the cryptocurrency disposal. As a result, it has been established that:
103
Banks and Bank Systems, Volume 13, Issue 2, 2018
• mining transactions and cryptocurrency income generation should be taxed with general taxes de-
pending on a taxpayer’s legal status. These taxes include personal income tax, corporate income tax 
and a unified social tax. At the same time, given the EU recommendations on the non-application 
of value added tax in the cryptocurrency transactions taxation, its implementation is not appropri-
ate in this area;
• all other transactions, which do not result in an increase in the physical volume of cryptocurrency 
assets, should not be taxed by special fees, they should be subject to the same taxation conditions 
as for foreign currency.
It is determined that there is an opportunity to carry out tax control of transactions on cryptocurrency 
receipt and disposal. To do this at the macro level, it is necessary:
• to ensure normative legal documents regulating the cryptocurrency market. These normative docu-
ments should determine the cryptocurrency as a foreign currency, supported by the representatives 
of the Department of Cyberpolice of the National Police of Ukraine;
• to recognize the National Bank of Ukraine the main body of tax control on this market. The National 
Commission for State Regulation of Financial Services Markets and the National Securities and 
Stock Market Commission State Commission should provide financial control at the level of crypto-
currency brokers and exchanges. Tax control over cryptocurrency transactions of economic entities 
must be secured by the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine, and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine 
should become the supreme body of tax control;
• to legalize cryptocurrency exchanges in Ukraine, which will allow receiving additional tax reve-
nues in the budgets and contribute to the development of the domestic cryptocurrency market;
• to take into account the volume of cryptocurrency assets when cutting tax rates or subsidies (in or-
der to stimulate business entities to disclose information about cryptocurrency transactions).
At the micro level, it is necessary: 
• to provide conditions for identification of electronic wallet owners; and
• through the mass media, to ensure the popularization of the conditions for cryptocurrency trans-
actions taxation.
The introduction of tax control on the cryptocurrency market will lead to the need for accounting of cryp-
tocurrency assets by business entities. This in turn will necessitate their revaluation, based on the high vol-
atility on the market under study. As a result, in order to create opportunities for cryptocurrency tax con-
trol, the National Bank of Ukraine should determine the official rate of major cryptocurrencies on a daily 
basis, as well as their exchange rate on the interbank and inter-exchange cryptocurrency markets. These 
measures will form the basis for tax control of transactions in terms of determining exchange differences.
The consequences of taxation on the cryptocurrency market are established. It is proved that the state 
needs to keep revenues derived from cryptocurrency transactions in the same cryptocurrency, rather 
than immediately convert it, which will ensure sustainable development of the cryptocurrency market.
These results create new preconditions for the development of the state tax control theory, as well as 
procedures for its conduct, in particular, extend its object to cryptocurrency transactions, as well as 
supplement the list of functions and responsibilities of the tax control system.

However, the risks of money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion that cryptocurrency transactions imply lead to the need to implement their state regulation, an important component of which is tax control.Therefore, the purpose of the article is to substantiate the value orientations when forming the system of cryptocurrency transactions tax control in Ukraine taking the positive experience of developed countries into account. The scientific results of the study consist in the emphasizing structural, functional, systemic and institutional approaches to understanding tax control, which became the basis for identifying the features of cryptocurrency transactions as a tax control object.It was revealed that the lack of personalization of the agreement parties, the relatively high level of information security, free international turnover and a decentralized payment system are the factors of the cryptocurrency market further development. On the other hand, this leads to the loss of tax revenues for Ukrainian budgetary system, taking into account the forecasted trends in the development of the cryptocurrency market by 2022 through methods of sums, least squares and expert estimates. Given the institutional approach to the understanding of tax control, an institutional structure of the cryptocurrency transactions tax control in Ukraine is proposed.It is established that domestic state institutions are able to carry out tax control over these transactions. It is also determined that introducing fiscal control will result in the receipt of additional revenues by budgets, reduction of shadow economy, counteraction to cybercrime and terrorism financing.The practical importance of the results is in the need to form an effective system of cryptocurrency transactions tax control as a function of public administration.It has been determined that transactions on cryptocurrency supply, on the determining exchange rates and transactions on cryptocurrency disposal should be an object of tax control in Ukraine. Mining transactions, receipt of income (profits) in the cryptocurrency are subject to general taxes, depending on the taxpayer’s legal status, in particular, personal income tax, corporate income tax and a unified social tax (UST). Taking into account the EU recommendations on the non-application of value added tax in the cryptocurrency transactions taxation, it is not appropriate to implement it in this area. Establishing tax control over cryptocurrency transactions will expand the powers of state authorities that are empowered to control observing financial discipline by economic agents in Ukraine and the financial capabilities of state and local budgets","['article', 'cryptocurrency', 'cryptocurrency transactions', 'mining', 'tax control', 'tax control object', 'tax control subject', 'Banking', 'HG1501-3550']",disabled

Abstract  
Cryptocurrency is a relatively new form of investment. Its concept was first introduced in 
2009, and has grown ever since. To this day, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Just 
as other currencies, cryptocurrency can be related to a crime. Ever since its introduction 
nearly a decade ago, there have been crimes where cryptocurrency are related. 
According to ACIC’s crime types, cryptocurrency are related to two crime categories: 
cybercrime, and illicit drugs. There are also other cases where the type of crimes is not 
listed as a part of ACIC’s. In response to the crimes that have occurred throughout the 
years, several governments have moved to establish laws regarding cryptocurrency. 
Some governments chose to ban cryptocurrency completely, whereas others opted for 
regulation.

Introduction  
Cryptocurrency is a relatively new form of investment. The concept of cryptocurrency 
was first submitted by Satoshi Nakamoto (46), where it was highlighted that 
7 
 
cryptocurrency eliminates the requirement of a middle-man, such as banks, and that 
users are able to safely and securely conduct transactions.  
Cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset, as it does not physically exist in the actual world. 
Over the years, there has been an increase in the number of cryptocurrencies types, and 
their number in circulation. More people are starting to invest in them as well. The price 
of cryptocurrency differs between each type, and the price of a single cryptocurrency 
coin could be as expensive as $13,000 (bitcoin)(31). Being a currency, cryptocurrency can 
be used in a crime, or at least a motivation in a crime. There have been reports of cases 
that are related to cryptocurrency in the last decade since their creation. 
The aim of this study is to explain cryptocurrency in great details, including its 
components, and how they differ from flat currencies such as cash. A few cases that are 
related to cryptocurrency would also be discussed in order to understand their 
connection to cryptocurrency.  
What is cryptocurrency 
Cryptocurrency are digital assets that are designed to work as a medium of exchange, 
using cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, 
and to verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies can be classified as a subset of 
digital currencies. What is unique regarding cryptocurrency is that they utilise 
decentralised system; in decentralised banking system, boards or governments does not 
hold control over the system. This differs from traditional banking system, which utilises 
centralised control.  
8 
 
What are some of the terms associated with cryptocurrency 
There are a few terms that are closely associated with cryptocurrency. Brief description 
will be given below, in order to assist with understanding the later contents of this work.  
Cryptography 
Cryptography is the practice and study of secure communication in the presence of a 
third party. This also includes construction of protocols that prevent third parties, or the 
public, from reading private details within a message.  
Blockchain  
Blockchain is a public transaction database. Blockchain also functions as a distributed 
ledger which contains list of records called blocks – linked and secured using 
cryptography. Each block contains a pointer as a link to the previous block, a timestamp, 
and transaction data.  
Decentralised  
A decentralised system in economy means that none actually holds control of them 
system; neither the government, nor the boards. In other words, the government holds 
no power in setting market cap for cryptocurrencies, or how much a cryptocurrency is in 
circulation, whereas in the traditional banking system such as cash, the government 
regulates how much cash are in circulation, and setting the market cap.  
Digital asset 
A digital asset is anything that exists in binary format, and is able to be used for trade 
purposes. Digital assets includes, but not limited to: digital documents, audible content, 
motion picture, and other digital data that can be stored in mediums such as laptop, 
personal computers, and media players.  
9 
 
Ledger  
A ledger is a summary of all amounts entered in supporting journals which list individual 
transactions by date. The function of a ledger is to record, and total economic 
transactions.  
Volatile  
Cryptocurrencies are known to be volatile. A cryptocurrency can have a high value in a 
moment, and become significantly cheaper the next moment. Such risk is common 
amongst cryptocurrencies.  
Components of cryptocurrency 
Cryptocurrency trading involves several key components, in which without would result 
in failure to trade cryptocurrency. The components are cryptocurrency keys, 
cryptocurrency wallets, blockchain, and cryptocurrency mining. Details of each 
component will be discussed below.  
Keys  
There are two types of keys that are essential in cryptocurrency trading: Private keys and 
Public keys. A private key is stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and proves ownership of a 
public key. A public key is connected to a particular amount of cryptocurrency, and can be 
used to access that amount.  Both the private and public keys are significant tools to 
maintain the security of crypto-economy.  
Private Key 
A private key is a sophisticated form of cryptography that allows a user to access his or 
her cryptocurrency. A private key is an integral aspect of cryptocurrency, and its security 
helps in protecting a user from theft and unauthorized access to their cryptocurrency.  
10 
 
In cryptocurrency trade, a use is commonly given a public address and a private key to 
receive cryptocurrency in a form of coins or tokens (20). The private key is made up of 51 
alphanumeric characters, which make it hard for a hacker to obtain.  
The private key of a user is typically stored in a digital wallet belonging to the same user. 
When a transaction is commenced, the wallet software creates a digital signature by 
processing the transaction with the private key. This symbolizes a secure system, since 
the only way to generate a valid signature for any given cryptocurrency transaction is to 
use the private key. The signature is then used to confirm that a transaction has come 
from a particular user, and ensures that the transaction cannot be changed one it has 
been broadcasted into a blockchain. If a transaction is altered, the signature will change 
as well.  
If the private key is lost, the user can no longer access their wallet to spend, withdraw, or 
transfer cryptocurrency. Hence, it is imperative that to save the private key in a secure 
location. Private keys can be stored on paper wallets, or hardware such as smartcards or 
USB devices. An offline software wallet can also be used to store private keys. This type of 
wallet has an offline portion for private keys, and an online portion which contains the 
public key.  
In short, a private key is an indispensable component in order to conduct a 
cryptocurrency transaction. Security measures need to be taken to prevent loss of private 
key, whether accidental, or theft by hackers.  
A solution to cryptocurrency private key security was suggested by WISeKey International 
Holding Ltd, a leading cyber security and IoT Company in January 2018, about the use of a 
11 
 
secure mechanical watch called WIS.WATCH, powered by contactless secure hardware 
enabled wallet (14). It was designed to offer security and ease to cryptocurrency users. 
The WIS.WATCH can securely store a user’s private key, and allows them to make 
contactless transactions. Every time a contactless blockchain transaction is initiated, 
including a bitcoin transaction, the private key must be validated by using the Near Field 
Technology, before enabling the transaction. While software wallets continue to be 
vulnerable to hackers, the secure hardware wallets have gained popularity. With the 
existence of WIS.WATCH, hardware wallets such as USB flash drives are now able to be 
used without contact, and users can establish multiple private keys into the secure store 
by using the WISeWallet application, and access these private keys to make transactions 
(29). The WISeWallet application was said to be compatible with most of the existing 
blockchain technologies, and works as a part of payment using WISeKey Blockchain-as-a-
Service technology offerings. The WIS.WATCH is also said to be able to be used as a 
unique personal key identifier and trusted device to access smartphones, applications, 
personal data, and secured cloud storage.  
Public key  
The public key is where cryptocurrency funds are deposited and received. It is a 
cryptographic code that allows a user to receive cryptocurrencies into their account (21). 
When a user initiates their first transaction with a cryptocurrency, a unique pair of public 
key and private key is created. The transaction would also be broadcasted to the 
network, where distributed nodes confirm the validity of the transaction, before finalising 
it and recording it on the blockchain. It was noted that before a transaction is 
broadcasted, it needed to be signed digitally using the private key. The signature would 
12 
 
prove the ownership of the private key, but not divulge the details of the private key to 
anyone.  
Since a public key is created based on the private key, the user’s public key is used to 
prove that the digital signature came from their private key. Once the transaction has 
been verified as valid, the cryptocurrency funds are sent to the recipient’s public address.  
The public address is a hashed version of a public key. Since the public key is made up of 
extremely long string of numbers, it needed to be compressed and shortened, hence the 
creation of public address. In other words, a private key generates a public key, which 
then generates a public address. When two users agreed to conduct a transaction, they 
would reveal their public addresses to each other. The sender needs the recipient’s public 
address to be able to send the funds to, which will then be able to spend or withdraw the 
amount using their private key. The recipient can also verify the sender’s batch of 
cryptocurrency coins using the sender’s public address, which is displayed on their 
screen.  
Cryptocurrency wallets 
Cryptocurrency wallets are essential component of cryptocurrency. They are digital 
wallets that are used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency 
wallet is commonly used to store a private key that proves ownership of a public key, 
which is a public digital code connected to a particular amount of currency. 
Types of cryptocurrency wallets  
There are several types of cryptocurrency wallets, and each wallet has their advantages 
and disadvantages. Most cryptocurrency have their official wallet, or a few officially 
recommended third-party wallets. Typically, no wallet can store many cryptocurrency; 
13 
 
most can only hold one, or two cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency users would need to 
figure out which wallet can store their chosen cryptocurrency.  
Cryptocurrency wallets can also be divided into two categories: cold wallet, and hot 
wallet. A cold wallet is generally considered to be effective for long-term storage of 
unused funds. A hot wallet is described as a type of wallet that is carried around for 
immediate use of the funds within. The key difference between hot and cold wallets is 
that hot wallets are connected to the internet, whereas cold wallets are not. Hot wallets 
are also considered to be more likely targets from hackers, as they’re connected to the 
internet – cold wallets are offline/not connected to the internet; hence they’re safe from 
hackers. Due to this, it was recommended to have as many layers of protection as 
possible on hot wallets. Layers of protection can include two-factor authentication, 
strong password, and security settings. It was also thought to not have many funds in a 
hot wallet. The reason being that hackers can see how much funds are inside a hot wallet 
as it’s connected to the internet. Lesser funds would naturally mean less appealing target.  
However, despite having an offline feature to protect them from online threats, cold 
wallets are not immune to threats. A study found that a malware can be preinstalled, or 
pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet (38). Alternatively, it can infect the 
cold wallet’s system when removable media such as USB flash drives is inserted into the 
wallet’s computer in order to conduct a transaction. The study found that these attack 
methods have been repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade (1, 23, 44, 50, 54). 
After obtaining a foothold in the wallet, a hacker can then utilise various air-gap covert 
channel techniques (39), including physical, electromagnetic, electric, magnetic, acoustic, 
optical, and thermal techniques. In conclusion, even though cold wallets provide a high 
14 
 
degree of isolation, it is still possible for attackers to compromise such wallets and steal 
private keys from the owners.  
Desktop wallet  
A desktop wallet is the type that is considered more secure, when compared to both an 
online and mobile wallet. However, the degree of security is directly related to the quality 
of the desktop’s protection against online threats, such as computer virus, and malware. 
Examples of desktop wallets are desktop applications, such as Exodus, Multibit, Armory, 
and Bitcoin Core.  
A desktop wallet also has a feature that can identify it as a ‘cold’ wallet; when not 
connected to the internet, the desktop wallet is impervious to online threats from 
hackers, viruses, etc. A cold, desktop storage can be an older laptop that is completely 
offline, and on a clean operating system install.  
Some of the advantages of desktop wallets are that they are easier-to-use cryptocurrency 
wallet as compared to the others, good cold storage solution, and private keys not stored 
on a third-party server. It was noted however, that they are only great solution for a cold 
wallet, only if they have never been connected to the internet before; if they have been 
connected to the internet, they would obtain an IP address, which hackers can trace and 
use to access the desktop. Desktops can also store private keys by downloading and 
storing them - eliminating the need to rely on third-party server.  
Disadvantages of desktop wallets include the security concerns, when and if they are 
connected to the internet. As mentioned before, connecting to the internet would 
present the desktop with an IP address, which hackers can use to hack the desktop. Being 
able to or connected to the internet also exposes the desktop to other online threats, 
15 
 
such as malware, key loggers, and viruses. Desktops are also not immune to physical 
damages. Fixing desktops by relying on service of others can expose its contents to them; 
they can examine the desktop’s contents, potentially obtaining access to cryptocurrency 
funds of the owner. It was also mentioned earlier that desktops can download private 
keys into them for storage. This also creates a risk such as that if a backup key/s were not 
made and the desktop become disabled or inaccessible; the key/s would be lost, and 
likely impossible to retrieve.  
Mobile wallet 
Mobile wallet is a type of wallet that is run from a phone application. It provides access to 
cryptocurrencies via mobile devices and provides additional features via the applications; 
however, it does create security risks similar to desktop wallets when connected to the 
internet.  
Advantages of mobile wallets include them being practical and easier to use and access 
than other cryptocurrency wallets; mobile phones can be carried around and accessed 
anywhere, so long as there’s internet connection. This enables users to accept, or send 
cryptocurrency payments practically from anywhere. It was also mentioned that mobile 
wallet have additional features via the applications. One such feature includes QR code 
scanning to access cryptocurrency funds.  
The disadvantage of mobile wallets is the fact that mobile phones in general are 
incredibly insecure devices; just as desktops, they can also be infected with online threats 
such as malware and viruses.  
16 
 
Online wallet 
Online wallets are commonly cryptocurrency wallets that are accessed via web browsers, 
which is why they can also be referred to as web wallet.  
Advantages of online wallets include the fact that they are the fastest way to complete 
cryptocurrency transactions, given that there is no lag between locations of the 
application and server. They are also ideal to hold small amounts of cryptocurrency. This 
characteristic categorise them as hot wallets, and share their property; ideal for quick, 
daily transactions that does not involve massive amount of cryptocurrency. Some online 
wallets are also able to manage multiple cryptocurrencies, transfer between them, or be 
directly integrated into a cryptocurrency exchange marketplace. 
Disadvantages of online wallets include users being susceptible to phishing scams, 
malware, and insider tracking, and out-dated security measures. The risks mentioned are 
a part of the hazard of using web browser services, and often out of the user’s control. 
Information relating to user’s cryptocurrency details are also out of their control, as in 
they are stored in a third-party storage, the internet. Use of online wallet requires a 
desktop, and as mentioned earlier, desktops connected to the internet are at risk from 
malware, key loggers, and viruses. As such, it is generally not recommended to use 
services such as internet café, to reduce the risk of information theft.   
Hardware wallet  
Hardware wallets are dedicated hardware that is built to be able to hold cryptocurrency, 
and keep it secure. Hardware wallets include USB devices, and external hard disks. These 
devices are able to go online when connected to desktop, conduct transactions, and 
taken offline upon completion, for transportation and security. Requiring a desktop and 
17 
 
internet connection to conduct transactions relating to cryptocurrency classifies this type 
of wallet as hot wallet.  
Paper wallet 
Paper wallets are a medium in which stores information related to both public and 
private keys. An example of the information stored is QR code that belonged to a private 
key. Using that QR code, a user can both send, and receive digital currency using a paper 
wallet. Overall, paper wallets enabled an option of not storing digital data about a user’s 
data, such as private key, by using a paper wallet.  
Mining  
Cryptocurrency mining is the process of generating new cryptocurrency in the form of 
coins. Cryptocurrency mining is called such, from to the fact that when transactions are 
added to the public ledger that is blockchain, new coins is created, or in other word, 
mined.  
Cryptocurrency mining is an integral part of how cryptocurrency functions as a digital 
currency. The mining network relies on miners to verify and update the public ledger of 
cryptocurrency transactions, to verify that cryptocurrency users are not trying to cheat 
the system, and to add newly-discovered coins into the system.  
Miners 
As explained earlier, miners work together to verify transactions, ultimately mining new 
coins into the system. But that does not mean that all miners are on the same team. 
Cryptocurrency miners gets rewarded in the form of some new coins for their hard work 
in mining coins, but the amount of coins rewarded are directly proportional to the 
contribution a miner had in the process of generating new coins. Hence, there are 
competitions amongst cryptocurrency miners in adding new transactions into the ledger 
18 
 
as part of generating new coins. To put it simply, the more a miner contribute into adding 
new transactions into the ledger and generating coins, the more coins the miner obtains 
as rewards.  
Proof-of-Work  
In cryptocurrency, proof-of-work is a system that utilises hard-to-compute, but easy-to-
verify functions, in order to limit exploitation of cryptocurrency mining by miners.  
A proof-of-work system’s hash function is the algorithm used to find a solution to the 
computational puzzle, which is simple to calculate the output is if the input is known. 
However, it is virtually impossible to calculate an output, if the input is unknown; trying 
every possible input would be done until the correct input is found. When cryptocurrency 
miners mine digital coins and add blocks of transactions to a blockchain, they effectively 
complete a proof-of-work system by using high-powered computers to solve a 
mathematical problem that is cryptographical puzzle.  
One of the most popular proof-of-work functions is called SHA256, a part of the SHA-2 
family of Secure Hash Algorithms. It is also the one that is used as bitcoin’s proof-of-work. 
It was first used by Adam Back in 1996 as a way to block spam emails. Recently however, 
bitcoin started utilising an alternative to proof-of-work, called proof-of-stake (30, 53). It 
was a new proof-of-work mechanism that improves decentralisation and reduces risk of 
51% attack, without increasing the risk of Sybil attack – an attack in which a single node 
such as a cryptocurrency miner assumed multiple identities (53).  
There is a single major flaw to the proof-of-work system, and that is requiring a large 
amount of computing power, to solve cryptographical puzzle. The proof-of-work system 
holds no use apart from protecting the validity of cryptocurrency transactions and 
19 
 
generally ensuring cryptocurrency system are ran honestly. This would mean that the 
process of mining cryptocurrency with proof-of-work is horribly wasteful, in terms of 
energy-use. Given the wasteful energy spent on proof-of-work system, it was not viewed 
as a long-term for cryptocurrency. Alternatives such as the aforementioned proof-of-
stake are seen as a more friendly function.  
In short, proof-of-work is indeed designed to be difficult, in order to prevent malicious 
behaviour, such as a miner trying to add fake transaction block into a blockchain to get 
reward coins. Proof-of-work would not only protect digital currency such as 
cryptocurrency from malicious miners, but also prevent a single person from assuming 
control over which transaction block to next be added into the blockchain.  
How cryptocurrency are mined  
In order to add transactions into a blockchain, all miners collect all transactions that were 
recently broadcasted by cryptocurrency users, verify the transactions, and compile them 
down into a transaction block – a condensed record of all transactions for that period of 
time.  
It is possible for a miner to simple create a fake transaction block and adding it into the 
blockchain. Due to this, the cryptocurrency algorithm was designed to make 
cryptocurrency mining difficult. To prevent a miner from adding a transaction block at 
their will, they have to solve a difficult computational puzzle – a proof-of-work scheme. 
The proof-of-work scheme was designed to provide solutions that are easy to verify, but 
difficult to find.  
In short, cryptocurrency miners compete against each other to see who can solve a 
difficult, cryptographic puzzle first. As one miner found the solution, they broadcast the 
20 
 
solution to all the other miners, for them to verify that the solution is correct. If the 
solution is indeed correct, the network adds the successfully-mined transaction block to 
the accepted blockchain permanently.  
The miner who was the first to successfully solve the cryptographic puzzle of transaction 
block is the rewarded for their effort, by receiving new coins – the amount of coins differs 
and depends on the transaction block size. The possibility of reward acts as an incentive 
for cryptocurrency miners to keep investing in computational time and effort into mining 
new cryptocurrency coins. The process of rewarding cryptocurrency miners with coins for 
their hard work of solving cryptographic puzzle also contributes to the overall 
cryptocurrency coins supply.   
Where cryptocurrencies are mined 
It was explained that cryptocurrencies are mined by miners, in which they solve 
cryptographical puzzle to add transactional blocks into a blockchain, creating new coins 
as a result. As such, cryptocurrency mining can be done from practically everywhere, 
providing that the miner have access to a computer with sufficient computing power.  
It was also explained that mining cryptocurrency with proof-of-work in place would 
require a large amount of energy. This raised a concern such as carbon footprint (34). It 
was estimated that the combined electricity consumption for bitcoin and ethereum 
mining, which represented as high as 88% of the total cryptocurrency market 
capitalisation (36), had already reached a staggering 47 terawatt-hours yearly, and is on 
the rise. In terms of perspective, Greece’s population of 11 million consumed close to 57 
terawatt-hours annually; the consumption of energy to mine bitcoins and ethereum coins 
alone nearly require as much energy as Greece, a nation.  
21 
 
A vast majority of cryptocurrency mining (48%) was done in China, and is typically 
powered by coal plants (34). With the use of life-cycle impact-assessment methodology, 
it was estimated that the annual carbon footprint for bitcoin and ethereum mining was 
comparable to that of some 6.8 million average European inhabitants; hence the 
conclusion of the study being that the cryptocurrency industry was in need of reform to 
be more environmentally sustainable.  
However, despite the claim that cryptocurrency mining was environmentally hazardous, a 
different study found that findings to be economically unsound. In a review, Stuart 
Wimbush mentioned a possible fault in the claim of the combined annual electricity 
consumption due to bitcoin and ethereum mining was 80% that of Greece (56). It was 
found that Bitcoin and ethereum generated a total wealth of US$275 billion in 2017, 
whereas the 11 million inhabitants of Greece generated a total wealth of approximately 
US$205 billion in the same year. Given that Greece generated less wealth than 
cryptocurrency mining, and would have consumed much more than simply electrical 
energy in the process, it was thought that the mining of cryptocurrency seemed to be 
considerably less wasteful.  
In summary, even though there are valid claims that cryptocurrency mining is 
environmentally hazardous, it was theoretically impossible for it to be so, given that 
Greece, a nation, generated less wealth than cryptocurrency mining, and yet consumed 
much more than simply electrical energy in the process. In other words, it was natural for 
cryptocurrency mining to have consumed as much power (electrical) in order to generate 
a large amount of wealth. It was also suggested for nations to transit from using fossil-
fuel-based electricity generation, to nuclear or other sustainable alternatives (56). This 
22 
 
would allow generation of a large amount of wealth such as from cryptocurrency mining, 
and using a large amount of sustainable energy.  
Blockchain  
In terms of cryptocurrency, a blockchain is a public ledger of all a cryptocurrency’s 
transaction. As new transactions are made, they are compiled into blocks, which will be 
added into the sequential blockchain. In order for a transaction to be considered 
successful, it has to be added into the blockchain. Once a transaction block is added into 
a blockchain, it will remain there permanently and are considered as public record.  
Other uses for blockchain 
Aside from cryptocurrency, there are emerging theories in ways to utilise the blockchain 
technology. Amongst them are medicines, gun control, stock exchange, and other 
investments such as gold.  
Medicine  
A use of the blockchain ledger system was suggested by M. Hoy in medicines (42). It was 
suggested to tie everything from medical records to library checkouts using a blockchain 
ledger containing verifiable time-stamped records of creation and ownership. The system 
can also potentially prevent changes in documents, and data tampering.  
Gun control 
It was suggested by Thomas F. Heston that the blockchain used for effective gun control 
(40). The blockchain protocol can be used to keep track of gun flow from manufacturer to 
end user, and track sales from a gun owner to another. The blockchain’s anonymity 
feature would also allow better privacy than existing background check systems, and 
simultaneously link ownership of a particular gun to an individual in an immutable 
manner.  
23 
 
Stock Exchange  
In December 2017, it was announced that ASX, Australia’s main stock exchange, would 
start using blockchain technology to process its equities transactions (2). ASX would begin 
replacing its current system, CHESS, with the distributed ledger technology to help 
manage the clearing and settlement for buying and selling stocks. ASX chief executive at 
that time, Dominic Stevens, stated that the change into using blockchain technology 
would put Australia at the forefront of innovation in the financial markets.  
Other investments – Gold  
It is apparently possible to implement the blockchain system onto other types of 
investment. An article was published about Australia’s biggest gold refiner, Perth Mint, 
developing their own blockchain-based gold products, as a response to the threat posed 
by the increasing in popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (37). Richard Hayes, 
chief executive of Perth Mint at that time, commented that the underlying blockchain 
technology behind cryptocurrencies presented an opportunity for Perth Mint to develop 
new products with greater security, and traceability.  
In summary, blockchain has features that are beneficial to many fields. Such features 
include anti-tempering, as all records added into a blockchain are final, anonymity, and 
continual records to keep updated about a matter.  
How to trade cryptocurrency  
Trading cryptocurrency requires having good background knowledge, and the 
components needed to trade cryptocurrency. The two main components a user needed 
to start trading cryptocurrency are cryptocurrency wallet, and cryptocurrency exchange. 
In terms of having good background knowledge, there are several notes to consider. First, 
a beginner should choose a trading company with a good reputation that offers an 
24 
 
exchange and a wallet. A beginner should also trade prominent coins, as starter. Bitcoin 
and Ethereum are two of the most prominent coins as of June 2018 (31, 49).  
How to spend cryptocurrency  
One of the major concerns regarding cryptocurrency is finding ways to spend it. 
Conducting a search using a search engine was thought to be one of the best ways to look 
for ways, or merchants who accepts cryptocurrency. Gambling is also a way to spend 
cryptocurrency (51) 
Spending cryptocurrency is not always possible, as some countries have banned trading 
of cryptocurrency. Some countries opted for a compromise in the form of regulations. 
Government regulations will be discussed in more detail in a later section.  
 
How cryptocurrencies differ from flat currencies 
As explained earlier, cryptocurrency differs from regular, flat currency. The difference lies 
in two major ways. Cryptocurrencies are only accepted as payment by other users – if no 
one accepts it, then it is considered worthless. Flat currency however, will always be 
accepted as payment by the government, at the very least. The second major difference 
is that cryptocurrency token supply is not managed by a central authority, whereas flat 
currency is managed by the government and can lead to either inflation, or deflation.  
Popular cryptocurrencies (latest price)  
There are thousands of cryptocurrency. It can be hard to determine which cryptocurrency 
is the best, or worst. There are several parameters that can be used to rank 
cryptocurrency: their price, market cap, supply rate, and existing volume in circulation. In 
25 
 
terms of price, the four highest-ranked cryptocurrency as at June 2018 are Bitcoin, 
Bitcoin Cash, Mixin, and Ethereum (31).  
Crime types in Australia 
The types of crimes in Australia will be listed, and matched with some of the cases related 
to cryptocurrency discussed below. The types of crime happened in Australia according to 
Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) are illicit drugs, fraud, financial crimes, 
illicit firearms, money laundering, cybercrime, identity crime, exploitation of business 
structures, public sector corruption, and violence (10).  
Some of the most recent crimes in relation to cryptocurrency  
To understand more as to how cryptocurrency can be related to crimes, various case 
involving cryptocurrency in general, or a particular cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, various 
case that occurred in the last decade will be discussed below. Swoop for cases that 
occurred in the last decade was decided, as cryptocurrency, or at least the proof-of-
concept, was published in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto (46).  
6 December 2017 – Hacking of NiceHash  
One of the case examples to be explained is the cyber-attack against Nicehash. The crime 
happened on the 6th of December 2017, where NiceHash, a crypto-mining company 
based in Slovenia, reported that their system was breached in a cyber-attack(6).  
NiceHash is known as the world’s largest crypto-mining marketplace, and was created 
based on the concept of a shared economy. They were founded on the 24th of March 
2014, and has grown to exponential heights ever since, and harboured 160,000 
cryptocurrency miners daily on average (47). NiceHash is different from any crypto-
mining marketplace in that they applied a new system to cryptocurrency mining that 
26 
 
resolved around the relationship between cryptocurrency sellers and buyers. NiceHash 
users upon registration are presented with three options. The first option would be that 
users can choose to sell their hashing power generated from their mining hardware to 
receive earnings. The second option would be that investors can choose to buy a package 
to mine a particular cryptocurrency at a designated set pool with the support of crypto-
algorithm. The last option would be to be a combination of a buyer, and a seller via 
NiceHash.  
On more detail about the case, it was reported on Newstex Finance & Accounting Blogs 
that about 4,700 bitcoins were stolen (3). The approximate worth of those stolen bitcoins 
was $70 million. It was reported earlier that day, that the price of bitcoins was at a 
record-high of more than $14,000 (6). The record-high price of the bitcoin was very 
possibly be the motive of the crime, or at least tempted them to steal bitcoins.  
In terms of bitcoin-theft, the case was not the first reported case in the field. In February 
2014, Mt. Gox, a bitcoin exchange based in Japan, reported a theft of 850,000 coins (17). 
Those bitcoins were worth nearly $500 million at that time. Mt. Gox were shut down not 
long after the case (19), and filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, later that year (5). A 
study of this case found that a meteoric rise in price and rapid growth were associated 
with cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin – this also attracted thieves/hackers (32).  
In regards of the aftermaths of the case about NiceHash, the CEO of NiceHash at that 
time, Marko Kobal, had resigned following the incident (55), and reimbursements were 
carried out by the company. On the 31st of January, nearly two months after the hacking 
of bitcoins, the company announced that they are going to reimburse their service users 
that were affected by the security breach that occurred on 6th of December 2017 (18). 
27 
 
The reimbursement program is called the Repayment program, and thus far consisted of 
four stages: the first was carried out on the 2nd of February (18), the second on the 1st of 
March (22), the third on the 3rd of April (27), and the latest stage, fourth stage, was done 
on the 7th of May (12).  It was also reported along with the fourth stage, that 30% of the 
old balance amount was already reimbursed to all users that were impacted by the 
security breach. More details about the program are unknown, or if there will be any 
more, but  given that there are four stages thus far and 30% of the stolen amount 
reimbursed, it can be predicted that there will be about seven more stages of 
reimbursements, with each stage reimbursing approximately 10% of the stolen amount. 
Blockchain-related – Child pornography  
In a report published in March 2018, German researchers found about 1,600 files of non-
financial data, some linking to, or actually containing child pornography, and other 
objectionable materials, on the blockchain system that stores bitcoin transactions (52). It 
was concluded that users of blockchain are able to add non-financial data for purposes 
such as describing a transaction’s purpose, and insert benign messages or record 
information for other financial services. The objectionable contents were found to be 
imbedded in such data, and given that blockchain are viewable by practically all users, the 
data would be downloaded and persistently stored by them.  
This discovery would place certain users of the bitcoin network in legal difficulties. The 
researchers also mentioned that this discovery could pose an obstacle for greater 
adoption and mainstream acceptance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Upon 
further analysis, the researchers found that most of the files were harmless, but some of 
the files contained copyright violations and the disclosure of the people’s identifiable 
information, and at least eight files were said to containing sexual content (33). Amongst 
28 
 
the child pornography materials, two files were found to contain 274 links to child 
pornography websites, and a file depicting a nude image of a minor.  
Experts said that the files were likely to be downloaded as a part of notes to transactions, 
or inserted as the transactions themselves. Users of blockchain are able to add non-
financial data for purposes such as describing a transaction’s purpose insert benign 
messages, or record information for other financial services – anyone with access to 
bitcoin software such as miners, exchanges, and traders, have the ability to upload any 
content into the blockchain.  
Arbitrary data insertion methods for bitcoin’s blockchain  
As explained before, aside from recording financial transactions, Bitcoin’s blockchain are 
also able to be filled with non-financial data. Non-financial data can take a form of short 
messages via special transaction types, or even complete files. To add complete files into 
a blockchain, arbitrary data has to be encoded as standard transactions. There are two 
insertion methods for non-financial data: low-level insertion methods, and content 
insertion services.  
Benefits and risks of arbitrary blockchain content 
Bitcoin’s blockchain design included several ways to insert arbitrary, non-financial data 
into its blockchain, both intentionally, and unintentionally. Potential benefits of engraving 
arbitrary data into the bitcoin’s blockchain and the risks associated with them will be 
discussed further below.  
Benefits  
Bitcoin offered Coinbase, a digital currency exchange headquarters, and OP_RETURN, a 
special transaction template that allows one small data chunk as an attachment onto a 
transaction, as explicit channels to insert small chunks of non-financial data into their 
29 
 
blockchain. The benefit of using OP_RETURN is that different services use OP_RETURN to 
link non-financial assets such as vouchers, to bitcoin’s blockchain. Coinbase differ from 
OP_RETURN in those only miners who dedicate significant computational contribution to 
maintain the blockchain, to be able to add extra chunks of data into the new transaction 
blocks.  
Risks  
There are several risks associated with adding data into blockchain content. Some of 
them are copyright violations, malware, privacy violations, politically sensitive content, 
and illegal & condemned content. As the blockchain are akin to file-sharing networks, 
pirated data can be distributed as part of a transaction block. Malware is also a threat, as 
they can be inserted as an attachment, and if downloaded and opened, can cause 
cataclysmic damage onto the system or device. Governments have valid concerns 
regarding a leakage of classified information. If such classified information is added into a 
blockchain, it would mean that more than a single user having the file, and the ability to 
access it, potentially exposing sensitive information about a government.  
In short, there are ways for someone to add an objectionable content into a blockchain, 
and cause harm if possessed or accessed by other users. Unlike systems such as social 
media platforms, file-sharing networks, and online storage systems, contents that are 
stored in a blockchain can be do so while remaining anonymous, making it hard to trace 
the culprit.  
Examining the data (non-financial data) 
There are three methods to examine non-financial data in a blockchain: low-level 
insertion methods detectors, and service detectors, and suspicious transaction detectors.  
30 
 
Low-level insertion method detectors 
The low-level insertion method detectors were designed to match individual transactions 
that are likely to contain non-financial data. They detect manipulated financial 
transactions, as well as OP_RETURN, non-standard, and Coinbase transactions.  
Service detectors  
The service detectors enabled the detection and extraction of files based on the service’ 
protocols, and also tracking of data used in service-created transactions.  
Suspicious transaction detectors  
The suspicious transaction detectors examine standard transactions that are likely to 
carry non-financial data, but were not detected. For a transaction to be examined by this 
method, it has to have at least 50 suspicious outputs.  
Illegal drugs  
There was a reported case in India about a drug trade related to cryptocurrency (11). An 
arrest was made by the police against two university students that were caught 
purchasing drugs using cryptocurrencies. The duo would purchase an amount of drug, 
and then have it transported into a particular place where it’ll be picked up.  
It was not the first case where cryptocurrency was used to purchase drugs. There was a 
case in 2011, where a university student sold/auction drugs via an online drug 
marketplace called ‘Silk Road’ (41). The student had created a fake profile and auctioned 
drugs online, where customers would buy, and have it delivered to an address of their 
choice. The method of payment was cryptocurrency, with different drugs cost different 
amount of coins. The case was ultimately solved when police made an arrest of the 
student in a public library, where he logged in into his Silk Road profile.  
31 
 
9 March 2018 
In a newspaper article published on March 2018, it was announced that Pavel Lerner, a 
cryptocurrency businessman, was kidnapped in Ukraine by armed assailants, and was 
forced to pay $1 million ransom in the form of bitcoins from his digital wallet (45). The 
case led to demands being made to the government to clamp down on cryptocurrency 
crime. It was mentioned that every month, the Ukrainian police would raid the Kvazar 
semiconductor plant in Kiev, and seize millions of pounds in form of computer 
equipment, which were claimed to be taken by Russians and used to finance the 
separatist regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.  
Base on the case examples below, in terms of type of crimes in Australia by ACIC, 
cryptocurrency had been used in two categories of crimes: illicit drugs (Silk Road), 
cybercrime (hacking of NiceHash). Child pornography and kidnapping did not quite fit into 
the crime categories listed, but they are serious crimes, nonetheless.  
Government regulations  
In response to several concerns such as environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining 
and the risks of owning cryptocurrency, several governments had decided to take actions 
against cryptocurrency. Actions taken include total banning, and putting regulations in 
place.  
China  
China as of February 2018 had completely banned cryptocurrency trading within their 
country. The process actually started from September 2017, where it was announced that 
Chinese regulators declaring initial coin offerings illegal (7). This meant that 
cryptocurrency owners are not allowed to promote, much less sell, their cryptocurrency 
32 
 
to anyone in the country. The regulatory action was said to be caused by growing fear 
from initial coin offerings, which caught investors’ imagination that further leads to 
phishing activities.  
Ultimately, cryptocurrency was banned in total starting February 2018. It was announced 
in an article that was published by Financial News, a publication company that is affiliated 
with the People’s Bank of China, that the Chinese government’s recent attempts to stamp 
out digital currency trading by shutting down domestic cryptocurrency exchanges were 
not successful in completely eradicating cryptocurrency trading, and that the government 
will strengthen measures, to thoroughly remove any onshore or offshore trading 
platforms related to virtual currency trading (8).  
South Korea 
South Korea is another country that moved to regulate cryptocurrency. Initially, it was 
reported that South Korea planned to ban cryptocurrency trading, in light of 
cryptocurrency abuse. South Korea’s justice minister at that time, Park Sung-Ki, 
mentioned there being great concerns regarding virtual currencies (26, 35). However, as 
at mid-January 2018, a ban had not been placed, but instead considered taxing 
cryptocurrency transactions, according to the South Korean finance minister at that time, 
Kim Dong-Yeon (25). Later in the month, raids were conducted by the country’s police 
and tax agencies on major cryptocurrency exchanges for alleged tax evasion. Aside from 
alleged tax evasion case, the police were also looking for a Seoul-based cryptocurrency 
exchange, over possible gambling allegations.  
Ultimately, the South Korean government officially banned anonymous cryptocurrency 
trading commencing at the end of January 2018 (24). This would mean that 
33 
 
cryptocurrency traders could only make cryptocurrency transactions from bank accounts 
set up under their real names.  
Ukraine & Kazakhstan 
Ukraine had started to intensify the search for methods to regulate cryptocurrencies, due 
to growing concerns in their capital, Kiev, that exploitation of the digital assets by 
criminals and geopolitical adversaries presented a growing national security risk (48). 
Ukraine’s national security and defence council chief, Oleksandr Turchynov, warned that 
the current legal vacuum posed a threat to the economy and security of the state. He also 
mentioned that given the rapid development of cryptocurrencies around the world, the 
issue could not be left out of attention, hence the plans to develop regulations. The 
soaring prices of cryptocurrency have made the market an increasingly lucrative target 
for cyber criminals. There was also a growing concern among regulators and governments 
that cryptocurrency could be used by organised crime-groups for money laundering (4, 
43), and other criminal activities.  
In a response to growing concerns of cryptocurrency being used, or simply being related 
to crimes, The Kazakhstan Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency submitted a 
proposal to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) to create an advisory board on 
blockchain and cryptocurrency (15). The proposal was submitted during the 
Cryptoconference 2018 in Almaty, and had gathered some support for governments to 
adopt legislation to regulate the cryptocurrency market. Conference participants were 
pushing for the adoption of cryptocurrency laws within the EAEU in order to protect the 
best interests of all market from third parties such as cryptocurrency exchange 
marketplace. The regulation also aimed to prevent the use of cryptocurrency as a tool for 
34 
 
illegal transactions, the legalisation of proceeds from crime, and the financing of 
terrorism.  
Australia  
As of April 2018, new laws for digital currency exchange (DCE) providers operating in 
Australia were implemented by AUSTRAC, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, anti-
money laundering, and counter-terrorism financing regulator (AMF/CTF) (16). The new 
laws would cover regulation of service providers of cryptocurrency, such as 
cryptocurrency exchange marketplace.  
The AUSTRAC CEO, Nicole Rose, announced that the new laws would strengthen the 
agency’s compliance and intelligence capabilities to help DCEs implement systems and 
controls that can minimise the risk of criminals using them for purposes such as money 
laundering, terrorism financing, and cybercrime.  
With the new laws in place, DCEs with a business operation located in Australia must now 
register with AUSTRAC, and meet the government’s AML/CTF compliance and reporting 
obligations. The transition period were run until May 2018, to allow DCEs time to register 
them.  
Corporate regulations  
Countries are not the only one capable of banning, or at least regulating 
cryptocurrencies. It was found that massive corporations such as Google, and Apple, have 
also moved to regulate cryptocurrency – cryptocurrency mining, to be exact.  
Google 
On the 3rd of April 2018, it was reported that Google had decided to start cracking down 
on malicious cryptocurrency mining via extensions on their website platform, Google 
35 
 
Chrome (9). Until that period, Google Chrome’s web policy had been permitting 
cryptocurrency mining in their extensions, providing that cryptocurrency mining was 
indeed an extension’s single purpose of use, and that the user is adequately informed of 
the cryptocurrency mining behaviour.  
Unfortunately, it was found that approximately 90% of extensions with cryptocurrency 
mining scripts that developers have attempted to upload to the Chrome Web Store failed 
to comply with Google Chrome’s policies (13). That resulted in their rejection or removal 
from the store, according to James Wagner, Extensions Platform Product Manager, 
explained in a blog post. It was then decided that Chrome Web Store would no longer 
accept extensions that mine cryptocurrency. However, the currency existing extensions 
with blockchain-related purposes other than cryptocurrency mining would still continue 
to be permitted in the Web Store. 
Apple  
Apple is one of the latest companies to ban cryptocurrency mining on their devices (28). 
It began with the release of a new set of developer guideline updates. Virtual currencies 
such as cryptocurrency heavily rely on cryptocurrency mining to sustain their existence. 
The process required using a computer’s processing power in order to obtain fractions of 
coins – this consumes an incredible amount of power. The power drains could potentially 
end up leading to a higher electricity bill, surpassing the price of what are mined. It could 
also put a significant burden on the mining device. The reason of Apple banning 
cryptocurrency mining seemed to be caused by the latter concern, as they banned 
cryptocurrency mining on their devices due to power consumption, and the potential of 
the process to put unnecessary pressure on the devices.  
36 
 
In summary, some countries actively ban cryptocurrency, while others opted to 
compromise by placing regulations in place. Concerns regarding cryptocurrency being 
used for crime seemed valid, but with regulations such as the new law implemented by 
Australia’s AUSTRAC would ensure transparency of DCEs, and assist in solving crimes by 
having DECs registered in the system, and keeping track into their activities. The new law 
would also help in monitoring DECs for any sign of criminal activities.  
Conclusion  
In conclusion, cryptocurrency indeed have a relation to crimes. There have been cases 
where cryptocurrency was used to commit a crime such as purchasing a drug, kidnapping 
a person and demand ransom in the form of cryptocurrency, and hacking into a 
cryptocurrency marketplace to steal cryptocurrency. Based on the crime types listed by 
ACIC, two crime categories have been proved to be related to cryptocurrency: 
cybercrime, and illicit drugs. In response to crimes related to cryptocurrency being 
committed, laws were put in place in several countries. Some laws were implemented to 
ban cryptocurrency completely such as in China, whereas others such as South Korea and 
Australia opted to regulate cryptocurrencies as opposed to completely banning them. As 
cryptocurrency are able to continue to rise, so too are the number of people that accept 
them as payments – this can be a cause for a crime. In this study, there was no search 
conducted on the relation between cryptocurrency against other crime types such as 
violence and arson. A future study concerning the relation between cryptocurrency and 
other crime types, including the lesser ones, would be helpful in identifying more ways 
cryptocurrency can be used, or related to a crime – this can help in placing laws, or create 
methods to counter, or solve those crimes.

Abstract  
Cryptocurrency is a relatively new form of investment. Its concept was first introduced in 
2009, and has grown ever since. To this day, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Just 
as other currencies, cryptocurrency can be related to a crime. Ever since its introduction 
nearly a decade ago, there have been crimes where cryptocurrency are related. 
According to ACIC’s crime types, cryptocurrency are related to two crime categories: 
cybercrime, and illicit drugs. There are also other cases where the type of crimes is not 
listed as a part of ACIC’s. To forensically examine exhibits related to digital crime 
involving cryptocurrency, tools such as Tableau Imager 3.1.2, EnCase 6.19.7, Internet 
Evidence Finder 6.2.3, and Winen.exe are available to assist in examination. Results 
obtained from such examination include includes identity of the owner or user of an 
account or device that was used in a crime, and matching address of a particular account 
to a transaction, including “criminal” transaction. One of the flaws of the mentioned tools 
was they were tested and proven in a study that was centred around Bitcoin and not 
cryptocurrency in general. Future studies can include testing the tools or similar tools, on 
other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Mixin.  
Keywords: Cryptocurrency, Forensic, Crime, Tool, Case.  
Introduction  
Cryptocurrency is a relatively new form of investment. The concept of cryptocurrency 
was first submitted by Satoshi Nakamoto (39), where it was highlighted that 
cryptocurrency eliminates the requirement of a middle-man, such as banks, and that 
users are able to safely and securely conduct transactions.  
47 
 
Cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset, as it does not physically exist in the actual world. 
Over the years, there has been an increase in the number of cryptocurrencies types, and 
their number in circulation. More people are starting to invest in them as well. The price 
of cryptocurrency differs between each type, and the price of a single cryptocurrency 
coin could be as expensive as $13,000 (bitcoin)(22). Being a currency, cryptocurrency can 
be used in a crime, or at least a motivation in a crime. There have been reports of cases 
that are related to cryptocurrency in the last decade since their creation. As such, there is 
a need to be able to forensically examine the items related to such crimes.  
The aim of this study is to explain cryptocurrency in details, including its components, and 
how they differ from flat currencies such as cash. A few cases that are related to 
cryptocurrency would also be discussed in order to understand their connection to 
cryptocurrency. The study is also aimed to explore the tools to forensically examine 
exhibits related to digital crime involving cryptocurrency.  
What is Cryptocurrency? 
Cryptocurrency are digital assets that are designed to work as a medium of exchange, 
using cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, 
and to verify the transfer of assets (21). Cryptocurrencies can be classified as a subset of 
digital currencies. What is unique regarding cryptocurrency is that they utilise 
decentralised system; in decentralised banking system, boards or governments does not 
hold control over the system (21). This differs from traditional banking system, which 
utilises centralised control.

Components of cryptocurrency 
Cryptocurrency trading involves several key components, including cryptocurrency keys, 
cryptocurrency wallets, blockchain, and cryptocurrency mining.  
Keys  
There are two types of keys that are essential in cryptocurrency trading: Private keys and 
Public keys. A private key is stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and proves ownership of a 
public key (14). A public key is connected to a particular amount of cryptocurrency, and 
can be used to access that amount (15).  
Private Key 
A private key is a sophisticated form of cryptography that allows a user to access his or 
her cryptocurrency. In cryptocurrency trade, a use is commonly given a public address 
and a private key to receive cryptocurrency in a form of coins or tokens. The private key is 
made up of 51 alphanumeric characters, which make it hard for a hacker to obtain (14).  
The private key of a user is typically stored in a digital wallet belonging to the same user. 
When a transaction is commenced, the wallet software creates a digital signature by 
processing the transaction with the private key.  The signature is then used to confirm 
that a transaction has come from a particular user, and ensures that the transaction 
cannot be changed one it has been broadcasted into a blockchain. If a transaction is 
altered, the signature will change as well (14).  
If the private key is lost, the user can no longer access their wallet to spend, withdraw, or 
transfer cryptocurrency (14). Hence, it is imperative that to save the private key in a 
secure location.  
49 
 
Public key  
The public key is where cryptocurrency funds are deposited and received. It is a 
cryptographic code that allows a user to receive cryptocurrencies into their account (15). 
When a user initiates their first transaction with a cryptocurrency, a unique pair of public 
key and private key is created. The transaction would also be broadcasted to the 
network, where distributed nodes confirm the validity of the transaction, before finalising 
it and recording it on the blockchain. It was noted that before a transaction is 
broadcasted, it needed to be signed digitally using the private key. The signature would 
prove the ownership of the private key, but not divulge the details of the private key to 
anyone.  
Since a public key is created based on the private key, the user’s public key is used to 
prove that the digital signature came from their private key. Once the transaction has 
been verified as valid, the cryptocurrency funds are sent to the recipient’s public address.  
The public address is a hashed version of a public key. Since the public key is made up of 
extremely long string of numbers, it needed to be compressed and shortened, hence the 
creation of public address. In other words, a private key generates a public key, which 
then generates a public address. When two users agreed to conduct a transaction, they 
would reveal their public addresses to each other. The sender needs the recipient’s public 
address to be able to send the funds to, which will then be able to spend or withdraw the 
amount using their private key. The recipient can also verify the sender’s batch of 
cryptocurrency coins using the sender’s public address, which is displayed on their 
screen.  
50 
 
Cryptocurrency wallets 
Cryptocurrency wallets are essential component of cryptocurrency. They are digital 
wallets that are used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency 
wallet is commonly used to store a private key that proves ownership of a public key, 
which is a public digital code connected to a particular amount of currency. 
Categories of cryptocurrency wallets  
Cryptocurrency wallets can be divided into two categories: cold wallet, and hot wallet. A 
cold wallet is generally considered to be effective for long-term storage of unused funds. 
A hot wallet is described as a type of wallet that is carried around for immediate use of 
the funds within. The key difference between hot and cold wallets is that hot wallets are 
connected to the internet, whereas cold wallets are not (5). Hot wallets are also 
considered to be more likely targets from hackers, as they’re connected to the internet – 
cold wallets are offline/not connected to the internet; they are safe from hackers (5, 24).  
However, despite having an offline feature to protect them from online threats, cold 
wallets are not immune to threats. A study found that a malware can be preinstalled, or 
pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet (30). Alternatively, it can infect the 
cold wallet’s system when removable media such as USB flash drives is inserted into the 
wallet’s computer in order to conduct a transaction. The study found that these attack 
methods have been repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade (1, 16, 37, 42, 45). 
After obtaining a foothold in the wallet, a hacker can then utilise various air-gap covert 
channel techniques, including physical, electromagnetic, electric, magnetic, acoustic, 
optical, and thermal techniques(31). In summary, even though cold wallets provide a high 
degree of isolation, it is still possible for attackers to compromise such wallets and steal 
private keys from the owners.  
51 
 
Mining  
Cryptocurrency mining is the process of generating new cryptocurrency in the form of 
coins. Cryptocurrency mining is called such, from to the fact that when transactions are 
added to the public ledger that is blockchain, new coins is created or in another word, 
mined (36).  
Miners 
As explained earlier, miners work together to verify transactions, ultimately mining new 
coins into the system. But that does not mean that all miners are on the same team. 
Cryptocurrency miners get rewarded in the form of some new coins for their hard work in 
mining coins, but the amount of coins rewarded are directly proportional to the 
contribution a miner had in the process of generating new coins (36). Hence, there are 
competitions amongst cryptocurrency miners in adding new transactions into the ledger 
as part of generating new coins.   
How cryptocurrency are mined  
In order to add transactions into a blockchain, all miners collect all transactions that were 
recently broadcasted by cryptocurrency users, verify the transactions, and compile them 
down into a transaction block – a condensed record of all transactions for that period of 
time. Cryptocurrency miners compete against each other to see who can solve a difficult, 
cryptographic puzzle first. As one miner found the solution, they broadcast the solution 
to all the other miners, for them to verify that the solution is correct. If the solution is 
indeed correct, the network adds the successfully-mined transaction block to the 
accepted blockchain permanently.  
Where cryptocurrencies are mined 
It was explained that cryptocurrencies are mined by miners, in which they solve a 
cryptographical puzzle to add transactional blocks into a blockchain, creating new coins 
52 
 
as a result. As such, cryptocurrency mining can be done from practically everywhere, 
providing that the miner has access to a computer with sufficient computing power (20).  
Blockchain  
In terms of cryptocurrency, a blockchain is a public ledger of all a cryptocurrency’s 
transactions. As new transactions are made, they are compiled into blocks, which will be 
added into the sequential blockchain. In order for a transaction to be considered 
successful, it has to be added into the blockchain. Once a transaction block is added into 
a blockchain, it will remain there permanently and is considered as public record (34).  
How to trade cryptocurrency  
Trading cryptocurrency requires having good background knowledge, and the 
components needed to trade cryptocurrency. The two main components a user needed 
to start trading cryptocurrency are cryptocurrency wallet, and cryptocurrency exchange. 
In terms of having good background knowledge, there are several notes to consider. First, 
a beginner should choose a trading company with a good reputation that offers an 
exchange and a wallet. A beginner should also trade prominent coins, as starter. Bitcoin 
and Ethereum are two of the most prominent coins as of June 2018 (22, 41).  
How to spend cryptocurrency  
One of the major concerns regarding cryptocurrency is finding ways to spend it. 
Conducting a search using a search engine was thought to be one of the best ways to look 
for ways, or merchants who accepts cryptocurrency. Gambling is also a way to spend 
cryptocurrency (43) 
53 
 
Spending cryptocurrency is not always possible, as some countries have banned trading 
of cryptocurrency. Some countries opted for a compromise in the form of regulations. 
Government regulations will be discussed in more detail below.  
Government regulations  
In response to several concerns such as environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining 
and the risks of owning cryptocurrency, several governments had decided to take actions 
against cryptocurrency. Actions taken include total banning, and putting regulations in 
place.  
China  
As at February 2018, China had completely banned cryptocurrency trading within their 
country. The process actually began in September 2017, where it was announced that 
Chinese regulators declaring initial coin offerings illegal. This meant that cryptocurrency 
owners are not allowed to promote, much less sell, their cryptocurrency to anyone in the 
country. The regulatory action was said to be caused by growing fear from initial coin 
offerings, which caught investors’ imagination that further led to phishing activities (6).  
Ultimately, cryptocurrency was banned in total starting from February 2018. It was 
announced that the Chinese government’s recent attempts to stamp out digital currency 
trading by shutting down domestic cryptocurrency exchanges were not successful in 
completely eradicating cryptocurrency trading, and that the government will strengthen 
measures to thoroughly remove any onshore or offshore trading platforms related to 
virtual currency trading (7).  
54 
 
South Korea 
South Korea is another country that moved to regulate cryptocurrency. Initially, it was 
reported that South Korea planned to ban cryptocurrency trading, in light of 
cryptocurrency abuse. South Korea’s justice minister at that time, Park Sung-Ki, 
mentioned there being great concerns regarding virtual currencies (19, 28). However, as 
at mid-January 2018, a ban had not been placed, but instead considered taxing 
cryptocurrency transactions, according to the South Korean finance minister at that time, 
Kim Dong-Yeon (18). Ultimately, the South Korean government officially banned 
anonymous cryptocurrency trading commencing at the end of January 2018 (17). This 
meant that cryptocurrency traders could only conduct cryptocurrency transactions from 
bank accounts set up under their real names.  
Ukraine & Kazakhstan 
Ukraine had started to intensify the search for methods to regulate cryptocurrencies, due 
to growing concerns in their capital, Kiev, that exploitation of the digital assets by 
criminals and geopolitical adversaries presented a growing national security risk (40). 
Ukraine’s national security and defence council chief at that time, Oleksandr Turchynov, 
warned that the current legal vacuum posed a threat to the economy and security of the 
state. He also mentioned that given the rapid development of cryptocurrencies around 
the world, the issue could not be left out of attention, hence the plans to develop 
regulations. The soaring prices of cryptocurrency have made the market an increasingly 
lucrative target for cyber criminals. There was also a growing concern among regulators 
and governments that cryptocurrency could be used by organised crime-groups for 
money laundering (2, 35), and other criminal activities.  
55 
 
In a response to growing concerns of cryptocurrency being used, or simply being related 
to crimes, The Kazakhstan Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency submitted a 
proposal to the EAEU to create an advisory board on blockchain and cryptocurrency (10). 
The proposal was submitted during the Cryptoconference 2018 in Almaty, and had 
gathered some support for governments to adopt legislation to regulate the 
cryptocurrency market. The regulation was also aimed to prevent the use of 
cryptocurrency as a tool for illegal transactions, the legalisation of proceeds from crime, 
and the financing of terrorism.  
Australia  
As at April 2018, new laws for DCE providers operating in Australia were implemented by 
AUSTRAC (11). The new laws would cover regulation of service providers of 
cryptocurrency, such as cryptocurrency exchange marketplace.  
The AUSTRAC CEO, Nicole Rose, announced that the new laws would strengthen the 
agency’s compliance and intelligence capabilities to help DCEs implement systems and 
controls that can minimise the risk of criminals using them for purposes such as money 
laundering, terrorism financing, and cybercrime. With the new laws in place, DCEs with a 
business operation located in Australia must now register with AUSTRAC, and meet the 
government’s AML/CTF compliance and reporting obligations.  
How cryptocurrencies differ from flat currencies 
As explained earlier, cryptocurrency differs from regular, flat currency. The difference lies 
in two major ways. Cryptocurrencies are only accepted as payment by other users – if no 
one accepts it, then it is considered worthless. Flat currency however, will always be 
accepted as payment by the government, at the very least. The second major difference 
56 
 
is that cryptocurrency token supply is not managed by a central authority, whereas flat 
currency is managed by the government and can lead to either inflation, or deflation.  
Popular cryptocurrencies (latest price)  
There are thousands of cryptocurrency. It can be hard to determine which cryptocurrency 
is the best, or worst. There are several parameters that can be used to rank 
cryptocurrency: their price, market cap, supply rate, and existing volume in circulation. In 
terms of price, the four highest-ranked cryptocurrency as at June 2018 are Bitcoin, 
Bitcoin Cash, Mixin, and Ethereum (22).  
Crime types in Australia 
The types of crimes in Australia will be listed, and matched with some of the cases related 
to cryptocurrency discussed below. The types of crime happened in Australia according to 
Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) are illicit drugs, fraud, financial crimes, 
illicit firearms, money laundering, cybercrime, identity crime, exploitation of business 
structures, public sector corruption, and violence (8).  
Some of the most recent crimes in relation to cryptocurrency  
To understand more as to how cryptocurrency can be related to crimes, various case 
involving cryptocurrency in general, or a particular cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, various 
case that occurred in the last decade will be discussed below. Swoop for cases that 
occurred in the last decade was decided, as cryptocurrency, or at least the proof-of-
concept, was published in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto (39).  
57 
 
6 December 2017 – Hacking of NiceHash  
One of the case examples to be explained is the cyber-attack against Nicehash. The crime 
happened on the 6th of December 2017, where NiceHash, a crypto-mining company 
based in Slovenia, reported that their system was breached in a cyber-attack(4).  
In terms of bitcoin-theft, the case was not the first reported case in the field. In February 
2014, Mt. Gox, a bitcoin exchange based in Japan, reported a theft of 850,000 coins (12). 
Those bitcoins were worth nearly $500 million at that time. Mt. Gox were shut down not 
long after the case (13), and filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan, later that year (3). A 
study of this case found that a meteoric rise in price and rapid growth were associated 
with cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin – this also attracted thieves/hackers (25).  
Blockchain-related – Child pornography  
In a report published in March 2018, German researchers found about 1,600 files of non-
financial data, some linking to, or actually containing child pornography, and other 
objectionable materials, on the blockchain system that stores bitcoin transactions (44). It 
was explained that users of blockchain are able to add non-financial data for purposes 
such as describing a transaction’s purpose, and insert benign messages or record 
information for other financial services. The objectionable contents were found to be 
imbedded in such data, and given that blockchain are viewable by practically all users, the 
data would be downloaded and persistently stored by them.  
This discovery would place certain users of the bitcoin network in legal difficulties. The 
researchers also mentioned that this discovery could pose an obstacle for greater 
adoption and mainstream acceptance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Upon 
further analysis, the researchers found that most of the files were harmless, but some of 
the files contained copyright violations and the disclosure of the people’s identifiable 
58 
 
information, and at least eight files were said to containing sexual content (27). Amongst 
the child pornography materials, two files were found to contain 274 links to child 
pornography websites, and a file depicting a nude image of a minor.  
Experts said that the files were likely to be downloaded as a part of notes to transactions, 
or inserted as the transactions themselves. Users of blockchain are able to add non-
financial data for purposes such as describing a transaction’s purpose insert benign 
messages, or record information for other financial services – anyone with access to 
bitcoin software such as miners, exchanges, and traders, have the ability to upload any 
content into the blockchain.  
Arbitrary data insertion methods for bitcoin’s blockchain  
As explained before, aside from recording financial transactions, Bitcoin’s blockchain are 
also able to be filled with non-financial data. Non-financial data can take a form of short 
messages via special transaction types, or even complete files. To add complete files into 
a blockchain, arbitrary data has to be encoded as standard transactions. There are two 
insertion methods for non-financial data: low-level insertion methods, and content 
insertion services.  
Benefits and risks of arbitrary blockchain content 
Bitcoin’s blockchain design included several ways to insert arbitrary, non-financial data 
into its blockchain, both intentionally, and unintentionally. Potential benefits of engraving 
arbitrary data into the bitcoin’s blockchain and the risks associated with them will be 
discussed further below.  
Benefits  
Bitcoin offered Coinbase, a digital currency exchange headquarters, and OP_RETURN, a 
special transaction template that allows one small data chunk as an attachment onto a 
59 
 
transaction, as explicit channels to insert small chunks of non-financial data into their 
blockchain. The benefit of using OP_RETURN is that different services use OP_RETURN to 
link non-financial assets such as vouchers, to bitcoin’s blockchain.  
Risks  
There are several risks associated with adding data into blockchain content, including 
copyright violations, malware, privacy violations, politically sensitive content, and illegal 
& condemned content.  
In short, there are ways for someone to add an objectionable content into a blockchain, 
and cause harm if possessed or accessed by other users. Unlike systems such as social 
media platforms, file-sharing networks, and online storage systems, contents that are 
stored in a blockchain can be do so while remaining anonymous, making it hard to trace 
the culprit.  
Examining the data (non-financial data) 
There are three methods to examine non-financial data in a blockchain: low-level 
insertion methods detectors, and service detectors, and suspicious transaction detectors.  
Low-level insertion method detectors 
The low-level insertion method detectors were designed to match individual transactions 
that are likely to contain non-financial data. They detect manipulated financial 
transactions, as well as OP_RETURN, non-standard, and Coinbase transactions.  
Service detectors  
The service detectors enabled the detection and extraction of files based on the service’ 
protocols, and also tracking of data used in service-created transactions.  
60 
 
Suspicious transaction detectors  
The suspicious transaction detectors examine standard transactions that are likely to 
carry non-financial data, but were not detected. For a transaction to be examined by this 
method, it has to have at least 50 suspicious outputs.  
Illegal drugs  
There was a reported case in India about a drug trade related to cryptocurrency (9). An 
arrest was made by the police against two university students that were caught 
purchasing drugs using cryptocurrencies. The duo would purchase an amount of drug, 
and then have it transported into a particular place where it’ll be picked up.  
It was not the first case where cryptocurrency was used to purchase drugs. There was a 
case in 2011, where a university student sold/auction drugs via an online drug 
marketplace called ‘Silk Road’. The student had created a fake profile and auctioned 
drugs online, where customers would buy, and have it delivered to an address of their 
choice. The method of payment was cryptocurrency, with different drugs cost different 
amount of coins. The case was ultimately solved when police made an arrest of the 
student in a public library, where he logged in into his Silk Road profile (33).  
9 March 2018 
In a newspaper article published on March 2018, it was announced that Pavel Lerner, a 
cryptocurrency businessman, was kidnapped in Ukraine by armed assailants, and was 
forced to pay $1 million ransom in the form of bitcoins from his digital wallet (38).  
Base on the case examples mentioned, in terms of type of crimes in Australia by ACIC, 
cryptocurrency had been used in two categories of crimes: illicit drugs (Silk Road), 
cybercrime (hacking of NiceHash).  
61 
 
Cryptocurrency’s forensic significance 
As it was evident that cryptocurrency were used in various crimes, the need to 
understand how to forensically examine the items involved in a crime arose. It was 
explained earlier that to conduct a cryptocurrency transaction, a person would require a 
device (cryptocurrency wallet) and an account (of a particular cryptocurrency) (22, 41). As 
such, forensic examination would be conducted surrounding those components, both 
digital and hardware, that make up cryptocurrency transaction (26).  
A study was done in 2015 by Michael Doran on forensically examine Bitcoin 
artefacts/exhibits. Details on various aspects of forensic examinations explained in that 
study will be included in discussions below. 
Investigation process of digital evidence 
According to DFRWS 2001, a successful Investigation Process in Digital Forensic science 
would contain 6 phases: 1) Identification, 2) Preparation, 3) Collection, 4) Examination, 5) 
Analysis, and 6) Presentation (26, 32). Processing a case surrounding cryptocurrency can 
be difficult due to the principles that Nakamoto implemented to keep cryptocurrency 
transactions anonymous. Due to anonymity, some evidence are more difficult to obtain 
and interpret (29).  
Despite the difficulties, a successful investigation can be done by escalating though the 
process of the Investigation Process for Digital Forensic Science. It was mentioned that in 
the Collection phase, the forensic investigator needs to search for, document, and collect 
any object or data that could potentially contain digital evidence (23). These objects 
include cell phones, PDAs, laptops, tablets, desktop computers, or iPods. Various types of 
evidence may be available in the memory compartment relating to cryptocurrency, 
62 
 
including running cryptocurrency processes and services, system information, 
information about logged-in users, registry information, chats history, recent 
cryptocurrency web-browsing activities, and running cryptocurrency malware. As 
evidence are collected, either physically or via data extraction or imaging, the forensic 
investigator can begin examining data and assigning the level of importance of each 
evidence (26).  
Investigation methods of digital evidence 
As explained above, evidence such as laptop and desktop computer can be collected and 
examined in regards to digital forensic investigation. To examine such evidence, both 
traditional and digital approach should be taken.  
Traditional forensic 
In this approach, a forensic examiner would examine the device itself, rather than the 
content. Aspects to consider include fingerprints, and DNA evidence from a sample that 
may be present on the exhibit. In dusting for fingerprints, the investigator would dust 
areas that are prominent with samples, such as keyboard on a laptop, and display touch-
screen on a modern cell phone (46).  
Digital forensic 
The digital approach would examine the “content” of an exhibit such as laptop, rather 
than the surface. In the study by Doran in 2015, several tools were mentioned and used, 
including Tableau Imager 3.1.2, EnCase 6.19.7, Internet Evidence Finder 6.2.3, and 
Winen.exe (26). Tableau Imager 3.1.2 is a forensic imaging tool that is used to acquire a 
bit-for-bit copy of a piece of media. Encase 6.19.7 is a forensic program designed for 
forensic examiners and trained investigators who conducts full forensic examinations on 
63 
 
any type of digital media. Encase allows the forensic examiner to acquire data rapidly 
from various types of device, and perform an in-depth forensic analysis of the media.  
Internet Evidence Finder 6.2.3 is a forensic program that allows forensic investigators to 
recover data from social networking sites, instant messenger chats, file-sharing apps, 
mobile backups, web-browser history, and pictures & videos. In the study by Doran in 
2015, the Internet Evidence Finder produced information such as the Public Key and the 
Public Key hash of addresses, and transaction history that was conducted in the test 
environment. By revealing the presence and identity of a Public Key in a particular device, 
it can be concluded that the owner or the user of the Key was indeed involved in a 
particular transaction - this could help in solving investigating illegal transactions such as 
drug payments, terrorist funding.  
Lastly, Winen.exe is a RAM acquisition tool that collects information from a RAM and 
places the collected information into a file that can be stored on an external device (26). 
In the study by Doran in 2015, the analysis of a RAM under test environment provides 
results that matched the Bitcoin wallet addresses, transactions, and Bitcoin applications 
on the test system.  
Conclusion  
In conclusion, cryptocurrency indeed have a relation to crimes. There have been cases 
where cryptocurrency was used to commit a crime such as purchasing a drug, kidnapping 
a person and demand ransom in the form of cryptocurrency, and hacking into a 
cryptocurrency marketplace to steal cryptocurrency. Based on the crime types listed by 
ACIC, two crime categories have been proved to be related to cryptocurrency: 
cybercrime, and illicit drugs. As cryptocurrency are able to continue to rise, so too are the 
64 
 
number of people that accept them as payments – this can be a cause for a crime. It was 
proven in a study conducted in 2015 by Michael Doran that tools such as Tableau Imager 
3.1.2, EnCase 6.19.7, Internet Evidence Finder 6.2.3, and Winen.exe could be used to 
forensically examine the content of an exhibit related to digital crime. Information that 
can be acquired through such investigation includes identity of the owner or user of an 
account or device that was used in a crime, and matching address of a particular account 
to a transaction, including “criminal” transaction. One of the flaws of the study by Doran 
in 2015 was that the study was centred on Bitcoin and not cryptocurrency in general. 
Future study could try replicating or conducting similar study using similar tools used, on 
other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Mixin.

CRYPTOCURRENCY FUNCTIONING IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
The article reveals a conceptual basis of the cryptocurrency functioning. The main types of 
cryptocurrencies are featured and analyzed as well as their general strengths and weaknesses. 
Based on the price dynamics correlation analysis of some cryptocurrency types, a general low level 
of dependence between digital assets is established. The main functions of the cryptocurrency are 
formulated in the form of transformed money functions. Also, additional functions of cryptocurrencies 
are defined on the basis of their innovative nature, as well as the role in the modern financial system 
and world economic relations.

The emergence of cryptocurrencies has been a logical development of the electronic 
money network with the main paradigm of decentralization, high anonymity and issue 
low cost.
The term «cryptocurrency» began to be used after the emergence of Bitcoin pay-
ment system, which was developed in 2009 by a person or group of people under the 
pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (Nakamoto, 2008). Despite the rapid rise in popularity,

today there is no single internationally recognized definition of cryptocurrency, which 
would clearly reveal its essence and economic nature. The development of the conceptu-
alization of the cryptocurrencies phenomenon became relevant only in recent years that 
happened due to the emergence of hundreds of new cryptocurrencies, blockchain plat-
forms and strengthening their role in the modern financial system. To some extent, this 
is explained due to this instrument novelty and the technical solutions diversity imple-
mented in the electronic payment systems.
Scientists like D.Weber, D. Seldin, D. Dwayer, О. Dzhusov, G. Karlstrom etc. investigated 
prospects for the use of cryptocurrency as part of the new world monetary and financial 
system and its potential benefits and risks. Such scientists as A.Herve, M. Wilson, A. Yelow-
itz and others began development in the framework of this subject, focusing only on the 
legal and theoretical aspects of the cryptocurrency disclosure as an economic category 
without affecting the questions of its practical use as an investment tool. The portfolio 
theory works of  H. Markowitz, J. Tobin, J. Fama, K. French, W.Sharpe and others became 
the theoretical basis of the cryptocurrency inclusion in investment portfolio.
However, despite the existing achievements in this field, cryptocurrency conceptual 
foundations in the global economy with a clear definition of the cryptocurrency roles in 
world processes require further disclosure and more detailed studies.
The aim of this work is the definition of the cryptocurrency functioning conceptual 
basis in the global economy. The methodological basis of the research was formed by 
the works of scientists, the statistics of the origin, development and dynamics of the 
cryptocurrency functioning. The study was conducted on the basis of dialectical, analytical, 
systematic methods and scientific abstraction. For comparison of the price dynamics 
for different types of cryptocurrency mathematical method of correlation analysis was 
applied.
There are 3 main definitions of the «cryptocurrency» concept in scientific circles as:
1. a form of digital currency, whose emisson and accountingare based on asymmet-
ric encryption and the use of different cryptographic protection methods (Angel, 2015);
2. innovative payment network and a new form of money that uses the P2P (people-
to-people) technology, that operates without a central controlling authority or the bank, 
transaction processing and emissions are produced collectively by the efforts of the net-
work (Gervais, 2014);
3. a special kind of electronic money that is based on a decentralized mechanism of 
issue and circulation and has a complex system of information and technological proce-
dures that are built on cryptographic methods of protection, governing the identification 
of owners and fixation of their changes facts (Ober, 2013).
A key feature of cryptocurrencies is the lack of any internal or external administra-
tor. Therefore, banks, tax, judicial and other public or private bodies may not affect the 
transactions of all participants in the payment system (Kobrin, 1997). Such a situation 
facilitates the anonymous use of the cryptocurrency and provides the irreversibility of the 
deals, so no one can cancel, block, challenge or be forced to make a transaction without 
access to the private key of the owner.
Generally, cryptocurrency developers are setting a first upper limit for the total 
emissions. However, some cryptocurrencies have no fixed upper limit of emissions with 
possible reverse process of demission (by annihilating a small fixed amount in each 
transaction).
The emergence of cryptocurrencies has led to the emergence of a new phenomenon, 
that is difficult to be classified in the financial and industrial activities. For instance, mining – 
is the process of obtaining compensation in the form of a certain number of cryptocur-
rency for the use of their computing power to verify each next block of payments.
The cryptocurrencies also has some disadvantages. The main one is the high price 
volatility, which affects the incentives for the accumulation of such currency and increases 
the cost of hedging (volatility of gold averages around 1.2%, while other major currencies 
average between 0,5 % to 1,0 %). Other crucial drawback of cryptocurrencies is the low

awareness and the difficulty in understanding  by potential consumers. This limits the 
range of users of such currency and make currency only «for the elite» network members.
The governments of the world have different views on the cryptocurrency: 1. Global 
supporters of the pioneer countries, whose governments have already taken steps to 
promote cryptocurrency and management parity for the virtual currency (Japan, Sweden, 
Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Belarus, Estonia, USA, Spain, UK, South Korea, Australia, 
Chile, Canada); 2. Neutral countries – governments that do not do any steps and do not 
provide any legal or regulatory protection for users of cryptocurrency (this group includes 
most countries of the world); 3. Opponents  – the countries that have taken measures 
to decrease the use of virtual currency or prevent cryptocurrency usage on its territory 
(China, Turkey, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Lebanon, Bangladesh). Venezuela until recently was 
an extreme opponent of of the cryptocurrencies usage, however, in 2018it announced 
the introduction of the national cryptocurrency, which aims to improve the economic 
situation of the country.
Cryptocurrency as the financial trend of a new generation attracts the attention not 
only of scientists, IT-experts and corporate sector, but also creates «schools» that represent 
their vision of the concept of cryptocurrencies, and its use in the future. Concerning the 
use of cryptocurrency Bitcoin, there are two main way of seeing the applicability of this 
currency (Figure 1).
The first group consists of the so-called «bitcoin radicals» who believe that the 
cryptocurrency will be used as a complete substitute for modern currency and money in 
the traditional sense, but their purpose has rather ideological arguments rather than real 
solutions to the modern monetary problems (Greenspans, 2016).
The second group – representatives of the «аltchain» – see cryptocurrencyas more 
than just a sharing tool. Cryptocurrency is a new tool of enrichment, which brings a 
lot of prospects (Penney, 2017). This group consists of investors, in the classic sense  – 
corporations and individual investors wishing to increase their capital, that are informally 
called «private boys». 
At the beginning of 2017 the total value of all cryptocurrencies was $17.7 bln. In a 
year(at the beginning of 2018), their total market capitalization already amounted to $800 
bln. Now Bitcoin builds up 47% of this amount.
In 2017, the ether cryptocurrency has grown up to 4407 % and the capitalization 
of this cryptocurrency amounted at$83.6 bln (table 1). One of the important reasons for 
the popularity of the ether this year was the creation of Ethereum Enterprise Alliance – 
corporate enterprises who aim to use cryptocurrency for business. 
Ripple was the third currency by market capitalization with the14406  % growth on 
theyear beginning. Competitive advantage of Ripple comes from its blockchain, which 
is focused on the financial services sector, that allows investors to process international 
remittances. The main function of the Ripple is the use as exchange currency (currency 
bridge) for cross-border transfers when you need to convert one currency into another.

By the end of 2017, the Ripple has become the most profitable coin for 2017, showing a 
yield of 34,000 %. On January 1st, 2017, the cryptocurrency was worth about 0,0065 USD 
and a year later – 853 USD.
Ripple was created and is being controlled by the same company in San Francisco. 
Unlike ordinary cryptocurrencies, Ripple is not mined. Firstly, it was immediately released 
100 bln XRP coins, each of them is divided into a million small pieces, which are called 
«drops» –20 % drop of issued coins of the creators left, and the remaining 80% is intended 
for use on the Ripple network. There are about 39 bln coins in circulation today.
The average cost of the transaction in the Ripple network is hundredths of a cent. On 
the background of this amount of fee in the Bitcoin network look much higher (Figure 2).

At the same time the Ripple network processed more than 1500 transactions per 
one second. And one transaction is processed in 4 seconds, which is faster than any other 
cryptocurrency in the top-10 by market capitalization (Figure 3).
Сryptocurrency XEM, the twelfth by market capitalization, demonstrated high 
growth pace in 2017, rising in price by 39490  %. This cryptocurrency also have a spe-
cial type of blockchain with possibility of safe and effective money transfers. XEM 
is a regional cryptocurrency where the users are mainly concentrated in South-East 
Asia. 
A Verge network has shown the largest increase (219780 %), which occupies the 20th 
place in chart of market capitalization. This little-known virtual currency started the year 
with a cost of $0,000007 for the coin XVG and grew to about 0,05$.
The value of the cryptocurrency, thatis formedby the specific market of supply and 
demand is growing, however, between different currencies, there is a high dynamic ratio 
of prices. Sometimes changes in the price of currencies have the same direction, some-
times opposite, occasionally their correlation is very low. In certain cases, markets develop 
commonly and clear but in short-term trends, when the value of most altcoins is changing 
in the same direction.
Correlation analysis of pricedynamics on some types of cryptocurrencies over the 
past two years has revealed a general low level of correlation between digital assets, 
except for a Bitcoin-Litecoin couple (table 2). This happens due to the fact that Litecoin 
to a certain extent is a «branch»of bitcoin and uses similar technology and principles, but 
even the ratio of their prices sometimes diverge.
As the international legal status of cryptocurrencies currently is not defined, it 
is impossible to attribute this kind of tool to any of the financial categories. However, 
cryptocurrencies have become an element of world economic processes and took over a 
large number of economic and financial functions (Figure 4).

Cryptocurrency functions are not measured only by the functions of 
money;moreover, they enhance the understanding of them, transforming and globaliz-
ing, that is becoming an output to a new level. The intrinsic value of cryptocurrency can 
be considered conditionally zero because, although it is not supported by the value of 
the produced economy of goods and services, but the demands of the economic factors 
for production costs are not zero. Therefore, the function of value measure of the classical 
moneycryptocurrencies perform in the process of exchange and payments. 
As a medium of exchange, cryptocurrencies is in direct turnover, though limited 
by Internet market. At the same time, the cryptocurrency is devoid of the limitations on 
the capabilities of transaction  – each of the owners can pay to anyone, anywhere and 
anything. Transaction is impossible to control or prevent, so that you can make transfers 
anywhere in the world. That is, again, comparing cash with traditional money, you can see 
that they are the world money, or even global in nature.
Cryptocurrency are not issuing loans, it is not used in the repayment of debt. But in 
case that the cryptocurrency will become legal tender at the level of states and the global 
economy, the potential use of cryptocurrency as a tool of circulation and payment will 
increase significantly. Accordingly, functionally there is a clear link between the increase 
in payment opportunities of cryptocurrencies and their circulation.
An overwhelming number of cryptocurrency owners are the owners more than 
active users and view the cryptocurrency as a tool of enrichment, which is a wider concept 
than a function of storage in conventional money, since it focuses on the ability of the 
speculative aspect of using cryptocurrency. In general, cryptocurrenciesperform function 
as short-term storage worse because of excessive instability, but could be effective in 
medium – and long-term storage tools (Ali, 2017).

As the object of investment, cryptocurrency fulfills the function of the investor 
reserve funds while acquiring a high risk and unpredictability. Cryptocurrency can bring 
rapid and unexpected income caused by external factors, trends and scientific and 
technological progress. 
One of the criteria for the selection of investment object among cryptoassets is the 
direct acquaintance with technical characteristics and features of networks. Platform and 
the blockchain system can be created onbitcoin-based technology (Bitcoin Blockchain), 
to be independent (Non-Bitcoin Blockchain) or is a separate system not tied to blockchain-
system (Non-Blockchain) (Garcia et al., 2015). Understanding of network characteristics 
gives potential investors an insights to the possible problems, features and advantages, 
thatwill have a direct relationship to the market value in the future.
Cryptocurrency allows companies not only to produce its own currency, whose rate 
will depend on the success of the company, but also allows you to start the whole life 
cycle of capital, including its production, storage and trading.
Schematically the relationship between the main types cryptoassets can be seen in 
figure 5. Cryptocurrency in the classical sense has evolved into a full-fledged financial 
instrument through the mechanism of initial offering and has a tendency to turn into a real 
financial instrument in the future that will reflect the increase in values in the real sector of 
the economy, and not only limited to electronic space and cryptographic rewards.
The Initial Coin Offering (ICO), or Initial Public Coin Offering (IPCO) is a decentralised 
means by which funds are being raised for the new cryptocurrencyprojects (NCC, 2016). 
ICO is used by start-ups to bypass the strict and regulated process of raising capital that 
is required of venture capital investors or banks. ICO campaigns include some percent of 
cryptocurrency that will be released for sale for early fans and enthusiasts of the project in 
exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, but usually bitcoins.
Coins of new cryptocurrency are called tokens and can be compared with the shares 
at their initial offering on the classic exchanges. If the collected amount of money does 
not meet the minimum specified level of project the funds are returned to sponsors and 
ICO is considered a failure (Allison-McCloskey Escrow Company, 2016).
When cryptocurrency start-up firm wants to raise funds for the initial placement of 
the coins, it is usually consists a plan that includes the following items (NCC, 2016):
1. the concept of the project;
2. what goals the project will accomplish by its end;
3. how much money is needed to support the campaign;
4. how many virtual tokens the «discoverers» of the project will keep;
5. what are the types of currency accepted for exchange;
6. how long the ICO campaign will last.

Early investors are usually motivated to buy cryptocurrency in the hope that the plan 
will be successful after its launch that will result in the rising cost of cryptocurrency.
An example of one of the most successful projects, which became profitable for 
early investors, was a platform for smart contracts –  Ethereum, which issued the currency 
«ether» as a token of their project (Ethereumdecentralizedplatform, 2018). In 2014, the 
Ethereum project was announced and posted at the primary collected funds for $18 mln 
in bitcoins at a cost of $0,40 for 1 ether. The project continued in 2015 and 2016 and 
the cost of ether increased to $14 (or 30 times), and the capitalization of the project has 
reached more than $1 bln. 
The ICO have many features in common with the IPO (Initial Public Offering). By 
analogy with the IPO, in the ICO share of the start-up company is sold to raise funds 
to further  activities of the enterprise project (Ethereum decentralized platform, 2018). 
However, while IPO deals with investors, there are proponents and enthusiasts in ICO who 
want to invest in a new project, so the process is similar to crowdfunding.
ICO also has common characteristics with venture capital financing and crowdfund-
ing, but alongside it occupies a separate niche in the investment market. The common 
with crowdfunding is the use of small size attachments of individuals for the project 
financing. As for ICO and crowdfunding – they both do not need the specialized banks 
or institutions for investment, raising funds are operated through online platforms and 
social networks, any person can be in the role ofthe investor (NCC, 2016).
And the main difference between ICO and crowdfunding is that the supporters of the 
initial placement of the coins are motivated by potential profit, however crowdfunding 
occurs in the form of donations and lack of prospects in receiving financial benefits from 
the project.
In turn, venture financing aimed at projects with the prospect of mid-growth and 
becomes an alternative way for innovative start-up companies without access to capital 
markets.
The high rate of growth, risk and assessment requirements to business monitoring 
of projects are the common features of venture financing and ICO, in contrast to 
crowdfunding. 
Cryptocurrencies use different algorithms, the method of extraction and trade takes 
place in different ways. In order to select the optimal currency for an investment portfolio, you 
need to consider 3 main groups of characteristics (Cryptocurrency Data Monitor BFX, 2018):
1. мarket capitalization, daily trading volume and the dynamics of the currency value 
(quantitative indicators);
2. мethod of verification;
3. рopularity and currency usage.
The main criteria for evaluation for the future cryptocurrency investor should be 
the prospect of the currency, based on the unique feature and the latest technology. 
This will ensure a steady growth of its value and popularity among users. In the study 
of cryptocurrencies, we have identified key indicators and features that may become 
significant about the inclusion of currency in the investment portfolio. Such a criteria may 
be technological, energetic, financial, scientific or other value that cryptocurrency can 
offer:
1. the exceptional anonymity of the transaction (Dash);
2. less energy consumption and performance of the transaction (BlackCoin, Dash, 
Litecoin, Peercoin);
3. а high level of security (Dogecoin);
4. the possibility of creating a decentralized system of domain names (Namecoin).
5. startup promotion and creation of platforms for crowdfunding by implementing a 
full-fledged fiscal system online (Nxt).
6. using computational power of its users to conduct mathematical research and 
solving highly complex problems that will serve for a science (Primecoin).
7. the creation of a decentralized exchange (Ripple).

Digital currency can have a profitable role in the country’s financial system, because 
they can be used to create a banking system that is mainly based on the cryptocurrency. 
But now there are significant barriers to any digital currency to become the dominant 
form of money in the economy. Theoretical study of John. Barreira and M. Cumhots identi-
fied what the consequences would be if the Central Bank will issue digital currency in the 
amount of 30 % of GDP based on a dynamic general equilibrium model according to the 
pre-crisis United States. The authors argue that, although the lack of historical precedent 
reduces the accuracy of their prediction, the adoption of cryptocurrency by the Central 
banks will have positive effects (Barrdear, 2016).
The Venezuelan government, in turn, decided to prove in practice the effectiveness 
of alternative digital banking system and was the first to introduce a national cryptocur-
rency in February of 2018 as a public tool for anti-inflationary crisis regulation. Venezuela 
believes that it is possible with the help of national cryptocurrency to overcome financial 
blockade by the US and hyperinflation in the country.
The concept of cryptocurrency and its infrastructure in the form of a distributed 
network based on decentralized blockchain technology create an alternative way of the 
world financial systemfunctioning of with the possibility of «programming» money. Al-
though the current global financial system is unchanged, but the cryptocurrency is be-
coming an indispensable element.
Prospects for the cryptocurrency usageas a part of the global financial system, ac-
cording to experts, will affect all areas of our lives. The areas associated with the stock 
market, the search for new financial tools to raise funds and the extension of private capi-
tal will gain popularity (Dzhusov, 2017).
Digital currencies and a distributed blockchain network will make it easy to 
individuals to credit and microfinance in the field of P2P (people-to-people or person-to-
person) on the basis of mutual consent and consensus, minimizing transaction costs and 
the intervention of 3rd parties.
Cryptoinvestments has opened a new channel of capital increase in a volatile financial 
system. A striking example is shown by the countries of Latin America. In 2015, a published 
report estimated an increase of 510 % in the number cryptocurrency transactions in Latin 
America, and the conduct of cryptocurrency business is promising (Cryptocurrency and 
Bitcoin Related Spread Sheet for ICO Investing & Reference, 2017). This is promising mainly 
due to the adverse economic situation in many countries in the region, the corruption of 
all parts of the financial system, high inflation, instability of the investment climate that 
hinders the development of small and medium business, unfavorable bank rates and the 
lack of depositors’ guarantees.
Venezuela is a vivid example of this: in January 2016, the IMF published a report 
according to which in 2016 the inflation rate in the country has exceeded 700 %. In 2017, 
according to IMF estimates, the inflation rate should have been 1600 % (Dwyer, 2015). But 
along with the inflation growth, Venezuela increased and the number of transactions in 
Bitcoin: in the first week of August, the amount of BTC transactions through the platform 
LocalBitcoins reached a record $14,2 mln. The number of Bitcoin users in 2015 doubled 
compared to 2014 (Bitcoinaverage.com, 2016).
The immediate prospect for cryprtoassets is the integration of virtual platforms with 
the actual business. This communication will become in-depth and comprehensive, that 
will be shown not only at the level of individual companies but will create a full blockchain 
infrastructure of the business environment.
In the example plan of the Waves – most famous cryptoplatform, the next stage of 
the system development will be to attract real business to issue their securities in the 
blockchain network (Waves Platform, 2018). High attention will be paid to compatibility 
issues of technology with the law.The goal of this project is the creation of an ecosystem 
that is fully consistent with the legislation in the field of securities and remittances.
A significant factor in the further cryptocurrenciypopularization and development 
will be the support of classic banking sector, and not the complete isolation of the 
118

blockchain from the state. This communication will occur on the principles of symbiosis 
and mutual benefit by providing potential investors and cryptocurrency users the right of 
choice and ease of transaction.
A vivid example of this perspective was the opening of the first BitcoinBank in Vienna 
in Austria (2017).The local blockchain startup Bit Trust owns the Bitcoin Bank (Dwyer, 
2015). The Bank has special ATMs that allow you to have BTC exchanged for euro and vice 
versa.
Cryptocurrency has traditionally been considered as a modern type of financial 
innovation (Panteljejeva, 2015), but the true innovation stems from the work of 
«production» the cryptocurrency due to the technology on which they are based (Bank 
of  England, 2014). No country has declared or classified the cryptocurrency mining as 
economic activity, although it happenshence it is a profitable activity that needs to be 
served from both a highly intelligent human resources and high-performaning equipment 
and technologies involving energy resources. The spread of the cryptocurrency popularity 
creates additional demand related with crypto- and unusual for money market: 
increasing demand for electronic equipment, the demand for electricity (in some cases, 
the concentration of cryptocurrency production occurs in places with cheap electricity 
tariffs). This derivative development of adjacent markets also has innovative orientation.
Cryptocurrencies can benefit especially to small businesses. The cost of installing 
the system is much cheaper than paper payments. Cryptocurrency in prospect of 
creating the ability to handle microtransactions is more effective, fast and inexpensive 
way of conducting international transfers. In order to provide payments that do not 
need an account, the company even do not have to possess additional hardware such as 
payment terminals. By eliminating third parties there will be no storage costs. Overall, the 
blockchain technology can improve any system that deals with the contracts, transactions 
and distribution of private information.
It is obvious that the modern globalized world is impossible to be fitted into the 
traditional system of economic and financial instruments. As the time requires, a new 
form of digital money has rapidly entered into the world economy system. Science cannot 
ignore the emergence and existence of the cryptocurrency phenomenon, furthermore, 
the role of cryptocurrencyis far beyond the role of the universal equivalent in commodity 
exchange. A modern phenomenon, whencurrencies and wealth acquired can be purely 
virtual, create a real boost for the world economy development.
Conceptual bases of the cryptocurrency functioning is based on their increasing role 
in the world economy. Firstly, they are already quite effective in doing all the basic money 
functions that are transforming due to the basic cryptocurrency features. Secondly, 
unlike traditional money, cryptocurrencies are able to perform a number of additional 
features, that is extremely important for the modern economics development: a tool 
for decentralized exchange of digital currencies and values; the tool of enrichment; an 
investment; a tool of crisis management; the element of the global financial system; a 
type of innovation; a tool to simplify document management and sharing, and others. 
In addition, cryptocurrencies constantly generate new functionality niches in world 
processes.
Like any new phenomenon, the use of cryptocurrencies is still a full of questions, 
most of them require state regulation. But the current changes in the financial field are 
occurring so rapidly that today it is clear that the process of state regulation will be in time 
only in case it would be no less innovative.
