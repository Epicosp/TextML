Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study was to determine what collaborative interventions produce positive 
effects for students working on collaborative robotics projects for science process skills, 
collaborative problem solving, and learning motivation. In addition, the study examined the 
impact students’ prior robotics experience had on science process skills, collaborative problem 
solving, and learning motivation. The results indicated experience level and collaboration 
interventions can have impacts on students. Assigned Group Roles had positive effects on 
students’ motivation and collaborative problem solving.  Experience level also had effects upon 
student learning motivation and collaborative problem solving with the Novice status associated 
with higher levels as compared with students who had more experience. A collaboration 
intervention was identified that has the potential to produce positive effects for students in 
collaborative robotics projects as well as assist classroom educators in the purposeful design of 
collaborative robotics projects with scientifically based strategies to improve the attitudinal 
outcomes for students of various robotics experience.

Introduction 
 
Robotics have been used for educational purposes since the 1980s (Bers, 2010; Castledine & Chalmers, 1993; 
Chambers, Carbonaro, Rex, & Grove, 2007; Papert, 1993).  Educational robotics provides a fun and developmentally 
appropriate way to teach technology and engineering to students of all ages (Bers, 2010; Slangen, Keulen, & 
Gravemeijer, 2010; Sullivan & Bers, 2016).  A variety of content areas, as well as social skills, can also be taught 
using educational robotics (Eguchi, 2012; Grandgenett, Ostler, Topp, & Goeman, 2012; Hwang & Wu, 2014; Sullivan 
& Bers, 2016). Typical goals for these learning tools include; generating student interest in technology through robotic 
activities or lessons and engaging students in learning while teaching difficult or abstract concepts through non-
traditional methods (Eguchi, 2012).  Learning with robotics can facilitate student collaboration, problem solving, and 
critical thinking (Jordan & McDaniel, 2014; Mills, Chandra, & Park, 2013).  Furthermore, robotics instruction can 
reflect real world research where complex problems are solved in collaboration with others (Karahoca, Karahoca, & 
Uzunboylub, 2011; Mills et al., 2013; Papert, 1993; Robinson, 2005).  The potential benefits for educational robots 
move beyond classroom academics if students are able to develop real world problem solving skills (Mills et al., 2013; 
Papert, 1993; Sullivan, 2008).  This allows them to make connections between abstract content areas through concrete 
hands-on robotics, negotiate and interact in collaborative problem solving environments, and develop skills that 
benefit them in a variety of real world situations, all within the educational setting (Mills et al., 2013; Papert, 1993; 
Sullivan, 2008).  Collaborative robotics projects have the potential to use robotics as an educational tool that combines 
hands-on learning in a collaborative environment and provides the opportunity for students to develop learning 
motivation, collaborative problem solving, and scientific process skills. 
 
While it is common for students working with robotics to have challenges with programming and the mechanics 
(Ucgul & Cagiltay, 2014), lack of successful collaboration may limit beneficial learning outcomes and motivational 
benefits from the robotics projects.  Difficulties with sharing ideas and equally dividing the workload during the hands-
on experience seem to limit the potential for positive benefits for students.  In addition, different ability and experience 
levels can make it challenging to comfortably share ideas within a group. However, for educational purposes, 
collaborative robotics projects can be used to build the skills of each student in all areas of the project, designing, 
building, and programming whether it is an existing strength or not. The collaborative environment is a necessity in

robotics instruction due to available resources in the engineering lab and are even recommended for group work 
(Eguchi, 2012; Mills et al., 2013; Yuen et al., 2014). Nevertheless, it seems group collaboration sometimes leaves 
students with fewer participation opportunities, less learning motivation, or with a less than enjoyable experience. 
 
Learning motivation during collaborative projects may vary depending upon the group and its collaborative success.  
Past experiences in the elementary engineering lab indicated that groups that struggle to work collaboratively seem to 
have a more negative view of collaborative projects. Students may have not felt as though their ideas were listened to, 
or may have not had an opportunity to work on an area of the project that interested them. Perhaps collaboration 
strategies can be implemented that would promote a more productive collaboration process to aid students in achieving 
learning objectives and increasing benefits from the collaborative nature of robotics instruction.  Eguchi (2012) notes 
the introduction of robots alone cannot influence students’ minds or directly influence their learning; therefore, 
changes have to be made in the learning environment to support the collaborative robotics projects. 
 
The goal of this study was to implement collaborative instructional strategies, interventions for supporting group work 
to improve student learning motivation, collaborative problem solving, and science process skills, when designing, 
building, and programming robotics solutions. While motivation is a complex construct, for the purpose of this study, 
learning motivation was defined as motivation for students to take an active role in and a responsibility for their own 
learning (Petre & Price, 2004). This may also include developing an interest in a subject area that previously had been 
of little or no interest. Collaborative problem solving was defined as activities identifying problems and developing 
solutions through testing, improving, and using the collective ideas of a group (Barak & Zadok, 2007). Science process 
skills are defined as a set of skills used to systematically identify and answer scientific questions (Benitti, 2012). 
Experience levels were defined as novice level having no prior experience with collaborative robotics projects and 
experienced level having experienced at least one prior collaborative robotics project. Research questions in this study 
are below: 
When controlling for students’ pretest scores, what are the effects of collaboration interventions and prior student 
experience with collaborative robotics on students’: 
a) learning motivation 
b) problem solving 
c) science process skills 
 
Literature Review 
 
Learning Motivation in Robotics 
 
The hands-on nature and materials in the elementary engineering lab seem to provide sufficient motivation to some 
students (Petre & Price, 2004). However, researchers continually turn to instructional methods that involve a problem, 
meaningful units, and are cross-curricular in order to motivate and engage other students (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). 
Increases in student motivation are associated with constructivist and problem-based learning (Barak & Zadok, 2007; 
Bers, 2005; Eguchi, 2012, Papert, 1993; Somyürek, 2014).  Moreover, integrated robotics projects combine 
educational tools with experiential learning to promote an increase in student learning motivation for STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects (Blanchard at al., 2010; Mohr-Schroeder et al., 2014; Petre & 
Price, 2004; Somyürek, 2014; Ucgul & Cagiltay, 2014). The role of facilitator becomes critical in robotics projects to 
help sustain student motivation and promote the desired higher level learning (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). When students 
have the necessary collaborative provisions in order to create a supportive classroom environment during robotics 
projects, the results can positively impact student learning motivation (Yuen et al., 2014). Student motivation 
contributes to successfully learning and retaining the content (Mohr-Schroeder et al., 2014). The use of robotics in the 
classroom has the potential to motivate students to learn, however, it must be noted that the introduction of robotics 
alone does not guarantee positive student impacts (Eguchi, 2012). Indeed, the teacher must shift to a new role and 
implement appropriate instructional practices in order to support the learning process, collaboration, and to promote 
the benefits of student learning and motivation (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Yuen et al., 2014). 
 
With teachers taking on new roles as facilitators in the shifting learning environment, students are also asked to take 
on new roles as collaborators. The new roles allow students to take a more active role in their own knowledge 
development when participating in constructivist and problem-based learning, which increases motivation (Barker &

Ansorge, 2007; Blanchard et al., 2010; Chambers et al.,  2010; Hwang & Wu, 2014; Liu et al., 2010; Papert, 1993). 
Not only do students have the opportunity to be active learners, they also have the potential to positively impact student 
learning and motivation through peer collaboration (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Eguchi, 2012; Robinson, 2005). Small 
group settings for robotics necessitates social and peer interaction. With scaffolding and direction for students on 
successful collaboration, robotics has the potential to promote quality social interactions which support successful 
collaboration and increase motivation (Denis & Hubert, 2001; Hwang & Wu, 2014). If the nature of robotics is not 
motivating enough for students, the collaborative nature of robotics projects, constructivist learning, and problem-
based learning may offer social interactions that support and maintain student motivation (Slangen et al., 2010; Yuen 
et al., 2014). The collaborative robotics projects in the elementary engineering lab integrate characteristics of 
constructivist and problem-based learning that have been shown to motivate student learning and engage students in 
the learning process. 
 
Collaborative Problem Solving in Robotics 
 
While there are opportunities in the elementary engineering lab to practice problem solving individually, the fourth 
and fifth grade robotics projects rely heavily on collaborative problem solving. Collaborative problem solving is 
defined by Mills et al. (2013) as a process where peers construct new knowledge together that neither of them had 
prior knowledge of before working together. By practicing collaborative problem solving in real world applications 
with peer and teacher support, students may improve their problem solving skills and possibly transfer learning across 
content areas (Jordan & McDaniel, 2014; Mills et al., 2014; Petre & Price, 2004). Research suggests that problem 
solving engages students in the learning process, as opposed to more passive learning, and is essential for developing 
real life skills (Eguchi, 2012, Jordan & McDaniels, 2014; Mills et al., 2013; Papert, 1993; Somyürek, 2014).  Utilizing 
the design process for identifying a problem and developing a robotic solution can increase students’ use of critical 
thinking and problem solving skills (Barak & Zadok, 2007; Barker & Ansorge, 2007; Castledine & Chalmers, 1993; 
Jordan & McDaniel, 2014).  In addition, researchers argue that acquiring problem solving and critical thinking skills 
is essential for students’ futures (Castledine & Chalmers, 1993). Nelson (2012) emphasized there is more than content 
preparation needed to implement robotics projects, some of which are less tangible.  If these less tangible preparations 
are addressed through the implementation of effective strategies, additional student benefits can be achieved with 
skills-transfer (Nelson, 2012). 
 
Understanding the characteristics of collaborative problem solving will assist in determining what scaffolds, less 
tangible preparations, would best support student learning. Since collaborative problem solving is a form of problem 
solving requiring peer interactions (Mills et al., 2013) students need to ask questions, gather information, and reflect 
on what they have learned in order to solve a problem (Somyürek, 2014). Though the process may seem simple 
enough, it requires complex skills (Somyürek, 2014). In fact, problem solving is a complex phenomenon that utilizes 
both conscious and unconscious processes as well as combinations of explicit knowledge and intuition (Barak & 
Zadok, 2007). However, the process can be simplified for students by breaking problem solving into a series of steps 
(Mills et al., 2013). Another potential support for collaborative problem solving is the use of language to promote the 
collaboration and the development of newly co-constructed knowledge (Mills et al., 2013). The potential benefits for 
collaborative robotics projects to facilitate groupwork, problem solving, and critical thinking may be supported 
through language scaffolds (Hwang & Wu, 2014; Mills et al., 2013). While collaborative problem solving may prove 
to be a challenge for students because of the complexities, experiences with collaborative problem solving allow 
students to develop group solutions to meet the common group goal (Denis & Hubert, 2001; Jordan & McDaniel, 
2014; Mills et al., 2013). However, the uncertainties of collaborative problem solving may also create barriers to 
students’ development of solutions (Jordan & McDaniels, 2014). Jordan and McDaniels (2014) determine that teacher 
and peer support is critical for managing the uncertainties of collaborative problem solving.  Students’ ability to reflect 
on and relate problem solving strategies in relation to real world contexts could boost confidence levels in the subject 
area (Castledine & Chalmers, 1993). Students may need the boost in confidence to feel comfortable sharing ideas and 
assisting with the project. 
 
The collaborative problem solving and the group work required with robotics projects may also make it more difficult 
to identify individual student progress. Teachers must closely monitor individual students, their understanding, and 
their performance in order to support successful projects (Eguchi, 2012). Papert (1993) identifies ways in which to 
guide student thinking, but cautions that problem solving cannot be as simple as memorizing a procedure, such as a 
math algorithm, because the variety of problems are always changing. In addition, Papert (1993) reminds us that 
students do not have to give up old methods to learn new ones.   Furthermore, structured thinking is powerful thinking

 4 
and is not a skill that all students develop when left to construct their own knowledge (Papert, 1993). The role of the 
teacher, as facilitator, then, is to develop the proper balance as well as organize the instructional plan to support the 
learning process. Providing students with the means to comfortably share and participate within the group can make 
collaborative problem solving a better experience for all involved. 
 
Science Process Skills in Robotics 
 
While instruction in the elementary engineering lab focuses on engineering, the use of cross-curricular instruction is 
also a priority in order to develop connections for the students between the general classroom and the engineering lab. 
Nelson (2012) identified the scientific method and engineering as primary rationales for STEM education and robotics 
integration. Fortunately, integration of science skills fits easily within engineering and robotics instruction (Eguchi, 
2012; Papert, 1993). For instance, robotics helps students master various concept areas, depending upon how the 
robotic instruction is developed.  As a result, multiple student benefits are possible by using robotics as cross-curricular 
activities (Eguchi, 2012). The structure of collaborative robotics projects and robotic materials provide an opportunity 
to focus student learning on engineering (Bers, 2005; Jordan & McDaniel, 2014; Petre & Price, 2001; Ringwood et 
al., 2005; Yuen et al., 2007). With the cross-curricular potential of robotics, the use of a collaborative robotics project 
can easily combine science and engineering in addition to creating connections between the elementary engineering 
lab and the general classroom. Research identified three main skills developed through the use of robotics; thinking 
skills, science process skills/problem-solving skills, and social interaction/groupwork skills (Benitti, 2012; Hwang & 
Wu, 2014; Mills et al., 2013; Ringwood et al., 2005; Slangen et al., 2010). These skills are applicable and valuable for 
engineering, science, and the general classroom setting. In addition to the identified three main skills, Benitti (2012) 
noted robotics activities required the use of thinking skills and scientific reasoning. Furthermore, Sullivan (2008) 
maintained that an appropriate open-ended instructional approach, in conjunction with the use of robotics promotes 
the use of thinking and science process skills, as well as increased systems understanding. 
 
Science requires students to use language as a component of critical thinking and is necessary in order to understand 
and identify solutions for problems (Mills et al., 2013). Sullivan (2008) suggests that the process of debugging a 
program is an ideal format for teaching science process skills. Students generate hypotheses about what would work 
in the program, test it, and receive immediate feedback. The feedback starts as an iterative cycle of observation, 
hypothesis generation, testing of the hypothesis, and evaluation of the solution (Sullivan, 2008). This is not only an 
appropriate format for teaching science process skills, but also emphasizes the real-world process scientists engage, 
while offering a different exposure to science, since typical classroom lessons do not have the iterative feedback loops 
(Sullivan, 2008). Sullivan (2008) makes clear connections between the scientific process and the engineering design 
process by arguing that students must control variables and change only one variable at a time. This is key in the use 
of the scientific method and science process skills. A study by Somyürek (2014) indicates that during robotics 
instruction, students learn by designing and programming robots to solve problems. They use scientific skills such as 
making predictions, generating a hypothesis, conducting experiments or tests, and presenting their results. Robotics 
provides a hands-on method for teaching critical thinking, science process skills, and support for learning abstract 
concepts (Eguchi, 2012; Papert, 1993; Slangen et al., 2010; Sullivan, 2008). Though the learning objectives for the 
collaborative robotics project may not connect specifically with science standards, implementation scaffolds and 
problem-based learning could assist the students in achieving similar beneficial learning outcomes. 
 
Prior Experience in Robotics 
 
Barak and Zadok’s (2007) comparison between expert and novice robotics problem solvers highlights the importance 
of experience level in effective design and problem solving.  While this is a factor that is out of the teacher’s control, 
it is an important factor to consider for structure of the instruction.  Although some differentiation was provided in the 
past in the elementary engineering lab, based upon experience level, it may not have been sufficient to promote student 
success in collaborative robotics projects. Eguchi (2012) contends that it is very important to provide inexperienced 
students with supports, and in fact, emphasized the essential teacher’s role as facilitator to support inexperienced 
students. Teachers should provide modeling, guiding, and project planning and assist with the necessary skills and 
thought processes for students to successfully complete robotics projects (Barak & Zadok, 2007; Eguchi, 2012). 
 
Each year the robotics project is slightly different in the elementary engineering lab with an emphasis on a different 
problem, i.e. landing or mars, solving community problems, or creating robots that can create art. Fourth grade students 
have not experienced a collaborative robotics group projct. They have worked with a partner in programming the

 5 
robot, but have not had to design, build, and program a working solution. Fifth grade students experienced 
collaborative robotics project as fourth graders.  The fifth grade students have more prior knowledge and experiences 
to draw upon in order to help them successfully complete their robotics projects. However, students new to the school 
as fifth graders may not have collaborative robotics experience. Therefore, novice level students have not completed 
a collaborative robotics project while experienced level students have completed at least one. With low turnover in 
the elementary grades, most groups had the same experience levels with only a few groups in fifth grade having 
students with mixed experience levels. Even groups with the same experience level would have had a variety of ability 
levels.  The past instructional practices and the design of the study may not provide enough support for the 
inexperienced students since they are receiving the same interventions as the fifth grade students and no other 
scaffolds. 
 
The lack of additional supports for inexperienced students may impact potential benefit for the fourth grade students 
in the study. According to Barak and Zadok (2007) students with varying experience levels tend to approach robotics 
problems from different perspectives.  Inexperienced students may have difficulty in describing problems, which can 
hamper the success of the group in developing solutions, while experienced students may be able to use collaborative 
techniques such as being able to re-describe or re-define problems (Barak & Zadok, 2007; Blanchard et al., 2010). If 
a description of the problem is an issue, robotics vocabulary instruction or modeling may be beneficial to 
inexperienced students to alleviate possible barriers to problem solving issues. Furthermore, modeling of appropriate 
discussion could provide support for inexperienced students to overcome any differences in perspectives. Another 
concern with the differences in experience levels is that novices may rely more on trial and error where experts use 
domain-specific strategies (Barak & Zadok, 2007; Papert, 1993). Blanchard et al. (2010) demonstrate that experienced 
students still may use trial and error, but may also use it more efficiently base upon their prior knowledge.  Experts 
are able to develop “chunks” of specialized knowledge that are transferable while novices tend to memorize small 
disconnected facts (Barak & Zadok, 2007). The expert use of knowledge may allow for shortcuts or efficiency in 
problem solving rather than having to follow a specific method from start to finish (Barak & Zadok, 2007; Blanchard 
et al., 2010).  It is recommended that students within a group have similar levels of expertise so that one group member 
is not an expert, and thereby supporting the co-construction of knowledge rather than expert to novice transmission of 
information, as in a teacher-directed situation (Barak & Zadok, 2007; Mills et al., 2013). The Mills et al. (2013) study 
also demonstrates that novices with no prior knowledge of building or programming a robot continue to improve their 
speed of problem solving. Can this increase in speed or success of problem solving be maintained at the experienced 
level?  Perhaps novice students require more support and scaffolds to develop a successful collaborative process and 
support the growth of all students in collaborative problem solving, learning motivation, and scientific process skills 
within the robotics project. 
 
Method 
 
Participants 
 
The participants in this study consist of fourth and fifth grade students of six classes at a school in Eagle, Idaho USA. 
Of the 91 fourth grade students and 88 fifth grade students the study started with, 42% were female and 58% were 
male.  They range in age from 8 to 11. They attended engineering for a one-hour class each week. The engineering 
teacher was also the primary researcher and had been teaching robotics in the elementary engineering classroom since 
2012. Fourth grade students have not experienced the robotics project in the elementary engineering lab.  Therefore, 
the fourth grade students were identified as the Novice in regards to completing a robotics project.  Fifth grade students 
who attended the school during the previous year have completed a similar project. Student groups within each 
classroom were established with random assignments. The number of groups with four student members totaled 33 
groups at the beginning of the study and 35 upon completion of the study. Group size consisted primarily of four 
students with a few groups of three. Prior to the start of the study, permission for the study was secured through the 
school district and IRB approval. IRB approval included an informed consent letter being sent home to all the parents 
of students involved in the study. The purpose of the study was shared with all the students emphasizing the process 
as a learning experience for the teacher/researcher rather than an assessment of the students. Identities of the students 
were also protected with a coded system that provided anonymity.

Robot Activities 
 
Each group did robotics activities with LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3. The Mindstorms robotics platform uses LEGO 
pieces for construction along with a brick for controlling the robot. Programming is completed using a drag-and-drop 
software. Students in fourth and fifth grade continued to work on their programming skills with a partner at the 
beginning of the school year, advancing to the sensors and more complex programming, to refresh and build upon 
their skills from the previous year of instruction before starting the collaborative robotics project. Student participants 
completed their collaborative robotics project over sixteen weeks for one hour each week.  The progression from basic 
programming to complex designs and builds followed Ucgul and Cagiltay’s (2014) recommendation that content be 
organized from simple to complex. The learning sequence provided the necessary experiences and prior knowledge 
for students to take on the more complex collaborative robotics projects which required students to design, build, and 
program a robotics solution. Collaborative robotics projects were designed to reinforce and assist with learning in the 
general classroom by targeting science, math, language, and engineering standards. The use of the robots promoted 
the cross-curricular aspect of STEM in real world practices. The use of the Engineering Notebooks and the 
presentation of their group solution to their peers reinforced language standards, promoted student reflection, and co-
construction of knowledge in group projects.  Engineering Notebooks are used for all projects in the elementary 
engineering classroom to record relevant information and progress notes. The process of identifying problems and 
developing solutions promoted science process skills and engineering practices. The collaborative robotics project 
required students to use what they have learned about robots and fostered the development of new knowledge in order 
to design, build, and program an original solution to a problem they identified based upon the criteria given.  Students 
had the option of using instructions to design the base of their robotic solutions, but were required to add an original 
working part or modifications. 
 
Interventions 
 
The first collaborative support used classroom discussions including establishing expectations and developing a safe 
environment for sharing ideas.  Additional supports were included throughout the project to reinforce the expectations 
and promote effective discussions both within the group and as a whole class.  Restating someone else’s thoughts, 
increasing wait time, partner talk, and encouraging many contributors were strategies used for the intervention, 
modeled after the classroom strategies in Classroom Discussions Using Math Talk to Help Children Learn (Chapin, 
O’Connor, & Canavan Anderson, 2012).  Whole class discussions provided the teacher time to model strategies and 
assist students in developing the strategies, with redirection if necessary.  The teacher also had the opportunity to 
monitor group discussions by visiting groups during the class time.  Checking in with each group allowed the teacher 
to assess how the group discussions were progressing and provided opportunities for additional modeling and 
redirecting within a small group setting rather than the whole class (Mills et al., 2013).  The goal was to model and 
promote collaborative discussion techniques and assist students in implementing these strategies in their collaborative 
robotics groups. 
 
The second intervention was assigning group roles within the project that rotated throughout the course of the project, 
giving all the group members equal opportunity to develop a variety of skills.  The roles consisted of a time manager, 
materials manager, project manager, and data manager.  The time manager assisted the group in monitoring the time 
they had available in comparison with the tasks to be accomplished for the class time.  The materials manager was 
responsible for gathering and maintaining the materials needed for the project, the robotics kit and other miscellaneous 
items.  The project manager was responsible for the big picture of the project and identifying tasks that needed to be 
accomplished for the completion of the project.  The data manager recorded any data and notes pertaining to the 
project.  The assigned roles with specific jobs, in addition to the scheduled rotations, were designed to promote a 
process for the equal distribution of work and the opportunity for all students to develop the skills from all the roles. 
Groups with only three students combined two of the roles.  It was controlled not to play the role in the assigned group 
role. 
 
The third intervention was the previous instructional practice. Two classrooms, one fourth and one fifth grade 
classroom, did not receive the structured classroom discussion nor utilize assigned group roles, but rather, continued 
with the previous instructional practice as outlined in Table 1.  Although the teacher/researcher did not bring in aspects 
from the first two interventions, aspects such as discussion and group roles could develop if occurring naturally

through student interaction. In addition, groups that were struggling received extra time from the teacher/researcher 
to help students identify challenges and potential solutions rather than implement interventions that were not 
appropriate for the group.

Students were given the basic criteria for the robotics project, brief reminders and potential tasks that needed to be 
accomplished for each class, and any questions were addressed. They were reminded to share the work equally, make 
sure all group members got equal turns building and programming the robot, and given reinforcements for these 
aspects as needed.  Not all students were able to program or build on the robot at the same time.  Therefore, these 
activities rotated through all group members in a method established by each group with the understanding that the 
time should be divided equally among the group members and everyone should work on the programming or building 
within each class time. It is possible, even likely, discussions and group roles took place in all student groups. 
However, the additional supports and scaffolds from the teacher/researcher were only provided in the appropriate 
intervention.

Measures 
 
Robotics Expo 2012 [Pre CEENbot] - Adapted 2015 Student Survey 
 
Students also completed the Robotics Expo 2012 [Pre CEENbot] (Grandgenett, Chen, & Timms, 2010) - Adapted 
2015 Student Survey before and after the robotics project to assess student learning motivation and collaborative 
problem solving. It consisted of 38 questions using a 5-point Likert Scale to have participants self-assess for 
collaborative problem solving and motivation. 
 
Sample survey question for collaborative problem solving: 
I am able to help my group to accomplish the task within the allocated time frame. 
 
Collaborative problem solving had 22 questions at 5 points each question for a possible full score of 110 points. 
Motivation had 16 questions at 5 points each question for a possible full score of 80 points. 
 
Sample survey question for learning motivation: 
It is important for me to learn how to conduct a scientific investigation. 
 
The same items were used twice for the pre and posttest as well. The items were shuffled to avoid possible memorized 
answers. The survey had a Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of .94 (Grandgenett et al., 2010).  In the present 
study, the 22 questions for collaborative problem solving had a Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of .87.  The 16 
questions for learning motivation had a Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient of .88. 
 
Fowler Science Process Skills Assessment 
 
The Fowler Science Process Skills Assessment (Fowler, 1990) was administered. This assessment consists of two sets 
of test: a pretest of Form A and a posttest of Form B. An administrator read the problem loud while students look at 
the paper. 
 
Sample Fowler Prompt for Science Process Skills: 
Today you are going to complete a short exercise to see how well you can design an experiment.  Look at 
your paper while I read the problem aloud: 
 
(Form A) Are earthworms attracted to light?  In other words, do earthworms like light? 
 
Tell how you would test this question.  Be as scientific as possible when you write about 
your test. 
 
Write down the steps you would take to find out if earthworms like light.  You may draw 
a picture of your experiment, but you still need to explain your experimental design in 
words. 
Students wrote down the steps and explained their experimental design for the given problem. Two teachers marked 
an answer sheet of one student. A score of 0 on an item indicated no evidence and a score of 3 indicated strong 
evidence. The mean of the two scores was used as the final score. It could range from 0 to 45 points. The validity and 
the reliability of the Fowler Science Process Skills Assessment as a measure of science process skills has been 
previously established (Callahan, Hunsaker, Adams, Moore, & Bland, 1995; Fowler, 1990; Mallozzi & Heilbronner, 
2013).  Furthermore, the intrarater reliability Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient of .89 for the pretest and 
.91 for the posttest was comparable to other science performance assessments (Callahan et al., 1995). 
 
Research Design 
 
Figure 1 illustrates the research design for this study.  Each of the experience levels have groupings for the three levels 
of intervention.  This creates a total of six groups of participants, Novice/Classroom Discussion, Novice/Assigned 
Group Roles, Novice/Usual Instructional Practices, Experienced/Classroom Discussion, Experienced/Assigned Group

Roles, and Experienced/Usual Instructional Practices. The Novice groups were the three fourth grade classes, while 
the Experienced groups were the three fifth grade classes. The elementary engineering teacher/researcher worked with 
all grade levels, classes, and groupings.

Statistical Analysis 
 
Data analysis was performed in SPSS 21 to determine answers to the main research questions.  In order to determine 
possible interactions, 2x3 ANCOVAs were used for both experience levels and the three interventions while 
controlling for students’ pretest scores.  The ANCOVA procedure was applied because three dependent variables – 
science process skills, collaborative problem solving, and learning motivation - were not correlated with one another 
in pre-test scores. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients for learning motivation and collaborative problem solving, 
for learning motivation and science process skills, and for collaborative problem solving and science process skills 
were .45, -.01, and .03 respectively. Pretest scores for science process skills, collaborative problem solving, and 
learning motivation were used as covariates.  Tukey HSD followed the results from the ANCOVAs to determine 
which differences were significantly different. 
 
Results 
 
Research Question 1 
 
Table 2 indicates the means of pre and post scores for three interventions by experience levels. Classroom Discussion 
had a pre mean score of 66.91 and a post mean score of 65.33.  Usual Instructional Practices had a pre mean score of 
67.51 and a post mean score of 65.25.  Only Assigned Group Roles indicated an increase in post mean scores, which 
was 1 point increase from 68.14 to 69.14.  When examining the scores by intervention condition and experience level, 
both Experienced Classroom Discussion and Usual Instructional Practices had greater than 4 point decrease.  
Therefore, only the intervention of Assigned Group roles in the Experienced students demonstrated an increase in the 
post score for motivation according to Table 2.

The means of the post survey for the Novice demonstrated over 1 point increase, while the Experienced demonstrated 
a decrease of more than 3 points.  In addition, the post mean score for the Novice (69.08) was more than five points 
higher than the Experienced (64.06).  The Novice Classroom Discussions and Assigned Group Roles for student 
learning motivation demonstrated increases for post mean scores.  Therefore, at the Novice level all three interventions 
produced a positive impact on student motivation as indicated in Table 2. 
 
In order to test the differences discovered in Table 2 for statistical significance, a 2x3 ANCOVA was applied with the 
pre motivation scores as covariate.  The ANCOVA indicated statistically significant main effects of the interventions 
for motivation after controlling for students’ pretest scores, F(2,135) = 5.24, p = .006, p < .05, as seen in Table 3.  The 
ANCOVA also indicated statistically significant main effects of the experience level after controlling for students’ 
pretest scores for motivation, F(1,135) = 24.97, p = .000, p < .05.  There was no interaction between intervention and 
experience level, F(2, 135) = .77, p = .463, p > .05.

In examining the motivation levels by intervention and experience level, it can be concluded that there is a statistically 
significant main effect for the interventions and experience levels. Tukey HSD post hoc analysis in Table 4 indicated 
that the mean motivation score for Assigned Group Roles were statistically different in motivation, p = .011, p < .05 
than Classroom Discussion and Usual Instructional Practices, p = .004, p< .05.  Taken together, these results indicate 
that the use of Assigned Group Roles had an effect on student motivation.  Specifically, students in Assigned Group 
Roles had higher post mean motivation scores when controlling for students’ pre motivation scores than the students 
in Usual Instructional Practices with a mean difference of 4.27 and Classroom Discussion with a mean difference of 
3.65.

Research Question 2 
 
Table 5 indicates the mean pre and posttest scores for collaborative problem solving. Table 5 identifies Classroom 
Discussion and Assigned Group Roles as having a positive effect with increased post mean scores.  Classroom 
Discussion increased from 89.60 to 90.32 while Assigned Group Roles increased from 92.29 to 93.07.  Though these 
increases are less than 1 point, Usual Instructional Practices demonstrated a decrease of over 2 points from 92.61 to 
89.35.  Experienced Classroom Discussion, Novice Classroom Discussion, and Novice Assigned Group Roles 
demonstrated a positive impact on collaborative problem solving.  The increase is greatest for Novice Assigned Group 
Roles.  Experienced Assigned Group Roles was less than .1 point of a decrease.  Experienced Usual Instructional 
Practices experienced the largest decrease with 5.68 points difference between the pre and post mean scores for 
collaborative problem solving. 
 
The post mean scores for the Novice demonstrated a slight increase for collaborative problem solving from 92.81 to 
93.32.  The post mean scores for the Experienced indicated a decrease from 90.18 to 88.50.  The Experienced only 
had positive impact for Classroom Discussion while the Novice had positive impact for both Classroom Discussion 
and Assigned Group Roles.

In order to test these differences statistically, a 2x3 ANCOVA was applied with the pre collaborative problem solving 
scores as covariate.  The ANCOVA indicated statistically significant main effects of interventions after controlling 
for students’ pretest scores for collaborative problem solving, F(2,140) = 5.09, p = .007, p < .05, as seen in Table 6.

Examining the collaborative problem solving levels by intervention and experience level, it can be concluded that 
there is a statistically significant main effect for the interventions and experience level.  A post hoc analysis for the 
three interventions using Tukey HSD was performed to determine which differences were statistically significant. 
Table 7 indicate that the mean collaborative problem solving score for Assigned Group Roles were statistically 
different than Usual Instructional Practices, p = .014, p < .05.  Taken together, these results indicate that the use of 
Assigned Group Roles has an effect on collaborative problem solving.  Specifically, students in Assigned Group Roles 
had higher post mean collaborative problem solving scores when controlling for students’ pre collaborative problem 
solving scores than students in both Classroom Discussion with a mean difference of 2.08 and Usual Instructional 
Practices with a mean difference of 3.98.  However, there was only a statistically significant difference between 
Assigned Group Roles and Usual Instructional Practices.

Research Question 3 
 
Table 9 indicates that all interventions for all the experience levels had increases in the post mean scores for science 
process skills with relation to the pre mean scores.  However, higher gains were seen within the Novice with all the 
post mean scores showing an increase of at least 1 point from 1.68 to 2.78.  Assigned Group Roles also demonstrated 
an increase in post mean scores for science process skills from 2.35 to 3.45.

Discussion 
 
The findings for the collaborative robotics project demonstrated that Assigned Group Roles with an increase produced 
statistically significant positive effects on measured student motivation in relation to Classroom Discussion and Usual 
Instructional Practices, which both demonstrated decreases from pre to post mean scores. Only Assigned Group Roles 
produced statistically significant positive effects on measured collaborative problem solving in relation to Usual 
Instructional Practices.  The Novice experience level was associated with statistically significant positive effects on 
measured student motivation and collaborative problem solving in relation to the Experienced level.  All interventions 
demonstrated positive effects on science process skills, but not at a statistically significant level. 
 
The Assigned Group Roles intervention included teacher reinforcement and a document outlining each role, Time 
Manager, Materials Manager, Project Manager, and Data Manager, as well as detailed job responsibilities.  In the 
present study, the roles were also designed to balance quiet and dominant group members, as encouraged by Somyürek 
(2014).  Rotating the roles weekly was established to further promote equal distribution of the work responsibilities. 
The rotation of the roles provided each student in the group to experience the different roles rather than remaining in 
a single role the entire project. This may have helped students develop empathy and understanding of the various 
roles, as well as, an understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses. The study’s positive results support Yuen

et al.’s (2014) emphasis of structure during collaborative group work.  The four roles included some responsibilities 
that were the same, such as researching, designing, building, and programming.  In addition to each role having 
identical responsibilities, each role had unique responsibilities created to develop and promote collaboration between 
the four roles.  The division and sharing of job responsibilities created structure for the Assigned Group Roles that 
supports Eguchi (2012) and Mills et al. (2013) recommendations for collaborative robotics work.  The roles were 
developed for educational purposes to develop a wide range of skills in each student.  Students were required to work 
on all areas of the collaborative robotics project rather than focusing solely on one area or on any areas of strength 
they may have had.  While this use of group roles is contrary to Yuen et al. (2014) recommendations of focusing on 
students’ areas of strength, the roles are used to promote new skills, as well as, developing existing areas of strength.  
Yuen et al. (2014) addressed collaborative robotics in an informal educational setting and had different instructional 
purposes for group roles.  Furthermore, the rotation of the roles may have increased motivation because students did 
not become complacent in one role and created a stronger support for collaborative problem solving. The positive 
results indicate that structure of the roles provided the necessary support and scaffold to meet the needs of the 
classroom setting while developing motivation and collaborative problem solving. 
 
The Novice experience level was associated with a clear positive effect on motivation and collaborative problem 
solving.  Interestingly, research with experience levels in robotics suggests that the Novice students would have needed 
more supports than more experienced robotics students in order to recognize the same benefits (Eguchi, 2012), and 
yet, the Novice demonstrated more positive effects. Though the positive effects for the Novice was less significant, 
the Experienced had a decrease.  Perhaps the novelty of the collaborative robotics project could be responsible for 
higher post mean motivation scores.  However, it is difficult to identify potential reasons for the differences in post 
mean collaborative problem solving scores.  Post mean scores for collaborative problem solving should have been 
higher for the Experienced, and yet the Experienced students showed a decrease in post mean scores while the Novice 
students had a slight increase.  Perhaps additional supports and interventions need to be identified to continue the 
growth of these skills for Experienced students.  In addition, students had to self-evaluate on the Robotics Expo 2012 
[Pre CEENbot] - Adapted 2015 Student Survey measure. Students with experience with collaborative robotics projects 
may have overestimated their ability to complete the task in groups and had more realistic understanding during the 
post evaluation. 
 
The lack of any statistically significant difference in post mean scores for science process skills for interventions and 
experience level may be due to the overall low scores.  With the potential for a total of 45, student scores ranged from 
0 to 9.  The low scores may not have allowed for large enough difference to successfully identify a statistical difference 
between the interventions.  The Fowler Science Process Skills assessment was designed for middle school students.  
While some middle schools include fifth grade students, the instrument may not have been the most appropriate 
measure for students in fourth and fifth grades.  The potential issue with the instrument appropriateness may have 
made it difficult to identify effects of the interventions or experience levels. 
 
Conclusion 
 
While the general method of instruction for collaborative robotics projects had promoted student benefits, there was 
a need to evaluate the general method of instruction and determine if collaborative interventions could improve student 
outcomes.  Additionally, with students using a form of robotics as early as first grade and the Mindstorms as early as 
third grade, understanding how to support the developing experience levels is critical for on-going robotics instruction 
and development of an appropriate scope and sequence. 
 
The results indicate that the Assigned Group Roles had a positive effect on student motivation and collaborative 
problem solving.  While Assigned Group Roles had not been previously used in the elementary engineering classroom 
for previous projects, it will be used in future instruction and adapted for use with other collaborative projects.  Not 
all groups used the roles as effectively, and some still struggled with the challenge of sharing the work and staying on 
task. However, the structure offered with the Assigned Group Roles seemed to provide students with appropriate 
guidance to stay on task if desired. Furthermore, the structure provided the teacher with appropriate guidance to assist 
students who may have been off task with a simple means of redirection. In the present study, Assigned Group Roles 
was the only intervention that had printed guidelines for students to keep in their Engineering Notebooks.  Perhaps a 
printed guideline for classroom discussions could be included in the intervention to offer appropriate sentence starters, 
questions, and reminders about classroom interaction expectations in order to better support that collaboration strategy.

Robotics experience level also played an important part in student motivation and collaborative problem solving.  The 
status of Novice was associated with positive effects and consistently outperformed the status of Experienced.  
Understanding the supports needed for the varying experience levels is important in order to implement the appropriate 
instructional practices.  It appears that additional supports are necessary for the Experienced students in order for them 
to continue to make gains in learning motivation and collaborative problem solving.  Post mean motivations scores 
only showed an increase in the Experienced for Assigned Group Roles, and the increase was minimal.  Only Classroom 
Discussion from the Experienced had increased post mean scores for collaborative problem solving; however, not at 
a significant level. Overall additional investigation into supports for Experienced students is warranted. 
 
The identification of successful collaboration intervention for collaborative robotics projects fills a practical and 
growing need for robotics integration into the educational setting.  In fact, the relevance of the study to student learning 
also added to the rigor (Reeves, 2011).  This study was relevant to teaching, learning, and educational outcomes, as it 
addresses the educational needs of learners, practitioners, designers, and society by promoting collaborative problem 
solving skills and learning motivation (Reeves, 2011).  Furthermore, the study has the potential to provide instructional 
insights for various problem-based collaborative environments. 
 
The study was conducted in an authentic contextual setting to determine how best to support collaborative robotics 
projects.  Additional studies could be conducted to determine how to develop classroom discussions to produce a more 
consistent benefit to students.  Using claims, evidence, and reasoning in discussions to construct explanations may 
support the collaborative nature of the robotics project by reducing the potential for personal opinion to enter the 
discussions.  Furthermore, the claims, evidence, and reasoning discussion format supports the systematic scientific 
approach desired for scientific process skills. Further research could also be conducted to improve upon the Assigned 
Group Roles. Perhaps it would be possible to improve the size of the increase in post mean scores by combining the 
two interventions.  Future research has the potential to benefit not only robotics instruction, but collaborative learning 
as well.

In recent years, educational robotics has become a popular tool in STEM 
programs, such as afterschool clubs, and summer camps, as well as classrooms. However, 
the research on the benefits of robotics have shown mixed results. In addition, many of 
the studies lack strong controls and focus on short-term effects, while the programs they 
investigate have few contact hours and do not have a consistent curriculum. This situation 
indicates that more research is needed. 
This work focuses on a public high school in Texas with a year-long robotics 
class. The first part examines a set of students who enrolled in the robotics class in the 9th 
or 10th grade, and a comparison group of students who did not enroll in robotics. The 
robotics and comparison groups were matched on 8th grade standardized math test scores, 
and demographic factors. Using multiple linear regression and logistic regression, I found 
that robotics enrollment was not a significant predictor for 11th grade math standardized 
test scores, or high school enrollment in Physics 1, Physics 2, or Calculus classes. 
The second part examines a series of video recordings of student teams in the 
robotics class working on a capstone project. Using grounded theory, I coded and 
analyzed recordings of two of the teams, focusing on the math and science discussions 
between the students and the contexts in which the math and science occur. Three themes 
 vii 
emerged from the data. First, students use math/science more frequently to identify and 
fix problems than in their initial design. Second, students use math/science at a 
conceptual level and do not perform math calculations. Last, students have a “good 
enough” attitude and do not prioritize precision. These results may help explain the lack 
of effect robotics have on math test scores.

Chapter 1:  Introduction 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
With over half of the United States’ historical economic growth deriving from 
technological innovation (Bonvillian, 2002), the country has a vested interest in 
producing more STEM professionals and innovators. To accomplish this, more students 
need to be encouraged and prepared in STEM fields in K-12 and college. One promising 
method that has risen to help has been the use of robotics as an educational tool (Nugent, 
Barker, Grandgenett, & Adamchuk, 2010).   
Use of robotics as an educational tool appeared in Seymour Papert’s work in the 
1980s (Papert, 1993) and underwent rapid acceleration in the 1990s. Since there is no 
central organization to track educational robotics proliferation, it is difficult to obtain 
accurate information about the growth of the field. However, FIRST robotics, one of the 
largest robotics competition organizers, started with 28 teams in 1992, and has increased 
to 39,000 teams in 2015, representing over 359,000 students (FIRST robotics, 2015a). 
Since its inception in 1989, over 1 million students have participated in FIRST (Flowers, 
2015). In the United States, Myers (2009) estimated that 8% of the 25,000 high schools in 
the country were involved with FIRST robotics. 
Despite its rapid growth, implementing an educational robotics program has 
several challenges. Monetary cost is one of the major problems. In a typical classroom or 
after school club, small groups of students work together on a robot, sharing one robotics 
kit (~$350) and one PC (~$350), yielding a cost of approximately $700 if students work 
in pairs. For 20 students, a school can expect to purchase $7,000 of equipment. In 
addition, there is the cost of the teacher and meeting space. Also, robotics competitions 
typically have registration fees. FIRST robotics charges $5,000-$6,000 per team for one 
competition, with additional ones costing between $500 and $5,000 depending on 
 2 
location and competition level (regional, district, etc.) (FIRST robotics, 2015b). A five-
student team attending a single competition costs at least $1,000 per student. In contrast, 
the cost of a 3-credit advanced math or science class at a local community college can be 
$255 per student (Austin Community College, 2016). 
Another problem is teacher training and acceptance. As reported by Sullivan and 
Moriarty (2009), some teachers have a difficult time adapting to the use of robotics. With 
a steep learning curve, many interviewed teachers were concerned about their own 
proficiency. Others believed that robotics activities or curricula would be difficult to 
implement and integrate into regular school periods. While many of these issues are not 
unique to robotics, they are still barriers to implementation.  
Starting a robotics program can be an expensive investment and a challenge to 
implement. Any organization that wishes to pursue educational robotics needs to ask 
several questions. First, what are the educational benefits of robotics programs? While 
the rapid growth of robotics demonstrates a desire for more robotics activities, popularity 
is not proof of learning (Johnson, 2003). If robotics programs produce favorable 
outcomes, educational institutions still must address another important question—Do the 
benefits outweigh the high cost or would the money be better spent on a different 
program? 
Unfortunately, the benefits of robotics programs remain largely undocumented. 
While there is a substantial amount of published literature about robotics programs, the 
majority of publications focus on descriptions of implementations of programs (Benitti, 
2012), and evidence of learning tends to be anecdotal (Johnson, 2003; Silk & Schunn, 
2008). Of the few quantitative studies have been performed, many suffer from small 
sample sizes, using instruments that may not be reliable or valid, a low number of contact 
hours, and multiple curricula being used with different groups of subjects (Barker & 
 3 
Ansorge, 2007; Laughlin, 2013; Nugent, Barker, & Grandgenett, 2008; Wolfgang, 
Stannard, & Jones, 2003). Some studies used multiple sites, but did not coordinate the 
curriculum, making it uncertain whether the groups received comparable lessons 
(Hussain, Lindh, & Shukur, 2006; Lindh & Holgersson, 2007). In addition, most of the 
studies conducted their evaluation within a few months of the intervention. Thus, they did 
not measure whether the observed effects persisted or if students quickly returned to their 
pre-intervention state. Given these issues, it is difficult to conclude whether robotics 
programs deliver meaningful and lasting benefits for their participants.    
What is needed is a longitudinal comparison of a large population of robotics 
students against a comparison group. The outcome measures should be validated 
instruments. Students should have an ample number of contact hours and all robotics 
students should be using the same curriculum.  
METHODS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
This study is designed to fulfill many of the aforementioned needs. Focusing on a 
high school with an established robotics program, I will use data from multiple years of 
robotics students and a comparable matched comparison group. For each student, I will 
examine math standardized test scores and later enrollment in elective STEM classes. 
Since standardized test results and class enrollments are routinely recorded by the school 
district, they are convenient to obtain for large numbers of students. In addition, several 
prior quantitative studies have used math standardized scores (Laughlin, 2013; Tran & 
Nathan, 2010a; Wolfgang et al., 2003), so using them here would allow for a comparison 
of results. Further, these are the outcomes that matter for many if not most school 
districts. 
 4 
Summer camps and brief interventions do not deliver many contact hours to the 
robotics students, so it is possible that some of the students do not derive the full benefit 
of the program. Likewise, extracurricular clubs do not mandate attendance and 
engagement; so some students may be “enrolled” but not actively participating. By 
focusing on school courses, I can filter out the students who skip class and are not 
engaged by examining the class grades.  
 By using a school with an established and long-running robotics program, I can 
obtain a sufficient sample size by including multiple sections of the robotics class over 
several years. There has been some evidence of robotics increasing interest in STEM 
subjects (Eguchi, 2016; Iturrizaga, 2000). By comparing STEM course enrollment, I will 
be able to see if possible heightened interest translates into action and pursuit of that 
interest. Research has shown enrollment in advanced math and science courses to be 
correlated with higher math and science achievement (Leow, Marcus, Zannuto, & 
Boruch, 2004). Standardized math and science tests are professionally designed and 
typically have published reliability metrics and the validity has been accepted by the state 
educational administration. As such, by comparing test scores multiple years after the 
robotics class, I will be able to see whether any gains persist over the long term. 
This study includes a quantitative piece (Part 1) and a qualitative piece (Part 2). 
My research questions for Part 1 and their corresponding null and experimental 
hypotheses are as follows: 
1. Is there a correlational relationship between enrollment in a high school robotics 
class and standardized math test scores? 
H0: There is no relationship between enrollment in high school robotics and 
standardized math test score. 
 5 
µ0: There is a relationship between enrollment in high school robotics and 
standardized math test score. 
2. Is there a relationship between enrollment in a high school robotics class and 
later enrollment in advanced STEM courses? 
H0: There is no relationship between enrollment in a high school robotics class 
and later enrollment in advanced STEM courses. 
µ0: There is a relationship between enrollment in a high school robotics class and 
later enrollment in advanced STEM courses. 
To help contextualize and triangulate the results of the first two research 
questions, the second part of this dissertation will be a qualitative study of robotics 
students. In Spring 2010, students in a robotics class were video recorded for several days 
over the course of the semester. The class occurred in the same high school studied in the 
first part of this dissertation. Using the video and written documents produced by the 
students, I will analyze whether the students were using math and science during the 
design, construction, and testing of their robotics projects. My research question for Part 
2 is as follows: 
3. Are robotics students frequently using math and science in the course of their 
robotics project, or are there missed opportunities where more math/science use 
could be encouraged? 
Video recording of the classroom can provide a view into the daily activities of 
the students and may help explain the reasons for the results of the first two research 
questions. If the observed students frequently use math and science during the course of 
their robotics project, the extra practice and reinforcement of the subject matter would 
lead me to expect improved math test scores and increased enrollment in advanced 
elective STEM courses. However, if students do not notice or do not choose to use math 
 6 
or science, it would help explain if there are no significant changes in math test scores or 
enrollments in advanced elective STEM courses.

Chapter 2:  Literature Review 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
In broadest terms, robotics are physical manipulatives, and the use of physical 
objects as learning tools dates back at least to the 18th century. Johann Heinrich 
Pestalozzi used stones, plants, and other examples from the natural world to teach forms. 
Friedrich Fröbel used models of geometric solids to teach shapes and encouraged his 
students to create their own models and artifacts (Dunn, 2005). 
Theoretically, educational robotics is a direct descendant of Seymour Papert’s 
constructionism. A student of Jean Piaget’s, Papert’s work can be seen not as an alternate 
view of constructivism, but as an extension of it. Papert acknowledged this foundation 
when he named his theory by modifying the spelling, and hence limiting the meaning, of 
“constructivism” (Papert & Harel, 1991). Both theories are rooted in the idea that 
meaning cannot be directly taught, but rather that students must create their own meaning 
through personal experience (Ackermann, 2001). “People don’t get ideas, they make 
them” (Resnick, 1996, p. 281). 
But where understanding in Piaget’s constructivism passes through the concrete to 
the abstract, Papert focuses attention on the concrete. Indeed, the defining feature of 
constructionist teaching is the need for the learner to build and create artifacts, whereas 
constructivist practice may or may not involve the creation or manipulation of physical 
artifacts. An oversimplification of constructionism reduces the idea to “learning by 
building”. More accurately, “constructionism does not privilege abstract reasoning as the 
only route to high-level intellectual understanding” (Sullivan & Moriarty, 2009, p. 112).  
 8 
While the artifacts are often physical models, it is not required. There is room for both the 
concrete and the abstract. 
In addition to a way of learning content, Papert also saw constructionism’s 
potential in the affective domain as a way to pique interest and motivate students to seek 
out knowledge (Papert & Harel, 1991). Notable was the embrace of technology as a 
medium for construction and collaboration and its use as a source of inspiration and 
motivation. The origins of his work with robotics can be seen in his development of the 
Logo programming language and Turtle geometry for elementary students. Logo enabled 
students to explore geometric concepts by constructing a program to tell the “turtle” 
cursor to draw lines and turn through angles to create shapes on the computer screen. His 
later extension to “physical Turtles”—small, wheeled robots that could be programmed to 
move around the classroom floor— was an even more concrete expression of the shapes 
drawn by the virtual Logo Turtle cursor and a physical realization of the commands used 
to program it. (Papert, 1993) 
This work eventually led to a direct collaboration with the LEGO Group to create 
their next generation of robotics kits, named MINDSTORMS, after one of Papert’s 
books.  
Papert saw the potential for constructionism to impact not just instructional 
methods, but major educational structures as well. He had a vision of constructionist 
education, specifically, of STEM education, which came to him when he was working at 
a junior high school and happened upon one of the art classes. 
In this particular art class they were all carving soap, but what each student carved 
came from wherever fancy is bred and the project was not done and dropped but 
continued for many weeks. It allowed time to think, to dream, to gaze, to get a 
new idea and try it and drop it or persist, time to talk, to see other people’s work 
and their reaction to yours — not unlike mathematics as it is for the 
mathematician, but quite unlike math as it is in junior high school …. An 
 9 
ambition was born: I want junior high school math class to be like that. (Papert & 
Harel, 1991, p. 3)  
Here, we can see that his vision was not limited to merely building things, but 
extended to the whole learning environment. It includes giving students a non-rigid class 
structure that provides students time and freedom to experiment, work authentically, 
collaborate, and review each other’s work.  
There are, however, criticisms of constructionism and constructivism. Studying a 
programming project with elementary and middle school aged students in a constructivist 
setting, Bruckman, Edwards, Elliott, and Jensen (2000) found that while some students 
mastered the material, the majority of students learned little with large amounts of time 
off task. Other researchers note that while constructivism is a good cognitive model of 
learning, it has been difficult to translate into useful instructional practices. Gordon 
(2009) highlights misuses that have led to poor implementations, while Windschitl 
(1999a, 1999b) discusses inadequate teacher training, and the difficulties in creating a 
constructivist culture in the classroom. One practice that draws particular criticism is pure 
discovery learning, where students are left in a low guidance environment where they are 
supposed to “discover” and construct understanding by themselves. Mayer (2004) states 
that without sufficient guidance students learn inefficiently and sometimes construct the 
wrong conceptions. Studying children working in Logo, Kurland and Pea (1985) found 
that the students created the wrong mental model for recursion. Citing empirical studies 
and cognition theories, Lehrer (1986) similarly calls for more guided learning.  
BACKGROUND 
In recent years, robots have been used in education in K-16 education in several 
ways. The first, which I will call “industrial robotics”, is when manufacturing robots are 
brought into the school and students are taught to operate them as an introduction to the 
 10 
industrial automation environment. In this setting, the students learn to program and 
operate the machines, but are not designing or creating them. A second, which I will call 
“educational robotics”, is when students are provided parts and are expected to design 
and construct the robots out of mechanical and electronic components. Mechanical parts 
include structural elements and motors, and electronic components include programmable 
microcontrollers and sensors. Pre-packaged kits, such as LEGO MINDSTORMS or 
VEX, are included in this second group. The focus of this work is on educational 
robotics, where students design and create a robot, and not industrial robotics, where 
students learn to use an existing robot. 
There is a belief that educational robotics has a positive effect on students, 
particularly with respect to STEM education (Barker & Ansorge, 2007). But, despite the 
popularity of robotics, the research evidence for its merits is somewhat sparse. Benitti's 
(2012) review of the robotics literature found while there is a substantial literature base 
on educational robotics, the majority of reports are not critical studies. Of the 197 articles 
she found that were published between 2000 and 2009, only 5% were quantitative studies 
(with pre- and post-measures) where robotics was used as an educational tool in K-12 
settings. Most published articles on robotics are descriptions of the implementations of 
robotics programs (e.g. Genalo & Gilchrist, 2006; Lau, McNamara, Rogers, & Portsmore, 
2001; McLaughlin, Hardinge, Brown, Jenne, & Stiegler, 2007; Nagchaudhuri & Singh, 
2003; Robinson, Fadali, Wang, & Vollstedt, 2004) or ideas for robotics curricula and 
lessons (e.g. Howell & McGrann, 2003; Lau et al., 2001; Schep & McNulty, 2002). Some 
merely measured whether the students gained knowledge about using the robotics kits 
(Barker & Ansorge, 2007; Sullivan, 2008). Despite the large number of articles, few 
actually try to determine whether robotics students gain knowledge or skills that are 
 11 
transferrable. Of these, there are a variety of skills that are measured, including divergent 
thinking (Gibbons, 2007) and problem solving ability (Hussain et al., 2006).  
PATHWAYS FOR ROBOTICS TO AFFECT MATH AND SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT 
Despite the fact that robotics programs are often considered to be engineering 
interventions, it is reasonable to believe that such programs can also improve 
achievement and interest in math and science. Figure 2.1 illustrates potential pathways 
that I believe can lead from robotics to increased test scores and course enrollment. I 
labeled the metacognitive pathway with dashed lines because the research literature on 
this topic is still in its infancy. 
 
Figure 2.1: Pathways for robotics to lead to improved math/science test scores and 
course selection. 
Explicit teaching 
A direct method of teaching math and science to robotics students is to create 
curriculum and activities to explicitly teach math and science concepts in the context of 
designing and using the robots. In a middle school summer program, Williams, Ma, 
Prejean, Ford, and Lai (2007) used robotics to teach Newton’s Laws of Motion. 
 12 
Robinson, Fadali, Wang, and Vollstedt (2004) also taught physics teaching through 
robotics, but the program was aimed at 8th eighth-grade Limited English Proficient and 
English as a Second Language students. Meanwhile, Silk and Schunn (2008) studied a 
program created to teach middle school math concepts. 
 While ratios, geometry, and physics are common math and science topics for 
explicit teaching, a wide diversity of subjects have been addressed through robotics, 
including Geographic Information Systems (Nugent et al., 2010) and evolution (Whittier 
& Robinson, 2007).  
While some projects report significant pre-post learning, (e.g. Williams et 
al.(2007), not all do. Silk and Schunn (2008) examined a robotics program in which 24 
middle school math concepts, such as taking averages, converting between metric and 
imperial systems of measurement, maintaining accuracy and precision, and calculating 
percentages, were used by the students in the course of the robotics activities. 
Anticipating the possibility that they would not measure any significant learning gains, 
they hypothesized that, by teaching math and science through robotics, the program could 
be overcontextualizing the math and science concepts. That is, while using concrete 
examples has been shown to help students learn and apply new material, it can also lead 
to specializing the knowledge such that students do not abstract and are unable to apply it 
to other contexts (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000). Thus, Silk and Schunn (2008) 
assessed the learning of the middle school students using two sets of questions. One set 
included published standardized test questions, while the other set was created by the 
researchers and based on the same topics as the published test questions but rephrased to 
involve robots. Students performed poorly on both sets of questions, implying that the 
poor performance was due to something other than overcontextualization. With the large 
amount of content covered by the robotics project, an analysis of the interaction between 
 13 
the instructor and students indicated that there was little time being spent on any 
particular topic and no repetition or practice. Thus, they recommended that robotics may 
be best used to reinforce information that had already been taught and not as a student’s 
initial contact with the material.   
Affective Domain 
While many studies consider gains in content knowledge, another common aim is 
to improve students’ affect, e.g. motivation or persistence. In particular, many studies 
include self-report, pre-post surveys of attitudes toward one or more STEM subjects (e.g. 
“I think science is fun.” (Wendell & Rogers, 2013, p. 538)) and measure students’ 
inclination toward pursuing STEM as a college major or career (e.g. “Working with 
[STEM] ideas would be an interesting way to earn a living.” (Norton & Ginns, 2005, p. 
146)). Most papers report an increase in interest and attitudes after robotics projects 
(Eguchi, 2016; Mitnik, Nussbaum, & Soto, 2008; Nugent et al., 2010; Wendell & Rogers, 
2013). 
There is a vast amount of literature about how student perception and beliefs 
affect the choices students make and their achievement in math and science (Singh, 
Granville, & Dika, 2002). Models, frequently based on goal theory or expectancy-value 
frameworks, try to capture the complex behavior of students based on internal and 
external factors (DeBacker & Nelson, 1999). In particular, Eccles’s expectancy-value 
model, a prominent and often used approach, predicts student achievement related 
choices using a variety of categories of variables, including affective values, such as 
student interest and attitudes towards the subject, previous achievement, cultural norms, 
and expectations of success (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). Singh et al. (2002) found that in 
 14 
eighth-grade students’ attitudes and interests towards math and science were correlated 
with higher math/science grades and standardized test scores. 
Interestingly, while working with college-bound students in Germany, Köller, 
Baumert, & Schnabel (2001) found that at lower grades (i.e., 7th grade), student interest 
and attitudes toward math did not predict math achievement in 10th grade. However, later 
in high school, interest and attitudes in 10th grade predicted students’ 12th grade math 
achievement. In addition to a significant direct effect of interest on achievement, there 
was a significant partial mediation of interest by student selection of the more 
challenging math courses. The researchers hypothesize that interest and attitudes only 
become important once students have electives and can choose to enroll in more 
challenging math courses or take an easier option. According to this model, programs and 
interventions that enhance a student’s attitudes and interest towards math and science in 
middle school or early high school may not see significant effects until several years have 
passed and the student is in later high school, when he or she can elect to enroll in 
advanced coursework.  
Metacognition 
Broadly defined, metacognition is a person’s awareness of his or her own thought 
processes and the ability to regulate these processes (Goos, Galbraith, & Renshaw, 2002). 
Studies have shown that metacognition is associated with math and problem solving 
ability (Lucangeli & Cornoldi, 1997) and course grades (Young & Fry, 2008), and that 
metacognitive ability can be developed (Bransford et al., 2000). Hypothetically, using 
robotics has the potential to foster metacognitive development. Students working in small 
groups (as in robotics teams) can achieve a group metacognition where the members 
work as peer reviewers of each others’ ideas and processes (Goos et al., 2002). However, 
 15 
work on this subject is still in its infancy and studies have predominately focused on pre-
school and elementary school children. McWhorter (2009) measured metacognitive 
changes in a college computer science class that used robotics, but did not see a 
significant improvement. 
Indirect Use and Interactions Between the Pathways 
A few robotics programs have shown evidence of improving some math and 
science skills or student attitudes towards math/science even though those were not major 
goals for the program. The Robot Diaries, which focuses on storytelling using robots 
built with craft supplies reports that their students have increased their interest in 
studying STEM subjects (Nourbakhsh, 2009). Observing teams of middle school students 
working on a robotics challenge, Sullivan (2008) recorded the scientific skills she saw the 
students using. Even though the challenge was not science oriented, she was able to code 
for actions such as observation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing, estimation, 
control of variable, and evaluation of solution. While these are essential skills for science 
and were learned and practiced in robotics, it is not certain whether they would directly 
impact math or science standardized test scores. But, if the robotics increases student 
interest in science or math, it could lead to the more STEM course taking and greater 
achievement through the affective pathway.  
However, there may be a trade-off between these pathways. Comparing a week-
long robotics summer camp with 40 contact hours to a one day 3- hour program, Nugent, 
Barker, Grandgenett, and Adamchuk (2010) noticed that while students in the long 
program had larger content knowledge gains than the student in the short program, the 
short program students had more gains in positive attitudes and interest in STEM. The 
authors hypothesize that the difference was a result of the different focuses and needs of 
 16 
the two curricula. With the extra contact time, the long program was able to use a more 
cognitively challenging project, while the short program focused on tasks that could be 
completed within the limited time.  
RELEVANT PRIOR STUDIES  
This dissertation focuses on math and science achievement. Unfortunately, very 
few robotics education studies maintain this same focus. I discuss the relevant studies 
below. While these all have definite strengths, they also have sizable limitations.  
The largest study on educational robotics was conducted in Peru when the 
INFOESCULELA Project expanded use of LEGO robotics kits from 12 primary schools 
in 1996 to 130 schools by 1998. Using seven pairs of schools matched by social and 
economic factors, Iturrizaga (2000) conducted a mixed methods study of 2nd, 4th, and 6th 
grade students over one year, split between experimental schools (robotics) and 
comparison schools (no robotics). In total, between the experimental and comparison 
groups, over 500 students participated in the study along with their parents and teachers. 
Teachers went to robotics training programs on weekends and were provided with 
robotics instructional material including lessons and projects. Students worked in small 
groups of 2-4 and worked with robotics for at least 12 hours per month for one school 
year.    
Casting a wide net, students were surveyed and tested in math, technology, 
Spanish, self-esteem, and hand-eye coordination. The math tests were multiple choice 
and fill in the blank tests based on the official Ministry of Education program. The 
Cronbach Alpha reliability was at least 0.79 for all three grades. Iturrizaga reports a 
significant increase in test scores in each of the three grades, with mean scores of the 
robotics students 45% to 63% higher than for the comparison students. 
 17 
This study has some important strengths. It has a large number of subjects split 
between multiple sets of matched schools. Teachers were trained and there were a large 
number of contact hours during the year. In addition, the assessment questions were 
aligned to their standard curriculum and were fairly reliable.  
However, considering that the subjects were spread out between 3 grades in 14 
schools, 500 subjects yields an average of only 12 students in each grade in each school. 
It is also unknown how the students were chosen. Furthermore, while the schools were 
matched, the students were not. Given the relatively low number of students in each 
grade and school subgroup, controlling for factors such as previous achievement would 
have been helpful. In addition, one of the weaknesses of this study is that the final 
assessments were administered shortly after the activities were completed. This method 
captured immediate short-term effects but provides no indication of whether or not 
effects persisted in the long-term. According to Köller, Baumert, & Schnabel (2001), 
changes in interest and attitudes may not improve achievement until students are old 
enough to choose whether to enroll in STEM electives.    
Hussain, Lindh, and Shukur (2006) noted that Peru’s education setting and norms 
are not the same as those of most Western countries. Elementary students in Peru only 
attend school for half a day instead of a full day, and Peruvian students are less likely to 
be familiar with technology. Since Iturrizaga’s results may not generalize to other 
locations, they conducted a large-scale study involving over 700 students split between 
the fifth grade and ninth grade, in multiple schools across central Sweden. Unlike the 
Iturrizaga study, experimental group teachers were not given robotics lessons and 
projects, but were told to adjust ordinary school activities to incorporate robotics for 
approximately eight hours per month. The groups were pretested on math and problem 
solving and given posttests after 12 months. The math exams were modeled after the 
 18 
Swedish national math tests for 5th and 9th grades. Using t-tests, the researchers found that 
for fifth grade students, there were no significant differences in math scores, but there 
was a significant decrease in problem solving scores for robotics students. For ninth 
grade students, the researchers found no significant differences.  
Using what seems to be the same raw data as Hussain, Lindh, and Shukur (2006), 
Lindh and Holgersson (2007) divided the students by performance level and reanalyzed 
the information. They split the fifth-grade students into three groups based on how the 
students performed on their math tests during their fourth-grade year: low, medium, and 
high scorers. There was no significant difference between comparison and experimental 
students who were low scorers or high scorers, but the robotics students who were in the 
middle on fourth grade math scores had a significant math score gain compared to the 
comparable non-robotics students.  
Even after splitting the subjects between two grades, this pair of studies has a 
large number of subjects, and the students had a good number of contact hours each 
month. Also, because entire classes were assigned to either the experimental or 
comparison group, there was no student self-selection bias. Furthermore, the tests were 
similar to standardized test questions.  
However, there was no guarantee of consistent instruction because the subjects 
were spread out between schools. Each teacher was charged with designing his or her 
own robotics curriculum, and thus there was no guarantee of consistent instruction. Also, 
unlike the fifth-grade students, there was no pattern found with the ninth grade students, 
which further calls into question the robustness of their findings. As with Iturrizaga 
(2000), the assessment came soon after the robotics lessons ended and there was no 
followup in later years to see if there were differences in achievement once the students 
could choose advanced math/science classes.  
 19 
Working with an American charter elementary school, Laughlin (2013) 
investigated whether an afterschool robotics program affected standardized math test 
scores in fourth- and fifth-grade students. The robotics student participants (23 fourth 
grade and 23 fifth grade) were matched to a comparison group (76 fourth grade and 87 
fifth grade) based on standardized math pre-test score, gender, and gifted designation. 
While Laughlin found a significant increase in pre to post math scores in the robotics 
students, the improvement was not significantly different from the comparison group.  
This study used reliable standardized tests and there was matching on several 
important variables. Because there was only one site, it is likely that all of the students 
had the same curriculum. 
Unfortunately, due to small sample sizes, this study had little statistical power. In 
addition, the setting for the study is a single charter school, calling into question whether 
the results can be generalized to a national population. As with the previous studies, this 
work is not longitudinal, so delayed effects are not captured.   
Though it did not use a full robotics kit, there may be some lessons available from 
a long-term study by Wolfgang, Stannard, and Jones (2003). The study spanned 17 years, 
following students from pre-school until their high school graduation. At the start, 27 pre-
school children were graded on a 5-point scale on how well they could use and create 
with regular LEGO (non-robotic) blocks. A high score indicated that they were insightful 
and adaptive in their use. There was no significant difference between the higher-scored 
and the lower-scored children in the third- and fifth-grade tests. However, differences 
started to appear starting in seventh-grade standardized math tests once the researchers 
controlled for IQ and gender. As the students aged, the differences between the groups 
grew statistically stronger. By the end of high school, students’ pre-school LEGO scores 
 20 
significantly correlated with their high school math grades, number of honors courses 
taken, number of advanced math courses taken, and weighted math grade point average.  
The main strength of this study is that it is longitudinal and there are many 
achievement measures. In addition, the researchers controlled for two important 
variables: IQ and gender.  
However, the sample size is very small. By the end of the study, the researchers 
were only able to track 20 students through the entire period. Furthermore, since the 
study employed non-robotic LEGO blocks, it is not known whether the addition of the 
robotic and programming components would have altered the results. Also, since there 
was no intervention or teaching, it is possible that the LEGO skill differences that were 
observed are something that cannot be taught.  
Project Lead the Way (PLTW) is a series of courses designed to introduce middle 
school and high school students to engineering. The lessons and other materials are 
commercially available and have been used in over 1,400 schools across the United 
States. To participate, schools are required to purchase the materials and PLTW teachers 
are rigorously trained. Looking at 70 pairs of matched students, Tran and Nathan (2010) 
used participants’ 8th- and 10th-grade standardized math and science test scores as pretests 
and posttests. Both comparison (no PLTW) and experimental (PLTW) groups increased 
their scores. However, after controlling for student factors (gender, free/reduced school 
lunch eligibility, and eighth-grade test scores) and teacher experience (in years) the 
PLTW students gained less than students who did not participate in the courses. 
The strength of this study is that the researchers matched the pairs on several 
important factors and had an acceptable number of subjects. In addition, because of the 
PLTW training, all PLTW students likely had similar experiences. This study is also the 
only one that examined science achievement as well as math. 
 21 
For our purposes, the main problem with this study is that it is not a robotics class. 
However, PLTW it is a STEM elective that, like robotics, has projects and improve 
student interest and attitudes towards science and math. Thus, it may be serve as a 
surrogate for robotics. It is important to keep in mind that the various PLTW courses are 
different from each other and from robotics, and thus I cannot rule out that they may have 
different impacts on math and science affect. However, while the time between pretest 
and posttest was two years, because the study focused on early high school students, it is 
unlikely that the students would have been able to take math or science electives within 
that time; so we would not see any achievement gains due to course selection, as 
predicted by Köller, Baumert, & Schnabel (2001). 
Because of the conflicting results of the above studies, there is no consensus 
whether or not educational robotics is beneficial to math and science achievement in an 
industrialized country, such as the United States. All of the major studies on robotics 
have substantial weaknesses, including low sample size, a different educational setting 
(Peru vs. Western), inconsistent robotics curricula, absence of controls for student 
factors, and lack of assessment of long-term effects. What is needed is a study using a 
large number of robotics students (e.g., Iturrizaga (2000)) who have had a large number 
of contact hours using a consistent curriculum (Iturrizaga, 2000; Tran & Nathan, 2010a), 
and the study should follow the students for multiple years into high school (e.g., 
Wolfgang et al., 2003) and control for multiple confounding factors (Tran & Nathan, 
2010a). This study encompasses these features.

Chapter 3:  Methodology 
This study involves a quantitative piece (Part 1) and a qualitative piece (Part 2). In 
this chapter, I describe each piece separately.  
PART 1: QUANTITATIVE METHODOLOGY 
Study Site 
The dataset used in this study concerns a single school located in a large city in 
Texas. In the 2012-2013 school year, which was the last robotics cohort, the school had 
over 2100 students and was approximately 52% non-Hispanic white, 30% Hispanic, 7% 
African American, and 6% Asian. 29% of the school was economically disadvantaged, 
with 7% in special education, and 4% English Language Learners. The school met state 
accountability standards and the class of 2012 had a 97% graduation rate.  
Description of Dataset 
The data used by this study is a subset of a larger database which was provided by 
the school district and consists of standardized test scores, course enrollment, and 
demographics information for a set of students who have enrolled in robotics at the 
school and a matched set of comparison students who did not enroll in robotics at the 
school. The entire dataset consisted of 766 students. All robotics students were enrolled 
in the robotics course at some point in the academic year range from 2009-2010 to 2012-
2013. Since robotics was not restricted to any particular grade level, robotics students 
could have taken the class any time from 9th through 12th grades.   
Unfortunately, many of the subjects in the main database did not fulfill the criteria 
for this study, and were excluded. The reasons a subject was removed from the study 
subset were: 
 23 
1. Missing data – some student records were missing important data points, such 
as standardized test scores or class enrollment. Because each of the analyses 
are independent (exit level math test score, each class enrollment), I could 
have maximized the number of samples available for each analysis by using  
different subsets of data for the different analyses, e.g. ignore missing class 
enrollment information for exit level math test score analysis and vice versa. 
However, using different subsets calls into question whether the analyses are 
comparable. Therefore, only students with complete records are included in 
the study subset. 
2. Standardized test change – during the time period covered by the database, 
Texas was in a multi-year transition from the TAKS (Texas Assessment of  
Knowledge and Skills) standardized testing systems to the STAAR (State of 
Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness) system (Texas Education Agency, 
2017a). Since TAKS test results are not comparable to STAAR scores, in 
order to simplify the analysis, all students in the study subset use only students 
with a complete set of TAKS math scores (8th grade and exit level) were 
included in the data subset used in this study. 
3. Grades of robotics enrollment – since the focus of the quantitative study is 
whether robotics could have a long-term effect on test scores and class 
enrollment, I only included students who enrolled in robotics during their 9th 
or 10th grade years and examined exit level math scores (taken in 11th or 12th 
grade) and math/science electives commonly taken in the 11th and 12th grades.  
4. Female students – for some unknown reason, the previous three criteria 
disproportionately removed female students from the database. Because there 
were not a significant number of female students who remained in the study 
 24 
data subset, I chose to remove all the girls in order to focus on the male 
students and simplify the analysis. Only male students were included in the 
study subset. 
The data includes test scores, course enrollments and demographics for each 
student. Test scores include students’ scaled math TAKS standardized test scores (8th 
grade and exit level), and the month/year that the tests were administered. The course 
enrollment data consists of the titles, semester enrolled, and semester grades of every 
math, science, and technology class that each student enrolled in from 9th grade through 
12th grade. The demographic information consists of student ethnicity, gender, economic 
disadvantaged status, English Language Learner (ELL) status, and special education 
(SpEd) status. 
Variables 
Standardized math TAKS test scores (8th grade and exit level). All public 
school students in Texas take a series of standardized tests over their school career, where 
the immediate result of each test is a raw score of how many questions the student 
answered correctly. In the study data subset, all test scores are from the TAKS system. 
However, because the number and difficulty of test questions changed between test 
administrations, raw scores from different administrations cannot be directly compared. 
To solve this problem, charts are provided by the Texas Education Agency to convert raw 
scores to scaled scores that can be directly compared across test administrations (Texas 
Education Agency, 2017a).  
Typically, students usually take the exit level math TAKS exam in the 11th grade, 
but occasionally in the 12th grade. In this case, all the students in the study subset took the 
test between 2012 and 2014. For these test administrations, the Texas Education Agency 
 25 
used a scaling system that had an approximate range of 1200-3300. The minimum 
standard was set at 2100 points, and commended performance at 2400 (Education Service 
Center, Region 20, 2009). For exit level tests, I am using the TAKS scaled scores in my 
analysis as continuous numeric variables.  
All the students in the study subset took the 8th grade math TAKS test between 
2009 and 2010. During this time, the 8th grade math TAKS test converted from a scaled 
score with a range of 1200-3300 (similar to the exit level test) to a scale with a 0-1000 
range (Education Service Center, Region 20, 2009).  In order to compare 2009 and 2010 
scores, I used data published by the Texas Education Agency to convert both sets of 
scores into percentile ranks.  
Ethnicity. Student ethnicity was self-reported by the student in the 9th grade and 
is used as a categorical variable in the analysis. Students had the following options for 
ethnicity: American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, Black non-Hispanic, Hawaiian 
Native or other Pacific Islander, Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, and Two or More 
Ethnicities. In order to have groups large enough for valid statistical analysis, several 
ethnic categories were combined into two main groups: 
1. Asian /White, non-Hispanic 
2. Hispanic/Black non-Hispanic/Two or More Ethnicities 
The categories American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Hawaiian Native or other 
Pacific Islander did not have any members in the study data subset. 
Special Education status. Because students are categorized for special education 
after they are evaluated for qualification and not upon onset of a qualifying condition, 
special education status is a lagging indicator. A student may qualify for special 
education, but not have special education status because he/she has not been evaluated 
 26 
yet. Thus, I treated special education as a dichotomous variable and considered a student 
as special education if he/she has ever qualified for special education during high school.   
Economic disadvantage status. A student’s free/reduced lunch status was used 
as a proxy for their socio-economic status. The school district qualifies families as 
eligible for free lunch if their income falls below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines, 
and reduced lunch if it is between 130% and 185%. I did not distinguish between students 
who receive reduced lunch instead of free lunch. In addition, because, as with special 
education, lunch status is a lagging indicator, I treated economic disadvantaged status as 
a dichotomous variable and considered a student as disadvantaged if he/she has ever 
qualified for free/reduced lunch during high school.  
English Language Learner status. In the school district, students judged to be 
English Language Learners (ELL) are placed in English as a Second Language (ESL) 
classes and transition out of ELL status upon completion of the program. However, while 
students who complete ESL programs may be able to communicate in English, they 
typically do not have the mastery to complete academic work (Lee & Buxton, 2010), thus 
they continue to be at a linguistic disadvantage. For this reason, I treated ELL as a 
dichotomous variable and considered a student as an ELL if he/she has ever qualified as 
an ELL student.  
In the complete database, gender was self-reported by the student in the 9th grade. 
However, as previously noted, because there were not a significant number of female 
students that fit the criteria for the study subset, I removed all female students in order to 
focus on the male students. Thus, it is not included as a variable in the analysis. 
 27 
Matching Criteria 
Since students in robotics classes are self-selecting and not randomly assigned, it 
is possible that robotics students are not representative of the larger school population. 
Based on discussions with the robotics teacher and classroom observers, it was 
determined that the robotics classroom may have fewer ethnic minority, female, English 
Language Learners, and special education students than the rest of the school. Thus, for 
the dataset, I matched on demographic and achievement factors that I hypothesized may 
be different.  
Because I am interested in math and science achievement, I was concerned about 
whether the robotics students are starting at the same level as the rest of the school. Thus, 
I matched on previous math achievement, as measured by their 8th grade math 
standardized score as well as the demographic factors.  
Weaknesses 
One of the weaknesses of the data is that in order to protect students from being 
uniquely identified, the dataset contains only a subset of the total number of robotics and 
comparison students, which were selected by the school district. This reduces the sample 
size. In addition, demographic groups that may have only a small number of students may 
not be represented at all, or may have the critical information masked in the data. 
Information about the proportions of demographic groups are estimates of the true 
distributions.  
Another limitation is the shift in course requirements during the target time 
period. During the time period in which the students in the dataset were in high school, 
the Texas high school graduation requirements changed. The “4x4” raised the math and 
science course requirements to 4 years of each for the recommended graduation plan, and 
were in effect for students who started 9th grade between the 2007-2008 school year 
 28 
through the 2013-2014 year. Before this period, students were only required to pass three 
courses in each math and science. This change may have impacted the enrollment in math 
and science classes and was accounted for during the analysis by adding an independent 
variable that describes whether a student was subject to the 4x4 requirement or not. 
As previously noted, to simplify the analysis and to maintain consistency between 
tests, I only used students who took all TAKS tests, had a complete set of records, 
removed students who took robotics after 10th grade, and removed all female students. 
The disadvantage is that the sample size available for each analysis is reduced, which in 
turn reduces the power of the analysis. 
Research Questions and Data Analysis Plans 
Research Question 1 
Is there a relationship between enrollment in a high school robotics class and 
standardized math test scores? 
Data 
As previously noted, because I am interested in long term effects, I used only the 
subset of robotics students who enrolled in robotics during 9th or 10th grades, and their 
comparison counterparts. To make the Research Question 1 results easier to compare to 
Research Question 2, I only used the subset of students who also qualified for both 
questions. The final number of students used in the analysis is N=87. 
Dependent Variable 
High school students in Texas take their exit level standardized state math test at 
the end of 11th grade or in 12th grade. Thus, my dependent variable is the students’ scaled 
exit level math standardized test score. I hypothesized that robotics students would have 
higher test scores than similar students who did not enroll in robotics class in high school. 
 29 
Main Independent and Control Variables 
For categorical variables, effect coding was used so that interactions between 
them can be studied. The main independent variables are: 
• Robotics – this variable describes whether a robotics student was enrolled in the 
robotics class during either their 9th grade or 10th grade year, or was a comparison 
student (not in robotics). See Table 3.1 for Robotics year codes. 
 
Table 3.1: Effect coding for Robotics variable. 
 Robotics 
9th or 10th grade Robotics student 1 
Comparison (non-robotics) student -1 
 
In addition, I added several other predictors as control variables. Most of them 
have been described above.    
• 8th grade standardized math scores expressed as percentile rank 
• 9th grade math class – While many students have Algebra I as their 9th grade math 
class, more advanced students could have Geometry or Algebra II. With a limited 
amount of time to take math classes in high school, which math class a student 
takes in 9th grade can be an important factor in whether a student will qualify to 
take advanced math and science course later in high school. Thus, I included it as 
an ordinal predictor variable. I effect code this predictor set as the variable 
Post_Algebra_I. See Table 3.2 for Algebra 1 codes. There were no students in the 
dataset who were behind schedule and did not have at least Algebra I in the 9th 
grade.  
 30

• Tables 3.3-3.7 contain codes for the following variables: Ethnicity, English 
Language Learner, Economic Disadvantage, and Special Education. American 
Indian /Alaskan Native and Hawaiian Native/Pacific Islander are not included in 
Table 3.4 because there were no students in the study subset who identified in 
those categories. Simiarly, there is no table for gender since there are only male 
students in the study data subset.

Analysis Plan for Research Question 1 
To answer the research question, I used multiple linear regression, which has the 
general equation: 
Y = β0 +β1x1 +β2x2 + ...+βi xi +βi+1x1x2 +βi+2x2x3 + ...+βnx1...xi  
where Y is the dependent variable, x are the independent (predictor) variables and β are 
the weights. The terms past βi xi  express the interactions between the previous predictor 
variables.   
For the analysis, I created a series of models where I varied the independent 
variables: 
• Model 1: Robotics  
• Model 2: Model 1 plus 8th grade math test percentile rank 
• Model 3: Model 2 plus 9th grade advanced math class 
• Model 4: Model 3 plus ethnicity (Asian/White, non-Hispanic) 
• Model 5: Model 3 plus interaction terms for ethnicity (Robotics x Asian /White, 
non-Hispanic) 
 
 32 
Research Question 2 
Is there a relationship between enrollment in a high school robotics class and later 
enrollment in advanced STEM courses? 
Data 
To answer the research question, I started with the subset of robotics students who 
enrolled in robotics and who had a complete list of STEM class enrollment through 12th 
grade, and their comparison counterparts. To make the Research Question 2 results easier 
to compare to Research Question 1, I only used the subset of students who also qualified 
for both questions. The final number of students used in the analysis is N=87. 
Dependent Variables 
The school offers several math and science courses beyond the minimum 
required. However, because in some of these courses, students do not have an 
independent outside evaluation of their learning (such as a standardized test), it is 
possible that these classes are not rigorous. Thus, I focused on classes with an Advanced 
Placement exam or are in the International Baccalaureate program. Calculus and statistics 
both have AP exams, but calculus is more commonly required for college STEM majors 
than statistics. There are several AP science subjects, but physics, particularly mechanics, 
is directly relevant to robotics. Designing and constructing the hardware for the robot is 
an exercise in mechanical engineering. The concepts of using motors and generating 
torque are central to robotics, but are also key topics in physics. In addition, physics is 
also a common requirement for STEM majors. In addition to AP courses, calculus and a 
second year of physics are also addressed in International Baccalaureate classes. To be 
inclusive of both the AP and IB courses, I will refer to these groups as Calculus and 
Physics 2. Thus, the dependent variables are whether a student enrolls in Calculus class 
or Physics 2 class, and are dichotomous variables.  
 33 
This decision aligns with the findings of Sadler, Sonnert, Hazari, and Tai (2014), 
who found that among advanced high school math and science courses, only calculus, 
physics and a second year of chemistry predicted student interest in a STEM career. 
While there was no significant difference between having one or two years of calculus, 
enrolling in two years of physics was a stronger predictor than just one year. Since the 
robotics class had no chemistry content, I determined that it was unlikely that students 
would take a second year of chemistry as a result of their experience in the class, and 
focused on Physics 2 classes. This is also consistent with Trusty's (2002) work that found 
that calculus is the most significant predictor of girls majoring in math or science in 
college, while only physics is a significant predictor for boys. Trusty did not include the 
number of years of course taking in his study.  
Independent Variables 
The key independent and control variables for this analysis are the same as for the 
previous analysis. I controlled for both 8th-grade standardized math test percentile rank, 
and 9th grade math class, as well as for the demographic factors of ethnicity, economic 
disadvantaged status (as measured by free/reduced school lunch status), English 
Language Learner, and Special Education status. The coding was the same as with the 
previous research question. 
Analysis Plan for Research Question 2 
To answer the research question, I used logistic regression. Logistic regression 
has a similar principle to linear regression, but is used with dichotomous dependent 
variables instead of continuous.  
As with the previous research question, I created a series of models where I varied 
the dependent variables: 
 34 
• Model 1: Robotics  
• Model 2: Model 1 plus 8th grade math test percentile rank 
• Model 3: Model 2 plus 9th grade advanced math class 
• Model 4: Model 3 plus ethnicity (Asian/White, non-Hispanic) 
• Model 5: Model 3 plus interaction terms for ethnicity (Robotics x Asian/White, 
non-Hispanic) 
In addition, I also calculated the odds ratio for the final model, which has the 
general equation:  
Pr (Y =1) =
eβ0+β1x1+β2x2+...+βi xi
1+ eβ0+β1x1+β2x2+...+βi xi
 
where xi  are the independent variables and βi  are the weights. The odds ratio  
describes the odds of a robotics student taking a Calculus (or Physics 2) class compared 
to the odds of a non-robotics student taking the same class, i.e., for every non-robotics 
student taking Calculus (or Physics 2), how many robotics students will take the same 
class? 
 
PART 2: QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGY 
Study Site 
The site of this study is the same robotics class and high school as in the previous 
section. The class assumed no previous knowledge of robotics and was a full year course 
during the 2009-2010 academic year, though all of the data I used here is from the Spring 
2010 semester. During this year, the school implemented block scheduling, so the class 
met for 90 minutes every two days. Every two weeks, the class met on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Fridays, while it met Tuesdays and Thursdays on the weeks in between. 
There were four sections of the robotics class, but the data was collected only during two 
 35 
of the sections (periods 3 and 5). Combined, there were 51 students in the two periods, 
and the students were all in the 10th, 11th, or 12th  grade.   
The teacher for all sections had 10 years of prior high school teaching experience, 
mostly in science education. He had started the robotics team in 2006, and originated the 
robotics course in the 2008-2009 school year. In addition, a researcher who was 
observing and video recording the teams occasionally answered students’ questions and 
prompted teams to explain their thinking. In the transcripts, he is listed as a teaching 
assistant. 
Robotics Assignment 
Basic robotics hardware and software were taught in Fall 2009. The bulk of the 
Spring 2010 semester involved the design and construction of a complex robot system 
consisting of two robots working together.  
The first robot (Rail robot) is a mechanical claw that travels up and down a rail. 
The claw is programmed to examine a multi-level shelf for plastic balls. If it finds a ball, 
the robot picks it up, travels down the rail to drop the ball to the second robot, and returns 
to look for another ball. Figure 3.1 is a picture of a Rail robot on the rail and shelf. 
The second robot (Stationary robot, or Stat) catches the ball and detects its color. 
If the ball is green, it will throw the ball through a particular target. If the ball is black, it 
will throw the ball through a different target.  
Students were assigned to teams, and each team was split into two groups. One 
group designed and built the Rail robot, and the other group designed and built the Stat 
robot.  
In professional engineering projects, members of a design team may not be 
located at the same physical location or work in the same time zone.  To provide a more 
 36 
authentic experience, the robotics project also required two groups in different sections to 
work together to complete each robot. In all, four groups formed one team to create one 
complete robot system. The groups Rail Team 1 Period 3, Rail Team 1 Period 5, Stat 
Team 1 Period 3, and Stat Team 1 Period 5 worked together to create one Rail robot and 
one Stat robot pair. Each of the groups was assigned either 4 or 5 students, and each 
student had a defined role in the team.

 37 
The description of the project given to the students is included in Appendix A.  
Description of Qualitative Data 
The data collected from the project are videos of one robot system design team 
(Rail1 P3, Rail1 P5, Stat1 P3 and Stat1 P5). The videos were collected periodically over 
the semester and document each of the groups designing and constructing their robots.  
For Rail1 group, there are 21 videos, totaling 9.5 hours. For Stat1 group, there are 7 
videos, totaling 6 hours. 10-minute final presentations by each of the groups are included 
in the videos. These artifacts were originally collected by for use in another study 
(McKenna, 2014).  
Data collection was approved through the University of Texas IRB and data was 
collected only from students who were properly consented. Older students were able to 
provide their own consent, and parental consent was obtained for younger students.  
Research Question and Data Analysis Plan 
Research Question 3: 
Are robotics students taking advantage of potential opportunities to utilize math and 
science in their robotics project, or are there missed opportunities that could have been 
used? 
To answer the question, I used a grounded theory analysis on the videos and 
Google Docs text produced by the student design teams. Originally described by Glaser 
and Strauss (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), grounded theory is distinguished from other forms 
of interpretivist qualitative research by its emphasis on emergence. Glaser and Strauss 
believed that other qualitative researchers often “over-emphasize rigorous testing of 
hypotheses, and de-emphasize the discovering of what concepts and hypotheses are 
relevant for the substantive area being researched.” (Glaser & Strauss, 1970, p. 288). 
 38 
Where other methods start with a theoretical framework through which to interpret the 
data, grounded theory deliberately avoids it. Instead, the guiding principle is to let the 
theory “emerge” from the data (Merriam, 2002). By insisting on “grounding” the theory 
in observed data, the goal is to avoid biasing the researcher into using a framework that 
may not fit the data. 
Grounded theory distills its theory through repeated levels of coding and 
refinement. The process begins with “open coding” where the data elements in the 
artifacts are initially examined, identified, categorized, and compared to each other. New 
codes are created and others modified to fit the evidence.  
Because I am interested in how math and science could and are being used by the 
subjects, my initial list of codes included descriptions of the math and science concepts 
observed (e.g. measurement, algebra, force, momentum). In addition, I also coded the 
context of the usage (e.g. describing a problem, fixing problem). Thus, each usage of 
math and science had multiple codes to capture the situation. While these were the initial 
codes, I added and modified the list to incorporate potentially useful contextual 
information as I encountered it. The NVIVO software was used to aid in organizing and 
coding of the video recordings. 
In axial coding, codes and categories are reassembled and modified as the 
researcher tries to expose the underlying phenomena (Mann, 1993). As these connections 
between categories become evident, it is important to test these relationships against the 
data (Corbin & Strauss, 1990). Throughout the entire process, new data can be collected 
or existing data re-evaluated to support or refute the growing theories. As the concepts 
coalesce and survive scrutiny, the researcher eliminates the weaker connections to focus 
on a core category on which to build the theory (Mann, 1993).  
 39 
The final phase is selective coding, where the non-essential concepts and codes 
are culled, and essential areas of the core category are expanded upon. At this stage, the 
literature base is often consulted to see how similar ideas have been developed (Mann, 
1993). 
To support coding reliability, interrater agreement was determined. Another 
researcher independently coded a portion (10-20%) of the video and the text data, using 
the codebook from the open coding stage. The results were judged reliable if the overall 
agreement between coders was at least 80%.  
Below in Figure 3.2 is an excerpt from the final presentation from Stat Team 1 
Period 3 with example codes. Underlined sections of the transcript are coded. Math and 
science concepts that were used or talked about were used as codes. Contextual codes are 
written in italics and are defined as: 
 
Observation – math/science used to describe a phenomenon, but math/science not 
necessarily used to do something 
 
Design – math/science used to describe a component of the robot design or how it works.   
 
Problem – math/science used to describe or analyze a problem that they encountered. 
 
Fix – math/science used to describe and solve a problem with the robot.

    Transcript           Codes
 
Our specific strategy is to basically just 
shoot the balls into the specific goal and 
we do this we have a funnel that collects 
the balls. The rail robot drops them off at 
the funnel and they just through the 
motion of gravity and one wheel that 
spins to help transport them move to the 
shooter that is a couple of wheels that 
ball goes through and are spun by 
motors and goes off a Lexan ramp and 
just fires to the goal from there.  
 
And the functional requirements are that 
it has to the balls have to transport from 
the funnel to the shooter. And that was a 
difficulty in our original building design 
and we had to compromise design 
because we didn’t have a way for the 
balls to once they fell down from the 
funnel to the shooter, so that’s important 
and we had to figure out a way to do 
that. And we also need a powerful 
enough motor to be able to spin the 
wheels enough so that they can launch 
the balls and the balls will actually be 
able to like have enough momentum to 
travel into the goal.  
 
And basically. I kinda gave already a 
description of the design overview. But 
so basically our robot was kinda like a 
box sort of thing which was where the 
balls went into and on top is the funnel 
that they were dropped off into and then 
from they from there coming out of the 
box was an up sloped ramp with the 
wheels near the box that the balls went

through to shoot them up. And we went 
through a lot of original construction 
designs. Originally we wanted to have a 
rotating base so that we could turn the 
robot and have it shoot to various goals 
but that idea was swapped with an idea 
to have a sorter hooked up to a light 
sensor and have two shooters going on 
opposite ends, but then that was too 
complicated so we simplified it to one 
shooter that shot both the balls and 
regardless of like. It would only go to 
one goal. So it wasn’t as like efficient 
like as some of these other ideas were 
but it was more simple and doable so 
that was how it turned out. 
 
The shooter it…, we had already talked 
about it but, uses two motors and a series 
of 4 gears on each side to give each side 
a little more power. The motor and gears 
are on the bottom of the piece of Lexan 
and the wheels are on the top so Gears 
on the bottom so it doesn’t get caught … 
the ball doesn’t get caught on the gears  
 
And the funnel is a piece of posterboard 
then folded and taped into the shape of a 
funnel and is the maximum catchability  
cause the balls won’t bounce out cause 
of the slope.

each piece of metal to help propel the 
balls into the shooter to get them there. 
 
This wheel is powered by a motor and a 
gear system. There’s one motor and 2 
gears to help the balls get up the slight 
incline before the shooter    
 
All right, so as we were building our 
robot we ran into a few problems. The 
first, as --- mentioned, was the 
competing ideas of either a rotating base 
or just two different shooters that get fed 
balls by a sorter. And the problem with 
these two shooters was that on the base 
that we constructed there wasn’t enough 
room for both shooters to fit and overall 
it was just overall too complicated so we 
kind of scrapped that idea and went to 
one shooter. The second problem was 
the sorter. The sorter was pretty much .. 
if you can like a imagine a chicken 
rotisserie thing. It’s a rod with prongs 
that like spin and knock the balls either 
left or right depending on whatever the 
light sensor read and that was to fix the 
initial like … if you’ve got a green ball 
you don’t want to shoot it to the yellow 
goal or whatever. So that’s what the two

shooters were doing but the problem 
with the sorter was it would knock it 
down but the ball would lose all of its  
speed that it had from being dropped and 
it wouldn’t be able to get up the shooter 
and get launched out by the wheels. And 
the second .. uh third problem was balls 
were bouncing out of the frame of the 
robot . And the robot is basically a 
square with like a box on top of it made 
of like tubes and when balls would go 
down the sorter originally, they would ..  
some of them would bounce out to the 
left or right and we fixed that by putting 
rubber bands on. 
 
Our tough challenges. The biggest one 
was to make a rotating base stable and 
the double shooter design that was 
intense and the balance robot was also 
hard because there was a lot of moving 
parts that needed to be stable at the same 
time. And the sorter was probably a huge 
part because it had to deal with the light 
sensor, the rotisserie thing and 
communicating with other groups was 
probably the main problem. It’s just 
really hard.

QUANTITATIVE RESULTS 
Dataset Descriptives 
As mentioned in the previous chapter, this study used a subset of the complete 
dataset of robotics and comparison students provided by the school district. The students 
in the subset have no missing data, took only TAKS exams, and all robotics students 
were enrolled in the class in either the 9th or 10th grades. The final number of samples is 
N=87. 
Table 4.1 displays the numbers and proportions of the demographic variables in 
the study data subset. Students were considered Special Education students or an English 
Language Learner if they had ever been in one of those categories during their high 
school career. Students were categorized as Economically Disadvantaged if they had ever 
qualified for free or reduced price school lunch during their high school years.

Due to small numbers of some race/ethnicity groups, I combined the Two or More 
Ethnicities and the Black, non-Hispanic students with the Hispanic students, and I 
combined the Asian students with the White, non-Hispanic students. While Asian 
students are often combined with other minority students, there are several reasons why I 
am grouping them with the White students. First, while African-American and Hispanic 
students are underrepresented in STEM disciplines compared to percentage of the 
population, Asians are typically overrepresented. Thus, the division is a separation 
between overrepresented groups versus underrepresented instead of any individual race 
or ethnicity. 
The means and frequencies of the predictor variables used in the statistical 
analysis in this study are displayed in Table 4.2. For continuous variables (i.e. 8th grade 
math test percentile rank), the table lists the means and standard deviations of the overall 
data, robotics group, and comparison group. For categorical variables (9th grade advanced 
class, and White or Asian, non-Hispanic), the table lists the percentages in each group. In 
addition, the distributions of the predictors over the robotics and comparison groups were 
conducted and are included. A t-test was used for the continuous variable while χ2 was 
used for categorical variables. Because the set of robotics students may not match the 
general population of the school, I had requested that the set of students included in the 
dataset would be approximately matched with respect to race/ethnicity and 8th grade math 
test achievement. The results in Table 4.2 show that there are no significant differences at 
the 0.05 level between the distributions of any of the predictor variables over the subset 
of data used in the study.

Table 4.3 displays the intercorrelations between the predictor variables. Overall, 
the correlations are weak to moderate between the predictors, with the strongest being 
between 8th grade percentile score and 9th grade advanced class at 0.50.  
The means and frequencies for the dependent variables, and the distribution of 
robotics and comparison students are detailed in Table 4.4. While there is no significant 
difference between groups for Physics 1 enrollment, a significantly larger percentage of 
robotics students take Calculus and Physics 2.

Regression Results 
Tables 4.5-4.8 display the results of the linear and logistic regressions performed. 
For each analysis, the models used are: 
 Model 1: Robotics 
 Model 2: Model 1 + 8th grade math test percentile 
 Model 3: Model 2 + 9th grade advanced math class 
 Model 4: Model 3 + Asian/White, non-Hispanic 
 Model 5: Model 4 + Robotics x (Asian/White, non-Hispanic) 
Exit Level Test Scores 
To analyze the exit level math test scaled scores, I performed a 2-tailed multiple 
linear regression on the data using an ∝=0.05 significance level. A separate regression 
calculation was performed for each model, applying the predictors specified above. Table 
4.5 displays all of the regression results.   
In Model 1, the only predictor is whether the student was enrolled in robotics, and 
it did not prove to be significant. The addition of 8th grade math test percentile rank in 
Model 2 created a marked increase in the accuracy of the modeling equation, causing the 
R2 value to jump from 0.03 to 0.54. Unsurprisingly, the new predictor is significant at the 
 48 
p<0.001 level. Although Model 3 adds another highly significant predictor, there is only 
a small increase in the R2 value to 0.60, indicating that 9th grade advanced math class 
only accounts for a small part of the variance. Through all of the models, only 8th grade 
math test percentile rank and 9th grade advanced math class were significant predictors. 
Model 4 adds the race/ethnicity predictor of non-Hispanic White or Asian 
students, and Model 5 introduces the interaction of Robotics and non-Hispanic White or 
Asian. It is interesting to note that while the main effect of race/ethnicity has a positive 
coefficient, indicating that non-Hispanic White and Asian students are predicted to have 
higher 11th grade math scores, the interaction term is negative, suggesting that 
underrepresented minority students in robotics may receive a math score boost over their 
non-Hispanic White classmates and Asian classmates. However, since neither predictor is 
significant, these effects are far from certain. Though with a significance level of the 
0.107 for the interaction term, it is possible that a larger dataset could push this term to 
significance.  
For each TAKS administration, there is a mapping from the raw score (number of 
questions answered correctly) to a scaled score. However, the mapping is non-linear. The 
difference between answering 21 questions correctly and 22 questions correctly increases 
the scaled score by 2 points. However, the difference between answering 56 questions 
correctly and 57 questions correctly increases the scaled score by 101 points. The 
increase in scaled score for an extra correct question ranges from 2 points to 173 points. 
The largest score increases happen at the extreme ends of the scale. For students in the 
middle 68% (one standard deviation from the mean), the average scale score gain for 
each question is approximately 13.7 points. Typically, the exit level math TAKS test has 
between 58 and 60 questions. Using this approximation of 13.7 for each question, in 
Models 1-4, robotics students scored 2.6, 1.5, 1.1, and 1.1 additional questions correctly 
 49 
respectively. Since Model 5 adds the interaction term, race/ethnicity must also be taken 
into account. Asian/White, non-Hispanic students who take robotics scored 4.16 points 
less than their comparison group counterparts. Meanwhile, Hispanic/Black, non-
Hispanic/Two or More Ethnicity students scored 50.14 points more, which I estimate to 
be 3.7 additional questions correct.  
Physics 1 
In this work, I define Physics 1 as the first high school class dedicated solely to 
physics. Unlike later physics classes, knowledge of calculus is not a requirement.  
Since enrollment in a class is a binary variable, logistic regression was used for 
the following set of calculations instead of multiple regression. A separate logistic 
regression calculation was performed for each of the five models. Table 4.6 shows the 
results of the analysis. As before, ∝=0.05 was used as the significance level. 
Focusing on the odds ratios, for Models 1-5, robotics students are 1.45, 1.39, 1.36, 
1.37, and 1.33 times more likely to enroll in Physics 1 than comparison group students, 
respectively. 
However, robotics failed to be a significant predictor of Physics 1 enrollment in 
any of the models. Since Table 4.3 shows that the great majority of both robotics and 
comparison students enroll in the class, this is not a surprising result. Physics 1 seems to 
draw from a wide cross section of students. In fact, 8th grade math test percentile was the 
only significant predictor in any of the models.  
There is one outside factor that may have affected the data surrounding Physics 1. 
During this time period, students in Texas were subject to the “4x4” science and math 
graduation requirement, where the recommended public high school graduation plan 
required students to pass four science and four math courses, which was an increase from 
 50 
the previous requirements. During the years the “4x4” was in effect, there is likely to 
have been a boost in science and math elective course enrollments, including Physics 1, 
among students who would have otherwise enrolled in other electives, potentially 
reducing the effect that robotics may have had in promoting physics. 
Calculus 
In the study school, calculus was taught in multiple courses. In addition to the AP 
AB Calculus and the AP BC Calculus classes, the International Baccalaureate (IB) 
Mathematics Higher Level, covers a number of topics including calculus. Students in all 
of these classes were grouped together as Calculus students.   
The results of the logistic regression on the five models are shown in Table 4.7. In 
the first model, robotics was the only predictor variable and was significant at the p<0.05 
level. However, as I progressed through the models and more predictors were added, the 
significant variables shifted. In Model 2, 8th grade math test percentile rank became 
highly significant (p<0.001), and robotics became non-significant. In Model 3, the results 
shift again. Now, whether students were enrolled in an advanced math class in 9th grade is 
highly significant (p<0.001), and both robotics and 8th grade math test percentile become 
insignificant. 
This result remained stable in Model 4, with 9th grade advanced math class as the 
only significant predictor. 
The fact that enrollment in an advanced math class in the 9th grade is a highly 
significant predictor is not surprising. The typical math sequence consists of year-long 
courses in Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, and then Calculus. If a student 
is enrolled in Algebra 1 in 9th grade, and takes one math course each year, then he/she 
will only reach Pre-Calculus by the end of four years. While it is possible to enroll in two 
 51 
math courses in a year and reach Calculus, it is a rare occurrence. Nearly all Calculus 
students passed Algebra 1 before the 9th grade.  
While robotics was not significant past the first model, it remained much closer to 
significance than the other predictors other than 9th grade advanced math class. It is quite 
possible that a modestly larger dataset would cause the p-value to cross the threshold.  
Based on the odds ratios, for Models 1-5, robotics students are 1.65, 1.63, 1.86, 
1.87, and 2.11 times more likely to enroll in one of the Calculus courses than comparison 
group students, respectively. 
Physics 2 
Like Calculus, students at the school had several options for a second physics 
class: AP Physics B, and AP Physics C classes, and IB Physics 2. While I have grouped 
all the students enrolled in these courses together as Physics 2 students, it is important to 
note that some of the courses, such as AP Physics C, are calculus based and require it as a 
co-requisite course, while others, such as AP Physics B, do not use calculus.  
Table 8 displays the logistic regression results of Physics 2 enrollment. In Model 
1, robotics is established as a significant predictor of enrollment at the 0.05 level, and in 
Model 2, robotics becomes less significant while 8th grade math percentile rank 
immediately becomes highly significant (p<0.01). In Model 3, 9th grade advanced math 
class becomes highly significant (p<0.001) and 8th grade math test percentile becomes 
insignificant. It is not surprising that the predictors are following the same pattern as 
calculus enrollment since many of the Physics 2 courses are calculus-based. Typically, 
students in Physics 2 are enrolled in a calculus class in the same year. 
 52 
However, unlike the results for calculus, robotics remains significant through 
Model 3. But even in Model 4, robotics is close to the threshold. It is possible that a 
larger sample size would maintain the significance of robotics. 
According to the odds ratios, for Models 1-5, robotics students are 2.05, 2.06, 
2.13, 2.03, and 1.85 times more likely to enroll in one of the Physics 2 courses than 
comparison group students, respectively.

QUALITATIVE RESULTS 
The qualitative analysis is based on video recordings of a robotics class as they 
work on a capstone project, and focuses on two student teams, one rail robot team and 
one stat robot team. While the recordings were spread out throughout the duration of the 
project, not all class meetings were recorded. In total, there were 10 hours and 47 minutes 
of the rail robot team and 8 hours and 27 minutes of the stat team. For each of the 
students who appear in the recordings, the proper consents/assents were collected.  
To answer the question of what math and science learning opportunities could 
have occurred in the class, I must first answer what math and science usage actually 
occurred. In order to characterize the possible learning, the following questions must be 
asked: 
1. What math and science topics and skills were being used by students in the class? 
2. How were the topics used? Were students calculating formulas or were they 
applying them at a conceptual level? 
3. In what context were the students using math and science? 
Transcription and Coding 
The first step of the analysis was to transcribe the relevant information from the 
videos. Not every spoken word was transcribed, but only the speech that was relevant to 
the teams’ work on the project. In addition, where the speech was ambiguous or it 
referred to something visual, I added contextual information in brackets to aid 
comprehension of the situation. Two examples of this are listed below: 
 
R: We’re going to have like a thing [makes roof shape with hands] like this.  
 
 58 
N: It’s going to move like this [bends arm at the elbow and swings forearm] … 
like that and have a grabbing hand.    
 
Some of the video includes interactions between team members and either the 
teacher/teaching assistant or other students in the class. Relevant discussions about the 
project that include math or science were also included.   
In the first phase of the analysis, open coding, using the transcripts, I created 
codes centered around the above questions: what math/science topics were being 
discussed or used, how were the topics used, and context of the usage. Table 4.9 shows 
the codes used along with examples from the transcripts.  
The topic codes were simply the science or math subject that the students were 
referencing in their discussion. Often, the correct code was easily determined because the 
students would use the appropriate terminology or the reference would be clear (e.g. “it 
would have enough momentum”, “it was pretty heavy”), but sometimes, the appropriate 
code would have to be ascertained from the discussion (e.g. “motors to be able to spin the 
wheels enough so that they can launch the balls”). Some of the codes overlap or are more 
specific versions of other codes (e.g. gravity and force, pneumatic and pressure). This 
reflects the fact that there is different terminology for subcategories of concepts, i.e. 
gravity is a type of force. Also, sometimes student discussions are clear and specific 
about concepts and sometimes they are vague or the speak more generally.  In each case, 
I used the most specific codes which fit the context. Where necessary, multiple codes 
were applied to some statements.  
 59

Teacher initiated You should say “center of gravity”. 
Usage 
Conceptual If it doesn’t bounce, all we have to do is add more 
metal. 
Calculation What fraction is a .93333? 
 
Two codes were used to describe the students’ usage of math and science 
material: calculation and conceptual. The first one was applied if the students used or 
computed a formula or performed some other mathematical calculation. The students 
could have used a calculator or a computer as well as performed it by hand. On the other 
hand, the conceptual code was applied if the students talked about a math or science idea 
but did not perform a calculation.  
To help capture context, I used a series of codes to describe the project activity 
that the teams were engaged in when they discussed the math or science. 
• Explanation – explaining a math/science concept to someone else 
• Observation – using a math/science concept or terminology when making an 
observation about the project or a robot  
 61 
• Description – using math/science when describing their robot to others 
• Design – using math/science when discussing design decisions or choices with 
team members or teacher/teaching assistant 
• Problem – using math/science in reference to a problem in their design 
• Fix – using math/science concepts when referring to a possible method to solve a 
problem  
 
In addition, I used the code “Teacher initiated” to indicate the occasions when the 
teacher or teacher’s assistant introduced new math or science ideas and terminology to 
the students. 
In the second phase of the analysis, axial coding, the previous codes were refined. 
The Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) specify the required curriculum for 
Texas public schools (Texas Education Agency, 2017b). Two codes were added to reflect 
whether the topics used by students are covered in the high school math or science TEKS. 
The courses I included were the required math classes (Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra 
II) and Physics.  
In the final phase, selective coding, codes were finalized and the main themes 
were identified and explored. Lesser themes were discarded. 
Main Themes 
From the transcribed videos of the rail and stat team, three main patterns were 
identified concerning the students’ math and science learning and usage. 
 
 62 
Theme #1: Math and science concepts were invoked/applied more often during 
problem solving than design. 
Figure 4.1 displays a chart of the proportion of each contextual code that was 
encountered in the transcripts. The majority of math and science students were engaging 
in was in either the context of talking about a problem with the robot or in an attempt to 
fix the problem. Students talking about the design of the robot accounted for less than one 
fifth of the math and science discussion. This result was somewhat counterintuitive since 
I coded as “design” several activities that a high potential for math and science content. 
These include expectations of how the robot would operate, design trade-offs, and 
discussing the pros and cons of alternative design ideas.  
 
 
Figure 4.1: Relative proportions of context codes 
 
The following are three examples of typical statements and exchanges about 
design. 
 
 63 
R: Maybe the funnel doesn’t start right here. Maybe it’s just like a slightly 
[gesturing a shallow ramp] thing 
 
 
R: So, an arm is going to attach. Like the shoulder. How is the shoulder and arm 
going to, is it going to be on the inside? 
N: Well, no cause the way she did it the motor is attached to the house then. Like 
that [gesturing with pieces] . So it is attached like that. 
 
 
R: I don’t know. Maybe the middle would be a better position. 
N: We want to do the middle. That way when we have the second motor here. 
Like mounted to the bottom, right? 
P: This is going to be attached to the side of the house, no? 
N: This is going to be attached to the top of the house. 
 
 
In the first example, R is making a design suggestion, which uses an inclined 
plane. Here, the student has brought in a physics concept to help accomplish their goal.  
 In the second, the students discuss details of how to attach the robot arm and how 
it fits within the constraints of the existing design, and in the third example, they are 
optimizing the placement of a part. In the first two cases, while the students are engaging 
in design activities, neither of the issues they are working around involves math or 
science concepts.  
In contrast, below are five typical statements and exchanges between students 
who are confronting a problem with their design and need to fix it.  
 64 
 
N: The gears are instead of like meshing; they’re leaning into each other [makes 
leaning gesture with hands], so they’re brushing [makes rubbing motion]  
 
 
N: I see what you are doing. What I’m thinking is I’m going to make this massive 
cube and do that Hole Wizard thing where it’s like 
R: But wait. Wouldn’t that be the opposite of a funnel? Like a funnel mold?  
 
 
N: let’s see if it fits … we’ll just attach it like that. Really we could just use it. 
Screw it down. That doesn’t necessarily need to be attached, you know. 
R: But then it would be less stable, you know.  
N: That’s true. 
 
 
P: See it’s going to slip [grabbing ball with claw]. It has to be really tight …  
 
 
M: I’m just trying to think of a way to keep it from sliding and I thought if you 
did that [points at part held by S] and then mounted a wheel on it or something. 
O: Yeah, case then the rubber would 
S: It would rotate  
M: That’s cool. Like put a wheel sideways of something so the rubber would keep 
it from sliding. 
 
 65 
 
In the first example, N is trying to communicate the problem with their gearing 
system. Not only is she discussing details of the function of the gears, but she is touching 
on the idea of friction between the teeth of the unaligned gears.  
In the second case, the students are using the Solidworks modeling tool and have 
run into a problem attempting to create a model of a funnel. Here, N is proposing a 3D 
geometric solution where instead of adding one 3D shape to another, she takes a cube and 
subtracts a cone shape using the Solidworks Hole Wizard tool. R points out an error in 
N’s geometric thinking.  
In the third example, R notices that N’s idea has a problem in that the design is 
less stable than the alternative. Here, stability can be thought of in terms of a force 
balance and stability is the tolerance for imbalance between the forces. 
With example four, P notices that the claw mechanism does not have enough 
friction to keep the ball from falling (gravity), and then solving the problem by increasing 
by increasing friction through increasing the pressure the claw exerts on the ball.  
In the last case, M is discussing the problem that he noticed because there is not 
enough friction between two surfaces, and proposed a solution using a repurposed wheel 
with tire because rubber has a higher coefficient of friction. S points out a problem with 
M’s plan because the tire will rotate when a force is applied. M offers an additional fix by 
altering the alignment of the tire to be sideways (perpendicular) to the direction of the 
force to minimize rolling.  
These sample problem and fix statements demonstrate that these students are 
comfortable thinking and communicating math and physics concepts to each other, and 
therefore math and physics should not be a barrier when conducting design activities. 
 66 
However, it is still more common for the students in this study to use math and science 
when solving problems than it is when creating the initial design.  
While this class did not use a formalized design cycle, it is important to note that 
discussing problems and fixes are necessary parts of the design process. In fact, in a 
survey of popular design cycles used in education and industry, though they are 
sometimes listed under different names, addressing problems and finding fixes are 
integral in each one (Guerra, Allen, Crawford, & Farmer, 2012). Many of these cycles 
have project phases dedicated to the redesign or optimization of an original design. Each 
redesign/optimization either implicitly or explicitly includes another round of problem 
and fix steps.  
Theme #2: Most of the mathematics content in the videos can be placed into two 
categories: geometry and measurement.  
While some of the robot design and construction utilized angles and shapes, most 
of the geometry was utilized when the students created mathematical modeling using the 
Solidworks CAD software. Much of the geometry was based in the simple two-
dimensional shapes of rectangles and circles, and finding the diameters. However, largely 
due to the CAD component, students also needed to create three dimensional shapes from 
either the extrusion of 2D shapes or by combining simpler 2D and 3D shapes similar to 
Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) in computer graphics.  
 
N: I don’t know how to make a circle on the same, on a different plane. Like I 
want them to be concentric, but I want them on a different plane. 
R: Oh, I gotcha. 
N: Cause I want to make this funnel. I decided that since the this is a Boss/Base, I 
could just [makes a stretching motion], and it works.  
 67 
 
In this example, N was attempting to create a model of a conical funnel (a 
truncated cone) by using the Solidworks Boss/Base tool to extrude a smaller circle into a 
larger circle.  
 
M: You know like grocery carts? How they have like a triangle with a rectangle 
and another triangle coming down and the wheel comes up inside of it? 
 
Here, M was attempting to describe the shape of caster and wheel using simpler 
geometric figures.  
 
Predictably, all of the science content was related to physics. Given that it is a 
robotics class, it would have been surprising to see chemistry, biology, or earth science 
directly used by the students. With the robotics kits abstracting away most of the 
electrical details of the control and motors, all of the codes created concern mechanics 
and kinematics. While much of the communication involved ideas from the first-year 
physics course, such as force, force balancing, inclined planes, and momentum, a 
substantial amount of discussion centered around more advanced concepts, such as gears 
and material strength. In the following example, N is explaining the system that they are 
using to slow down the movement of their robot.  
 
N: This will make the small one turn. For all the times the small one turns, it will 
take 12 times for this to turn to actually turn the big one once … and it will go 
slower … 
 
 68 
While it can be expected that some new math and science concepts were taught to 
students in the course of the robotics class, it is surprising how often those new concepts 
were used. Forty-two percent of the student discussions used science and math concepts 
not taught in the high school math or physics TEKS. In fact, several of the most 
commonly used codes (e.g. gearing, material strength) were not TEKS subjects.  
Theme #3: “Good enough” vs. precision in design. 
One surprising pattern that emerged from the analysis of codes is that all of the 
calculations performed by the students were in relation to measurement.  
 
R: It will be right there. It starts. [measuring and drawing] and then 3.16 inches … 
So this is 3 and a half, 3 and three quarters. What’s an eighth? 
N: I want to say it’s like [using calculator] 
 
This means that all of the physics used by the students was done at a conceptual 
level without computing any formulas. However, without working through formulas, it 
can be difficult to predict the effects of design decisions. While a conceptual 
understanding of mechanics can allow one to identify the forces at play in a situation, it 
does not allow one to tell if the forces are balanced or if a system is underdesigned or 
overdesigned. Imbalances and underdesign can lead to a system failure. Overdesign may 
not always lead to failure, but may be unnecessarily costly and limit options. Without 
accurate predictions, successful completion of a design proceeds through either trial and 
error, or through leveraging the experience and knowledge of an authority. The following 
was taken from the oral presentation each team made at the conclusion of the project. A 
classmate in the audience asked the team a question.  
 
 69 
Classmate: So when y'all were making the robot, … did it get harder and harder to 
keep it balanced on the rail? Like did that ever become a really big problem? 
R: Actually, we thought it would be a really big problem, but it really wasn't. 
N: Yeah, also because we had a lot of motors and servos, we had to have several 
motor controllers so that it sort of luckily worked out the extra motor controllers 
counteracted the weight of the arm. 
R: Yeah, but like who knows what would happen if we programmed it.... we don't 
know if would fall off or anything. 
 
Indeed, it seems that the teacher was encouraging an experimental approach to 
comprehending and fixing some design problems instead of promoting a more scientific 
understanding and characterization of the issues. In the following example, it seems that 
the teacher is rushing the team to immediately make a physical model instead of a more a 
scientific method of encouraging the team to think of hypotheses of how the system 
works before using a physical model to verify their ideas. 
 
T: You guys kind of played around with the angles, different options [holds 
wheels against rail at angle]. Um, I do know a group, yesterday, was kind of 
messing around with that and theirs was too wide and the thing was just moving 
around all over the place. … But I think if you make a prototype, even though it 
seems like we are close to running out of time, if you make a prototype, you are 
going to understand the situation much better.  
 
The lack of formulas and thoughtful prediction seem to be part of a larger culture 
where precision and exactness is not a priority. Throughout the class, it seems as there 
was a “good enough” attitude where instead of optimizing a design, the primary goal was 
to simply achieve a minimum level of functionality.  This is demonstrated in the next two 
examples. 
 
 70 
N: OK, let's just make it longer and see what happens. Cause we can always cut it 
off but we can't 
R: Should we make this a nice whole number, like 18.  
N: Let's do it. ... totally random number ... OK, uh. What happens when we don't 
smart dimension everything. OK. This needs to be smart dimensioned. 
R: So do you just want to keep just 9 inches? That's a pretty solid number...  
N: Yeah 
 
 
R: We need to draw in our 6 blah blah [sic] inches. And from that, we measure 
about 1.63 inches away.   
 … 
N: Yeah, why do we need to do 1.63 inches away from …? 
 … 
N: ... have a little bit more room for safety's sake. [holds pieces against old roof] 
We don't necessarily want all this content right up there. You know like . It'll be 
nice if there was a buffer. Is buffer a preferred word for it?  
R: I think so. It works. So we're going to ... down six and a half inches. 
 
In the last example, despite having calculated an exact measurement, the students 
deliberately veer away from it by an arbitrary amount to provide an extra margin for 
error.  In the next example, the teaching assistant (TA) is helping a student with a 
Solidworks problem.  
 
TA: That is a good question... the gears will mate to one another? 
A: Yeah 
 71 
TA: But these won't? 
A: Yeah. I could do that, but ... 
TA: But they're not mated?... Did you select both parts to mate?... Huh, I wonder 
if it doesn't believe it's a gear. That's kind of weird. Maybe there's an artifact.... 
Do you need it to? It looks like it's not quite there. 
A: Or I could just leave it like that. 
TA: You could. It's just a drawing. I doesn't have to be mechanically right. And 
since you're on a deadline, that might be it. 
 72 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
RESEARCH QUESTION 1: STANDARDIZED MATH SCORE ACHIEVEMENT 
A number of previous studies have found significant increases in math 
achievement after a robotics intervention. Iturrizaga (2000) worked with elementary 
school children in a dozen schools across Peru. Working in Sweden, Hussain et al. (2006) 
separated students into math test performance bands and found that there were math gains 
for students in the middle bands, but not for the high or low performing students. The 
only researchers who completed a longitudinal study, Wolfgang et al. (2003) found 
significant standardized math score benefits for students who were more adept at LEGO 
construction, with the gains becoming more significant as the students progressed in 
school. The adept students also tended to enroll in more elective math classes, which may 
have further affected their test scores. However, it must be noted that their sample size 
was very small (n=19), and they were using non-robotics LEGO. 
On the other hand, Laughlin (2013) failed to find significant results for math score 
achievement among the 4th and 5th grade students she studied. Meanwhile, Tran and 
Nathan (2010) discovered a significant negative impact on math scores for a large sample 
of PLTW students.  
Most studies of robotics and math achievement are concerned with the immediate, 
short-term effects of robotics. However, like Wolfgang et al. (2003) and Tran and Nathan 
(2010), my goal was to examine the effect on math achievement over the period of years. 
In this study, I examined whether enrollment in robotics class in the 9th and 10th grade 
was associated with standardized math score achievement in the 11th grade.  
The results of the regression analyses states that robotics class was not a 
significant predictor of math achievement in any of the models. Of the input variables, 
 73 
only 8th grade math score percentile and 9th grade advanced math course were of 
significance. This result agrees with the findings of Laughlin (2013). Unlike Tran and 
Nathan (2010), I did not find a negative effect. Unfortunately, because the number of 
samples is small, I was unable to separate the results into performance bands like Lindh 
and Holgersson (2007) to see whether middle performing students had different results 
than either top or bottom performing students.  
This answer is consistent with what I observed in the video recordings of the 
class. There was little discussion of math concepts and no calculations outside of 
measurement. Of the concepts that were discussed, a few were geometry topics, such as 
circumference, but most were not subjects covered in the standard high school math 
curriculum. Based on the qualitative data, I would not have expected to see any impact of 
robotics on math test scores.  
In later the models, overrepresented/underrepresented race/ethnicity was added to 
the list of predictors. Interestingly, in Model 5, the interaction effect of robotics and 
White or Asian (non-Hispanic) points in the opposite direction than the main effect. 
While I cannot draw definitive conclusions since neither result is significant, the model 
gives non-Hispanic White students and Asian students a small gain (5.79 points) while 
the interaction effect subtracts a much larger amount (-24.62) from the same group. The 
p-value of the interaction effect is also much closer to significance than the main effect 
(0.107 vs. 0.714).  With a larger sample size, it is possible that the interaction effect could 
cross the p<0.05 threshold. Given the emphasis on helping underrepresented minority 
students enter STEM fields, the possibility that robotics could offer an outsized gain to 
those students is worth further study. 
 74 
The answer to the research question of whether there is a relationship between 
participation in a robotics class and later standardized math scores is that, according to 
this analysis, there is not, and I fail to reject the null hypothesis.  
RESEARCH QUESTION 2: STEM COURSE ENROLLMENT 
This study also investigated whether there was a correlation between high school 
robotics class and future enrollment in high school STEM courses, specifically, Physics 
1, Physics 2, and Calculus. Physics 1 was defined as an introductory course devoted to 
physics curriculum. All second courses in physics, both calculus and non-calculus based, 
were included in our definition of Physics 2. These include all AP Physics courses and 
the IB Physics 2 course. For Calculus, I chose to include all AP Calculus classes, as well 
as the IB Mathematics Higher Level course, which contains a substantial amount of 
calculus in its curriculum.  
This study focused on these courses because Sadler et al. (2014) found an 
association between high school physics, calculus, and 2nd year chemistry enrollment and 
interest in a STEM career. Due to the low amount of chemistry, I judged that it was 
unlikely that robotics class would have a significant effect on advanced chemistry 
enrollment and concentrated on the physics and calculus courses.   
While many of the previous studies are concerned with math test performance, 
only Wolfgang et al. (2003) addresses the matter of future course selection. They found 
that the pre-school students who performed better on LEGO construction skills tended to 
enroll in more advanced math courses in high school than the lower performing students. 
However, as previously mentioned, the Wolfgang et al. (2003) study used very few 
subjects and used non-robotics LEGO. 
 75 
Since the robotics class does not focus on explicitly teaching math and physics 
skills, the pathway to affecting performance and enrollment is likely to be through the 
affective domain by increasing student motivation and interest in those subjects. In the 
video recorded sessions, there was little evidence that students use many of the 
mathematics concepts in the standard high school curriculum or perform any calculations 
in the capstone project beyond measurement. However, there are ample amounts of 
physics concepts being discussed between the students in the groups and with the 
instructors. The topics discussed ranged from Physics 1 subjects (e.g. projectile motion) 
to Physics 2 ideas (e.g. torque) and some that are outside the scope of the ordinary 
curriculum (e.g. material strength and gearing). Based on the proportion of physics talk to 
math talk, it would be reasonable to expect that the effect would be a greater on students’ 
interest in physics than in math. It is not obvious whether a greater emphasis on 
computation would increase interest in either subject. 
Physics 1 was a very popular class and was enrolled in by the majority of both 
robotics and comparison group students. Thus, it is not surprising that robotics was not a 
good predictor. In fact, the only significant predictor at the p<0.05 level is 8th grade math 
test score percentile. Both overrepresented and underrepresented race/ethnic groups 
enrolled in the class and the interaction between race/ethnicity and robotics was not 
significant either.  
As previously mentioned, a major confounding factor in this calculation is that all 
of the students in our final dataset were subject to the “4x4” requirement, which likely 
increased levels of enrollment in science electives, including Physics 1. It is probable that 
this effect is obscuring whether Physics 1 enrollment was impacted by robotics. While it 
is easy to search the records of pre-4x4 years to estimate the increase in Physics 1 
students due to the requirement, without knowing which of the students were in robotics, 
 76 
I would not still not be able to answer whether robotics has an effect on enrollment in the 
class. 
While Physics 1 enrollment is interesting, the results of the Calculus and Physics 
2 enrollment analyses are more important for several reasons. First, Wolfgang et al. 
(2003) found more significant differences as the subjects grew older. Also, while Sadler 
et al. (2014) found an association between enrollment in high school physics and interest 
in a STEM career, the effect is stronger for students who enroll in Physics 2 than students 
who just take Physics 1. Finally, both Calculus and Physics 2 are beyond what is required 
by the state high school graduation plan. Unlike Physics 1, there should be little impact 
due to the 4x4 requirement. 
The results for Calculus and Physics 2 are quite similar. This is not surprising 
since many of the Physics 2 classes require calculus, and the Physics 2 students in the 
final dataset usually enrolled in a calculus class in the same year. In both cases, robotics 
starts as a significant predictor in the first model, but as more predictors are added, the 
significance fades. Ultimately, the only significant predictor is 9th grade advanced math 
class. However, while the p-value of robotics erodes, it is never far from the threshold 
limit. In Model 4 of the Calculus analysis, which is the most complex model which uses 
only main effects, the p-value is still 0.084. In Physics 2, robotics stays significant 
through Model 3, and only rises to 0.063 in Model 4. With the increased power of a 
larger dataset, it is quite possible for robotics to stay significant predictor.  
The earlier observation that there was greater amount of physics talk in the 
classroom than math talk, led to the prediction that there would be a greater impact of 
robotics on physics enrollment than on math enrollment. While robotics was not 
significant for either subject, it is consistent with that expectation that Physics 2 is closer 
to significance than Calculus.  
 77 
Based on the analysis of the results from the final dataset, the answer to the 
research question of whether there is a relationship between robotics enrollment in 
subsequent STEM classes is that there is no significant effect at the p<0.05 level, and I 
fail to reject the null hypothesis. However, repeating the analysis with a larger dataset 
with more statistical power may yield positive results.  
RESEARCH QUESTION 3: MATH AND SCIENCE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES  
Emergent themes 
Theme #1: Math and science concepts were invoked/applied more often during 
problem solving than design. 
It is not surprising that students talk about math and science concepts more often 
when discussing problems and fixes than when doing their design. Other studies have 
also seen this phenomenon (Berland & Busch, 2012). The larger question is why this 
occurs.  
There are three possible explanations. First. it is possible that this is a “false” 
effect due to measurement issues. Since not every class meeting was recorded, it is 
possible that the design discussions which were not captured had heavy amounts of math 
and science talk instead of the amount that was observed on the videos. Similarly, the 
other students in the class may have been heavily discussing math and science and the 
chosen student groups that were recorded were not representative. The inability to review 
all of the discussions and interactions of every student in the class is a limitation of the 
study.  
Another theory is that students could be thinking about math and science concepts 
while designing, but are not openly discussing it with their teammates as frequently as 
they do when they encounter problems and try to fix them. Because the recordings only 
 78 
capture the spontaneous interactions between the students and between the students and 
teachers in the classroom, silent thinking would not have been evident. Had the students 
been asked to do a “think aloud” or prompted them to talk about their design approach, 
there might have been more recorded incidents of math and science usage. Comparing 
groups of novice design students in high school, and expert professional designers, 
Crismond (2001) observed that while the experts often made spontaneous connections 
between their design and the underlying science and math concepts, the novices rarely 
did so. This suggests that the robotics students, like the novices, are likely not making 
many math and science connections and that “silent math/science thinking” is probably 
not the cause of the difference. 
The final hypothesis is that problem identification and fixing are more conducive 
environments to use math and science than design. This could be due to the nature of 
engineering design versus science. Whereas design is typically concerned with creating 
multiple solutions and evaluating the trade-offs between them, science tries to find one 
cohesive theory to explain the observed event (Committee on Integrated STEM 
Education, 2014). When an unexpected problem occurs in a project, the first task is to 
examine the error to discover an explanation of why it is happening.  Since a goal of 
science is to explain natural phenomena by developing theories to explain all known 
evidence (Berland & Busch, 2012), this problem solving situation is more consistent with 
the processes of science than the processes of the design phase of a project. Crismond's 
(2001) work may also support this theory. Since experts are good at noticing math and 
science connections, they may be able to identify potential problems earlier in the project 
and avoid errors before they occur. Novices are not able to foresee possible difficulties, 
and so they only realize that there is an error after construction when it manifests as a 
 79 
problem to fix. It may be that both novices and experts could have similar discussions 
about math and science, but experts discuss them earlier in the design cycle.  
Theme #2: Most of the mathematics content in the videos can be placed into two 
categories: geometry and measurement.  
Nearly all of the mathematics used in the robotics class fell under the categories 
of geometry or measurement. Having a limited range of math is a common occurrence in 
pre-college engineering. Prevost, Nathan, Stein, Tran, and Phelps (2009) noticed the 
same pattern while investigating the Introduction to Engineering Design course from the 
PLTW curriculum. While surveying a range of K-12 engineering courses, Welty, Katehi, 
Pearson, and Feder (2008) found that nearly all the math used by students was related to 
measurement, and gathering, organizing, and presenting data, and that there was very 
little consideration of using formulas to solve for unknowns.  
This pattern can be thought of as a downstream result of two other pedagogical 
decisions. In design classes, students best learned the material that had immediate use to 
them (Edelson, 2001). Similarly, Berland and Steingut (2016) found that students made a 
greater effort to learn math and science if they expected that the material would help 
them complete their engineering project. Indeed, as a general instructional design 
principle for STEM-design classes, Berland (2013) advised that all science and math 
introduced to the class should be immediately applicable to the student design project. 
While the beginning PLTW classes used little math, one of the later courses focused on 
digital logic. Once that class started, students were introduced to binary number systems 
and Boolean logic (Prevost, Nathan, Atwood, & Phelps, 2011). However, creating a 
“good enough” classroom environment where students do few calculations makes it 
difficult to incorporate many fields of math authentically.  Algebra, trigonometry, and 
calculus all make heavy use of equation solving. It seems that including more high school 
 80 
math content into engineering courses requires a classroom environment that demands 
precision calculations.  
At the same time, a high percentage of the math and science topics discussed, 
such as 3D shape extrusion and gearing, were beyond the scope of the school curriculum. 
This highlights the mismatch between the math and physics curriculum sequences and the 
needs of engineering. As long as there is no focus on computation, robotics does not need 
algebra or trigonometry. However, adding more geometry, particularly related to 3D 
solids, rotations, translation, and extrusion, would deepen the connection to drafting and 
the CAD tools. While many different physics (mainly mechanics) topics were discussed 
by the students, the topics did not adhere to the high school sequence. Some of the topics 
are covered in the regular physics class (e.g. projectile motion) and AP Physics (e.g. 
torque). But other areas, such as gearing, come from outside the high school curricula. 
Unfortunately, as it stands, the science and math used by the robotics course is out of 
alignment with the standard math and science curriculum. 
Theme #3: “Good enough” vs. precision in design. 
Regardless of the actual goals and philosophy of a classroom, when working with 
real physical materials, a certain amount of “good enough” is necessary. Where 
abstracted math and physics problems specify frictionless surfaces, perfectly elastic 
collisions, and exact sizes, realized projects must tolerate non-negligible lower order 
effects, assumption violations, and inexact parts. 
Having a “good enough” attitude in the classroom is not necessarily a problem, 
but can be viewed as a difference in values between science and engineering. Schauble, 
Klopfer and Raghavan (1991) claim that the goal of science is to understand the relations 
among causes and effects, and when running experiments, all feasible combinations of 
 81 
input variables are systematically tested. Meanwhile, the goal of engineering is to make a 
desired outcome occur, and variables are tested only until the desired outcome is 
achieved. Similarly, Berland and Busch (2012) posit that in science, the goal is to create 
theories that explain observed phenomenon, but in engineering, the priority is creating 
working practical solutions. For engineers, accurate and complete explanations are not as 
important as fulfilling requirements, obeying constraints, and avoiding failure (Berland & 
Busch, 2012). Furthermore, in their observation of student groups working on an 
engineering project, Berland and Busch (2012) found that the students ignored the 
science goals and only paid attention to the engineering goals. Instead of engaging in 
deep learning about the science, students used a minimum amount of science needed to 
complete their design.  
One clue why this attitude is both pervasive and accepted in the engineering 
classroom is be exhibited when the teaching assistant says, “It’s just a drawing. It doesn’t 
have to be mechanically right. And since you’re on a deadline, that might be it.” In the 
videos, there are multiple instances of the teacher reminding the students that there are 
pressing deadlines, and that they need to have a finished robot by the due date. The 
students may have had difficulty managing their time, possibly due to inexperience with 
the design process or due to procrastination, or because the instructor did not allow an 
adequate amount of time for each phase of the project. In any case, it is clear that both 
teams were under a pressing time constraint to deliver a working robot. In his work on 
adaptive expertise, Hatano specifies that one of the criteria necessary to develop a deep 
understanding is a lack of “urgent external needs” so sufficient amount of time and effort 
can be spent on comprehension (Hatano, Ericsson, & Hoffman, 2002). In reviewing the 
research, the National Research Council has found that to increase student interest, it is 
important to not only provide enough time for students to complete their tasks, but also 
 82 
allow them time to initiate and work on some self-directed tasks too. Furthermore, 
students need to feel competent at what they are working on (Committee on Integrated 
STEM Education, 2014). If time is short and students are only rewarded for a working 
project, it is rational for them to prioritize advancing the project forward by investing 
only the minimum amount of time on exploration and understanding. While they may 
complete the assignment, they may not feel accomplished. This could be seen as a 
symptom that the teacher and students have different priorities; the teacher wants to 
students to learn the material and develop interest in it, while for the students, it may be 
more important to get a high grade.  It is possible that the amount of time allocated to 
complete a project is inadequate for the students to learn the science deeply and explore 
the underlying concepts.  
Fittingly, even if the student who was having difficulty mating the two parts in 
Solidworks were able to complete the action, it still would not have been “mechanically 
right”. The TA is correct when he states that it is just a drawing. Solidworks does not 
model the physics of the mechanical parts acting upon each other. It is not kinematically 
driven, but rather it merely plays an animation of the pieces moving. “Good enough” 
applies to the software too. 
Improving the math/science content 
Berland and McKenna (2012) divide challenge-based engineering classes into 
three categories. Problem classes concentrate on providing large complex problems 
which students solve by applying the STEM content in the lessons. Of the three 
categories, problem classes tend to be the most math/science focused (Valtorta & 
Berland, 2015). On the other hand, design-based classes emphasize engineering practices 
and habits of mind by trying to provide students a chance to engage in work of the sort 
 83 
done by design engineers. While math and science concepts may be used, it is not the 
primary goal of the course and the connections between the design and math/science may 
not be made explicit. Often, the design challenges can be accomplished without a 
thorough understanding of the underlying math/science principles. The last type, labeled 
STEM-design classes, attempts to better integrate math and science into the engineering 
design environment. Design projects are formulated so that they cannot be successfully 
completed without understanding and applying the intended math/science content. 
Berland and McKenna (2012) note that with few exceptions, STEM-design is typically 
found not in standalone classes, but implemented as projects within science classrooms.  
By this classification system, the robotics class that was studied in this work is an 
example of a design-based course. Its primary purpose was to introduce students to 
engineering, not to advance math and science knowledge and skills. However, with some 
modifications, it could convey much more math/science content and be closer to a 
STEM-design class.  
To adapt the robotics class for math/science learning, there are two frameworks 
that are useful. First, the class can be examined at the scale of daily activities and 
individual interactions. Explicit integration is defined as any time an instructor or the 
curriculum material specifically point out a math/science principle, law, or formula and 
how it is used to understand an engineering concept or to perform an engineering task. In 
contrast, implicitly embedded concepts or skills occur when the math/science is part of a 
tool, representation, or procedure used for engineering, but is not specifically pointed out 
by the instructor or curriculum material. One example is a CAD program which is used to 
create a mathematical model of a physical object. If the teacher points out that the 
software uses a combination of linear algebra and trigonometry to display rotations and 
translations of the object on the screen, the math integration is explicit.  If the instructor 
 84 
does not specifically alert the students to the underlying mathematics used by the CAD 
program, then the math content is implicitly embedded  
Prevost et al. (2009) assert that students learn math/science better in engineering 
classes if the connections between the math/science content and the engineering are made 
explicit. While expert designers often make spontaneous connections to math and science 
concepts while novice designers rarely do. Making connections across disciplines can be 
particularly difficult for students, since the ideas and tactics that students have developed 
to make connections within each field may no longer apply (Committee on Integrated 
STEM Education, 2014). However, through scaffolding, novices could be helped to make 
the necessary leaps (Crismond, 2001). 
To illustrate how existing material can be improved, Prevost et al. (2009) took 
samples of curriculum materials and added episodes of explicit integration. Similarly, in 
this section, I will do two things. First, I will create some curriculum materials that 
explicitly connect aspects of the design project to the underlying physics and math. 
Second, I will examine several teacher-student interactions from the robotics class and 
suggest ways the teacher could have increased the explicit integration of math and 
science into the engineering discussion.  
In their review of K-12 engineering programs, Welty et al. (2008) noted that few 
programs had students engaged in modeling. Of the models that were created, they 
tended to be just graphical or physical representation of student design ideas. What would 
be more useful, they said, would be mathematical models which the students could use as 
a data source to make inferences about their design ideas. In addition to the modeling 
problem, when students tried to improve their designs, they typically just brainstormed 
ideas without first performing an analysis of their work. Having appropriate models can 
 85 
aid students in analysis and make iterative improvements more informed and with less 
trial and error. 
Here, the robotics project can be improved by introducing mathematical models 
of common problems encountered by student teams. Figures 5.1 and 5.2 are physics 
problems based on the rail robot and stat robot projects. As previously discussed, students 
are more likely to learn and expend more effort in learning if the content is directly 
relevant to helping them complete their project (Berland & Busch, 2012; Berland & 
Steingut, 2016). Thus, each of these problems comprises a physics-based design problem 
that the team needs to solve to ensure robot functionality. For the Rail robot, the problem 
involves making a counterweight to balance out the torque generated by the robot arm. 
For the Stat robot, the problem involves calculating the launch angle to throw the ball in 
order to hit the target. For each, the physics concepts are sufficiently self-contained that 
even students who have not had physics can be helped to complete the assignment. The 
result of the problem will provide a starting point for students to use in their design.  
 
 
Your ball launcher throws the ball in a parabolic arc and it follows a simple law of 
projectile motion: 
     Distance = v
2 sin(2ϑ )
g
 
where v is the initial velocity of the ball and θ is the launch angle 
 
Now that you have a working ball launcher, use the above equation to calculate:  
 1. The initial velocity of the ball 
 2. The theoretic maximum distance that your launcher can throw a ball 
 3. The launch angle you would need to hit a target 2 meters away 
 
In addition, draw a force diagram of the ball at the moment of launch, and a force 
diagram of the ball in midflight. 
 
Figure 5.1: Physics problem for Stat robot teams
 86 
 
Your rail robot design probably looks something like the diagram below, with the 
main robot perched on top of the rail and an arm/claw assembly extending out from it.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unfortunately, this design suffers from one major problem. The weight and position 
of arm and claw unbalances your robot and creates a torque (a rotational force). What do 
you think will happen to your robot because of this balance problem? 
A simple fix is to attach a boom and counterweight on the other side to balance out 
the torque from the arm and claw.

To make the following questions easier, you can make the following simplifying 
assumptions: 
a. the origin for your coordinate system is the center of the rail 
b. the weight of the boom is negligible  
c. the entire weight of the arm is located at the midpoint of the arm 
d. the entire weight of the claw is located at the midpoint of the claw 
 
1. Draw a force diagram for your robot, labeling the torque from the arm, the 
claw, and the counterweight.  
 
 
2. To make this first calculation simpler, assume that you will be able to 
make the counterweight 100% of the weight of your arm and claw assembly. 
Calculate the length of the boom that you will need to balance your robot on 
the rail. Use the weight and dimensions of the assembly that you built. The 
formula to calculate the torque due to an object is:  
   Torque = rFsinθ 
 
  where F is force, r is (in this case) the distance from the origin to the 
center of the object,  
  θ is the angle between F and r, and torque is the rotatonal force from the 
object. 
 
3. Suppose that your robot is too heavy and you need to lighten the load. 
Suppose your counterweight can only be 25% of the weight of your arm and 
claw assembly. How can you generate the same amount of torque using the 
lighter counterweight? Use the equation to get a specific answer. 
 
Figure 5.2 (continued) 
 
In addition to curricular materials, the connection between the design projects and 
physics and math content can be emphasized and made explicit when the teacher talks to 
the student teams. Here, I will provide several excerpts of teachable moments from the 
video transcripts and suggest ways the teacher could have made more explicit 
connections.  
 88 
In the first example, the teacher was describing a problem encountered by another 
team involving an unbalanced robot falling off the rail. 
 
Teacher: Um, I do know a group, yesterday, was kind of messing around with that 
and their's was too wide and the thing was just moving around all over the place.  
R: So they were like this high?  
Teacher: Yeah. It was actually kind of like this. [holds wheels through roof 
cutouts perched high on the rail] And so it was twisting off the rail and it was kind 
of going like this. [wheels twisting off rail] But if is further out, it is going to hold 
on better. [holds wheels wider on rail].  
 
The teacher described the problem as “twisting off the rail” and immediately 
offered a possible solution, widening the wheelbase on the robot to add stability. 
However, he never described the reason for the twisting problem or why his proposed 
solution should work. Instead, the teacher could have asked the student to draw a cross-
section diagram of the robot perched on the rail and overlay it with a force diagram. This 
would have led to a discussion about the center of mass of the robot, why it needs to be 
roughly on top of the centerline of the rail, and what would happen if it is not. Then, the 
conversation could be steered towards how to improve the stability of the robot and 
whether it would be better to have a narrower or wider wheelbase.  
Then, the teacher could introduce the concept of torque, and how it is calculated. 
To emphasize the point that torque increases with distance from the center, he can ask the 
students how the forces change when the robot arm is extended to pick up a ball. This 
would spur the design question of how to compensate for the torque from the arm. If the 
team is stuck on ideas, the teacher can direct them by saying that the rail robot is 
essentially a building crane and asking them to find pictures of other cranes and see if 
 89 
they can figure out how they handle the issue. Along with this discussion, the teacher 
could give the team members the modeling problem in Figure 5.2 to provide them the 
chance to perform the calculation. 
 
In the next example, P is having difficulty making the metal claw on the rail robot 
grab and hold on to a ball without it sliding away.   
 
P: See, it's going to slip. [grabbing ball with claw] It has to be really tight .. and 
then it's just going to roll… it kept slipping. I'm trying to find something  
TA: Some grip tape. Have you seen it? 
P: No, I haven't seen it.  
TA: Put tape on one side  
P: Really? That would be so nice.  
 
While P understands that pressure can reduce the ball from slipping out of the 
claw, she does not understand what other factors she can also use to craft a solution. 
Instead of offering a quick fix for the problem, the teaching assistant could have asked 
her to use the Internet to look up the formula for friction. From the formula, he could 
have pointed out the meaning of the variables and asked what factors she could adjust to 
increase the friction of the claw on the ball, which would lead her to look at the 
coefficient of friction. From there, they could have discussed what it means to have a 
high coefficient of friction and look up what common materials have high coefficients. 
Eventually, P could figure out that she could put rubber bands or some other ‘grippier’ 
material on the claw to solve her problem.  
 
 90 
N: Also, some people are saying that maybe the Lexan would be enough power to 
support our whole robot cause all the weight that's going to be on the robot and all 
the motors and all the balls that are going to be in there and like if we make our 
funnel or basket or whatever we are making out of metal then that's going to 
weigh more. We don't know.  
R: I don't think we'd make the basket out of metal. That's doesn't sound ... 
N: I just want to make sure. Would Lexan be strong enough? 
Teacher: I think so. We can .... If let's say, it wasn't or we get concerned ... we can 
do something like… angle supports to it or whatever that will hold up to it.  
 
Here, when N says, “would be enough power”, the context strongly suggests that 
the intended meaning is “have enough strength”. Since the amount of weight that a sheet 
of Lexan can support is a complex problem that depends on many factors, including the 
thickness of the Lexan, the distribution of the weight, and the structural supports holding 
the Lexan, the students would not be able to perform a simple calculation to answer their 
question. In this case, the teacher could have helped the students explore the question and 
their options.  
The students seem to have a fuzzy idea about the weights in the problem. First, he 
could have asked the students to estimate the weight of the robot with a metal 
funnel/basket and compare that to the weight of the robot with a non-metal funnel/basket. 
Since the robot is not completely built, they can use the parts that they intend to use to 
calculate a number. While the computation of the weight of parts is not in itself a 
complex mathematical task, it quantifies the problem and allows the students to calculate 
the proportional change in weight between metal and non-metal parts. If the robot is 
much heavier than the funnel/basket, the proportional change may be smaller than 
expected, which could cause the students to decide that the metal/non-metal problem is 
 91 
not as important as they had thought. If the proportional change is larger than expected, it 
could steer their design in a different direction.  
In addition, the teacher could have brought up another potential issue. Depending 
on the placement of the funnel/basket and its weight, the funnel/basket could create a 
torque that may require the team to recalculate and adjust the counterweight. This could 
lead to a discussion about how to design the funnel/basket to help balance the forces on 
the robot and shift the center of mass. 
The common thread through these three cases has been that the teacher and 
teaching assistant have been quick to offer workable engineering solutions. To increase 
the science and math learning, the teacher could have guided the students to analyze the 
problem and introduced concepts and vocabulary (e.g. torque) to help them design more 
robust solutions.  
At a larger scale, the class can be analyzed at the lesson and course level. Based 
on the available literature, Berland (2013) provides 6 instructional design principles for 
creating STEM-design classes with well integrated content. Figure 5.3 shows the 6 
principles. The last principle requires detailed knowledge of the limitations of the school 
and school district. Redesigning the entire course and situating it within the needs of the 
school community, is beyond the scope of this work, However, I argue that this 
framework is still useful to review the qualities of the capstone project.  
Expanding on the first principle, Berland adds the four criteria in Figure 5.4. The 
first criterion calls for an open-ended project that permits multiple possible 
implementations. While there are several constraints and requirements of the capstone 
project (in Appendix A), implementation details are still left to the teams. The two teams 
in the videos made numerous design decisions over the course of their project and 
different teams had different solutions to the problems. In the transcription of the Stat 
 92 
team’s final presentation presented and coded at the end of Chapter 3, the team members 
discuss some of the design decisions that they made to arrive at their solution.  
 
 
1. Contextualize all student work within STEM-design challenges. 
2. Specify specific course and unit learning goals. 
3. Employ a standardized engineering design process as an instructional framework. 
4. Engage students in sensible forms of engineering practices from day one. 
5. Ensure that all science and math concepts, and technology tools employed are 
necessary for students’ successful completion of the STEM-design projects. 
6. Attend to the constraints of the high school and school district systems. 
 
Figure 5.3: Six principles of STEM-design (Berland, 2013) 
 
The second criterion speaks to the scope of the course and its ability to survey the 
breadth of engineering. While exposing students to multiple engineering disciplines is 
useful, it may be best done at the course level instead of within a single project. 
The National Research Council has also noted that using “real world” problems is 
a strategy to increase student interest  (Committee on Integrated STEM Education, 2014). 
However, as written, the rail and stationary robots do not address any societal needs. This 
is perhaps the most obvious failure of the capstone project with respect to this 
framework. The project problem is entirely artificial and has no purpose or relevance 
outside of the classroom. While none of the videos showed that the ad hoc nature of the 
 93 
project was demotivating, it is unknown whether a more socially conscious challenge 
would have yielded better results.  
 
1. The challenge must have multiple plausible solutions so as to create opportunities 
for students to solve the problems creatively rather than to execute their teacher’s 
plan.  
2. The challenge will require students to consider the problem from multiple 
engineering disciplines and, throughout the course, different challenges will 
emphasize different disciplines. This will ensure that students experience the 
interdisciplinary nature of engineering and will introduce students to a range of 
possible foci for their professional trajectory.  
3. The challenge must address a societal need as this has been shown to attract 
individuals from populations that are typically underrepresented in engineering.  
4. The challenge will directly draw upon math and or science concepts such that 
students have an opportunity to apply domain specific knowledge to their 
engineering design work.  
Figure 5.4: Criteria for contextualizing student work (Berland, 2013) 
 
In regard to the 4th criterion, using the physics problems which I added in the 
previous section, student teams would be able to use the results of their newly acquired 
knowledge to drive design decisions. Rail teams will be able to create a counterweight 
and Stat robot students will be able to predict how to angle their shooter to target the 
goals. 
 
 94 
The intent of the second instructional design principle is to specify learning goals 
so that the goals can be used to drive the creation of the projects. Unfortunately, it is 
unknown whether there were specific written learning goals used to create either the 
capstone project or the course. In its absence, I have created a sample list of learning

The purpose of employing an engineering design process (EDP) is to introduce a 
structure to guide students. Having it as a stable base for every project enables students to 
focus on the specifics of the assignment with clear, consistent expectations (Berland, 
2013). Unfortunately, the robotics class did not teach a standardized engineering design 
process as part of the curriculum.  
By “sensible” engineering practices, Berland (2013) notes that at times, attempts 
to follow a particular process can become empty of meaning if it is not directly useful to 
the students. It is not desirable for students to follow the instructions solely to satisfy the 
assignment without understanding the purpose of the task. This principle is a parsimony 
rule, to omit steps that are not useful. In the videos, all of the tasks the students performed 
advanced the design and implementation of the project and there were no complaints of 
performing “busy work”. However, it may have been more useful to the teams if instead 
of simply using their CAD drawings as a diagram for their construction plans, to use 
them in a design review with the teacher or present them to the class.  
The fifth principle can be thought of in two ways. First, did the instructor attempt 
to teach math or science concepts that were not used to design and implement the 
engineering project? Since the class was intended as an engineering class, and not as a 
vehicle to teach science and math concepts, there was no extraneous math/science content 
taught in the course of the capstone project. For this evaluation of the project, a more 
applicable interpretation of the principle is whether teaching more math/science would 
have made the student design projects more successful. In other words, what is the 
optimum amount of math/science to teach for this set of capstone projects?  As I showed 
earlier, each of the two project problems would have been good entry points to introduce 
various physics concepts: torque and friction for the rail robot, and projectile motion for 
the stationary robot. Since students in the class span grade levels from freshmen to 
 96 
seniors, they will have different amounts of math and science in their backgrounds. Some 
students will have studied geometry and physics, while others will have not. Thus, it is 
not possible to precisely target the content for each student’s knowledge level. However, 
using the concepts and materials I created may allow the students to better understand 
some important design decisions they will need to make. While some design ideas may 
require additional math and science knowledge to implement, the concepts in the 
materials cover key content needed for the project. 
Berland's (2013) instructional design principles were written as a guide the 
creation of new STEM-design courses, but I have repurposed them to analyze an existing 
project. With the exception of social consciousness, using a formal design process, and 
possibly written learning goals, the robotics capstone project with the proposed content 
additions generally follows her ideas about good STEM-design principles. Unfortunately, 
without details about the rest of the curriculum, I cannot speak to whether the entire 
course also follows these design ideals. 
Comparing practicing engineers to robotics students 
A number of researchers have investigated how practicing engineers use math and 
science in the workplace, and found that the relationship is complex and somewhat 
contradictory. Kent and Noss (2002) interviewed civil and structural engineers at a large 
firm in the UK, while Gainsburg (2006, 2007) shadowed both junior and senior engineers 
at two structural engineering firms in the US as they worked through multiple projects. 
Given that the primary job of structural engineers is to analyze the sturdiness of building 
plans and guarantee their safety across a wide range of conditions, Kent and Noss (2002) 
expected large amounts of math and physics being used in rich varieties by the engineers 
daily, but to their surprise, there was very little calculation. ""Once you've left university 
 97 
you don't use the maths you learnt there, 'squared' or 'cubed' is the most complex thing 
you do."" (Kent & Noss, 2002, p. 1) Much of the difference is because while complex 
mathematical modeling of the physics of structures is still a core task of these firms, the 
actual modeling and calculation is no longer performed by the majority of engineers. 
Detailed modeling is assigned to either junior engineers fresh from college or to 
mathematical modeling specialists, or building codes are consulted for answers (Kent & 
Noss, 2002). 
 
There is a whole lot of maths in what we do that we don't need to think about 
really, because other people have done it for us ... certainly been set up so that we 
can avoid doing the complicated maths 95% of the time. (Kent & Noss, 2002, p. 
1) 
 
Meanwhile, Gainsburg (2007) found that solving equations is actually one of the 
easiest engineering tasks, as analysis software can automatically perform all the 
calculations in minutes, or answers can be looked up in building codebooks. With the 
difficult math offloaded, the remaining math that the engineers performed was relatively 
simple. The bulk of the math that she witnessed represented concepts taught at the 9th 
grade level and below. Even these calculations typically were not performed by hand, but 
entered and executed by a spreadsheet.  
While the previous studies were conducted with civil and structural engineers, 
anecdotal evidence suggests that engineers in other disciplines also encounter very little 
advanced math or calculation in their everyday practice (Pearson, 1991). 
One factor that complicates engineers' use of math/science is the constraints that 
the design is subject to. While Gainsburg (2007) notes that constraints make engineering 
possible, by steering the design in particular directions, limitations in cost, safety 
 98 
regulations, and the materials available help dictate what designs are possible, what kinds 
of analyses need to be performed, and which analyses are not worthwhile. In particular, 
she singles out for particular influence, and situations in which the engineers decide to 
accept the results of rough analyses because they could not afford the time to run more 
accurate calculations. ""But in buildings you approximate hugely because you have to get 
it done in a day, and there's nothing wrong with that, part of the art of structural design is 
learning how to approximate."" (Kent & Noss, 2002, p. 2) 
The general relationship that the observed engineers have towards mathematics 
(and the science that it models) has been described as ""skeptical reverence"", a balance 
between accepting the usefulness and necessity of mathematics, and understanding its 
limitations (Gainsburg, 2007, 2012). Having detailed mathematical models and analysis 
software is a requirement for structural engineering. Designs must be justified through 
mathematics. However, engineers need to understand potential problems with the 
software and analysis methods. One engineer actually cautioned against over-reliance on 
mathematical methods because it could obscure one’s understanding of the behavior of 
structures. Models may use extremely idealized conditions, such as assuming that some 
materials are perfectly rigid or infinitely flexible, in order to encompass the widest range 
of possibilities, and Gainsburg’s engineers recognized that neither pole represented 
realistic results and worked to create a better model. One engineer noted that the analysis 
software his firm was using causes spurious results when the elements are too small, and 
therefore it was important to review the modeling results for answers that looked unusual 
(Kent & Noss, 2002). Having too little or too much deference to the math and physics can 
compromise the project's safety or its budget (Gainsburg, 2012). 
Furthermore, while computer-based mathematical modeling makes the analyses 
possible, it does not necessarily generate ideas. Design must precede analysis. Thus, math 
 99 
and science, while necessary, are not sufficient. The typical project starts with a design 
produced not by analysis, but by an architect. Then the engineers run appropriate 
analyses, propose solutions, and then rerun the analyses. The nature of the work is 
iteration that continues until an acceptable solution is found that satisfies the constraints, 
including safety and cost (Gainsburg, 2007). 
One of Gainsburg’s interviewees has a particular relationship with the 
technological tools.  While he states that he is in favor of using more mathematical 
analysis in the work, he also admits, ""I use all the classical methods to figure out what the 
answer ought to be, and then I use that to figure out exactly how I'm going to arrange my 
model."" (Gainsburg, 2007, p. 499).  Here, mathematical modeling is a post hoc 
justification of the decisions he has already deemed acceptable through more traditional 
non-computer-based analyses. 
Through the research, it is clear that some math and science related skills are used 
more than others, particularly since all calculations are handled by computers. Though 
repeatedly, through their interviews, the engineers speak of the need to understand 
geometry, (Kent & Noss, 2002). 
 
Geometry is enormously important. For example, its relation to structural 
behavior: the bending moment in a beam being a significant shape --- it's a 
parabola, and not just any old parabola, but one that represents the structural 
behaviour. ... Or, in a complex three-dimensional tent, there's the equilibrium of 
forces in three dimensions. (Kent & Noss, 2002, p. 4) 
 
However, the skill most valued by the engineers interviewed is what the subjects 
frequently call ""engineering judgement"". While other researchers have attempted to 
define it roughly as making design or analysis decisions based on past experience 
 100 
(Graham, Wescott, & Kluck, 2001), Gainsburg (2007) was able to code the situations in 
which it was used in her data. Of these, there were three categories that particularly 
applied to mathematics and science. 
First, judgement is used where complex problems need to be simplified in order to 
be analyzed. Indeed, with the complex math mainly performed by computers, 
simplification is arguably one of the most difficult remaining tasks performed by the 
engineers (Gainsburg, 2007). 
Secondly, not all calculations need to be calculated at the highest precision. Since 
the models may be based on assumptions and simplifications, the inaccuracies from the 
inputs limit the amount of precision that can be calculated. ""You can get lost in doing a 
too-detailed job for your method ... If you use a method you have a lot of confidence in, 
you can go to a lot of decimal places …"" (Gainsburg, 2007, p. 488) Other reasons may be 
less technical. In an example mentioned above from Kent and Noss (2002), the time 
pressure from deadlines required the engineers to decide whether a quicker, but less 
accurate approximation was sufficient for their purposes. 
Lastly, at times, calculations and estimates done by the engineers sometimes came 
into conflict with other sources. In these cases, a decision needed to be made on which set 
of numbers to use. In one instance, when considering the properties of a material, a senior 
engineer deferred to the specifications provided by a vendor.  In another, the engineer 
decided that the building code was not sufficiently safe and ordered extra reinforcement. 
Making these decisions requires knowledge of both one’s own estimate process and an 
idea of the process used to create the other estimate and weighing the two while taking 
into account the tolerance for error and the needs of the project.  
In a similar vein, it is not the ability to perform complex calculations on the 
geometry that is prized, but the engineer's ""qualitative"" understanding of structures.  
 101 
 
Qualitative understanding is based on sets of rules that are very clearly based on 
the mathematics of how forces and elements are interacting between each other. 
You have to draw the structural diagrams, and you're looking for clues, and some 
of those clues come from the maths you've done. (Kent & Noss, 2002, p. 5) 
 
Kent and Noss (2002) call it an intuition that is developed through experience and 
is sometimes used synonymously with ""structural feel"". Their description of it implies 
that it is a conceptual understanding of the physics that is honed to give approximate 
quantitative solutions. 
To recapitulate, I identified three main themes from analyzing the robotics class 
video recordings: 
1. Students are using math and science more in problem identification and fixing 
and less in design. 
2. Students are not calculating formulas. Most of the math used is either 
geometry or measurement. 
3. Students have a “good enough” attitude instead of calculating with precision. 
 
These traits, particularly the last two, make it difficult to cover many math and 
science topics in the classroom. But following the instructional design guidelines from 
the research (Berland, 2013; Prevost et al., 2009), I made some suggestions on how to 
increase the amount of discussion and calculation. In particular, I created physics 
problems that are relevant to their design projects. But enacting these changes may create 
a different conundrum, reduced “authenticity”. Practicing structural engineers seem to 
exhibit much of the same three traits as the robotics students.  
 102 
1. While math and physics are crucial for structural modeling and analysis, they 
do not help generate new ideas, and thus, are not always useful during the 
design phase. Instead, they are more beneficial for verifying whether a design 
idea is sound and to guide modifications. 
2. Due to computer technology and job specialization, engineers no longer need 
to manually compute formulas and can operate at a more conceptual level. 
Nowadays, having a qualitative understanding is more important than the 
ability to crunch numbers. Freed from performing calculations, the important 
math knowledge is geometry and measurement. 
3. Despite the ability of computers to perform detailed modeling, engineers 
frequently make judgement calls to perform analyses at a reduced level of 
precision. Time constraints and software bugs are some of the reasons that the 
decisions are necessary. The engineers are able to use the “good enough” 
results, even though they are potentially less accurate. 
 
The number of parallels between the students’ relationship to math and science 
and that of practicing engineers is an unexpected benefit of the robotics class. Should the 
robotics students continue on in engineering, they will already be well acquainted with 
some of the practices and attitudes towards math and science. Making changes to the 
robotics class to increase the math/science content will make it closer to being a STEM-
design class. However, it may also change the engineering environment and shift the 
relationship to be less similar to an actual workplace, overemphasizing the role of 
math/science in the day-to-day practice of engineering. Since the goals of K-12 
engineering education include exposing students to engineering practices and the design 
 103 
environment, there is a trade-off to be considered. Curricular gains need to be weighed 
against the cost of a less accurate portrayal of the profession. 
There are, however,  several caveats to this comparison. First, none of the studies 
involved, including my own, claim to have a representative sample of either all structural 
engineers or all robotics students. Secondly, all of the studies on practicing engineers are 
of structural engineers. Other types of engineers, such as electrical or chemical, may 
exhibit different traits. 
 104 
Chapter 6: Conclusion 
SUMMARY 
 The past two decades has seen a tremendous rise in the use of robotics in 
education. However, there has not been a corresponding rise in research on the effects of 
robotics on students, particularly persistent effects over multiple years. Much of the 
available literature lacks treatment consistency, often focuses on short-term measures of 
performance, and disagrees on results. 
This study focused on a high school that has created a full year academic class on 
robotics. From the school district, I obtained data on some of the students in the robotics 
class and a matched set of comparison students. The data included demographic 
information, 8th and 11th grade standardized math test scores, and STEM course 
enrollment. The students were matched on factors including race/ethnicity, and 8th grade 
standardized math test score. In addition, I obtained video recordings of robotics students 
working on their capstone project from the same period of time covered by the 
quantitative data.  
The first research question asked whether there was an association between taking 
a robotics class and later standardized math test scores. Using a series of models that 
added predictors, I found that there was no significant relationship between 9th and 10th 
grade robotics class and 11th grade standardized math test scores. The only significant 
predictors were 8th grade math score (measured as a percentile) and enrollment in an 
advanced math class in 9th grade. This result is consistent with the qualitative evidence. 
In the video recordings, students had few discussions of math topics, and the math they 
used had little overlap with the standard math curriculum. Furthermore, outside of 
 105 
measurement, there was no calculation of formulas, so students did not receive any 
practice in solving equations.  
While race and ethnicity did not prove to be significant in any of the models, the 
p-value of the interaction between race/ethnicity and robotics suggested that robotics 
classes could affect underrepresented minorities differently than White and Asian 
students. Though not conclusive with this study, it may warrant further examination with 
a larger sample. 
The second research question asked whether future enrollment in STEM courses 
could be associated with robotics class. Focusing on Physics 1, Physics 2, and Calculus, I 
found that while there was a significant relationship to 9th or 10th grade robotics class in 
the simple models, adding other predictors caused the relationship to robotics to fade out 
of the threshold of p<0.05. Ultimately, only 8th grade math scores were significant for 
Physics 1, and 9th grade advanced math class enrollment was significant for Calculus and 
Physics 2. However, although it did not cross the threshold for significance in the most 
complex models, for Calculus and Physics 2, robotics remained close to it, particularly 
for Physics 2. It is quite possible that with a larger dataset, robotics would be significant 
predictor. With the heavy amount of physics discussion evident in the video recordings 
compared to the uncommon math talk, the result that robotics is closer to significance 
with Physics 2 than Calculus was expected.  
The third research asked whether there were opportunities to teach math and 
science that were missed in the robotics class. To answer this question, I first needed to 
find out what and how the students were using math and science in the classroom. Using 
a grounded theory approach, I coded video recording of two student teams working on 
the robotics capstone project. After analyzing the results, three themes emerged. First, 
students used math and science more often when they encountered problems and needed 
 106 
to fix their design than they did performing the design work. Second, the students did not 
perform any calculations or solve any formulas in the course of their project. The math 
was limited to measurement and some geometry concepts. Last, in the classroom 
environment, there was a pervasive attitude of “good enough”. While practical matters 
can never be ignored, the concern is that there is too much focus on completing tasks and 
not enough on understanding the underlying science principles for an effect on 
math/science achievement to be expected.  
With these themes in mind, I found the terminology described in Berland and 
McKenna (2012) to be a useful framework in which to think about how to increase 
science and math learning in the robotics class. Following the instructional design 
guidelines from Berland (2013), I made suggestions and created sample materials to help 
convert the robotics class capstone project from an engineering project into a STEM-
design project, which increases science and math content with the goal of understanding 
the principles. 
While the robotics class project may have done a better job of conveying a deep 
comprehension of the underlying math and physics, I found that it was quite successful in 
a different way. Looking at studies of the attitudes and day-to-day tasks of practicing 
structural engineers, I found that the robotics students operated very similarly to the real 
engineers. The three themes emerging from the video analysis correspond to descriptions 
from interviews with engineering and observations of the workplace. While adding 
additional science and math learning to robotics is a clear benefit, it may come at the 
price of being a less authentic engineering environment. Ultimately, there is a value 
judgement that needs to be made on whether it is more important to use robotics as a 
vehicle to teach science and math or to teach engineering principles. 
 107 
LIMITATIONS 
The most serious limitation of this work is that it draws all of the data from one 
school. There have been only two instructors for the class, and the curriculum was 
designed by the main teacher. The results computed in this study are not readily 
generalizable to other contexts. Other schools using other curriculums could have 
different results.  
In addition, the school is in a relatively affluent neighborhood in the district. The 
graduation rate and mean standardized test scores are higher than the state average, and 
the percentage of English Language Learners and students who qualify for free and 
reduced school lunch is lower than average. As seen in Table 4.2, for the final dataset, the 
mean 8th grade standardized math test score is over the 66th percentile for the comparison 
group, and the 72nd percentile for the robotics students. Also, it has the resources to offer 
multiple math and science elective courses, such as Astronomy and Aquatic Science, 
unlike many smaller or lower performing high schools. 
As previously mentioned, due to inconsistencies and omissions in the dataset, the 
number of subjects was drastically reduced. This has severely limited the statistical 
power of the analyses and prevented me from further analysis of subgroups, such as the 
performance bands used by Lindh and Holgersson (2007). 
In addition, since the reductions disproportionately affected some groups, such as 
women and minorities. The final dataset may not fairly represent the actual demographics 
of the robotics classes. Due to small numbers, women were excluded from the final 
statistical analyses entirely. While I included underrepresented minorities as predictors in 
the statistical models, the sample sizes are not large enough for definitive conclusions. 
Whether robotics has a different effect on math achievement and STEM class enrollment 
among women and minorities is still an open question. 
 108 
One question that hangs over the entire set of analyses is the issue of interest. 
Popular models state that student performance on tests and enrollment in math and 
science classes are dependent on the student’s interest in the subject (Wigfield & Eccles, 
2000). Since this study uses historical data, no direct measure of students’ interest in 
STEM subjects prior to robotics class was available. However, because 8th grade math 
achievement on standardized tests correlate with 8th grade interest in math and science 
(Singh et al., 2002), I was able to use the test scores as an indirect measure for STEM 
interest prior to robotics class. However, it is possible that for this dataset, 8th grade math 
score is not a good predictor, and the effect of interest is not sufficiently controlled for in 
the analyses.  
As previously mentioned, the students in this study were all subject to the “4x4” 
rule, in which the recommended high school graduation plan increased the math and 
science requirements from 3 years each to 4 years and stipulated which subjects must be 
taken for three of the four years (Biology, Chemistry, Physics). Most likely, the rule 
spurred an increase in enrollment in math and science courses, such as Physics 1, 
compared to previous years, and may be masking some of the effect of the robotics class. 
However, it may be possible to estimate the magnitude of the 4x4 effect. The High 
School Longitudinal Survey of 2009 (HSLS:09) is a national survey of over 23,000 9th 
grade students with follow-up surveys in 2012, 2013, and 2016 (National Center for 
Education Statistics, 2009). Since the project collected high school transcripts, one could 
compare the number of calculus and physics courses taken by students in Texas (with the 
4x4) to students in other states who do not have a similar requirement. Furthermore, in 
the first follow-up survey, students were asked whether they were taking math and/or 
science courses and the reason they were enrolled in the class (National Center for 
Education Statistics, 2012). From this question, one can estimate how many students are 
 109 
only taking a math/science class because of graduation requirements. Geographic 
information is however, not included in the publically available version of the data, and 
must requested under restricted use (National Center for Education Statistics, n.d.).  
Unlike quantitative studies, which attempt to collect large volumes of data and 
avoid overly focusing on any one group, qualitative studies need to purposefully choose 
and focus on the subjects who are able to provide the most useful data (Creswell, 2015). 
For the qualitative section of this study, I chose to focus on one student group from each 
of the two projects (Rail and Stat). The Rail team, which consisted of students I, K, N, P 
and R, was chosen because they were the team with the most discussion between team 
members and the highest quality of discussion. This team had more group discussions 
and tended to talk through design problems, which better exposed their thinking 
processes than teams which partitioned problems between group members and had 
members work individually. While the majority of the robotics class was male, and 
almost 90% of the quantitative data is male students, four out of five members of the Rail 
team are female. Although all members of the Stat team are male, there is a higher 
percentage of women in the qualitative data than there are in the robotics class. While 
women are not in the quantitative data, they are overrepresented in the qualitative.  
It may not be coincidental that the most communicative team consisted of mostly 
girls. Interviewing teachers working with elementary school students in single sex 
robotics programs, Voyles, Fossum, and Haller (2008) noticed that the teams that were 
composed of girls tended to work more cooperatively. More often, teams of all boys 
needed to be reminded to share and cooperate with their teammates. The girls also asked 
questions and otherwise communicated with the teachers much more often than the boys 
did. If it is the case that it is more difficult to collect quality data from majority male 
 110 
teams, then it may be necessary, as I did in this study, to rely on majority girl teams and 
assume that boys are having a similar experience. 
Also, video recordings were only available for selected class periods. Considering 
that the robotics class met for an entire academic year, only a small number of the classes 
were captured. Less than 11 hours were recorded for Rail Team 1, and less than 9 hours 
for Stat Team 1. It is possible that the available hours were not representative of the 
actual behavior of the students. 
FUTURE RESEARCH 
While this study adds to the literature on educational robotics, there are many 
possible directions for future work in the field. Certainly, studies of other schools using 
other robotics curriculums would increase the generalizability of the conclusions from 
this work. Studying schools with different demographic characteristics, particularly with 
more minority, English Language Learner, and low SES students, can expand our 
understanding of the benefits of robotics. 
The relatively low number of samples hampered many of the statistical results. In 
several of the analyses, predictors were not quite significant. A larger set of student data 
would provide more statistical power to provide more clarity to some of the results. In 
addition, it could enable the analysis on the demographic factors that were eliminated 
(gender, economic disadvantage, special education, English Language Learner), 
recombined (race/ethnicity).  It could also permit analysis by performance band as used 
by Hussain, Lindh, and Shukur (2006). 
Instead of using historical and already collected data, a forward-looking version 
of this study can solve one of the main limitations by surveying students at the start of a 
robotics class (and a comparison group) about their interest level in STEM subjects. As 
 111 
the years go by, students can be resurveyed to find if their interest remains consistent and 
whether robotics influenced their course choices and other educational decisions.  
This work is centered on a high school robotics class. However, robotics has been 
used with students from elementary school through undergraduates. There are interesting 
questions to be asked with both younger and with older students. 
I posited that robotics may influence enrollment in STEM classes through the 
affective domain by increasing student motivation and interest. While the analysis 
showed that robotics was not a significant predictor, the p-value was close enough to the 
significance limit that it is possible that repeating the study using a larger dataset could 
push robotics over the threshold. Instead, the main predictor of both Calculus and Physics 
2 enrollment was whether the student was in an advanced math class in the 9th grade. 
Köller et al. (2001) theorized that interest in math does not become a factor in math 
performance until the student is able to act on their interest by enrolling in more 
challenging or elective math courses. Since Texas allows students to opt into advanced 
math in middle school, student interest in math may be a factor earlier. Perhaps 
introducing robotics in elementary or middle school could increase student interest and 
provide the motivation to take the advanced 9th grade math course, thus increasing 
students’ opportunities to enroll in Calculus and Physics 2 later in high school. 
One of the findings is that robotics students performed few calculations. A 
possible reason for this is that the students may not have taken physics yet, or are not yet 
comfortable enough with the material to use it in the robotics context. It would be 
interesting to see if more experienced students, such as engineering undergraduates, use 
more calculations or whether they stay at a conceptual level. If they use more 
computation, it could be a sign that robotics curriculum is more useful to more 
experienced students.  
 112 
Although I was able to obtain enrollment records for Physics 1, Physics 2, and 
Calculus classes, I was not able to access reliable data on how the students performed in 
the courses. It is plausible that their robotics experiences could have increased their 
learning, particularly given the amount of physics concepts the students were exposed to. 
While class grades are a measure, the analysis would need to account for the differences 
between teachers. A more reliable measure would be to compare standardized test scores, 
such as the AP exams. 
Test scores and course enrollment are only a few of the metrics that robotics may 
impact. It would also be useful to compare robotics students against a comparison group 
on high school graduation rates, rates of college attendance, and how many majored in 
STEM subjects.  
This study focused on an academic class conducted by a school because it 
provided several research advantages, including a large number of contact hours and 
access to school and district data. However, many students do not learn and interact with 
robotics in a class setting, but instead through after school clubs, summer camps, and 
other extracurricular activities. While these less formal settings are more difficult to 
study, the fact that students are participating in them makes it important to perform 
rigorous research into the experiences students are receiving and measure what they are 
learning, as well as long-term affective and metacognitive outcomes.  
Hussain et al. (2006) and Lindh and Holgersson (2007) both showed some 
positive gains working with robotics embedded in a math class. Berland and McKenna 
(2012) would likely categorize this context as a STEM-design class instead of the 
engineering class of this study. More in-depth examination of embedded robotics could 
yield more positive math test results than what I found in this context. 
 113 
One instructional design principle that was advocated by Berland (2013) is 
making design projects address social issues in order to motivate students. The capstone 
projects in the observed class did not follow that ideal and created contrived artificial 
problems to solve. A redesigned project may be worth further study to see if the changes 
produce more student engagement and positive impacts.

Appendix A: Robotics Capstone Project Description 
2010 Robotics Challenge 
Setup 
As part of a major installation of a city art project, you are asked to design two 
components of a robotic Goldberg machine.   Your components will combine with others 
to form a large robotic art installation. 
 
Robots 
1) Pickup and Dropoff:  This robot must move along a 3” diameter tubular rail that is 
approximately 7 feet long.  This robot must also collect 4” diameter balls which 
rest on a shelf just below and to one side of the tubular rail.  These balls will rest 
6” apart as measured from the center of one ball to the center of the next (6” on 
center).  Additionally, a third row of balls will sit in the middle of the shelf.  
These balls will be placed at varying heights.  Each ball must be delivered to a 
launcher robot positioned on the ground about 5’ below the tubular rail.  The 
position of the launcher robot is fixed. 
2) Catch and Fire:  This robot rests on the ground and receives balls dropped from 
the Pickup and Dropoff robot.  Catch and Fire must then shoot the balls through a 
specified target zone, black balls to the black target and green balls to the green 
target. 
 
Game Specifics 
o You will be able to control your robots manually at first, but by a specified 
date (TBA), each robot must operate autonomously. 
o You may use additional materials to build your robot. 
o Points:   
§ (1 pt.)   Ball picked from shelf and dropped 
§ (2 pts.) Ball picked from shelf and dropped into Catch and Fire 
robot 
§ (1 pt.)   Ball launched through target 
§ (2 pts.) Ball launched through target of correct color 
o Pick-up and Drop-off 
§ Pieces of tape along the tubular rail will coincide with the center of 
the balls on the shelf. 
§ Balls must be dropped without stopping the robot. 
§ Robot can be designed to fit completely around the 3” diameter 
tubular rail, if desired.  Game apparatus will be disassembled to 
accommodate this. 
o Catch and Fire 
§ Robot rests on the ground, and its position is fixed. 
 115 
§ Robot must fit within a box measuring X x Y x Z. 
 
Teams 
 You will work in a team of 4-5 students designing one of the two types of robots.  
Your team will need to coordinate its efforts with other teams in your class as alliance 
members during game play.  Cooperative strategies, alignment of designs and 
communication between robots may all be things for your team to think about and 
discuss.  
 
Team Roles 
 Each team will have four member roles with specific duties to perform.  In the case of 
a 5 member team, duties will need to be shared.  At different times throughout the 
project, each role will assume the role of team leader.  For example, during the design 
phase, the CAD Manager will be incharge. 
 
Team Member Role Responsibilities 
Build Manager o Understand and describe the current build of the robot:  
§ how strategy and design fit together 
§ specific mechanical features 
§ principles of physics supporting the design1 
o Maintain a parts inventory 
o Maintain a photographic record of the build process 
o Help insure team productivity 
Automation Manager o Understand and describe the current program version: 
§ how the program fits with strategy and design 
§ specific programmatic features 
§ how the program works with the physics behind 
the design 
o Insure that robot brain is programmed correctly and 
that the robot is behaving predictably 
o Maintain program versions 
o Help insure team productivity 
 
CAD Manager o Understand and describe the current robot drawing: 
§ how robot is represented in CAD 
§ workings of sub-assemblies and how they fit 
together 
§ accuracy of representation 
§ Can someone not on your team build the robot 
from the drawings? 
§ Show how your robot relates to other robots and 
                                                
 
 116 
the game apparatus. 
o Maintain drawing versions. 
o Help insure team productivity. 
Project Manager o Understand and describe the overall picture of the 
project: 
§ How do the robot, program, drawing, strategy fit 
together? 
§ Report on coordination efforts between teams. 
§ Describe set-backs and accomplishments during 
the life of the project. 
o Maintain project folder and flash drive. 
o daily accounts of who did what and for how 
long 
o Find answers to questions through other teams, outside 
resources and Mr. Sperry. 
o Help insure team productivity. 
 
About Member Responsibilities 
 Although different members are responsible for different things, these responsibilities 
are not exclusive.  Each of you should understand something about the robot, strategy, 
drawings, program, coordination with other teams and the overall progress.  It’s your 
team, and you have to help make it successful.  Some days the Project Manager may have 
do some programming, or the Build Manager may have to attend to the project folder.  
Help each other out as best you can. 
 
Daily Routine 
 Each work day will be split between meeting time and work time. 
1. Collect project binder and flash drive. 
2. Review previous days’ work. 
3. Examine and discuss what you cooperating team has done or suggested. 
4. Make a plan for today. 
5. Work on that plan. 
6. Review and make notes on today’s efforts. 
7. Store latest electronic file versions on flash drive. 
8. Communicate with cooperating teams. 
9. Return project binder and flash drive.

However, the research on the benefits of robotics have shown mixed results. In addition, many of the studies lack strong controls and focus on short-term effects, while the programs they investigate have few contact hours and do not have a consistent curriculum. This situation indicates that more research is needed.
This work focuses on a public high school in Texas with a year-long robotics class. The first part examines a set of students who enrolled in the robotics class in the 9th or 10th grade, and a comparison group of students who did not enroll in robotics. The robotics and comparison groups were matched on 8th grade standardized math test scores, and demographic factors. Using multiple linear regression and logistic regression, I found that robotics enrollment was not a significant predictor for 11th grade math standardized test scores, or high school enrollment in Physics 1, Physics 2, or Calculus classes.
The second part examines a series of video recordings of student teams in the robotics class working on a capstone project. Using grounded theory, I coded and analyzed recordings of two of the teams, focusing on the math and science discussions between the students and the contexts in which the math and science occur. Three themes emerged from the data. First, students use math/science more frequently to identify and fix problems than in their initial design. Second, students use math/science at a conceptual level and do not perform math calculations. Last, students have a “good enough” attitude and do not prioritize precision. These results may help explain the lack of effect robotics have on math test scores.Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Educatio","['Thesis', 'text', 'Robotics', 'Longitudinal', 'Pre–college engineering', 'STEM integration', 'K-12', 'STEM', 'K-12 engineering', 'Math achievement', 'Math enrollment', 'Science enrollment', 'Authentic pedagogy', 'Math education', 'Science education', 'Physics achievement', 'Calculus achievement', 'Mixed methods', 'Grounded theory', 'Engineering design', 'Design education', 'Project-based learning', 'Design-based instruction', 'Design-based learning', 'Capstone', 'LEGO', 'VEX', 'MINDSTORMS', 'Explicit integration']",disabled

Abstract 
 
This paper presents a qualitative assessment of the experience of integrating a humanoid robotics seminar in 
a mobile robotics-related subject at the Master’s degree on Automatic Control and Robotics. In this way, social 
robotics is included as a part of the syllabus of this Master’s subject taught using the Problem-Based Learning 
(PBL) methodology. The assessment of our experience shows high interest in the new robotics approach and 
students are satisfied. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Isaac Asimov succeeded when forecasting about Robotics even though it will leave him behind. The 
biochemist and science fiction American writer predicted half a century ago that “Robots will neither be 
common nor very good in 2014, but they will be in existence”. But humanoid robotics, with anthropomorphic 
aspect and human functionalities, is giving huge leaps when living and sharing daily task with humans such as 
elderly attention, therapeutic training, medication supplying to unhealthy people, and kids’ surveillance at home 
[1] [2]. Nowadays, the robotics is a part of daily life. Most recently, European technological universities are 
introducing Social and Humanoid Robotics in their curriculum with a good pedagogical result.  
 
In this work, the main objective is to show the successful introduction of social robotics (using humanoids) in 
a funny and entertained manner into the classrooms. The idea is that students acquire skills related with social 
robotics in the major subject of Robotics in the second year of the master of Automatic Control and Robotics. At 
the end of the seminar a questionnaire is passed to students to have a fruitful feedback to improve the subject 
together an evaluation sheet to know whether they have acquired some important skills in this matter. 
Specifically, in this work authors present the assessment of a novel robotics seminar integrated in the “Robotics, 
Kinematics, Dynamics and Control” subject taught in the Master’s degree in Automatic Control and Robotics at 
BarcelonaTech.  This subject has a load of 45 hours, which 16 have been reserved for the Robotics Seminar. 
 
 
2. Assessment of the Seminar and Discussion 
 
The teaching results obtained by introducing this seminar as a part of “Robotics, Kinematics, Dynamics and 
Control” subject been promising [3] [4] [5]. To assess this seminar, an experimental evaluation protocol is 
followed. This protocol is based on the evaluation of the objectives and competences that were proposed in this 
robotics subject by two indicators: first, the achieved level of knowledge of students for generic and specific 
competences and, second, using a questionnaire targeted to students’ opinion about the seminar. This first 
indicator has been obtained in two different academic years, that is, one year without integrating the social 
robotics seminar in the “Robotics, Kinematics, Dynamics and Control” subject, and the next academic year with 
this seminar.  
 
Using this evaluation methodology, the goal is to assess the performance of the subject in the following 
aspects: 1) students achieve the required generic competences and above all the specific competence of 
teamwork; 2) training is tested mainly according three important features (building awareness, knowledge and 
skills). Fig.1 shows the normalized score for each competence of the subject (mechanics and electronics, 
programming, control and sensors and teamwork). For each competence, first column corresponds to the score 
of the subject without this seminar, and the second column to the score with the social seminar. 
 
Analyzing these results, all the students have finished the workshop with successfully grades showing high 
interest in the new robotics approach (with social seminar). In the case of the generic competence, it is clear that 
students raise 60 points more of performance. Besides, at the end of the term a questionnaire is given to the 
students to know their opinion about the seminar, see Table 1. It is concluded that they found the experience 
very fruitful and they are highly motivated to continue with this degree.  The score for these questions range 
from 1 to 5 (1-completely disagree, 5-completely agree). All the enrolled students answered the questionnaire. 
Fig.2 shows the questions passed to the students. 
 
 
Fig.1 Comparison between students’ scores in “Robotics, Kinematics, Dynamics and Control” subject  
with and without social robotics seminar. 
 
From the results, it can be observed that students found that this pedagogical procedure requires a higher 
effort that the traditional procedure. The students’ motivation about the developed activities is also higher, 
stimulating their interest for the university degrees. Moreover, students have achieved a greater number of skills, 
competences and also talent that are evaluated in the professional world respect to others academic years where 
the seminar was not taught. A second edition of the seminar is ongoing by the authors because the experience 
has been also very enriching for all the instructors that participated in this new pedagogical methodology. The 
weak point of the seminar is the reduced number of laboratory sessions in order to acquire a good level in social 
robotics.

3. Conclusion 
 
In this article, the novel seminar of “Social Robotics” for Master’s students has been evaluated. From the 
assessment of the seminar, the training methodology ensured their active participation and this encourages the 
authors to repeat the experience. This seminar has been carried out successfully as a part of the “Robotics, 
Kinematics, Dynamics and Control” subject taught in the Master’s degree in Automatic Control and Robotics 
This methodology can be exported to other robotic subjects independently of the hardware that will be used in 
the laboratory.

Abstract—In consideration of future employment 
in STEM domains, university graduates should 
be prepared to meet the demands of industry 4.0 
– resulting from a fourth industrial revolution. 
Based on the technological concept of cyber-
physical systems and the internet of things, it 
facilitates – among others - the vision of the smart 
factory. As a result, robotics education is faced with 
a large potential field of research, which ranges 
from the technical development and didactical 
students’ acceptance or the proof of concept of the 
terms of learning efficiency. This paper presents 
a conceptual framework to investigated which 
kinds of learning outcomes prefer in a robotics 
education in secondary school STEM curriculum. 
Building upon the results content analysis, a 
collaborative STEM curriculum using robotics as 
a platform was created within the collaborative 
competition environment. It is expected that the 
students exposed to the robotics curriculum in 
secondary school would continue to pursue the 
engineering course in university. Therefore, this 
is an important contribution towards a globalized 
and digitalized working world in terms of 
industry 4.0. 
Keywords—industry 4.0; robotics; education; 
curriculum.
 
I .  INTRODUCTION
IN today’s world, it seems all students need to be equipped with STEM knowledge and 
the creative problem-solving skills necessary to 
be innovative and creative thinkers. The vision 
of “industry 4.0” is characterized by highly 
individualized and at the same time cross-linked 
production processes [1].The digitalization 
of education system also means that learning 
becomes more collaborative. Recently, robotics 
education has built a track record in STEM 
education by providing resources that are 
engaging, familiar, and relevant to young 
learners so that teachers and facilitators can 
deliver high-quality, hands-on curriculum that 
encourages creativity and problem solving 
while strengthening the abilities and skills 
needed for students to be successful in the core 
classroom [2], [3].
 The curricula at all levels in Malaysia are 
developed to address the needs of all students, 
regardless of race, socioeconomic and gender. 
The current curriculum design adopted by 
the Curriculum Development Division of the 
MOE, is a standards-based thinking oriented 
curriculum [4]. Students engage in learning 
experiences by thinking about and thinking 
with what they are learning. It is hoped that 
the findings of this study would spearhead 
the formal training of robotic education in 
the Malaysia education curriculum using 
Robotics curriculum to enhance integrative 
STEM education. By integrating educational 
robotics into the latest standards-based STEM 
curriculum, teaching tools, and appropriate 
hardware and software that can help turn to 
ordinary learning into dynamic, performance-
boosting learning environments [3], [5], [6]. Article history: Manuscript received 15 March 2018; received in

The spotlight is now focus on how the learners 
learn and the how to design an effective 
learning environment. Parallel to this shift in 
pedagogy, the integrated STEM curriculum has 
emphasized the need for reform to modernise 
Malaysia STEM education.
II .  LITERATURE REVIEW
Since 21st century, Malaysia economy moves 
from a manufacturing-based economy to an 
information and service-based economy, thus the 
demand for a workforce well educated in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM) is 
growing. Unfortunately, the number of students 
who choose STEM fields continues to decline 
[7]. Research on integrative instruction that 
focuses on Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
Mathematics (STEM) is important, because the jobs 
of tomorrow are rooted in STEM fields. Although 
the written curriculum developed by the Ministry 
of Education (MOE) specifically states that STEM 
education includes three main components which 
are knowledge, scientific skills and scientific 
attitudes, however there is a gap between the 
aspired curriculum, implemented curriculum 
and examined curriculum [8]. The implemented 
curriculum does not reflect these three focus very 
well and the examined curriculum did not reflect 
this balance in integrative STEM education either. 
Educators are always searching the best pedagogy 
to improve students’ achievement, skills, and 
attitude toward learning STEM subjects, However, 
the current traditional curriculum is more teacher-
cantered than learner rather than the learner-
cantered. 
 In recent years, there has been a change 
in basic assumptions taking place, moving the 
emphasis from teaching to learning and a more 
student-centred curriculum especially in STEM 
subjects [9]. This change has impacted on the 
curriculum design process with a greater emphasis 
on the learning activities through project-based 
in terms of knowledge, skills and competencies 
within courses and modules [10], [11]. 
 The objective of this paper is to propose a 
new integrated STEM curriculum using robotics 
as an agent to deliver the content and learning 
activities. 
III .  METHODOLOGY
A conceptual framework for Integrated Robotic 
STEM curriculum is designed in this study as 
a guideline for curriculum development as in 
Fig. 1. The new framework focuses on using 
educational robotics in STEM learning as 
an outcome while capitalizing on the acts of 
workplace readiness as versioned in Industry 
4.0.

assumptions taking place, moving the emphasis from teaching 
to learning and a more student-centred curriculum especially in 
STEM subjects [9]. This change has impacted on the 
curriculum design process with a greater emphasis on the 
learning activities through project-based in terms of 
knowledge, skills and competencies within courses and 
modules [10], [11].  
The objective of this paper is to propose a new integrated 
STEM curriculum using robotics as an agent to deliver the 
content and learning activities.

Integrated Robotics STEM Curriculum Towards Industry 4.0
21
VI.  DISCUSSION
Developing a new curriculum requires large 
efforts, resources, and involves several changes. 
The first step including selecting one of the 
two curriculum frameworks or merging the 
both; rewriting and state the related curriculum 
documents; retraining the teachers in the 
integrated curriculum structure; rewritting new 
textbooks for possibly all grades; and providing 
substantial professional development course to 
allow school districts to coordinate pedagogy. 
Long-term investment in developing and 
refining their own robotics STEM programs has 
caused states, school districts, and teachers to 
modify their existing curriculum frameworks 
and have attempts to adopt national or state 
content standards and frameworks.
 To outline the learning activities based on 
an integrated STEM curriculum, the selection of 
a topic within the curriculum for the application 
of educational robotics is a very important step 
to ensure that learning outcomes relate directly 
to the curriculum. The course syllabus could be 
modified to suit the robotics related activities 
but without deviating away from the objectives 
of the course. Next, a clear set of learning 
outcomes must be derived from the STEM 
syllabus and aligned with the STEM curriculum 
as a guide in the process of constructing the 
robotics project which will be the basis for the 
activities. To design the robotics projects and 
specification, the project requirements must 
be defined in a way that its completion would 
fulfil the learning outcomes. In addition, the 
requirements must resemble a real-world 
problem which clearly defines the type of new 
knowledge to be learned, whether this new 
knowledge comes at the core of the curricula, 
and what existing knowledge is necessary for 
students to get involved in the robotics project. 
 As some of the projects including a robotics 
competition, a set of well-defined competition 
rules is included. The rules and regulations 
must include project themes, winning criteria, 
ranking procedures, violations, policies, and 
other related terms.  Finally, the assessment 
method for learning outcomes is design based 
on the Taxonomy Bloom. Assessing the learning 
outcomes of the integrated STEM curriculum 
using educational robotics is not an difficult 
task. The teacher can easily determine that 
through interviews or presentations, or even 
using traditional examinations.

VII. CONCLUSION 
       More Malaysian schools are now geared towards 21st 
century learning environment with emphasis on more active 
student-centred learning applying Higher Order Thinking 
Skills (HOTS) in curriculum, assessm nt, and co-curricular 
activities, and the utilisation of Information, Communication 
and Technology (ICT), in preparation for the changing 
landscape of higher education and future opportunities. 
Curriculum integration requires a shift in the traditional role of 
the teacher to a more dynamic, interactive, and collaborative 
students-centered. learning environment. It requires teachers to 
share decision making and the complicated process of inquiry, 
where the outcomes are unknown. As emphasized in the 
Malaysia Educati n Blueprint 2013-2025 [19], jobs of the 
future are STEM jobs. The Ministry of Education contributed 
in sharing knowledge and expertise on curriculum, pedagogy 
and assessment for STEM to strengthen the regional capacity 
of member countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Teachers 
in a conventional setting did not have adequate tech resources 
to inspire students to break free from monotonous educational 
pattern and would follow the same old practice for 
years. Various strategies can be planned to engage students 
and stimulate their interest in sch l  with the aid of em rging 
and modern technology tools.  Students  would feel 
encouraged and empowered to participate in classroom 
activities with free access to such tech tools in the 21st cenruty 
classroom.

modern technology tools.  Students  would feel 
encouraged and empowered to participate in 
classroom activities with free access to such tech 
tools in the 21st cenruty classroom.
 With the STEM-focused curriculum 
using educational robotics, we seek to create 
environments where learning happens in a 
hands-on and motivational way – helping 
students discover their talents and cement 
learning from the core classroom. By offering 
student-driven and easy-to-use materials, the 
new framework can reinforce and enhance 
the learning occurring throughout the school 
day, setting the secondary school students 
on a path to future success. Students will 
enjoy more inquiry-based learning in STEM 
curriculum through hands-on approach and the 
enhancement of practical sessions with more 
enquiry-based learning. The new curriculum 
focuses more on problem solving skills, and 
moves away from rote learning methods. It is 
expected that the outcome of the new robotics 
STEM curriculum is the graduates with skills 
which are critical in the 21st century such 
as technological literacy , collaborative and 
communication skills are embedded in the 
curriculum [20]. 
 In the integrated STEM curriculum, 
whether learning about robots or learning 
with robots, it is essential that a robotics lesson 
provide an introduction to the key areas of STEM 
while focus to insight the students’ engagement 
and exploration in the multidisciplines study. It 
is important that the curriculum allow for single 
activity or lesson plans as well. To allow for 
this, the robotics curriculum should allow entry 
points at various stages in the overall academic 
curriculum. By no means, robotics STEM 
curriculum is a new silver bullet for 21st century 
education, nor is it intended to replace the 
existing science and mathematics curriculum, it 
is another entry in the teachers' toolbox with the 
aim to prepare the STEM workforce and STEM 
literate society for the real world in Industry 4.0.

Abstract. This research is focused on studying educational robotics, specifically robots which 
provide functions of educational activity. We have considered the questions of intelligent 
agents’ behavior and have studied their educational opportunities. Educational robotics is a 
powerful tool of developing person’s skills and abilities in various fields of technical creativity 
and professional activity. The evolutionary development of robotics is connected with 
development of artificial intelligence, where emotions play a great role in operations. 
Nowadays the main thing is to form the ability and skills of optimum interaction with social 
environment when a person, based on gained knowledge, is capable to put goals of the activity 
in strict accordance with laws and society conditions and using current technology.  
1. Introduction 
The artificial intelligence does not excel human intelligence. There are many interpretation of the 
concept ""artificial intelligence"". According to Allen Newell and Herbert Aleksander Simon, the 
founders of research in the field of artificial intelligence [1], it is necessary to consider the specific 
strategy of machine cognitive and peculiar conscious activity. These strategies cause various potential 
opportunities of a human, considerably strengthening not only his/her physical capacities, but 
intellectual as well. 
David Vernon formulated the concept of computer vision and robot’s capacity to self-studying, he 
practically raised the question about the anthropomorphous robot. In his opinion [2], progress in the 
sphere of developing and creating robots is too fast, that something that was considered as an artificial 
intelligence a few years ago is seen as an improved method of research and data processing now. 
The aim of the research is to consider the essence and peculiarities of educational robotics as an 
innovative pedagogical practices using technology, to solve the problem of risks minimization in the 
usage of robotics in educational environment.  
As a result, we have solved such tasks as revealing the subject of educational robotics as a 
pedagogical technology and forms of its implementation. To achieve the goal and do the tasks we have 
used cognitive and productive approach in combination with dialectic and competency-based 
approach. Application of educational robotics within educational process is developed in cognitive and 
activity plane [3]. Cognitive activity of subjects of educational process is composed of requirements 
and strivings to acquire knowledge with the assistance of wide range of various sciences, young 
researchers’ (trainees) interest in a problem solving, trainees’ personal educational trajectory 
developing, cross-fertilization between theory and practice in the course of problem solving at the 
intersection of areas of knowledge. We applied competence-based approach which helped us to

analyze social space of safety formation as a space of organized human activity for eliminating social 
risks under formation of effective educational process. The competence-based approach has a complex 
hierarchic-level structure with a plenty of components and is interconnected with system, structural, 
functional, problem, genetic approaches in studying phenomena and events. This method is focused on 
a personality and the activity of the personality. Competence-based approach refers to the purpose and 
the result of education. Competence-based approach holds a special place in training specialists in 
information and measurement equipment and technology as it integratively opens the questions, 
requiring the solution, and then solves these problems integrally. Certainly, competence is a social 
education requirement, but this requirement is rather alienated from a future specialist. The 
competence is not simple knowledge acquisition; it is relevant competence, skill, knowledge of this 
competence, a personal quality. Cognitive and productive approach is a method of studying by 
autonomous system of environment and world, in general, learning by own experience, perceiving 
consequences of the acts, searching the ways to achieve target tasks and. objectives and adaptation to 
circumstances which are constantly changed.  
2. Educational Robotics as an Innovative Teaching Practice 
Educational robotics is a new knowledge acquisition at the intersection of the fields of priority and 
advanced areas of knowledge in such scientific spheres as mechanics, electronics, automatic 
equipment, programming, project engineering, circuitry engineering, design engineering. It represents 
such pedagogical practice using technology when acquisition of knowledge happens in the process of 
creating a robot. Therefore, educational robotics is focused on two actions: educational and 
technological. 
These two actions are combined and are urgent in the recent period, the period of innovative 
economy formation and development. We need to emphasize that educational robotics primarily is 
based on integration of knowledge, received while studying subjects according to educational 
standards. However, to solve certain specific objectives or problems cognitive achievements of 
sciences taught variably are integrated [4]. Consequently, we deal with knowledge integration which 
unites both the first, and the second integrated systems. As result we get the following: 
− formation of direct connection between various subjects and scientific branches of knowledge; 
understanding of education process, meaning of education, necessity to compete in the field of 
robotics; 
− ability to achieve successful results during research and educational process; 
− realization of the rivalry of the robotic ideas and decisions in the world. 
Nowadays theoretical knowledge is popular in unity with practical knowledge. Owing to the 
currently central demand of both theoretical and practical the striving to master them more deeply and 
more widely arises. This can be reached by means of robotics as a technology for mastering a complex 
of knowledge. Robotics as a pedagogical practices using technology corresponds to the basic Didactic 
principles of education [5]: 
−  scientific orientation; 
−  world outlook orientation; 
−  problematicity (stating a problem, having several decisions); 
−  visual aids caused by robotics (drawings, schemes, designs, mechanisms); 
− self-actualization of students’ own needs for knowledge, self-studying the theory and the 
transferring theory into a practical product, that is to the robot; 
− variability in studying, in choosing complexity of an engineering problem; 
− sequence of learning knowledge at robot production; 
− solidity and cyclicity of studying; 
− stage-by-stage checking robot production; 
− deepening knowledge expansion which is necessary for each stage; 
−  unity of the educational and developing functions of studying.

Modern scientific and technical creativity is expressed through a robotics which is focused on 
searching, preparing, and implementing younger generation ideas at the interface of researchers on 
urgent fields of knowledge with vast research prospect in the future. Therefore, robotics represents the 
unique innovative pedagogical practices using technology sent to search for creative persons. Robotics 
as pedagogical technology is expressed in educational process in the following forms [6]: 
1. Seminars.  
2. Symposiums, conferences. 
3. Open online courses. 
4. School and Conference. 
5. Workshops. 
6. Forums. 
7. Special courses. 
8. Specialized laboratories of robotics. 
9.  Participation in competitions. 
The main objective of all forms of expression of robotics as innovative pedagogical practices using 
technology consists in [7]: 
1. students acquaintance to the main principles of robotics, drawing attention to youth scientific and 
technical creativity; 
2. exchange of experience between young researchers; 
3. the organizations of communication between subjects of educational process; 
4. discussion of the ideas and results of technical realization; 
5. knowledge and basic principles of robotics; 
6. development of bases of design and designing of robots of various degree of complexity; 
7. understanding of an essence of technical creativity; 
8. ability to work in team. 
Robotics is a form of additional education at schools, lyceums, gymnasiums. In colleges, technical 
schools, institutes, universities, academies, it keeps the character of additional education. However in 
educational institutions with robotic profile, robotics is additional education along with the primary 
educational activity. The teachers, carrying out this form of pedagogical activity, create author's 
programs on organization and implementation of this innovative pedagogical practices using 
technology.  
At the same time there is a scientific and methodical challenge connected with the problem of 
concretizing knowledge on robotics course having cross-disciplinary character. As a result, the special 
course on robotics will allow to implement the ideas of the cross-disciplinary complex, and to promote 
practical use of theoretical knowledge and enhanced studying of the entering this complex disciplines. 
Besides, it is possible to enrich robotics course using information from related areas. 
Conducting lessons in the international robotics laboratories will be a considerable contribution for 
development of educational robotics. As a result of involving young forces in such scientific branch as 
robotics, there will be not only search, but also preparation and support of new highly qualified 
experienced staff [8]. Owing to successful search, challenging ideas, we can refer to high intelligent 
potential of the educational system subjects engaged in the educational robotics program. Annually 
competence content requirements are changed, new ideas appear constantly, and interesting decisions 
are made. Cognitive character of robotics is developed increasingly. Strengthening the role of 
educational and pedagogical technology is an important task of educational robotics - it is students’ 
work on cross-disciplinary complex projects in the field of robotics, formation of the up to date 
intelligent robotics environment which is capable to train experts for developing high technologies. 
Competitions, the Olympic Games, conferences having competitive character and characterized by 
any given degree of competitiveness are of great importance for development of educational robotics. 
As a rule, competitions are designed for a great pool of participants. The Olympic Games are for 
intellectual elite. Conferences are for broad interchange of opinions, for scientific and creative 
intercommunication. In competitions, the Olympic Games, conferences participants are engaged in

self-studying in the field of educational robotics. They can use gained knowledge and modern 
technologies in practice. In these forms of educational process students gain experience in 
implementing an innovative project, prepare to work in the hi-tech companies in the sphere of 
robotics. 
Robotic competitions are one of the key insights of educational robotics. They give an opportunity 
to disclose technical imagination, to exchange the ideas, knowledge, approaches to master knowledge. 
Cross-disciplinary creative approach in educational robotics is connected with implementation of 
symbolic method. Educational robotics demands using active and interactive training. In educational 
process a modeling environment should be created, in which a student works with knowledge and 
receives an intellectual response of system, and creates the virtual and real world. The symbolic 
method in educational robotics acts not in opposition to formal logic, but as a connection between real 
and unreal. 
The issue of scientific knowledge is solved not only in harmony of forms and techniques of 
expressing ideas, but in visual knowledge of the scientific truth as well, in its internal reflection. 
Scientific ideas have to declare themselves, emotionally influencing student’s consciousness. The 
abstract logical images gaining sensual character turn into concepts of educational robotics. The 
purpose consists in developing their ability to make sense of life phenomena transformations. In the 
system of contemporary education there is a tendency to symbolize forms of knowledge acquisition 
and represent it to integration of scientific, symbolic and mystic knowledge [9].  
It is a basis of innovative educational technologies which allow to give knowledge in a creative and 
figurative form that promotes its stronger training. Symbolic method helps to implement internal 
human aptitude to studying. It allows to achieve a bright illustration of upbringing and education 
process. This method influences feelings, rather than exclusively education subject’s mind via creating 
robotic models. 
At the carried out study we have succeeded in research objects: 
1. The investigation has revealed the subject and the features of educational robotics as an innovative 
pedagogical practices using technology.  
2. We have considered the forms of its implementation. 
3. We have developed methodical guidelines on implementing educational robotics as an innovative 
pedagogical practices using technology. 
The innovative educational technology presented by educational robotics is directed to stimulate 
and develop scientific and technical creativity of youth. The main feature of this technology is to 
combine competences formulated during the continuous comprehensive educational process of 
receiving and forming practical skills and theoretical knowledge allowing to realize the creative 
potential of young people. 
Educational robotics is a practical implementation of innovative approach to youth scientific and 
technical teaching, namely, it is a cross-disciplinary complex of the training, developing, cognitive and 
methodic actions aimed at the developing young inventors and researchers [10]. The main idea of 
educational robotics consists in: 
1) integration of subjects to create robot and consistently learn all steps of engineering process - from 
controlled robot to autonomous robot;  
2)  organizing design and inventive activity; 
3)  providing life cycle of creative projects – from the idea to an implementation; 
4)  differentiation of attainment level; 
5)  providing team work; 
6)  implementation of professional orientation; 
7)  using contemporary high technologies. 
Use of robotics is connected with risks in educational process, influencing subjects of the 
educational environment negatively. As a result, it was revealed that robotics and robotic technologies 
define depth and amplitude of the scope of knowledge. The carried out analysis of the role of social 
risks in educational system has shown that the process of formation and development of education

depends on the state and the nature of social risks, on the extent of preventive measures with them. 
The study emphasizes that minimizing risks can be achieved by the tasks limitation and concentration 
of conditions to use educational robotics, and establish criterion and standards of its application. 
Orientation of education assessment results is relevant due to the necessity of the theoretical and 
methodological analysis of training specialist in the robotics and robotic technology. According to the 
applied method of the analysis and cross-disciplinary approach we conclude that educational process 
has an integrative nature. 
3. The issue of risks and their minimization in using robotics in educational process  
Innovative character of educational robotics as pedagogical technology is caused by the combination 
of the learners’ project and practice-oriented activity and use of the modern technologies. Educational 
robotics is a powerful tool of developing person’s skills and abilities in various fields of technical 
creativity and professional activity.  
The key social task for modern society is to form population safety, to establish and develop 
tolerant relations in society and in education as well. In the modern era the state of scientific and 
technical assurance of educational process is closely connected with the development of innovative 
teaching technologies, one of which is robotics in educational process. Applying robotics in 
educational environment causes risks in implementing interaction of subjects and subjects and objects 
of educational process as well. To achieve necessary result we need to use methods of risks 
minimization. Applying these methods it is possible to reach minimization of risks when using 
robotics in educational process.  
The risk inherent in application of such supporting training tool as a robot can influence the result 
both positively and negatively. It is possible to avoid risk. To achieve this it is enough to apply an 
avoidance method, that is, to refuse the action connected with risk or to develop the action which is 
completely excluding risk. However it is not always possible to avoid risks. Therefore, avoidance of 
one risk can lead to emergence of another. Hence, it is necessary to analyze various ways of 
minimization [11]. It is possible to reach minimization of risk by limitation of tasks and concentration 
of conditions for use of educational robotics, and establishment of criterion and standards of its 
application. The limit of set up problems for particular conditions of studying or research allows to 
specify the application of a certain type of robotics (specific robots) in the organization of educational 
process.  
The subject of education loses the experience of a harmonious state if a priority and the importance 
of robotics. Thus, there is a self-loss of ""I-ego"", loss of understanding the essence of the conscious 
activity and its difference from robotic, underestimation of the intelligence. There is an emerging of 
self-estrangement, and the state of admiring robotics, self-opposition, the rise of technologies above a 
person. From there, the risk of losing yourself as a person, and emergence of dependence on robotics 
appears. According to the personality’s self-loss of its ""I-ego"" the model of person’s social 
regeneration can be formed. In the beginning a person, being in harmony along, considers him/herself 
intellectual, creative. But with the development of artificial intelligence, robotics, virtual games, 
people become the elements of an information field. The first prerequisites of alienated state, alienated 
thoughts appear. Here we discuss negative results of applying robotics in educational process. 
But there are also positive results. Use of robotics promotes knowledge of the world around, 
transformation of the environment. In this case robotics acts as the tool, a learning tool. For users it is 
important to master cognitive features of educational robotics, resulting in understanding the 
importance of intelligence of a person, his/her creativity. Cognitive approach in formation and use of 
educational robotics allows to increase positivism of using innovative technologies in educational 
space by means of identifying the mechanism of interaction of the education and robotics subject 
intelligence as learning tools. The complexity is that understanding of this interaction is possible after 
understanding the consequences of risk. In modern society the lines of social strain exerting negative 
impact on education. As a result, risk situations happen [12]. Modern technology equipment, including 
robotics influences much on risks emergence.

In education system there was always an ideal to educate an all-round and harmoniously developed 
individual, being not only self-sufficient and having fundamental knowledge, but brought up in the 
system of moral values. Usefulness and performance indicators [13], that is education 
commercialization, are the main content of modern educational practice. As a result humanitarian 
knowledge becomes second-grade, the value of technical and other applied sciences increases. The 
modern youth is interested in intelligent systems now and gravitates towards developing robots and 
certain cloning of properties and lines of the person in the robot, believing that it is possible to replace 
person’s monotonous work by robots. 
4. Summary  
Application of robotics and appropriate technologies facilitates and contributes to the development of 
interactivity in teaching, developing student’s independence and creativity, but at the same time forms 
egoism and individualism. The egoism and individualism are those features of an individual, which 
leads to alienation, to professional burning out, emotional failures. The innovation of a robotic 
technology represents a form of vulnerability of a person against the threats caused by the 
modernization and development of robotics [14].  
The risks caused by an innovation characterize the development stage when old mechanisms lose 
their efficiency, and new one arises [15]. Unfortunately, the influence of robotics affects often that 
absolutization of artificial intelligence leads to self-reflection, loss of the ""I-ego"".  
Innovative teaching techniques using robotic technology activate students’ attention and 
perception, make creative atmosphere. The feature of current generation is orientation to the 
entertaining, visualized teaching techniques specific to contemporary culture [16]. Innovative teaching 
is risky as it uses untested teaching methods. Teaching by robotic technology is innovative and risky 
as it is impossible to predict the action of the artificial intelligence. But at the same time use of a 
robotic technology leads to passive learning material, does not make memory and thoughts to train, as 
everything is done by a robot. There is time and forces saving, but the psychological indifference is 
formed. 
Competence-based approach is of great importance in training specialists by using robotics and 
robotic technology. The core of training specialists in the field of robotics is competences, aimed to 
form system of knowledge, skills and abilities. Nowadays, breakthrough technologies take on great 
importance. It is necessary to emphasize the role of information and measuring competences. In the 
course of their mastering people generate knowledge regarding the activity in the field of intelligent 
systems. The modern robotechnics and robotic technology assume rather good level of computer, 
information, natural-science, economic and socio-humanistic training of a person. Both in life, at 
work, and during educational process people deal with the innovative and advanced technologies 
which very quickly become outdated and make the owner be in a constant stress which can lead to 
emotional, and even to professional burning out [17]. 
Communicative practice is a part of business communication. For communicative practice in the 
system of robotics it is necessary to have skills and knowledge in the information and measuring 
techniques and technologies, knowledge of using them [18]. In the implementation of communicative 
practice by means of robotics it is necessary to be professional in using methods of acting in various 
situations. Robotic technology is favorable for development of individual approaches to training future 
specialists. Owing to cognitive features this is a fundamental condition of a competence-based 
approach [19,20]. 
Robotic technologies provide the efficiency of technical means and their profitability via optimum 
distribution of information and actions [21]. The robotic technologies are adaptive. When they were 
introduced into educational process, then methods, technologies and a methodological support of 
educational process using robotic technology and robotics started regulating.  
Global penetration of robot technologies into education considerably raised technical and 
methodical capabilities, it promoted enhancement of didactics. New quite efficient forms of education 
appear with the development of robotics.

Educational process using robotics and robotic technology keeps continuity of traditional education 
system, contributes to the development of innovative teaching model. The birth of robotics and robotic 
technology, despite the risks, makes changes in education system. The problem of minimizing risks in 
the use of a robot technology in educational process requires the solution owing to the existing 
education process modernization.

Abstract –  We describe  the  pedagogy behind the  MIT
Beaver Works Summer Institute Robotics Program, a new
high-school  STEM program in  robotics.  The  program
utilizes  state-of-the-art  sensors  and  embedded
computers  for  mobile  robotics.  These  components  are
carried on an exciting 1/10-scale race-car platform. The
program has three salient, distinguishing features:  (i) it
focuses on robotics software systems: the students design
and  build  robotics  software  towards  real-world
applications,  without  being  distracted  by  hardware
issues;  (ii) it  champions  project-based  learning:  the
students learn through weekly project assignments and a
final course challenge;  (iii) the learning is implemented
in a collaborative fashion: the students learn the basics of
collaboration and technical communication in lectures,
and they work in teams to design and implement their
software systems. The program was offered as  a four-
week residential program at MIT in the summer of 2016.
In  this  paper,  we  provide  the  details  of  this  new
program, its teaching objectives, and its results. We also
briefly discuss future directions and opportunities. 
Index  Terms –  High  school  STEM  education;  hands-on

I. INTRODUCTION
Robotics is a thriving emerging field that already has
had  tremendous  impact.  The  future  of  robotics  is  even
brighter: Self-driving cars may revolutionize transportation
by bringing down costs  by an order  of  magnitude,  while
substantially  enhancing  safety,  perhaps  even  eliminating
fatal  traffic  accidents;  Aerial  drones  may  finally  enable
affordable  same-hour  delivery  of  goods,  transforming the
way  we  shop;  Autonomous  underwater  vehicles  may
explore  our  oceans,  while  robotic  rovers  roam around  in
Mars  and  beyond.  These  robotics  applications  and  many
more are expected to unfold during the next few decades.
Those who will build these robotic systems are studying in
high schools today. How can we best prepare them now so
that they can build this future? 
It  is  widely  accepted  that  robotics  is  an  exciting
direction  for  high  school  students  [1],  and  robotics
competitions,  camps,  and  clubs  all  increase  interest  in
Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
[2], [3]. Many high-school robotics programs are organized
as competitions [4]. Among the best known are the FIRST
Robotics  Challenge,  the  FIRST Lego  League  [5],  BEST
Robotics  [6],  National  Robotics  Challenge  (NRC),  and
EARLY Robotics. These programs are all tailored for pre-
college  students,  spanning  a  large  variety  of  robotics
hardware for students to build and utilize. For instance, on
the one end of the spectrum, students build hundred-pound
robots  for  the  FIRST  Robotics  Challenge.  Teams  with
budgets  beyond  $15,000  are  fairly  common  [4].  On  the
other end of the spectrum, the BEST Robotics Competition
provides all hardware material required for a small fee of
$500  for  the  students  to  build  palm-size  robots.
Independently  of  the  cost  of  the  platforms,  almost  all
existing  robotics  competitions  for  high  school  students
require the students to focus on building and integrating the
hardware  that  make  up  the  robot,  at  the  expense  of
designing  and  implementing  complex  algorithms  and
software. 
The emerging applications of robotics are much more
complex  for  several  reasons.  Firstly,  they  are  software
heavy.  In  fact,  most  advanced  robotics  applications  are
enabled by software that is built from hundreds of thousands
of lines of code that is professionally implemented, often in
an object-oriented, low-level  programming language, such
as C++. The software is often so large and so complex that a
large  team  of  robotics  engineers  and  software  engineers
implement it  together. Hence, it  is essential  to  design the
software  system  given the  project  requirements,  and
implement  it  as  a  team  utilizing  essential  software
collaboration  tools. Second,  in  most  modern  robotics
systems  applications  the  sensor  data  is  massive  in  size,
unstructured  and  noisy.  Furthermore,  for  most  robotic
systems, there is not one sensor that the robot solely relies
on; often, data from multiple sensors (e.g.,  cameras, laser
range finders, inertial measurement units, global positioning
system, and more) are utilized together. Hence, algorithms
and software for proper sensor fusion is key to making most
of emerging applications of robotics. 
Most  existing  high-school  computer  science  and
robotics programs are unable to address these challenges on
their  own.  On  the  one  hand,  existing  robotics  programs
focus on the mechanics; as a result, they do not have room
for  students  to  design  and  implement  relatively  complex
software systems, as noted above. On the other hand, most
existing computer programs are fairly conceptual, and they
often  do  not  work  with real-world data  and not  consider
real-time processing.
In this paper, we describe the pedagogy behind a new
program,  called  the  MIT Beaver  Works  Summer  Institute
Robotics  Program.  The  new  program  complements  the
existing computer science and robotics programs as follows.
First,  the  new  program  focuses  entirely  on  robotics
software.  Students  do  not  engage  in  hardware  design  or
development. They are given a hardware kit that includes
state-of-the-art sensors and computers, including a scanning
laser range finder, a high-resolution stereo camera, and an
Nvidia Jetson Tegra  X1 embedded computer  with a  256-
core General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GPU).
The whole  sensing and computation platform is  fitted on
1/10-scale  race  car,  making  it  an  exciting  platform  for
students.
 Second,  the new program is project  based. Students
build their  skills  through several  “mini projects,”  each of
which require the design of a relatively complex software
and its  implementation.  Lectures  and laboratory  exercises
are tailored to help the students think towards their projects.
The program also features a final course challenge, which
requires  the  students  to  design  and  implement  robotics
software for fully-autonomous racing. The fastest  car  that
abides by the rules of the road wins! We believe project-
based learning that involves exciting projects helps motivate
the students and improves their system-level thinking and
system  design  skills,  in  this  case  focusing  on  software
systems. 
Third,  the  program  champions  collaboration. The
students work in teams for their projects. In each project, the
students  design  the  software  system  as  a  team.  They
partition their implementation into Robot Operating System
(ROS) nodes,  often each student implementing more than
one ROS node. They connect the nodes utilizing the ROS
messaging  environment.  The  students  also  utilize  the
software version tracking tools, which are common in large
software engineering projects in the robotics industry. Given
the  substantial  amount  of  collaboration  involved  in  the
course, we have implemented lectures and instruction that
teaches students effective communication and collaboration.
The  program  was  implemented  as  a  four-week
residential  program  at  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of
Technology (MIT) in the summer of 2016. A total number of
46  students  were  invited  to  the  MIT  campus  for  the
program, 22 of which came from Massachusetts while the
remaining 24 came from across the U.S. and stayed in the
Boston Area during these four weeks. We devote this paper
to a detailed description of the pedagogy of this program
and its results. 
Most  lectures  and  laboratory  exercises  are  modeled
after  MIT’s flagship robotics  course,  taught  by Karaman,
entitled  Robotics:  Science and Systems,  jointly offered by
the  Department  of  Electrical  Engineering  and  Computer
Science (under course number 6.141) and the Department of
Aeronautics  and  Astronautics  (under  course  number
16.405).
Let us note that there have been some other courses that
utilized state-of-the-art hardware in robotics education. The
most notable contemporary example is the ZERO Robotics
Challenge [7]-[10]. Teams from all over the United States
compete do develop software for a space robotics hardware.
They first compete in simulation systems, and then winning
teams compete with real robots at  the International  Space
Station in the zero-gravity environment. The program is an
excellent  example  of  the  utilization  of  state-of-the-art
robotics  equipment.  It  has  also  emphasized  collaboration
and  teamwork  since  its  inception  [11],  [12].  However,
almost  all  teams  are  entirely  made  up  of  undergraduate
students, rather than high school students. Furthermore, the
state-of-the-art  hardware  for  space  robotics  differs
significantly from the hardware for ground/aerial robotics.
Our  program  utilizes  hardware  for  the  latter,  and  it  is
specifically  tailored  for  high-school  students.  A relevant
example  is  from  2002.  A joint  program  offered  by  the
Carnegie  Mellon  University  (CMU)  and  National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invited 30
high-school students to NASA for a residential program to
learn  robotics  using  a  rover  utilized  by  NASA [13].  The
authors note that the goal for this course was to “provide
selected high school students with an immersive exploration
of  mobile  robotics  using  leading-edge  technologies.”  Our
program’s aim for 2016 was similar, with two exceptions:
the focus on high school education, and the focus on mobile
ground robots (rather than space robotics).
For the mobile robotics domain, most of the research
focused on the development of low-cost platforms, with the
motivation of reaching out to a large number of students. A
recent  survey  is  given  by  Irigoyen  [14].  Most  notable
examples include the use of Lego kits [5],  [15]-[18],  kits
based on the iRobot Create fitted with a Gumstix embedded
computer  [19],  [20] or  fitted  with just  a  laptop computer
[21].  These  platforms  serve  the  important  purpose  of
reaching as many students as possible, some of whom may
have very limited budgets. However, almost all of them lack
state-of-the-art sensors and computers that are an essential
part of many contemporary robotic systems. Our platform
includes the state-of-the-art hardware utilized in real-world
robotic vehicles today, while remaining within the budget of
high  schools  participating  in,  e.g.,  the  FIRST  Robotics
Challenge. 
This  paper is  organized as  follows.  In  Section 2,  we
describe  the  open-source  hardware  and  software  of  our
platform. In Section 3, we describe the major activities in
the program and the details of the technical instruction. In
Section  4,  we  provide  the  data  on  the  students’  self-
assessment along with a discussion of the results. We devote
the Section 5 to a discussion on potential opportunities to
extend  this  program  and  its  pedagogy  in  the  future.  We
conclude the paper with remarks in Section 6.
II. HARDWARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE SOFTWARE 
The  hardware  was  initial  developed  for  an  MIT
hackathon in January 2015 by the authors. It was updated
for another hackathon in January 2016. The same version
was  also  used  for  teaching  MIT’s flagship  undergraduate
robotics course. The same robotics hardware was used for
teaching this high-school program. 
Our hardware platform is an exciting autonomy-capable
mini  race  car.  The  fully-assembled  hardware  platform  is
shown in Figure 1. Its most essential components are shown
in Figure 2. The vehicle is based on the 1/10-scale Traxxas
RC Rally Car. We use the vehicle chassis, which one electric
drive motor that drives the wheels, and one electric servo
motor that steers the front wheels. The reported speed of the
Traxxas RC Rally Car is 40 mph. However, throughout this
high-school program, we limited the speed the vehicle to 5
mph through programming the firmware of an open-source
Electronic Speed Controller (ESC), called the VESC [22].

FIGURE III
THE ROBOT OPERATING SYSTEM VISUALIZATION SOFTWARE, RVIZ. 
The main computing element is the Nvidia Jetson Tegra
X1  embedded  supercomputer  (from  here  on  called  the,
Jetson  TX1).  The  Jetson  TX  1  features  a  GP-GPU  that
delivers 1 Teraflops of computation power, using only 10
Watts of electrical power. It also boosts a quad-core Central
Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU is clocked at 2 GHz.
The  hardware  platform  includes  three  main  sensors.
The first  major sensor is  the Structure.io RGB-D camera.
The sensor provides RGB color along with depth. The depth
sensing is based on the structured light method, similar to
the  method  used  by  the  Microsoft  Kinect  sensor.  The
Structure.io  sensor  provides  RGB-D  images  at  the  VGA
resolution (640 by 480 pixels)  at  a rate of  30 frames per
second. It perceives depth in the range of 0.4 to 3.5 meters.
Its  reported accuracy is less than a centimeter at  the 0.4-
meter  range  and  around  3  cm at  the  3-meter  range.  The
second major sensor is the Hokuyo UST10-LX planar laser
range finder. It features one laser range finder element that
rotates at 40 Hz, providing 270-degree field of view at ¼-
degree  resolution.  Finally,  the  third  major  sensor  is  the
Stereolabs  ZED  stereo  camera,  which  provides
synchronized video from cameras. The two images from the
two separate cameras can be utilized to re-construct depth
by  utilizing  standard  stereo  matching  techniques.  The
Stereolabs  SDK  implements  a  semi-global  matching
algorithm that runs on GPU-based computers, such as the
Jetson  TX1.  The  sensor  suite  also  includes  an  inertial
measurement unit, specifically the Sparkfun Razor 9-DOF
IMU. Finally, the open-source electronic speed controller,
called the VESC, allows us to sense the speed of the drive
motor, which is a measurement of the vehicle’s speed. 
These  components  are  arranged  on  two  pieces  of
custom-made plates,  which  were  cut  using  a  laser  cutter.
The lower piece houses the main embedded computer and
the  inertial  measurement  unit.  The  RGB-D  camera  is
mounted on the upper piece. The laser range finder and the
stereo camera are mounted directly on the vehicle chassis.
The main computer runs the Ubuntu Linux operating
system. The computer also runs the Robot Operating System
(ROS). The ROS environment allows robotics software to
be modularized. For instance, the feedback control systems
software, motion planning system software, computer vision
system software, and other perception system software can
be  separated  into  their  own  software  modules.  Each
software  module  is  called  a  “node”.  The  nodes  share
information using “messages.” The ROS environment also
provides tools to visualize data that is being sent between
the nodes. See Figure 3. As seen in the figure, the software
allows the visualization of the sensor data in real time along
with other features. 
We have implemented the various drivers for hardware
integration.  Specifically,  our  team  has  implemented
software that  interfaces with all  sensors and software that
governs  the  VESC.  Our  team  has  also  developed  a
simulation system based on the Gazebo simulator. All this
infrastructure  software  is  made  available  open  source
through  the  following  URL:  http://github.mit.edu/mit-
racecar/.  More  information  about  this  and  other  classes
taught by this platform can be found in the following URL:
http://racecar.mit.edu. 
III. ACADEMIC PROGRAM 
The  academic  program  included  the  following:  (i)
lectures that convey theoretical  underpinnings of robotics,
(ii) laboratory exercises that allow the students to practice
hands-on  skills,  (iii) lectures  on  collaboration  and
communication that help students work in teams, and  (iv)
technical  seminars  that  broaden  the  students’  vision  in
science,  engineering,  research,  entrepreneurship  and
beyond.
The agenda is as follows. Each day starts with a one-
hour  lecture  that  teaches the foundational  the  topics.  The
rest of the day is largely devoted to laboratory exercises that
allows  students  to  practice  hands-on  development  skills.
Each week ends with a mini project.  Near the end of the
week, the students are given time to go through the software
system design exercise, and implement the software for their
projects. The final week of the program is devoted to the
course challenge. During the final week, the lectures focus
on  case  studies.  Instead  of  the  laboratory  exercises,  the
students focus on design and implementation for the course
challenge. 
The technical  program is split  into four modules. We
named  them:  (i) Move,  (ii) Explore,  (iii) Learn,  and  (iv)
Race. Each module takes one week of time to implement,
and they collectively cover the four weeks in this order. The
first three modules provide the basics of robotics, and end
with a mini project. The last module focuses on the course

challenge. 
The  first  module,  which  we  call  Move,  teaches  the
basics of commanding the vehicle actuators, such as steering
and drive motor. The students first learn how to work with
the Robot Operating System and work with the platform. In
particular,  they  learn  how to  acquire  data  from the  laser
range finder, the inertial measurement unit, and the wheel
odometer (through the VESC). Later in the week, they learn
the  basics  of  control  systems  in  the  lectures,  and  they
experiment with the design of PID control systems in the
laboratory exercises. The mini project for this module is to
design and implement a software system for wall-following
drag  racing.  Specifically,  the  students  must  design  a
perception  system  that  detects  the  wall  from  laser  range
finder measurements, and a controller that steers the system
to align with the wall. During the mini race, we start two
cars at the same time side by side, and declare the first car to
finish  as  the  winner. We rank  the  teams in a  tournament
style race. 
The  second  module,  called  Explore,  delves  into
working with cameras.  Specifically, the students learn the
basics of blob detection in images as well as visual servoing
control systems. The project for the week is to design and
implement a software system that drives the robot towards a
fork, detects the color of a marker right at the fork location,
turns right if the marker is green and turns left if the marker
is red. 
FIGURE V
THE SEMINAR SCHEDULE. 
The third module, called Learn, teaches the basics robot
perception and robot motion planning. In the first half of the
week,  the  students  learn  the  basics  of  robot  perception
algorithms,  including  localization  and  mapping.  In  the
second half  of  the  week,  the  students  learn the basics  of
robot motion planning algorithms, such as potential field-
based,  search-based,  and  sampling-based  planners.  The
project  is  to  develop  software  for  a  robotic  vehicle  that
explores its surroundings without colliding with obstacles. 
The final module, called  Race, focuses entirely on the
course challenge. The course challenge includes two main
activities:  Racing  challenge and an exploration challenge.
Both challenges must be completed fully autonomously. 
The race involves the design and implementation of a
software system which allows the vehicle to travel through
the  race  course  as  fast  as  possible.  A picture  of  the  race
course is shown in Figure 6 with cars and students along the
race course. Notice that there is a fork at the top part of the
course. Right at the fork, there is a visual marker. The cars
must detect the marker and make a turn if the marker is red,
drive straight if the marker is green. First, we allow each
team to run their car on the track. We then place multiple
cars on the track at the same time. A view from the race is
shown in Figure 7; Autonomous mini race cars are chasing
each other.
The  exploration  challenge  involves  navigating  in  an
environment  that  is  unknown  a  priori.  The  environment
includes several visual markers framed in a pink frame. The
challenge is to design and implement a software system that
requires  the  robot  to  find  as  many  markers  as  possible
without colliding with obstacles within a fixed amount of
time.

A VIEW FROM THE RACE EVENT. 
The  academic  program  also  features  instruction  on
communication  and  collaboration.  In  these  lectures,  the
students are instructed in forums, where they get a chance to
actively  participate  in  exercises  that  help  them  develop
technical  communication  skills  and  provide  them  an
opportunity to effectively work in teams. 
Finally, the program features  a  one-hour seminars  on
each day. The seminars were given by researchers at MIT as
well as the thriving robotics industry. The seminar schedule
is shown in Figure 5. Each technical seminar is roughly 45
minutes of talk by the speaker and roughly 15 minutes of
questions and answers session. 
IV. ASSESSMENT AND DISCUSSION
In  this  section,  we  report  our  assessment  based  on
student surveys, and our findings after analyzing the data. 
At  the  completion  of  the  course,  the  students  were
asked  to  complete  a  self-assessment  survey.  They  were
asked to evaluate their  the following before and after the
course: 
 Understanding  of  the  Python  programming
language;
 Understanding of the Robot Operating System;
 Understanding of feedback control systems;
 Understanding of image processing;
 Ability  to  integrate  different  technologies  into  a
working systems solution;
 Ability  to  discuss  technical  issues  and  arrive  at
sound decisions with a team;
 Overall ability to contribute effective teamwork.
The ratings correspond to the following: 1.  Very poor;  2.
Somewhat  poor;  3.  Neutral;  4.  Somewhat  good;  5.  Very
good.
The results of the self-assessment survey are shown in
Figure 8. The top figure shows the average rating for each
question; the bottom figure shows the median. Notice that
the students report substantial improvement in every item. 
We  also  conducted  a  self  assessment  survey  of
communication and collaboration skills taught by the class
in  the  middle  of  the  program.  We asked  the  students  to
evaluate  their  interpersonal,  communication  and
collaboration skills, before the course and two weeks after
the  start  of  the  course.  The  ratings  correspond  to  the
following: 1. Very poor; 2. Somewhat poor; 3. Neutral; 4.
Somewhat good; 5. Very good. 
In terms of averages, we observe a slight increase in the
students’ self assessment of these skills two weeks into the
program.  Specifically,  assessment  of  interpersonal  skills
average  raises  from 3.26  to  3.71,  that  of  communication
skills  raises  from 3.36  to  3.78,  and  that  of  collaboration
skills raises from 3.42 to 3.86. In all three categories, the
median  values  are  3  before  the  class,  while  the  median
values improve to 4 after the class.  Hence, most students
report at most “neutral” for these skills before the class; they
report  that  these  skills  improved  to  at  least  “somewhat
good,”  after  the  course.  For  the  reader  to  see  the  slight
improvement individually, we refer the reader to Figure 9.
Several comments are in order. 
First, the students report relatively good programming
skills  (Python  programming)  even  before  starting  the
course; yet, they improve their programming skills over the
course of this program. See Figure 8. The average reported
rating  for  “understanding  of  Python”  is  2.787 before  the
course, and rises to 4.064 after the course; the median rises
from 3  to  4.  We believe  that  the  program contributes  to
students’ programming abilities substantially, even for those
who are good programmers. The students frequently quoted
the  valuable  experience  of  designing  and  implementing
software  to  handle  real-world,  real-time  data,  which  we
believe  was  one  of  the  major  reasons  that  helped  the
students  sharpen  their  programming  and  software
development skills. 
Second, the students report very little understanding of
advanced  robotics  concepts,  such  as  robot  operating
system,  feedback  control  systems,  image  processing,  and
autonomous systems; but, the program allows the students
to  build  these  skills  substantially  in  a  relatively  short
amount of time. Before the course, the average rating ranges
between 1.5 and 2; the medians 1 or 2. Hence, most students
report that their skills in these areas are “poor,” before the
course. After the course, the ratings improve substantially.
Specifically, the average values range between 3.7 and 4.2;
the median values all improve to 4. Hence, most students
rate their skills in these areas as at least “good,” after the
course.  We  believe  that  the  program’s  focus  on  these
advanced  robotics  topics  with  hands-on  practice  in  a
collaborative project-based environment allows the students
to  learn  these  advanced  skills  fairly  well  in  a  very  short
period of time.
Third, even though the students report relatively strong
communication and collaboration skills, we observe that the
reported  assessment  of  these  skills  also  improve  rapidly
throughout the program. Even two weeks into the program,
the students report improvement of these skills, as seen in
Figure 9. By the end of the program, the students report a
significant improvement on complex teamwork skills, such
as “ability to discuss  technical  issues and arrive at  sound
decisions  as  a  team,”  “ability  to  integrate  different
technologies into a working system solution,” and “ability to
contribute  to  effective  teamwork.”  We  believe  that  the
assessment is a consequence of a number of aspects of the
program.  First,  the  program  teaches  a  rigorous  set  of
lectures on communication and collaboration. In forum-style
lectures, the students learn the basics of working in teams.
Second,  the  program  provides  the  students  several
opportunities to practice these skills. Each lab exercise, each
project, and the course challenge are all conducted in teams.
We believe that the lectures and the hands-on practice for
communication and collaboration that is embedded in this
class provides the results we observe in Figures 8 and 9.

AND COLLABORATION SKILLS. 
V. FUTURE PLANS: SUPPORTING ONLINE COURSES 
AND A COMMON HARDWARE PLATFORM
There  is  ample  room  for  improvement,  towards
updating the platform, the technical lectures, the laboratory
exercises, the projects and the course challenge. However,
we believe the most important area for future work is to fill
in the essential ingredients that will allow us to scale this
program up, to reach thousands of high school students.  We
propose two extensions: a set of supporting online courses
and a common hardware platform. We envision the students
will have access to both of these components before coming
to MIT campus for the residential part of the program. In
this section, we describe these extensions in details, and we
survey  some  of  the  relevant  work  in  the  literature
afterwards.
Supporting  Online  Courses: We believe  one  of  the
key  ingredients  is  to  support  the  program  with  online
material that students can work with before they start the
summer program at MIT. The online material will be shaped
into a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) program. The
MOOC  program  will  consist  of  a  few  short  courses,
including programming, software engineering, the basics of
control systems, computer vision and robotics as well as a
set of lectures on communication and collaboration. 
We envision  that  the  students  will  go  through  these
courses  the  academic  year  before  they  come  to  MIT
campus, when they can focus on projects that involve the
design  and  implementation  of  complex  robotics  software
systems. 
These  online  courses  will  include  a  number  of
components: (i) short video lectures which the students can
watch on their own pace, comment on and discuss through
the online forums;  (ii) short technical exercises which are
automatically  graded,  so  that  the  students  can  get  rapid
feedback  on  their  learning  of  the  complex  foundational
concepts;  (iii)  hands-on programming exercises which are
also automatically graded through unit tests;  (iv) hands-on
robotics  software  development  exercises  that  run  on  a
realistic simulation environment or run with real-world data
collected using the experimental platforms,  through which
the students can design and implement relatively complex
robotics  software  systems  and  test  them  on  their  own
computer on their own time and pace. 
The implementation of these components requires the
development  of  a  few  key  platforms. First  is  an online
forum that  is  open  to  all  students  and  instructors.  We
envision this online forum to be used for any question that
relates to the course. The second is an open code repository
that  students and instructors  can share code.  We envision
instructors  to  share the solutions to  various programming
exercises,  software  components  that  students  can  utilize
toward their work as well as certain infrastructure software
such  as  robot  simulation  software.  We envision  that  the
students  will  use  the  code  repository  to  share  work-in-
progress  code  snippets,  their  solutions  to  programming
exercises, and code branches that include their own updates
to the instructors’ software posted in the code repository. We
expect  that  the  students,  will  help  tremendously  in
improving the software developed by the instructors; hence,
it is critical to allow students to provide feedback or even
the  opportunity  to  develop  software  for  the  course  itself.
Thankfully, modern software version tracking tools provide
easy  means  to  implement  this  vision.  Finally, third  is  an
open data repository which the instructors and students can
utilize to share data, either from experiments on the robots
or from the simulation environment. 
Common hardware platform: To further  strengthen
this  program,  we  also  envision  a  common  hardware
platform, such as the mini race car described in Section 2,
which  several  high  schools  have  access  to  even  before
coming to the MIT campus for the residential portion of the
program.  We  believe  that  having  access  to  a  common
platform  will  allow  the  students  download  and  execute
software from the code repository. They will be able to try
software developed by the instructors or the fellow students.
They  will  also  be  able  to  upload  their  data  from  their
experiments  to the common data repository to share with
fellow students and/or ask feedback from the instructors, or
even have the data evaluated by automated data evaluation
software to get  rapid feedback on their latest  experiment.
Furthermore, we believe that access to a common platform
will allow the students from different high schools to work
on  common  projects  by  utilizing  the  online  resources,
specifically the online forums, the open code repository, and
the  open  data  repository.  We  imagine  the  students  will
utilize  state-of-the-art  online  video  conferencing  tools  to
talk to each other and collaborate.  We, as the instructors,
hope to learn from this experience and tightly integrate the
utilization  all  these  remote  collaboration  tools  into  our
teaching of communication and collaboration, as we believe
these  tools  will  be  essential  to  robotics  software  systems
design and development in the coming years. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS
We  presented  a  new  high-school  robotics  program,
called the MIT Beaver Works Robotics  Institute Robotics
Program.  The  program focuses  on  robotics  software,  and
allows the students to design and develop complex software
systems  to  run  on  mini  race  platform.  In  particular,  the
course challenge involves the design and implementation of
software  systems that  allow the  mini  race  car  to  operate
completely autonomously. The program champions project-
based  and  team-oriented  learning.  The  program  was
implemented for the first time in the Summer of 2016 on
MIT campus as  a  four-week residential  program with the
participation of 46 students, 24 of which participated from
outside  of  Massachusetts  and  stayed  in  the  Boston  Area
during this program. The self-assessment suggests that the
students  benefit  in  many  directions  in  terms  of  both
technical and teamwork skills. Our future plans include the
expansion  of  the  platform,  particularly  with  an  online-
supported  teaching,  in  which  the  students  follow  online
classes during the semester building up to the summer to
understand the foundations, and then use their time at MIT
to design and  build complex robotic  software systems.  A
short  video  describing  the  course  can  be  found  in  the

Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine how robotics program developers perceived the role of
emulation of human ethics when programming robots for use in educational settings. A purposive sampling of
online robotics program developer professional sites which focused on the role of emulation of human ethics
used when programming robots for use in educational settings was included in the study. Content related to
robotics program developers’ perceptions on educational uses of robots and ethics were analyzed.
Design/methodology/approach – The design for this study was a qualitative summative content analysis.
The researchers analyzed keywords related to a phenomenon. The phenomenon was the emulation of human
ethics programmed in robots. Articles selected to be analyzed in this study were published by robotics
program developers who focused on robots and ethics in the education. All articles analyzed in this study
were posted online, and the public has complete access to the studies.
Findings – Robotics program developers viewed the importance of situational human ethics interpretations
and implementations. To facilitate flexibility, robotics program developers programmed robots to search
computer-based ethics related research, frameworks and case studies. Robotics program developers
acknowledged the importance of human ethics, but they felt more flexibility was needed in the role of how
classroom human ethical models were created, developed and used. Some robotic program developers
expressed questions and concerns about the implementations of flexible robot ethical accountability levels
and behaviors in the educational setting. Robotics program developers argued that educational robots were
not designed or programmed to emulate human ethics.
Research limitations/implications – One limitation of the study was 32 online, public articles written by
robotics program designers analyzed through qualitative content analysis to find themes and patterns.
In qualitative content analysis studies, findings may not be as generalizable as in quantitative studies.
Another limitation was only a limited number of articles written by robotics programs existed which
addressed robotics and emulation of human ethics in the educational setting.
Practical implications – The significance of this study is the need for a renewed global initiative in
education to promote debates, research and on-going collaboration with scientific leaders on ethics and
programming robots. The implication for education leaders is to provide ongoing professional development
on the role of ethics in education and to create best practices for using robots in education to promote
increased student learning and enhance the teaching process.
Social implications – The implications of this study are global. All cultures will be affected by the robotics’
shift in how students are taught ethical decision making in the educational setting. Robotics program
developers will create computational educational moral models which will replace archetypal educational
ethics frameworks. Because robotics program developers do not classify robots as human, educators, parents
and communities will continue to question the use of robots in educational settings, and they will challenge
robotics ethical dilemmas, moral standards and computational findings. The examination of robotics program
developers’ perspectives through different lens may help close the gap and establish a new understanding
among all stakeholders.
Originality/value – Four university doctoral faculty members conducted this content analysis study.
After discussions on robotics and educational ethics, the researchers discovered a gap in the literature on
the use of robots in the educational setting and the emulation of human ethics in robots. Therefore, to explore

Problem statement
Though scientific leaders strive to make advances robotics at a steady, ongoing pace, these
leaders fail to fully investigate the wide-ranging implications of programming robots to
emulate human ethics, especially in the educational setting (Ashrafian, 2015). Educators
play a significant role in the formation of learner ethical perspectives and models; however,
the ethical effects of the use of robots in education leave unanswered questions
(Kubilinskiene, 2017).
Questions arise related to how ethical standards will be determined and what model will
be used to emulate human ethics. If educational leaders fail to evaluate, monitor and play a
dominant role in the creation of human ethics in robots, negative outcomes as well as some
positive results may influence the determination of ethical standards for future generations
(Hersh, 2014). When researchers’ findings and perceptions related to the use of human ethics
to program robots used to promote learning are not examined, issues and challenges related
to programmed ethics may tend to be underestimated or ignored (Bogue, 2014). Therefore, a
content analysis of robotics program developers’ perceptions on the role of emulation of
human ethics when programming robots for use in educational settings was explored in this
qualitative study.
Purpose statement
The purpose of this qualitative summative content analysis was to examine how robotics
program developers perceived the role of emulation of human ethics when programming
robots for use in educational settings. A purposive sampling of online robotics program
developer professional sites which focused on the role of emulation of human ethics used
when programming robots for use in educational settings was included in the study.
Content related to robotics program developers’ perceptions on educational uses of robots
and ethics were analyzed.
For this study’s purpose, the qualitative summative content analysis was the most
appropriate. In the qualitative method, perceptions on phenomenon are examined, and
content is analyzed to find themes and patterns (Yin, 2003). A summative content analysis
approach is appropriate when little is known about a topic, and the identification
of keywords will be useful in the identification of themes or patterns (Nandy and
Sarvela, 1997). In this study, a content analysis was used to examine keywords related to
the phenomena of emulation of human ethics programmed in robots used in educational
settings. No participants were interviewed. In total, 32 online robotics program developer
professional sites which focused on the role of emulation of human ethics used when
programming robots for use in educational settings were selected, and the content was
analyzed. The phenomena were analyzed to find themes and patterns related to the
perceptions of robotics program developers who shared online findings or implications on
the role of emulating human ethics in robots in educational settings.

After discussions on robotics and educational ethics, the researchers discovered a gap in

ethics in robots. Therefore, to explore the implications for educators, they formed a group to
research the topic to learn more about the topic. No personal gains resulted from the study.
Literature review
Robotics in education
Robotics is a means of maximizing daily used skill sets of collaboration, problem solving,
project management and critical thinking to inspire individuals to get through mundane
tasks at hand (Eguchi, 2015). Robotics in education as a learning tool promotes knowledge
at all levels, and the use of robotics helps engage learners in the learning process.
In the literature, implications for the use of robotics in education include findings to support
the promotion of robotics to develop traits to be successful in a twenty-first century world of
innovators, such as is demanded in a highly driven technology society. Educational robotics
provides an environment conducive to a hands-on learning modality in which students
confront critical thinking scenarios that inspire them to develop new and nontraditional
solutions, tested/validated results using robotics and a cyclical process used to come to
successfully solution/resolutions problems of a more technical nature. Gura (2013)
considered educational robotics to be “the most perfect instructional approach currently
available” (para. 2). However, Gura noted that room for improvements in the learning
environment must be made to accommodate transformation needed to meet twenty-first
century requirement.
Accordingly, the successful adoption of an educational innovation such as the conception
of robotics has enhanced the ability to make meet the true challenges. However, studies on
developing curriculum content and how to incorporate the use of robotics in any educational
framework is limited in the literature. Robotics is only one tool; therefore, the use of robotics
must be aligned with correct theories of learning, educational philosophy, comprehensive
curricula and supportive learning documentation to ensure cohesive and successful
approach (Shannon, 2015). Though limited studies exist on the role of emulation of human
ethics programmed in robots identified educational challenges involved the need to make a
shift from technology usage to collaboration of human intelligence in education while
changing the pedagogy that embraces technology and learning theories, such as
constructivism and constructionism (Kubilinskiene, 2017).
In the literature, the consensus is robotic technologies should not be viewed as ordinary
tools but as tools to promote the development of innovative ways to enhance the learning
environment. Though few studies exist in which educational leaders’ perceptions on the
role of ethics and the use of robotics are investigated, in the literature educators tend to
agree that robotics learners engage in opportunities that enhance critical thinking skills
( Julià and Antolí, 2016). Additionally, educators note the importance of students’
adaptation to a technical inspired society. In existing findings, researchers demonstrated
that students are afforded the opportunity to enhance technical abilities will augmenting
learning strategies and problem solving within the twenty-first century workforce
requirements (Somyürek, 2015).
In existing robotic studies, a paradigm shift from traditional education in which the
curriculum guidance failed to adequately address the needs of technical requirements to the
use of robotics throughout the curriculum is evident. Leaders show how the growth of
robotic use in education changed the educational landscape Rihtarsic et al. (2016). In the
past, educators tended to view the use of technology in the classroom as mechanical
instruments, which were referred to as black box technology. Black box technology is the
128
JRIT&L
11,2
use of computers, laptops or IPods to find information, engage in activities programmed to
provide information, questions and answers. With the advancement of robotics, black box
technology tends to be less effective than white-box technology which is designed to
stimulate higher levels of creativity and engagement than participating in black box
technology (Alimisis, 2012).
Artificial intelligence (AI)
AI is a computer which functions based on human intelligence commonly referred to as AI.
AI focuses on the integration of computer science, mathematics, psychology, cognition and
biology fields. In the literature, an extension number of studies have been conducted on how
AI uses a range of knowledge from these fields to promote the rapid progress of emulation
of human intelligence traits (Nimberka et al., 2016).
Educational ethical standards
Few studies exist on educational leaders and ethical standards. In existing studies, study
findings are limited and not directly related to educators’ perceptions on how ethical
standards are viewed. Additionally, data on the impact of ethical standards on changes in
education are scarce. Though ethical standards are included in policy sections of
handbooks, educational leaders tend to focus on specific legalities rather than on innovative
learning techniques and possible ethical issues related to learning outcomes such as the use
of robotics or AI. Two ethical standards are commonly outlined in most educational
institutes. One area is instructor performance, and the second topic is centered on criminal-
like behaviors (Zirkel, 2014). Generally, in educational institutes, ethical standards are
defined and classified under three umbrellas: civil rights, specific local, state and national
laws, and contractual standards (Umpstead et al., 2013).
Educational ethical frameworks
With the infusion of technology in the 1990s, the educational learning environment changed
rapidly, and educational leaders failed to keep up with the need to review and re-evaluate
ethical issues and challenges related to technological advances and robotics (Bottino, 2016).
Though changes may have included the emulation of human ethics in robots, in the
literature, few studies are focused on ethical issues and the need for updated theoretical and
conceptual frameworks for ethics in education. In the limited number of published studies,
findings are indicators that a need exists for balanced ethical frameworks which address
twenty-first century technological issues and challenges in education (Martinov-Bennie and
Mladenovic, 2015).
Educational leaders tend to select theoretical and conceptual frameworks which include
moral decision-making theories and ethical guidelines that can be adapted for the
educational setting (McBride and Hoffman, 2016). Kitchener (1984) created a decision
making moral principles framework which addresses five basic principle-based guidelines.
The guidelines include focus on individual autonomy, justice for all, caring for others, no
maleficent intentions and trustworthiness. Kitchener’s (1984) principles are highly favored
by educational leaders. Though the framework was created before the emulation of human
ethics was used by robots in educational settings, educators tend to create ethical policies
which are based on Kitchener’s framework (Bates, 2004).
Human ethics in the educational setting
Baxter et al. (2015) identified three areas for research when using robots in the classroom:
Pedagogy: to enhance the teaching environment. Methodology: Try to prevent bias in the
teaching environment caused by inflating children’s expectations prior to the interaction
129
Robotics
emulation of
human ethics
with the robots. Ethics: What are the roles of robots in class? Is the robot a peer or someone
(or something) that cannot be trusted?
What should be the robot behavior in the classroom? Gelin (2013) cited Issacs Asimov
three laws of the robotics suggesting that to be the norm “1 –A robot may not injure a human
being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; 2 – A robot must obey the
orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First
Law; 3 – A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict
with the First or Second Laws” (p. 69). These laws are easy to conceptualize, but programming
robots is not easy, and those expectations can only be accomplished by programming robots
that can act and behave like human beings ( Jordon and McDaniel, 2014).
Ethical considerations for the use of robots in the classroom
The ethical use of robots to teach is an area that merits greater exploration and study.
Since the 1950s and 1960 when B.F. Skinner’s pioneered concepts related to teaching machines
educators have contemplated the efficiencies that a computer or robot might provide to better
optimize student learning in the classroom (Rutherford, 2003). A constant question debated by
roboticists is the extent to which robots should be designed to nudge a user in terms of their
thinking and decision making (Borenstein and Arkin, 2016). For example, researchers have
contemplated the effectiveness of humanoid robots within a socio-cognitive paradigm
intended to support knowledge acquisition, like Skinner’s theory of teaching machines and
programmed instruction, robots can provide forms of feedback and other learning advantages
for students in the classroom (Mazzoni and Benvenuti, 2015).
One recent comparative study of robots in school-based learning found that the use of an
actual humanoid robot in the classroom provided qualitative advantages related to social
impact over just using simulators (Bacivarov and Ilian, 2012). Robots potentially allow
course and training designers to provide the addition of a humanoid embodiment along with
tools for social interaction to the learning context beyond a PC-based computer program. In
addition, anthropomorphic features of humanoid robots along with characteristics related to
repeatability, flexibility and digitization may be engaging as well as motivating to young
students within the classroom (Chih-Wei et al., 2010; Toh et al., 2016; Kazakoff et al., 2013).
The ability of robots to make ethical decisions is also a consideration for their use in
situations that involve humans. For example, when it comes to artificial agents (including
robots) an emerging field of machine ethics has developed around a somewhat elusive goal
of potentially programming ethical patterns of thought into systems that are being
developed (Torrance, 2008). Moreover, roboticists continue to explore the prospect of robots
autonomously making ethical decisions because machines do not have emotions and are
unable to consider the emotions of individuals who may be adversely impacted by their
actions (Anderson and Anderson, 2010).
Method and design appropriateness
Qualitative researchers explore phenomena by trying to make sense of them (Yin, 2003).
In this study, online scholarly researchers’ perceptions of a phenomenon were analyzed.
The quantitative method was not appropriate for this study. Quantitative researchers use
numbers, instead of the examination of phenomena, to investigate the statistical significance
of an event (Yin, 2003).
Unlike in quantitative studies, numbers or statistics would not be significant when a
researcher examines perceptions about an event such as the role of the emulation of human
ethics programmed in robots used in educational settings. The use of numbers would be
appropriate for a quantitative researcher who wanted to begin with a hypotheses and
theories to describe a statistically significant comparison or correlation between types of
robots and ethics.

The design for this study was a qualitative summative content analysis. In summative
content analysis, the researcher analyzes keywords related to a phenomenon (Nandy and
Sarvela, 1997). In this study, the phenomenon was the emulation of human ethics
programmed in robots. Articles selected to be analyzed in this study were published by
robotics program developers who focused on robots and ethics in the education. In 2001,
in the USA, the use of robotics in the educational setting increased. Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematical (STEM) schools were established, and STEM
leaders promoted the adaption and use of robotics in the STEM school curriculum
(Holbrook, 2005). All articles in this study were posted online, and the public has complete
access to the studies.
The case study or phenomenological design were not suitable for this study.
Participants’ perceptions were not examined in this study, and interviews were not
conducted. To identify themes and patterns, the focus was on the analysis of keywords
related to robots and ethics in online articles selected by the researchers. Whereas, case
study researchers examine participants’ perceptions on external events, and
phenomenological researchers explore how participants feel internally about an event
(Yin, 2003). In this study, a range of keywords related to robots and ethics were analyzed.
The sampling method was purposive sampling, and 32 articles were selected for this
study (Weber, 1985). To find themes and patterns, Weber (1985) recommended the use of at
least 30 documents. Researchers conducted an inquiry on scholarly researchers’ perceptions
on the emulation of human ethics programmed in robots used in educational settings.
To obtain perceptions from the selected articles, the content analysis data method was used
to collect data from 30 subjects: 10 in robotics, 12 in ethics and robotics, and 10 in ethics
and robots used in educational settings.
Informed consent form was not appropriate for this qualitative summative content
analysis. The researchers were the primary instrument in this qualitative study. Hsieh and
Shannon (2005) defined qualitative content analysis as an organized approach to cipher
and classify text content and analyze data. The content analysis approach was
purposefully designed to aid the researcher in interpreting words, phrases and sentences
in a subjective manner.
To code content analysis study data, five steps are appropriate (Weber, 1985). In this
study, units to be used for recording such as words, phrases, sentences were established in
the first step, and categories were created in the second step. The third step was the
identification of samples to be used for data coding. During the fourth step, peer debriefing
was used to test themes and pattern agreement. In the fifth step, content analysis was
re-analyzed, and revisions were made.
In this study, the researchers critically read the selected studies and took notes from
each study. Keywords and phrases in each study related to the use of robots and ethics
were carefully noted. For each study, a list was created to show different types of
information discovered. List entries were descriptively categorized, and categories
were closely analyzed to determine whether categories are related and, if so, how.
Related categories were combined, and major themes, as well as minor themes, were
identified. The major and minor themes were compared, and this process was conducted
for each study. When major and minor themes were determined for each study, the major
and minor themes found in each study were collected, compared and contrasted.
Similar major themes were merged, and similar minor themes will be combined. Careful
analysis will be conducted to ensure relevancy and fit. After major and minor themes are
identified, researchers will closely examine the content of the selected studies at least five
times to assure a thorough content analysis.
After the researchers analyze keywords and phrases for themes and patterns, NVIVO10
qualitative software was used to help the researchers identify and organize themes and patterns.

In content analysis studies, triangulation is used for the collection of data from different sources,
such as revision and retesting, use of raw data to compare interpretations of data, varied
observations and member checking (Lincoln and Guba, 1985). This study was triangulated
though rich thematic descriptions. Quotations from articles were used to support themes.
For member checking, researchers re-checked words, phrases, sentences, categories, themes and
patterns for the content analysis of each study included in the study, which means that data in
each study were analyzed by four researchers. After each analysis was completed, researchers
conducted a peer debriefing, which acted as a measure to test agreement on themes and
patterns. The study was not generalizable to other content analysis studies. In a qualitative
study, the sample is small and not as generalizationable as in quantitative studies.
Research question
The central research question was used to guide the study. The qualitative researcher’s
findings at the end of the data collection and data analysis provide answers to the central
research questions and the sub-questions. In this study, the central research question
is as follows:
RQ1. How do robotics program developers perceive the role of emulation of human
ethics when programming robots for use in educational settings?
Open-ended sub-questions will be the following:
RQ1a. How do robotics program developers perceive the role of human ethics?
RQ1b. How do robotics program developers perceive the role of human ethics in
educational settings?
RQ1c. How do robotics program developers perceive the role emulation of human ethics
in robots?
Conceptual framework
Educational leaders are concerned with moral decision making and how to establish ethical
guidelines for all educational stakeholders (McBride and Hoffman, 2016). Kitchener (1984)
created a decision making moral principles framework which addressed five areas. The first
principle deals with the rights of autonomy and how individuals act. In the study,
findings on robotics in education and the emulation of human ethics will be explored.
Themes and patterns that result from content analyses may include themes related to
robotic programmers’ ethical considerations and how the educational community perceive
ethical coding, as well as how students view the role of ethical emulation. Kitchener argued
individuals have the right to act in the way they deem appropriate, unless they impede the
well-being of others.
In the second principle, individuals do not have the right to cause “physical or
psychological harm” to other people (Kitchener, 1984). Articles explored in this study
focused on the role of the reproduction of human ethics in robots used for educational
purposes and psychological implications for students. Robotics program developers’ views
on robots, ethics and dangers of physical harm to students in the classroom were examined.
The third principle is focused on helping other people. Individuals are responsible for the
development and “enhancement of welfare of others” (Kitchener, 1984). In this study, the
examination of robotics program developers’ perceptions provided insights on how ethics
were programmed in robots. Keywords were analyzed to find themes related to specific
categories and outcomes, which included categories on robotic behaviors and data which
influenced ethical decision making.
The Golden Rule is the basis for the fourth principle. All people must be treated fairly
and equally (Kitchener, 1984). The role of human ethical imitations in robots used in
132
JRIT&L
11,2
education may be a theme that results in this study. Equality is an ethical goal included
in educational mission statements, and the role of fairness and the use of robotics in the
classroom may be examined by researchers. If equality for all students is not a resulting
theme, educational leaders may use the study as a guideline to re-evaluate mission
statements and the use of robots in the classroom.
Trust is the foundation for the last principle. All persons must respect others, be truthful
and seek to keep their words (Kitchener, 1984). When robotics is used in the educational
classroom, educational leaders must trust robotic program developers who create
ethical standards for robotic-based learning. How trust is perceived was a pattern which
arose in the content analyses of this study.
The principles are idealist; however, in real world ethical situations, issues and dilemmas
are constantly in flux. No constant standards can be maintained. Thus, applications may
vary, and principles may be forsaken if a “higher moral purpose” is sought (Kitchener, 1984).
Based on educators’ lack of knowledge on ethical designs for programming robots, leaders
may need to analyze each moral principle area to evaluate which principles may need
enhancement, clarification or a new direction when considering ethical standards for the
emulation of human ethics programmed in robots used in educational settings.
Findings
Theme 1: computational educational moral agents verses human educational moral agents
Theme 1 was computational educational moral agents verse human educational moral
agents. In this study, robotics program developers agreed that educational robots were
moral agents who made moral judgments based on a multitude of collected right and wrong
ideas. Robotics program developers defined the educational robotic moral agent model as
“a moral decision-making procedure modeled by a computational process.” During the
moral decision process, educational robots are designed to search a wide range of online
research-based frameworks and accountability levels, and highly effective moral decisions
are made by matching individual situations to research-based data. Other programmers
defined educational robots “[…] as better moral creatures which can make decisions more
consistently that humans.” A third of the robotics program developers contended robots
used in the educational setting act as reliable data-based moral agents who lack inclinations
to make ethics decisions based on cultural bias. One developer explained the differences
between robots and human educators by noting that “age, ethnicity, educational levels,
gender and personal preferences play major roles in how humans view themselves as moral
agents.” Computational educational moral agents verse human educational moral agent
theme was a major argument which influenced robotics program developers’ perceptions on
the use of robots in educational setting and the emulation of human ethics.
The robotics moral agent model decision-making process espouses rational, unbiased
decision making. In the computational educational moral agents’ model, robotics program
developers found that educational robots minimized possibilities of personal or cultural
influences. According to one programmer, “Unlike human-based ethics, robot computational
moral reasoning decisions generate from globally recognized and accepted philosophical,
educational, and psychological critical thinking and problem-solving frameworks.” In the
computational moral education agent model, educational robotics program developers tend
to eliminate human-based ethical decision making based on personal choices and
environmental influences.
Robots as bias free moral agents will affect how future generations view ethics. One
programmer posited robotics educational program developers “are actually changing society,”
and the robotics moral agent change model will determine how ethics are taught in
educational settings. To help developers understand the impact of the computational moral
agent model, other programmers suggested that educators should work in conjunction with
133
Robotics
emulation of
human ethics
computer science and robotics education program developers to teach those educators a basic
understanding of human ethics. Unbiased robots acting as moral agents will act as
generational change agents.
Though the question of robotic moral agency and status raises questions for educators,
benefits of using robots in educational settings outweigh the concerns. One group of
programmers outlined the potential benefits of robots acting as moral agents to support
both individual and collaborative learning activities exceeds concerns related to traditional,
often non-situational, educational more agent frameworks. Robotics program developers
acknowledged educators’ questions related to the ability of robots to make teacher decisions
and control children’s behaviors in the classroom. However, given the vast array of case
studies and research from which robots made decisions, robotics program developers
perceived robot teachers as being highly capable of moral decision making.
Theme 2: perceived lack of robotics accountability
Theme 2 focused on a perceived lack of robotics accountability needed to maintain ethical
standards and privacy in the educational setting. Because computational searches involve
data-based searches of an infinite amount of material, robotics educational program
developers noted that they do not attempt to design, regulate or monitor specific robotic
accountability levels. After reflecting on how robotics accountability levels, one
programmer pondered that an ongoing question which robotics program developers must
consider is in terms of accountability “Can the robot be used as a form of human
replacement in the classroom?” When discussing accountability and privacy classroom
concerns related to vulnerable populations such as the poor or disabled, other programmers
asked a similar question. Summing up robotics program developers concerns on the
perceived lack of robotic accountability and privacy, a programmer noted that information
stored on robots might be “subsequently accessed by others.” Robotics program developers
recognize developers must continue to ask questions and monitor how accountability and
privacy levels are perceived.
In robotics, accountability is based on predetermined rigid scales. Educational robotics
program developers indicated computational ethics robots are programed to utilize
flexible, situational moral agency skills. Several programmers posited robotic brains rely
on basic problem solving and critical thinking accountability models, and educational
robotic ethical accountability depends on outcomes supported by computational
theoretical frameworks, case studies and research-based studies searches. Another
programmer noted human are “accountable for actions taken and having the ability to
individually make right and wrong decisions.” When educators perceive robots in human
terms, accountability levels appear diminished.
Lingering, unanswered accountability questions and educator perceptions on the
importance of establishing accountability levels create concerns about the use of robots in
the educational setting. Robotics developers identified specific questions of concern, and
they acknowledged why educators perceived a possible lack of accountability.
One programmer agreed that in the classroom “ethical regulations and traceability of
robot actions is of concern.” Because robotics program developers program robots to serve
as classroom tutors, tools or peers, F7 believed the answer to the question that asks,
“Who will bear ethical and social responsibility for robot behaviors” has not been
determined. Ongoing, unanswered accountability questions increase concerns related to the
use of robots in classrooms.
Designs of robots used in the classroom impact accountability perceptions. Robotic
program developers perceive a positive relationship between classroom robots and
students. F29 explained, “Computationally, educational robots are designed to appear
as if they understand and care for learners and masquerade as friends and companions”
134
JRIT&L
11,2
by promoting appropriate social and ethical behaviors. Because robots are programmed
to emulate caring, ethical behaviors, students tend to perceive a genuine affection.
F12 emphasized that “children tend to form strong attachments to robot companions and
robot teachers.” Learners’ positive perceptions and attachments to robots create a high level
of accountability expectations.
Theme 3: robots as non-human
The third theme was robots as non-human. Traditionally, educational ethics are defined by
a set of rules established for all stakeholders in all situations. Robotics program developers
visualized the role of ethics through a different lens. Programmers emphasized that “robots
are not humans,” and robotics objectives are not based on the emulation of human
educational ethics. F16 firmly acknowledged that robots emulate ethics based on a
“multitude of research, theoretical frameworks, and case study situations.” Robotics
program developers believed the use of the computational process stimulated increased
flexibility in ethical decision making. F9 noted a need for ethical decision making which is
“flexible in a changeable environment.” Robotic program developers perceived a need for a
more flexible ethical decision-making process.
Emulation of human ethics to program non-human robots used in the educational setting
is not a robotics program developers’ objective. To help educators understand the focus on
non-human ethical objectives, robotics programmers created “roboethics” roadmaps for
educators. According to F25, the roadmaps will “provide a systematic assessment of the
ethical issues involved in Robotics R&D, increase understanding of the problems at stake,
and promote further studying and transdisciplinary research.” Robotics program
developers recognize that robots are non-human, and the emulation of human ethics does
not meet robotic objectives.
Non-human moral agents play a distinct and needed role in the educational setting.
Robotic developers argued the importance non-human robotics moral agency. F11 posited,
“Robot ethics depends upon the notion that robots might in some sense be moral agents in
their own rights.” Educational robots are accountable for recognizing, synthesizing, and
processing well-known and highly appraised models which are the most appropriate for
ethical situations. The role of non-human moral agents in educational settings is a role
which robots can fulfill.
Findings summary
The study findings answered the main research question. The main research question is
as follows:
RQ1. How do robotics program developers perceive the role of emulation of human
ethics when programming robots for use in educational settings?
Robotic program developers perceived robots in the educational setting as non-human
moral agents. Therefore, the role of robotic program developers was not to emulate human
ethics in the educational setting. Robotics program developers viewed the need for flexible
ethical decision making in the educational setting, and, to avoid the emulation of human
ethics, they perceived the role of robots was to use a multitude of data base searches of
research, theoretical frameworks and case studies for ethical decision making.
The findings addressed RQ1a. Robotics program developers viewed the importance of
situational human ethics interpretations and implementations. To facilitate flexibility,
robotics program developers programmed robots to search computer-based ethics-related
research, frameworks and case studies.
For the second sub-question, RQ1b, robotics program developers acknowledged the
importance of human ethics, but they felt more flexibility was needed in the role of how
135
Robotics
emulation of
human ethics
classroom human ethical models were created, developed and used. However, some robotic
program developers expressed questions and concerns about the implementations of
flexible robot ethical accountability levels and behaviors in the educational setting.
In response to the last sub-question on how robotics program developers perceive the
role emulation of human ethics in robots, robotics program developers did not perceive that
a role existed. Robotics program developers argued that educational robots were not
designed or programmed to emulate human ethics.
Limitations, significance and implications of study
One limitation of the study was 32 online, public articles written by robotics program
designers were analyzed through qualitative content analysis to find themes and patterns.
In qualitative content analysis studies, findings may not be as generalizable as in
quantitative studies. Another limitation was only a limited number of articles written by
robotics programs existed which addressed robotics and emulation of human ethics in the
educational setting.
The significance of this study is the need for a renewed global initiative in education to
promote debates, research and on-going collaboration with scientific leaders on ethics and
programming robots. The implication for education leaders is to provide ongoing
professional development on the role of ethics in education and to create best practices for
using robots in education to promote increased student learning and enhance the teaching
process (Vollmer et al., 2016).
Traditional and widely accepted educational conceptual frameworks are idealistic, and
ethical models related to the use of robotics are non-existent (Hersh, 2014). Educational
leaders must initiate a change program which will include the re-evaluation of mission
statements and the possible implications of the role of emulation of human ethics by robots
used in the education setting. During the re-evaluation, issues of possible “physical or
psychological harm” to students and the learning community must be examined, as well as
how the use of robots by educators may benefit learners (Kitchener, 1984).
Change programs must include all stakeholders who understand the need for
investigating and establishing high levels of expectations for the emulation of human ethics
by robots. Leaders must convince stakeholders that a moral reason for change is needed,
and leaders must demonstrate how change will benefit global educational leaders,
instructors, students, parents, the community and robotic programmers. A trusting
foundation for collaboration among all stakeholders, including robotic programmers, must
be built, and methods for on-going communications must be established and developed
(Fullan, 2006).
The implications of this study are global. All cultures will be affected by the robotics’
shift in how students are taught ethical decision making in the educational setting. Robotics
program developers will create computational educational moral models which will replace
archetypal educational ethics frameworks. Because robotics program developers do not
classify robots as human, educators, parents and communities will continue to question the
use of robots in educational settings, and they will challenge robotics ethical dilemmas,
moral standards and computational findings. The examination of robotics program
developers’ perspectives through different lens may help close the gap and establish a new
understanding among all stakeholders (Borenstein and Arkin, 2016).

A purposive sampling of online robotics program developer professional sites which focused on the role of emulation of human ethics used when programming robots for use in educational settings was included in the study. Content related to robotics program developers’ perceptions on educational uses of robots and ethics were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach - The design for this study was a qualitative summative content analysis. The researchers analyzed keywords related to a phenomenon. The phenomenon was the emulation of human ethics programmed in robots. Articles selected to be analyzed in this study were published by robotics program developers who focused on robots and ethics in the education. All articles analyzed in this study were posted online, and the public has complete access to the studies. Findings - Robotics program developers viewed the importance of situational human ethics interpretations and implementations. To facilitate flexibility, robotics program developers programmed robots to search computer-based ethics related research, frameworks and case studies. Robotics program developers acknowledged the importance of human ethics, but they felt more flexibility was needed in the role of how classroom human ethical models were created, developed and used. Some robotic program developers expressed questions and concerns about the implementations of flexible robot ethical accountability levels and behaviors in the educational setting. Robotics program developers argued that educational robots were not designed or programmed to emulate human ethics. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of the study was 32 online, public articles written by robotics program designers analyzed through qualitative content analysis to find themes and patterns. In qualitative content analysis studies, findings may not be as generalizable as in quantitative studies. Another limitation was only a limited number of articles written by robotics programs existed which addressed robotics and emulation of human ethics in the educational setting. Practical implications - The significance of this study is the need for a renewed global initiative in education to promote debates, research and on-going collaboration with scientific leaders on ethics and programming robots. The implication for education leaders is to provide ongoing professional development on the role of ethics in education and to create best practices for using robots in education to promote increased student learning and enhance the teaching process. Social implications - The implications of this study are global. All cultures will be affected by the robotics’ shift in how students are taught ethical decision making in the educational setting. Robotics program developers will create computational educational moral models which will replace archetypal educational ethics frameworks. Because robotics program developers do not classify robots as human, educators, parents and communities will continue to question the use of robots in educational settings, and they will challenge robotics ethical dilemmas, moral standards and computational findings. The examination of robotics program developers’ perspectives through different lens may help close the gap and establish a new understanding among all stakeholders. Originality/value - Four university doctoral faculty members conducted this content analysis study. After discussions on robotics and educational ethics, the researchers discovered a gap in the literature on the use of robots in the educational setting and the emulation of human ethics in robots. Therefore, to explore the implications for educators, the researchers formed a group to research the topic to learn more about the topic. No personal gains resulted from the study. All research was original. All cultures will be affected by the robotics’ shift in how students are taught ethical decision making in the educational setting. Robotics program developers will create computational educational moral models which will replace archetypal educational ethics frameworks. Because robotics program developers do not classify robots as human, educators, parents and communities will continue to question the use of robots in educational settings, and they will challenge robotics ethical dilemmas, moral standards, and computational findings. The examination of robotics program developers’ perspectives through different lens may help close the gap and establish a new understanding among all stakeholders","['article', 'Education', 'Ethics', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Robots', 'Emulation of human ethics', 'Robotics program developers', 'Theory and practice of education', 'LB5-3640']",disabled

Abstract 
Robotics education places a premium on self-directed learning 
and teamwork. In the education system in Albania, however, 
these qualities have not been emphasized in the classroom. This 
project sought to engage students in robotics at the Harry Fultz 
Institute in Tirana and to assess the feasibility of  expanding 
robotics in schools in the Tirana region. We mentored six 
student teams in the robotics club to design and build robots for 
a competition. This was accomplished by developing lectures 
on the fundamentals of  robotics, helping the students apply 
these topics to their robots, and encouraging students to reflect 
on their progress with their teammates to recognize the skills 
they developed.

Authorship 
This report is the result of  the hard work of  each member of  
our team, and we are proud of  what we have produced. For 
each section of  our report, we, together, outlined the broad 
topics that we wanted to address. We would then divide up the 
sections and draft them to the best of  our ability. Once a 
member had finished their section, we exchanged sections with 
another member for primary editing. This process would 
continue until each member of  our team had read through and 
edited each section individually. From this point, we would each 
start from the beginning of  the section and read through every 
part, editing and ensuring that all desired topics were 
addressed, that everything flowed, and that sections made sense 
from start to finish. Google Docs was utilized for the drafting of  
this report, as the suggesting mode kept all initial edits for later 
approval by secondary or tertiary editors. We believe that, 
through this process, this report incorporates the voices and 
writing styles of  each member of  our team.

Executive Summary 
Goals 
 Our primary goal was to engage students in 
the robotics club at the Harry Fultz Institute in a 
robotics competition in order to promote creativi-
ty, communication, problem-solving skills, and 
teamwork throughout the six weeks of self-
directed learning in which the students had to de-
sign, build, and program their robots. 
 Despite our initial limited experience as 
teachers and mentors, we intended to get to know 
the students and learn more about their perspec-
tives, thoughts, and attitudes. By getting to know 
the students, we were able to adapt our lecture 
styles to more effectively connect to the students 
and help them get the most out of the learning ex-
perience.  Our group also assessed the interest in, 
feasibility of, and resources available for furthering 
robotics education throughout Tirana. 
Objectives 
Design an engaging and interactive 
educational experience through lec-
tures and mentoring in preparation 
for a competition 
 Our teaching was based in part on the 
lesson plans and recommendations from the pre-
vious three WPI project groups involved with the 
robotics club.  We presented short, introductory 
lectures at the start of each class.  These lectures 
contained necessary information for the students 
to gain a better understanding of robotics each 
day, as we introduced more components. We 
kept lectures brief in order to maintain student 
attention while introducing topics and ideas to 
the students who could then ask further ques-
tions during the rest of the club time. This meth-
od of teaching was based on the 
findings of the 2014 Harry Fultz 
IQP group which concluded 
that the most effective way to 
teach the club students was to 
work as their mentors by help-
ing them when difficulties arise, 
while allowing them enough 
room to research, fail, and prob-
lem-solve on their own. 
 The game we selected 
for this year’s competition at the 
Harry Fultz Institute adapted the 
2007 Savage Soccer game manu-
al and utilized badminton birdies 
as well as a size-four soccer ball 
as game objects.  Thus, the ten 
students that had been part of 
the club last year were unable to reuse the same 
mechanisms that they had developed to pick up 
the ping pong balls, allowing each team to begin 
on even ground.   
Assess student teamwork and encour-
age reflection 
 We often prompted the students to reflect 
and identify how their interests changed or skills 
developed through their experience in the club. 
Through ongoing interaction with the students 
while teaching the lecture material, assisting stu-
dents with problems, or performing other duties, 
we were able to observe student interactions and 
gauge the students’ feelings about their team.. Fur-
ther, by providing weekly surveys that prompted 
students to reflect on the lectures of the past week, 
we were able to determine how beneficial each lec-
ture was for the teams, helping us to become better 
mentors. 
 In order to improve our abilities to teach, 
mentor, and communicate with people of a differ-
ent culture, each member of our group kept a jour-
nal which highlighted the successes, failures, as 
well as personal and student motivations on a day 
to day basis.  Furthermore, as small details tend to 
get lost over time,  these journal entries helped us 
to note findings that could pertain and prove use-
ful to other project objectives. 
Explore feasibility of expansion of ro-
botics education in Albania 
 One way to expand the benefits of a robot-
ics competition is not only to take steps to ensure 
it continues in the years to come at the Harry Fultz 
Institute, but also to expand and encourage other

Executive Summary 
schools in the greater Tirana region to participate 
in robotics education. We assessed the resources 
and opportunities available in Albania to facilitate 
the expansion of robotics through a series of inter-
views with various individuals and organizations. 
Key Findings 
 The students were engaged in a fun and 
challenging way through the competition; however, 
the implementation of VEX parts this year reduced 
some challenge in order to maximize the time stu-
dents had to embrace the engineering design pro-
cess.  By making it easier for the students to iterate 
through different designs and get creative, they 
built unique robots. While the competition was a 
critical milestone for this project, it’s important to 
emphasize that it was only one part of this project. 
The five weeks of teaching robotics topics, men-
toring students, and preparing them for the com-
petition were the catalyst allowing us to study the 
larger questions of this project: namely the effects 
of mentoring, student engagement, and student 
teamwork. 
Mentoring 
 Mentors must be ready to adapt to the 
changing ideas, plans, and directions with which 
the students wish to take their projects.  One of 
our highest priorities throughout the course of 
this project was to better relate and understand 
the students in order to become better teachers 
and mentors for them. We found that it was ini-
tially difficult to maintain the students’ attention 
during lectures, especially given that each student 
specialized in a particular field (electronics, pro-
gramming, design). This meant that if we lectured 
about programming, the two thirds of the class 
that was not specialized in software would not 
pay attention. However, after we got to know 
them better, we began weaving humor into lec-
tures and surveys. This lead to a significant in-
crease in attentiveness from the students, includ-
ing those who were not specialized in that day’s 
topic. 
Student Engagement, Teamwork, 
and Collaboration 
 We were concerned students were not 
communicating or getting a full robotics experi-
ence due to their unwillingness to move beyond 
their particular specializations and take on other 
aspects of robotics necessary for the competi-
tion.  As the competition drew closer, and stu-
dents became more familiar with the concept of 
robotics as a singular topic rather than three sep-
arate specializations, team members worked out-
side of their specializations more often. 
 Due to differences in students’ schedules 
and obligations, some teammates were less in-
volved than others.  The smaller number of stu-
dents that attended the extra hours of club time 
promoted inter-team collaboration as we observed 
students discussing their ideas and asking each oth-
er for help. Teams came to each other’s aid in the 
weeks before the competition. 
 
Feasibility of Education Expansion 
 Robotics is a complex subject with many 
contributing factors, and expanding robotics edu-
cation is equally complex.  We compared key com-
ponents and relationships that support robotics 
education, teams, and competitions in the USA to 
the current state of robotics in Albania. In our ex-
perience, these key components include education, 
interest, facilitation, and goals.  Robotics teams 
receive necessary education from coaches, teach-
ers, or mentors- who may be alumni of the team or 
supplied by a sponsoring organization.  Teams 
then stimulate interest through various outreach 
programs and activities which help recruit new 
members as well as generate funding.  This funding
- which can come from one time donors, compa-
nies, organizations, or even the government- along 
with the aid of the school administration, helps to 
provide the team with essential materials and space 
in which to work.  Finally, teams and their constit-
uent members typically have a goal for joining 
teams, which can come in the form of competi-
tions, opportunities to enroll in institutions of 
higher education, or potential internships.   
 This current framework to support robot-
ics teams in the United States relies on several key 
stakeholders, including, but not limited to, various 
levels of the government, school administrations, 
local technology-focused companies, and stu-
dents.  In addition to the United States federal tax

Executive Summary 
code incentivizing companies and individuals to 
provide routine donations to organizations such as 
student teams, government organizations some-
times, in our experience, provide grants that assist 
with the acquisition of necessary parts and materi-
als. 
 In our research, we identified several key 
missing components from the baseline structure 
that hinder robotics in the Tirana region.  These 
missing components include a shortage of local 
technology-focused businesses, a lack of motiva-
tion for such businesses to support local programs, 
and limited higher education and career outlets for 
student interests as well as a high import tax on 
essential materials.  Currently, a 20% tariff is im-
posed on imported electronic materials, which dis-
suade many from purchasing these components, 
and the Albanian tax code does not encourage 
charitable actions in the same fashion as its Ameri-
can counterpart. 
Conclusions 
Limitations 
 Our surveys were certainly flawed, as they 
failed to trigger more reflective responses among 
the students. We were frustrated throughout the 
course of the club by the limited time to explore 
the students’ feelings about the opportunity or en-
vironment of the robotics club.  Because the stu-
dents had less than six weeks to design and finish 
their robots, much more club time was spent fo-
cusing on the physical products instead of the ef-
fects on the students’ thoughts about the develop-
ment of their skills or desires to continue their 
development.  We wanted to maintain a more 
professional mentor-mentee relationship 
with the students, and we did not meet with the 
students outside of the classroom, which further 
lessened the time we had to connect with and 
understand the students. Admittedly, our own 
limitations in part are what kept us from meeting 
with the students outside the club, as the thought 
of maintaining two separate relationships- one 
that was professional and one that was friendly- 
made us nervous. We did not know how it would 
affect our classroom dynamic, and we did not 
want to risk it. 
Recommendations 
 We recommend that the Harry Fultz In-
stitute establishes a VEX robotics competition 
team in the near future.  With the metal kits and 
parts provided to the robotics club this year, as 
well as with the VEX robotics curriculum and 
lessons that are available online, the Harry Fultz 
Institute is well situated to begin the transition 
into starting a team and participating in VEX 
competitions.  In order to set robotics education in 
motion in Tirana, we recommend reaching out to 
organizations outside of Albania, such as the U.S. 
Agency for International Development (USAID), 
the Peace Corps, or a similar European non-profit 
to sponsor events that may raise awareness and 
funding. 
Ethics 
 The primary ethical concerns for this pro-
ject involve providing an opportunity for students 
to engage in STEM in a country where such op-
portunities for students that want to pursue it are 
lacking beyond high school.  We hoped to instill a 
passion for robotics, but we did not want our work 
to lead students at Harry Fultz Institute to feel 
frustrated by emphasizing a lack of local oppor-
tunity for them, and a world of opportunity for us. 
During our time here, we have noted for whom 
robotics education is accessible, and for the most 
part, it seems that it’s available to students at pri-
vate schools receiving specialized educations, such 
as at the Harry Fultz Institute or Tirana Interna-
tional School.  Robotics education should be of-
fered not only to those that have the resources to 
attend such schools. For these reasons, we hope 
our interviews created the beginnings of a conver-
sation among students, schools, and organizations 
that will stimulate the growth of robotics education 
within Albania.

future and teaching children how to turn frustration into innovation.”

2 Chapter 1: Introduction 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
Math (STEM) related fields are becoming increas-
ingly important as technologies advance world-
wide.  In order to facilitate the growing importance 
of technology, STEM and robotics (a multidiscipli-
nary application of STEM) education have become 
increasingly prevalent in today’s schools around 
the world (Higher Education in Science and Engi-
neering, n.d.).  This is due to the fact that STEM 
education, especially in conjunction with programs 
such as robotics competitions, can have a signifi-
cant impact on students’ perception of technology 
related fields (Yawson, 2016).  The nature of ro-
botics competitions provides students with hands-
on experience in STEM education as well as expe-
rience working in a team to achieve a common 
goal.  Robotics competitions also stimulate the 
long term and muscle memory, helping students to 
better retain the educational material taught 
(Kyere, 2017; Ingmire, Jann 2015) . In many coun-
tries, such as the United States, STEM education is 
often closely incorporated with projects and vari-
ous other hands-on experiences such as robotics 
competitions.  “There is evidence to suggest that 
consulting students about their perceptions of sci-
ence and their school science education can en-
hance their motivation, contribute to the develop-
ment of a wider range of teaching strategies and, 
thereby, help raise levels of student attainment in 
science” (Jenkins, 2006, p. 78).  Robotics competi-
tions, have been shown to increase student self-
confidence, general education achievement, inter-
est in STEM based education and careers, as well 
as career “soft-skills” such as communicating, pub-
lic speaking, fundraising, and time-management 
(“Robotics Competitions: Building A Generation 
of Innovators”, 2017; VEX Robotics: Inspiring 
and Preparing Students for STEM Careers, 2011; 
Rider, 2013) 
 The Albanian education system, however, 
is primarily focused on teaching through the use 
of formal lectures with less emphasis on student 
interaction or cooperation.  A 2010 study of over 
300 Albanian high schools found that a typical 
forty-five-minute lesson was dominated by teach-
ers, who lectured for over 70% of the time, re-
gardless of the subject matter with minimal student 
initiated interaction (Sahlberg, 2010).  Due to the 
nature of lecture-style teaching, most students are 
rarely given the opportunity to apply the 
knowledge that they gain in the classroom to real 
world situations or multi-disciplinary exercises 
such as STEM and robotics activities.  One of the 
objectives of the project outlined in this document 
was to explore the possibilities for expanding ro-
botics education to a variety of schools and institu-
“Technology is kind of the future for every country.  Either you produce this workforce, and you 
use the intellectual power to go on, or you end.” -Professor Moisi Xhaferaj

tions throughout the greater Tirana area. 
 The technical high school at the Harry 
Fultz Institute in Tirana, Albania has already begun 
implementing robotics to better student learning in 
STEM education.  Through the ongoing develop-
ment of a robotics club, students at the Harry 
Fultz Institute are able to apply knowledge they 
learned in the classroom to build a functioning ro-
bot that can participate in a final culminating com-
petition.  The robotics club at the Harry Fultz In-
stitute was founded in 2014 by Professor Enxhi 
Jaupi and supported by students from Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute (WPI).  As part of their Inter-
active Qualifying Project (IQP), these and succes-
sive cohorts of WPI students helped Professor 
Jaupi by mentoring students and providing com-
prehensive lessons to complement the curriculum 
already present at the Harry Fultz Institute.  In 
2014, students used Lego Mindstorm NXT kits 
to understand the basics of robotics, such as pro-
gramming and mechanical design (Hunt, 
McQuaid, Sussman, Tomko, 2014).  The project 
has evolved over the years to permit students to 
use materials beyond the NXT kits in order to 
build robots ranging from a hexacopter drone to 
an autonomous rover (Jacobsohn, Landis, Pont-
briant, & Schifilliti, 2015).  By 2016, students in 
the robotics club were building robots to com-
pete in a Savage Soccer style robotics competi-
tion.  From introducing robotics topics to imple-
menting a competition, the club’s development is 
ongoing, and has made a lot of progress in the past 
three years. 
 The ultimate goal for the robotics club at 
the Harry Fultz Institute is to provide an engaging 
learning experience on the various aspects of ro-
botics.  This year, the club once again culminated 
in a competition which encouraged students to 
internalize the basic robotics knowledge they have 
learned and apply it as best they could while coop-
erating with and competing against other 
teams.  Using a robotics competition as the basis 
of the club allowed students to learn from each 
other and gain confidence as well as professional 
skills that will be helpful later in their careers.

Chapter 2: Background 5 
2.1 Hands-On Learning: Effects 
On Student Learning 
 Project based and hands-on learning has 
been shown in numerous studies to help students 
excel above those that follow traditional lecture-
based curriculum (Ates and Eryilmaz, 2011).  This 
is due to the fact that by allowing students to phys-
ically interact with the topic of a lecture, they uti-
lize long-term muscle memory to retain infor-
mation, while straight lecture based teaching utiliz-
es short term memory, reinforcing certain topics 
repeatedly to ensure that it is retained (Kyere, 
2017).  This was further emphasized in a 2015 
study in which students who participated in hands-
on classes were shown to later have significant ac-
tivity in the sensory and motor-related areas of the 
brain when they thought about the topics covered 
in class (Ingmire, Jann 2015).  Additionally, hands-
on activities provide a more enjoyable and engag-
ing learning experience for students.  This was em-
phasized in a study of a robotics competition at the 
Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New 
Jersey which stated that “the results from the first 
three offerings of the [robotics] course have been 
overwhelmingly positive.  The students really en-
joyed and preferred the hands-on labs and open-
ended final project over a traditional lecture-only 
course” (Cappelleri, 2013).  Hands-on activities 
have been proven to overall help students to better 
learn and engage in topics related to STEM and 
robotics. 
 Robotics competitions are a form of    
hands-on learning which has been embraced 
around the world to teach students engineering 
and technology (Robot Events, n.d.).  These com-
petitions are typically structured such that students 
are given a task to complete yet are not instructed 
on how to complete it.  This forces students to 
band together in teams to overcome each chal-
lenge they face while problem solving their way 
to success.  John Bugay, a mentor on a robotics 
competition in New Jersey with industry experi-
ence, utilized a robotics competition to provide 
students with guidance in project management, a 
skill not often taught in high school.  According 
to Bugay, building a robot applies all the topics 
taught in project management school, making a 
robotics competition an excellent opportunity for 
students to learn about all the components and 
coordination that is necessary for the success of a 
project (Rider, 2013). As seen in figure 6, in order 
for students to get the most out of such a learn-
ing situation, they must be in an environment 
that promotes motivation.  Students may per-
form tasks, but the amount of effort they put in-
to the tasks depends on their motivation, which 
can be highly influenced by the presence of a com-
petition.  Students must be provided with general 
training that makes them feel qualified to build 
their robots, but they must also be in an environ-
ment where their final product will be shared with 
and compete against those of others. Participation 
in a robotics competition is a critical part of in-
creasing student motivation to a point where they 
are likely to see the value in their experiences and 
learn the most (Bazylev, Margun, Zimenko, Krem-
lev, & Rukujzha, 2014).

2.2 Evaluating the Structure of a 
Typical Albanian Classroom 
 Today’s students are tomorrow’s work-
force.  In the words of Ray Kelly, CEO of Certi-
port, “As technology has become pervasive in the 
classroom and the workplace, solid technology 
skills are essential for every student” (Caron, 
2011).  This statement was further emphasized in a 
2014 analysis of the Albanian workforce in which 
over 35% of Albanian firms that acquired new 
technology cited the lack of an educated workforce 
as one of their major constraints in success 
(European Union, 2014), showing that the quality 
of a students education is primarily linked to their 
effect in the workforce.  In Albania, students 
progress through primary and middle school for 
the first eight years of their educational careers 
before being faced with a choice: to enroll in a 
general education secondary school- called 
“regular” schooling by native Albanians- or in 
vocational schools.  Regular schooling takes three 
years to complete, with the primary focus of en-
rolling in a university or other higher education 
institution after graduation.  Vocational schools, 
on the other hand, may take anywhere from two 
to five years depending on the level of degree the 
student would like to achieve.  Upon graduating 
from such a school, students can then enter di-
rectly into the workforce, if they wish, or contin-
ue onto a technical college for further education in 
their field (“Education System in Albania”, 2012).   
 Numerous reports state that the current 
Albanian education system is primarily focused on 
theoretical knowledge which is rarely applied with 
hands-on problems during class time (Gjokutaj, 
M., Dr., 2013).   For instance, Sahlberg (2010) 
found that a typical forty-five-minute lesson in Al-
banian high schools, regardless of the subject mat-
ter, was typically dominated by teachers lecturing 
with minimal student-to-student interaction or stu-
dent-initiated discussions.  This was further backed 
up by a 2013 report which stated that classes tend 
to be “conceptually overloaded and theoretic [in] 
character” (Gjokutaj, M., Dr., 2013), likely because, 
as found in a 2016 study by UNICEF, teachers in 
Albania often struggle to adapt their theoretical 
curriculum into real world scenarios (Asabella, 
2016).  Each of these reports show that students 
spend the majority of each school day listening to 
lectures rather than applying their knowledge to a 
physical system. 
 In 2008, the Albanian government began 
to put more focus on developing a plan for mini-
mal learning objectives and school plans in order 
to give better education for students in Albania 
(Ministry of Youth, Sports, and Education, 
2015).  As of 2010, the Ministry of Education and 
Science has been working to identify knowledge 
gaps in the education of students in Albania, in-
cluding STEM education, in order to better equip 
students to join the workforce (Country Profile 
2010: Education In Albania, 2010).  The lack of 
STEM focused education in Albania is recognized 
Figure 7: A WPI mentor lectures in front of the Robotics Club at the Harry Fultz Institute.

at practice, but it’s going fine, because my team is very helpful.” - Club Student

by its students as very few of them enroll in under-
graduate programs for STEM fields in Albanian 
colleges and universities.  However, of the students 
who enroll in colleges and universities outside of 
Albania, 80% wish to pursue STEM based studies 
(Hudhri, A., personal communication, December 
4, 2017).  Furthermore, Besnik Zylka, a technology 
professor at the Tirana International School in Ti-
rana, Albania asserts that the interest for robotics 
in Albania exists.  When discussing the initializa-
tion of a robotics competition at the International 
School, he states that “it was an immediate hit and 
it's been growing since then along with our school 
population”(Zylka, B., personal communication 
2017). 
2.3 Effective Mentoring for      
Robotics 
 Prior to discussing what constitutes a good 
mentoring program, it is important to define three 
similar terms: “mentoring,” “coaching,” and 
“teaching.”  The Oxford dictionary states that a 
mentor is “an experienced person in a company or 
educational institution who trains and counsels 
new employees or students,” while a teacher is, to 
be expected, “a person who teaches, especially in a 
school,” and further, a coach is defined as “a pri-
vate tutor who gives extra teaching” (Oxford Uni-
versity Press, 2017).  These descriptions make it 
clear that the three terms can be confused as each 
encompasses some form of teaching.  The main 
difference comes down to the approach taken and 
the time period over which these actions take 
place.  Mentoring occurs over a longer period of 
time and incorporates not only information per-
taining to the formal environment of the mentee, 
but advice regarding the mentee’s personal life as 
well, such as when a medical student enrolls in a 
mentorship at a research hospital (Sanfey, Hol-
lands, & Gantt, 2013).  In contrast to this, coach-
ing occurs over a shorter period of time, and 
while it implements much of the same tech-
niques, less of a relationship is developed (Brefi 
Group Ltd., 2015).  Additionally, mentoring and 
teaching are distinguished from each other in the 
quality and way in which information is present-
ed.  Teachers are usually figures that possess a 
greater knowledge base and transfer such 
knowledge directly and formally, while mentors 
possess a greater perspective on learners’ abilities 
and passion concerning subject matter (Cohen, 
2015). ""A coach has some great questions for 
your answers; a mentor has some great answers 
for your questions.""-Brefi Group Ltd. 2015 
 
 
2.3.1 Capacity Building in Robotics through 
Mentorship 
 Mentorship programs provide students 
with one-on-one teaching, resulting in a more ef-
fective learning environment overall.  This is par-
ticularly beneficial for STEM based subjects as it 
allows for students to ask specific questions and 
better understand challenging topics. However, the 
effectiveness of any mentorship program can be 
influenced by various factors.  In a 2016 study of 
Ghanaian students’ attitudes towards STEM edu-
cation before and after outreach, it was determined 
that short term outreach activities (i.e. solitary 
classroom visits) were not nearly as effective to-
wards getting students interested in STEM as long 
term exposure (e.g. classes, competitions, etc.) 
(Yawson, 2016).     
 Mentorship programs have been shown to 
be highly effective for inspiring enthusiasm to-
wards STEM, as well as improving the effective-
ness of the program as a whole (Beck & Morgan 
2006).  This fact was shown in a 2016 study of the 
establishment of mentorship programs in African 
countries.  The study observed the positive effect 
that establishing mentorship programs had on stu-
dent engagement and success.  Students under the 
influences of mentors proceeded to go further in 
their respective competitions at the international 
level.  Furthermore, the study noted a distinct im-
provement in the general attitudes of students to-
wards STEM fields in the areas which the mentor-
ship programs were implemented (Ilori, Watchorn, 
2016). 
“I spent a while with E-4 discussing their robot. They had some pretty neat ideas, but pretty      
complex. So I coached them to drop the really complex ideas for simpler.” -Rebecca Miles 
Figure 8: A WPI Mentor, Rebecca Miles, discusses robot 
ideas with a Robotics Club team. 
    
 
8 Chapter 2: Background 
2.3.2 Mentoring in a Cross-Cultural Setting 
 While mentoring or teaching is difficult 
enough in a traditional classroom setting of stu-
dents with similar cultural backgrounds, difficulties 
can be compounded when a culturally diverse 
classroom is presented to mentors and teachers. 
 In a 2009 study conducted in Australia,  
pre-service teachers- or college students guided 
into teaching by a particular mentor- were exposed 
to inner-city classrooms composed of an ethnically 
diverse student body for three-week peri-
ods.  During these experiences, some pre-service 
teachers found it hard to connect with the students 
in their classrooms, dismissing it as due to the stu-
dents’ individual socio-ethnic upbringing (Santoro, 
2009).  In order to mentor effectively in such an 
environment, teachers and mentors needed to look 
beyond their assumptions to understand their 
mentees backgrounds and perspectives on poten-
tial topics.  Because some of the pre-service teach-
ers claimed to “lack ethnicity” due to their un-
diverse and “boring” heritage- a fact they attribut-
ed to being able to trace their ancestry back to the 
first settlers- it became challenging for the teachers 
to account for the different ethnic perspectives of 
the students.  This caused issues with certain lec-
ture topics, as the teachers would speak from one 
cultural perspective.  For example, the Crusades 
were discussed from the Catholic perspective, 
which excluded certain other cultures from the dis-
cussion, such as the Muslim students pre-
sent.  This, in turn, made the teachers realize that 
their experiences and individual upbringings affect-
ed how they taught their outlook on certain top-
ics (Santoro, 2009). 
In her 2014 study on such mentorships, Crutcher 
identified the follow criteria for a successful cross
-cultural mentor: 
Based on these criteria, cross cultural mentors 
should, in general, be aware of their mentee’s cul-
tural background and keep it in mind when giv-
ing advice or guidance. 
 
2.3.3 Helping Mentees Achieve Higher-
Level Thinking: The Role of Facilitation in a 
Mentorship 
 Facilitation is the process of providing 
learners with the opportunity to internalize infor-
mation, processes, and abilities in order to pro-
mote higher level thinking.  Forms of facilitation 
include modeling, coaching, and fading.  Modeling 
is when a mentee directly mirrors the actions of 
their mentor while having the process explained to 
them.  Coaching occurs when the mentor asks the 
mentee questions, provides hints, and gentle re-
minders in order to correct their actions, starting 
from base knowledge the mentees already pos-
sess.  It is at this stage that mentees begin to devel-
op their own problem solving strategies and deci-
sion making skills.  Further, fading is when the 
mentor gradually pulls away from any directive or 
formal instruction involving the mentee, until the 
mentee is essentially self-sufficient in a given task. 
(Choi & Hannafin, 1995). 
 In the context of a robotics club or team 
mentorship, modeling would come in the form of 
hands-on instruction of such processes such as 
assembling a drivetrain or creating a Computer 
Aided Design (CAD) assembly.  As time progress-
es, mentors of robotics clubs and teams transition 
into coaching practices, and begin to have students 
discuss out loud what they believe would be the 
best option to tackle certain challenges.  After still 
more time, mentors slowly reduce their involve-
ment in order to allow mentees to truly get the feel 
for designing a robot.  Mentors in such situations 
would then only occasionally offer advice or help, 
preferring to have their mentees solve the prob-
lems of their own accord. 
 
“I needed to slow down and speak more clearly. I think I lectured too fast and though I kept the         
students’ attention, some information was lost in the process.” -Ben Wagner 
 Mentors must be adept at navigating 
cultural boundaries 
 Mentors must be active listeners, honest 
non-judgmental, persistent, patient and 
posses an appreciation for diversity 
 Mentors must see the mentee as an 
individual and as a part of a larger social 
context 
 Mentors must avoid becoming too invested 
in their mentee’s choices 
 Mentors refrain from becoming friends with 
their mentees in the beginnings of the 
mentorship

2.4 Robotics Competitions:      
Impact on Students Worldwide 
 Robotics competitions are an ideal outlet 
for encouraging student interest in STEM 
fields.  By combining three core disciplines of engi-
neering- computer science, mechanical engineering 
and electrical and computer engineering- students 
are exposed to a broad spectrum of STEM sub-
jects.  A study in 2011 compared the attitudes of 
100 students before and after participating in the 
FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), a competi-
tion in which teams build large robots to play a 
game.  The participating students each completed 
the Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA), 
which gauges students’ attitudes towards the sci-
ences, prior to the competition and again after the 
completion of the program.  The study concluded 
that, after participation in the FIRST Robotics 
Competition, the students’ opinions about STEM 
areas of study were significantly improved (Welch, 
Huffman, 2011).   
 By participating in robotics competitions, 
students may be encouraged to or dissuaded 
from following certain career paths, however, 
research suggests that, regardless of the partici-
pants’ future plans, skills gained by participating 
in such a competition can contribute to success 
in any field.  In a study conducted in 2017, it was 
found that team based competition increased stu-
dents’ communication and collaboration skills, 
enhancing their abilities to overcome a challenge 
as a group (Chen & Hwang, 2017).  The applica-
tion of robotics competitions can also lead to 
greater student self-confidence through peer in-
teractions and success in the game (Brand, 
Collver, & Kasarda, 2008).  In many competi-
tions, some students may have very limited tech-
nical knowledge, but contribute more towards 
leadership, marketing, or other skills (Robotics 
Teaches Technology, Life Skills, and 
""Coopetition,"" 2017).  These diverse contributions 
allow the team to connect and realize each individ-
ual’s potential.  In the words of one student on a 
robotics team in New Jersey, “everybody has to 
work as a team. If you don’t work as a team, every-
thing falls apart” (Rider, 2013). 
 
2.4.1 International Robotics Competitions 
 In order to expand the number of robotics 
clubs at schools in Albania, it is useful to take into 
account other programs which have successfully 
spread robotics and STEM education to countries 
that have limited financial and institutional re-
sources.  Some prominent organizations involved 
with this are FIRST (For the Inspiration and 
Recognition of Science and Technology), VEX 
Robotics REC (Robotics Education and Competi-
tion), Botball, and RoboCup.  As an example, 
FIRST’s competitions have seen the participation 
of over 460,000 students worldwide, with repre-
sentation from over 160 different countries.  These 
“I was reading that STEM as a concept was starting to go around the International school               
realm and so I put in an order for 3 Lego kits” -Besnik Zylka

10 Chapter 2: Background 
competitions have been shown to have a profound 
impact on the participating students world-
wide.  This was exemplified in a three-year study in 
which 636 FIRST participants were compared to 
409 students who did not participate in FIRST.  It 
was found that FIRST participants were 2.3 times 
to 3.7 times more likely to show gains on STEM-
related measures, including involvement in STEM-
related activities, STEM knowledge, and interest in 
STEM and related careers (Melchior et al, 
2017).  In addition to the reach of FIRST, VEX 
Robotics has also spread STEM through its own 
robotics competition and classroom material, 
which focuses on lower cost robotics educa-
tion.  While used in the VEX Robotics competi-
tion, VEX parts and kits are also frequently found 
in classrooms (Vandevelde, Saldien, Ciocci, & Van-
derborght, 2013).  With this, VEX Robotics has 
demonstrated potential keeping students engaged 
in science and math education.  A two-year study 
of 1000 inner city Baltimore students found that 
students, after participating in a VEX robotics 
competition, had higher test scores as well as 
higher classroom attendance compared to stu-
dents who did not participate in robotics (VEX 
Robotics: Inspiring and Preparing Students for 
STEM Careers, 2011). This shows that robotics 
competitions can be powerful tools for spreading 
robotics and STEM across a large range of stu-
dents from many different backgrounds. 
These competitions can also have inherently self 
sustaining aspects that can promote additional 
spread of STEM education.  Though robotics 
education is still relatively young, and much of 
the long term effects and cycles have yet to be dis-
covered, the student-turned-mentor aspect has al-
ready become apparent.  For example, in a recent 
FIRST Global competition, one high school stu-
dent, Michael Sergbeh, participated as member of 
the Liberian team.  The success of his team in the 
competition inspired him to return home and 
begin teaching primary math and science to young-
er Liberian students, while he continued to further 
his STEM education (Ahmad, 2017).  This shows 
how robotics competitions instill a sense of confi-
dence in individuals while teaching teamwork as 
well as professional skills to be used later in their 
careers (“Robotics Competitions: Building A Gen-
eration of Innovators”, 2017). 
 
2.4.2 International Competitions in Tirana: 
Tirana International School 
 While international robotics competition 
teams are rare in Albania, they are not altogether 
missing. The primary example of this is the Tirana 
International School (TIS).  TIS was founded in 
1991, and offers an American-style, K-12, college-
preparatory education for students of the greater 
Tirana area.  As a member of the Central and East-
ern European School Association (CEESA), TIS is 
able to participate in extracurricular competitions 
with other CEESA member schools (Tirana Inter-
national School, n.d).  As such, TIS has maintained 
several FIRST Lego League (FLL) teams as well as 
a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team which have 
participated in CEESA coordinated robotics com-
petitions.  While small, TIS has maintained a ro-

questions."" -Brefi Group Ltd. 2015

Albania. 
2.5 Robotics at the Harry Fultz 
Institute 
2.5.1 The Harry Fultz Institute 
 The Harry 
Fultz Institute is a pri-
vate school consisting 
of a three-year general 
high school, four-year 
technical high school, 
and community college 
situated in the heart of 
Tirana, Albania that 
strives to supply its stu-
dents with the skills to 
become high achieving 
professionals 
(Xhaferaj, M., Personal Communication, Novem-
ber, 17 2017).  The school was founded in 1921 by 
the American Youth Red Cross under the name 
the American Technical School of Tirana.  In that 
year, only 32 students enrolled in the school.  By 
1992, the school had grown to enroll over 800 stu-
dents and had gone through several name changes, 
settling on its modern name to commemorate the 
professor of mechanical arts who left the Universi-
ty of Chicago to superintend the school until 1933 
(Tomcini, 2014). 
 Professor Harry Fultz and his staff main-
tained the outlook that the students of the institute 
would, in his own words, “try to make Albania a 
place worth living” (Tomcini, 2014).  To that end, 
the Harry Fultz Institute provides a variety of tech-
nical and traditional courses in both the vocational 
and general high schools as well as the communi-
ty college that all share the same cam-
pus.  General high school students attend the 
institute for three years, just like most other Alba-
nian high schools, while the technical high school 
students attend four years. Community college 
students attend classes for eight months to spe-
cialize in a technical discipline (Tomcini, 
2014).  In regards to the technical high school, 
students gain some experience in basic STEM 
courses including physics, chemistry, and mathe-
matics and design, while specializing in one of 
three areas- electronics, business, or auto-
mechanics- through elective courses.  Now, there 
are about 230 to 280 incoming students in the 
technical high school each year (Hoxha, K., Per-
sonal Communication, November 19, 2017). 
 Outside of traditional schooling, the Har-
ry Fultz Institute provides several additional ser-
vices to their students.  In keeping with the 
theme of preparing students for the job market, 
the institute routinely offers career counseling 
and university fairs.  Students can also participate 
in extracurricular activities  such as volleyball, 
basketball, a student newspaper, and, as of 2014, 
a robotics club mentored by WPI students.   
2.5.2 Past WPI projects at the Harry Fultz 
Institute 
 The Harry Fultz Institute has hosted 
three groups of WPI students from 2014 to 2016 
with each year’s group building on the progress 
of prior years.  In 2014, WPI students worked 
with Professor Enxhi Jaupi to launch a robotics 
club at the Harry Fultz Institute and determine 
what teaching styles best complemented the ex-
isting curriculum.  The Harry Fultz Institute stu-
dents involved in this project desired shorter, 
more condensed lectures to increase the time to 
work on their robots, and enjoyed the self-directed 
learning style (Hunt et al., 2014).  In 2014, the six, 
four student teams built small arduino based ro-
bots that ranged vastly in ability and purpose.  For 
instance, some could be controlled through Blue-
tooth on android phones, follow lines drawn on 
the ground, seek a person out through sound or 
light, or balance on two wheels (Hunt et al., 
2014).  The following year, the six, five student 
teams were given a broad goal: to research robots 
and build something that interested them after 
basic robotics lessons on building, wiring, and pro-
gramming with Lego Mindstorms EV3 kits.  The 
2015 group then created more advanced lesson 
plans focused on teaching the club students to pro-
gram, 3D print, and apply their theoretical 
knowledge from their classes to practical challeng-
es and problems.  This resulted in an autonomous 
hexacopter drone, an autonomous rover, a balanc-
ing and jumping remote-controlled robot, a 3-axis 
CNC machine, a robotic hand, and a robotic arm 
(Jacobsohn et al., 2015).  Then, in 2016, WPI stu-
dents implemented a robotics competition to fos-
ter a competitive and collaborative environment 
among the twenty-four students.  These WPI stu-
dents mentored the club in building robots, as seen 
in figure 12, that competed in a Savage Soccer 
competition discussed below. 
 The club students have broad levels of un-
derstanding about a relatively large number of dif-
ferent technical disciplines.  The 2015 group con-
cluded that teaching would have been more benefi-
cial to the students involved if the class sizes had 
been kept smaller and different skill sets 
(programming, electrical engineering, etc.) had 
been spread evenly throughout the teams 
(Jacobsohn et al., 2015).  The following year, WPI

Fultz (Tomcini, 2014) 
    
 
12 Chapter 2: Background 
students focused on helping students develop 
teamwork and collaboration skills while increasing 
the interest in applying skills learned in class by 
providing lessons that culminated in a robotics 
competition (Titus et al., 2016). 
 Each year, the successful completion of the 
robotics club has helped the club to grow and de-
velop, although there have been difficulties each 
year.  This included an ongoing issue of obtaining 
parts in time due to delivery delays.  Such delays 
caused teams to complete the build of their robot 
in the last weeks of the competition, resulting in 
robots that the students felt did not quite represent 
the level of effort that went into them (Titus et al., 
2016).  In some cases, building had to continue 
after the WPI students had left Alba-
nia.  Furthermore, due to a limited budget, several 
simpler parts were manufactured within the ma-
chine shops of the Harry Fultz Institute.  While 
this saved money, it took more time, decreasing 
the time students had left to build.  According to 
previous groups, the students respond well to self-
directed learning and were motivated, ambitious, 
and excited to learn, work, and collaborate result-
ing in a unique environment the students could not 
get outside of the club (Jacobsohn et al., 2015). 
2.5.3 Current State of the Harry Fultz        
Institute’s Robotics Club 
 Over the last three years, the robotics club, 
and the accompanying projects, at the Harry Fultz 
Institute has been primarily led by Professor Enxhi 
Jaupi.  This year, however, the club was led by Pro-
fessor Klarens Hoxha alongside Professor Moisi 
Xhaferaj.  As with previous years, each student 
applied to be part of the club and were selected 
based on criteria specified by the two profes-
sors.  Similar to last year, the club was composed 
of six teams of four students each.  Each team 
had a student that was good at electronics, one 
that was proficient in programming, and one with 
experience in mechanical design in addition to a 
team leader (Jaupi, E., Personal Communication, 
September 11, 2017).  Ten of these students par-
ticipated in the club and subsequent competition 
last year, of which six served as official team lead-
ers this year.  The remaining four were distribut-
ed among the teams as normal to provide leader-
ship assistance when necessary. 
 The club, this year, followed the same 
structure as in 2016, that is, brief lectures were 
presented each class and were coupled with 
hands-on workshops and mentoring, culminating 
in a robotics competition at the end of the pro-
ject.  The role of WPI mentors in the classroom 
was to teach new topics, such as mechanical design 
and C programming basics as well as to encourage 
student interaction and teamwork. 
 The 2016 group implemented a Savage 
Soccer game.  Savage Soccer is an introductory-
level competition for groups to explore the basics 
of robotics, engineering and teamwork in a fun 
environment.  The main goal of the game is to use 
a remote controlled robot to transport game pieces 
to scorable zones (“Welcome”, 2017). Game pieces 
range from foam cubes to wooden eggs.  The 2016 
team utilized the Savage Soccer game manual from 
the 2014 game which used ping pong balls as game 
pieces on the field illustrated in figure 12.  Students 
built their robots primarily from scratch, utilizing 
various provided parts as well as salvaging metal 
from sources such as computer cases (Titus et al., 
2016). 
""This year has been such an improvement from last year. I know I'm saying this over and over again.    
But seriously... I can’t think of anything that needs to be changed. -Club Student

“I learned how to think critically and acquired new knowledge on electronics and

experience for me and it has prepared me for eventual problems that I will face in 
future projects in my life.” -Club Student 
    
 
14 Chapter 3: Process 
The primary goal of the project was to en-
gage students in the robotics club at the Harry 
Fultz Institute in a robotics competition in order to 
promote creativity, communication, problem-
solving skills, and teamwork throughout the six 
weeks of self-directed learning in which the stu-
dents had to design, build, and program their ro-
bots. 
 Despite our initial limited experience as 
teachers and mentors, we intended to get to know 
the students and learn more about their perspec-
tives, thoughts, and attitudes.  This was done such 
that implemented teaching styles could be adapted 
to more effectively connect with and ensure that 
students received the optimal combination of theo-
retical and applicable skills.  Our group also as-
sessed the interest in, feasibility of, and resources 
for furthering robotics education in Tirana.  This 
goal was accomplished through the following ob-
jectives: 
 3.1 Mentoring Students for a Ro-
botics Competition 
3.1.1 The Robotics Competition 
 The game that was selected for the 2016 
competition at the Harry Fultz Institute adapted 
the 2014 Savage Soccer game manual which uti-
lized ping pong balls that were scored in colored 
bins as can be seen in figure 13.  This year, in order 
to present the returning students with a different 
challenge than they had previously tackled, the 
2007 Savage Soccer game manual was 
adapted.  The corresponding game objects were 
badminton birdies as well as a size-four soccer 
ball.  Thus, the ten returning students were unable 
to reuse the same mechanisms that they had devel-
oped to pick up the ping pong balls, allowing each 
team to begin on even ground.  The fully adapted 
game manual for this year’s competition can be 
found in appendix H. 
3.1.2 Curriculum 
 Our teaching was based in part on the les-
son plans and recommendations from the previous 
three WPI project groups involved with the robot-
ics club.  As a base, short, introductory lectures 
were presented at the start of each class.  These 
lectures contained necessary information for the 
students to gain a better understanding of robotics 
each day, as more components were intro-
duced.  Checkpoint objectives were implemented 
in an attempt to keep student teams on track to 
complete their robots in time for the competi-
tion.  Examples of such checkpoints can be seen in 
the table 1. 
“As annoying as it might have been this lecture was the most important one for our team as it help 
us a lot to finalize our robot design and how our robot was going to work.” -Club Student

3.1.3 Mentoring 
 The 2014 IQP group concluded that the 
most effective way to teach the club students is to 
work as their mentors by helping them when diffi-
culties arise, while allowing them enough room to 
research, fail, and problem-solve on their own.  A 
2013 study analyzed how teachers interpreted their 
students’ problem solving abilities and related 
them to the student’s native culture.  Teacher’s 
pedagogical reasoning as they reflected on their 
students’ performance completing a task was orga-
nized into four categories: generativity, elaboration, 
justification, and explanation (Buxton, Salinas, Ma-
hotiere, Lee, & Secada, 2013).  Although this study 
analyzed how the teachers explained their students’ 
problem solving procedures, this was adapted in 
order to analyze the club students throughout their 
design and building process.  These categories pro-
vide a way to evaluate the students, and how they 
are rationalizing their decision making as they en-
counter options or issues.  Although formal scores 
in these categories could have been assigned to 
individual teams or students while evaluating them, 
it was deemed most beneficial to keep the catego-
ries in mind to guide our feedback or when asking 
the students questions in class.  In order to best 
assess the effectiveness of the planned teaching 
strategies, a multi-stage approach consisting of 
group- and student-initiated interactions was im-
plemented as seen in figure 14.

A note on “Mentoring” 
Aspects of the three instructional methods- mentoring, teaching, and coaching- played a 
role in the development of lecture material and student interaction over the course of this 
project.  While this project did resemble a mentorship in the sense that students were guided 
into discovering the STEM education path, the short time span in which this occurred as well 
as the culminating competition implied coaching while the addition of lecture-based instruc-
tion contributed aspects of teaching.  Therefore, this combination will be formally dubbed 
mentoring, but will differ from the traditional definition of the word as it combines aspects of 
all three disciplines together for the purpose of this project. 
    
Chapter 3: Process 16 
 Each day, the topics students were having 
the most difficulty on were analyzed and subse-
quent lesson topics were adapted according-
ly.  Further feedback on lesson content and stu-
dent issues was gathered via Google Forms at the 
end of each week. 
 There were two types of Google Forms: 
one which reviewed the previous week’s lessons 
and activities and one that was constantly available 
for student feedback, dubbed the “Suggestion 
Box.”  Google Forms allow for the rapid collection 
of data from a controlled sample population, in 
this case the twenty-four students, and can com-
bine qualitative and quantitative questions seam-
lessly.  The weekly survey, an example of which is 
seen in appendix D, was structured such that each 
lesson of the corresponding week was given a nu-
meric rating followed by a comment box where 
students could optionally explained the reasons 
for the rating.  The survey responses were then 
put into word clouds in order to analyze promi-
nent themes per lecture. Word clouds are an effi-
cient tool to generate context-preserving visuali-
zation that depict the frequency of text content 
(Cui, Wu, Liu, Wei, Zhou, & Qu, 2010).  Since 
the words or phrases that were used the most are 
considerably larger than other, it was simple to 
see if the students’ collective attitude was alto-
gether positive or negative regarding a particular 
lecture.  By coding the survey responses for com-
mon themes, we were able to better serve each 
student better in future lectures, as well as ana-
lyze the impact of the hands-on workshops that 
were incorporated into several lectures. 
 The second form, as seen in appendix D 
functioned as a digital suggestion box, which any 
student had access to at any time in order to ask a 
question or address some difficulty they were hav-
ing, while maintaining their anonymity, if de-
sired.  The responses from this survey would ex-
plicitly point us to some area which the club was 
lacking, whether it be in an individual group or, if a 
certain topic came up repeatedly, the club as a 
whole.  If the review indicated that there was a 
topic with which the class was struggling, short 
review lectures were prepared to address any mate-
rial students needed more time with, or any other 
issues and concerns the students were hav-
ing.  Though it was not expected to have many 
submissions that asked for further clarifications on 
lecture material, as we were present at the club 
each day to answer questions in person, it was pos-
sible that students would express other difficulties, 
 
Figure 14: Feedback Flowchart  for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Lectures 
    
 
17 Chapter 3: Process 
such as frustration with failure, outside of sched-
uled class time.  In such a case, a lecture on the 
importance of failure and how to overcome it was 
deemed beneficial in order to let the students re-
flect on their process and see how each failure 
brought them closer to their desired outcome.  The 
combination of these forms were intended to offer 
the students a way to communicate to us in their 
native language or submit a thought or concern 
anonymously if they felt the need to. 
3.2 Assess Student Teamwork, 
Collaboration and Reflection 
3.2.1 Encouraging Personal Student        
Reflection 
 As in previous years, students and their 
teams had the option of participating in semi-
structured interviews in informal settings.  Semi-
structured interviews utilize a set of prepared ques-
tions that probe at the interviewee to follow a par-
ticular line of inquiry (Jamshed, 2014).  Some ex-
amples of these questions can be found in appen-
dix B.  Some of the topics addressed in these inter-
views, include team dynamics, thoughts about the 
student’s robot, potential interests in majors at uni-
versity, or general interest in robotics as a whole. 
These questions intended to give students an op-
portunity to discuss their experience through guid-
ed questions, allowing them to reflect and identify 
how their interests have changed or skills have de-
veloped.  These interviews took place during the 
robotics club regular meeting times for the con-
venience of the students, and were recorded for 
proper documentation.  Since it was unlikely due 
to the school logistics that these interviews would 
include a complete population sample of the 
club, these interviews were primarily used for 
quote extraction on the relevant topics.     
 In order to better understand their moti-
vations and viewpoints, a brainstorming prompt 
was asked of the students.  This would enable 
them to respond with phrases, words, or sentenc-
es that they felt best fit the prompt, which was 
“What have you learned in the Robotics 
Club?”  We chose this question in order to en-
courage students to think about what valuable 
knowledge they had gained since the start of the 
club and to brainstorm topics they wanted to 
know more about.  A list of other brainstorming 
questions that were considered and a more in-
depth procedure can be found in appendix 
C.  The responses to these prompts were catego-
rized through thematic analysis by patterns of 
conversation topics, which, when headed by a 
theme, represent a collective experience among 
informants (Aronson, 1995).  For our organiza-
tional purposes, this allowed us to better identify 
what the students were most passionate about, 
and use that information to further adapt any in-
teractions with each individual as well as the class 
as a whole. 
3.2.2 Student Teamwork 
 Determining the collaborative-effects on 
the students was accomplished in two ways: rec-
orded observations of the student interactions by 
us, the WPI mentors, and analysis of student us-
age of a Google Drive.  Through constant inter-
action with the students while teaching the lecture 
material, assisting students with problems, or per-
forming other duties, we were in an excellent posi-
tion to observe student interactions and even 
gauge the students’ feelings about their team as we 
were constantly in contact with them while they 
were working and could directly observe them in 
action. 
 In observing the students, we followed the 
model described in Stephanie G Adams’ Team Ef-
fectiveness Model developed at the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln which determined that an ideal, 
productive team exhibits seven characteristics as 
listed in table X: Adams also asserted that “these 
constructs have been defined as characteristics a 
team should encompass in order to be effective 
and will be the foundation for the behaviors identi-
fied in the development of the protocol to measure 
team behavior” (Adams, Zafft, Molano, & Rao, 
2008).  Table 2 also illustrates the various charac-
teristics and how they were put towards the pur-
poses of this project. Our analysis differs from Ad-
ams’ suggestions, as we implemented a different 
ranking scale in each category in order to more ef-
fectively rate each team at a time instead of each 
individual. 
 As part of the observations of the students, 
each member of our group filled out a team suc-
cess potential survey, as can be found in appendix 
D after each club meeting in order to score the 
individual team behavior.  The survey quantified 
each student team’s success using a number scale 
for each of the seven criteria laid out in the model 
above.  There also was an option to add any addi-
“The opportunity to actually build something and experiment with it is priceless to me and that's 
what I like most about the robotics club.” -Club Student 
    
Chapter 3: Process 18 
tional comments or issues observed with each 
team.  Before the fourth week, each respective 
teams’ scores in the seven criteria were averaged, 
and converted to a number grade.  The comments 
attributed to each team were analyzed for common 
issues or problems, from which potential solutions 
were generated.  These grades and comments were 
then compiled in a comprehensive sheet, an exam-
ple of which is seen in figure 15.  
 In addition to the documented observa-
tions, we asked the students to fill out a Team 
Evaluation Survey.  This survey, seen in appendix 
D, combined fun questions with requests to rate 
their team members contribution in order to keep 
the students from feeling too uneasy or pressured 
to talk about their team. By assuring them that 
their anonymity would be preserved, the students 
had the chance to answer more honestly.  This sur-
vey was intended to provide confirmation of which 
students contribute more or less than others, while 
obtaining each student’s insight on how their team 
was operating.  From these survey responses, 
problematic team members were identified by the 
comments other team members left for them. 
 In the fourth week, we met with each team 
or problematic teammate met with a group mem-
ber, to discuss the results of the observations and 
related surveys.  The generated team success sheets 
were presented to the student teams such that each 
had the chance to reflect and make any necessary 
changes before the completion of the project. 
Each team met privately with a group member to 
discuss what was observed and any suggestions for 
improvement.  Any exceptionally low scoring 
score, being less than a 75% in any particular sec-
tion, required extra attention, explanation, and ad-
vice.  Additionally, any teammate that was identi-
fied as a problem met one-on-one with a group

conversation that follows, and 
encourage the development of the 
team’s ideas as a whole. 
Students are not being extremely loud or 
acting aggressively when discussing the 
project. Students are listening to each 
other and communicating in a mature 
fashion. 
Productive 
Conflict  
Resolution 
Conflicts are managed in a productive 
manner. A change is made instead of 
ignoring the issue. 
 
 
Students make an effort to understand 
each other, and maybe change roles on 
the team, redefine their goals, remind 
teammates of a common purpose etc. 
Accountable 
Interdepend-
ence 
The team should not be able to 
succeed if a member were to not 
make contributions. Each teammate 
should be interdependent on the work 
and success of others. 
The workload is spread well between 
members, students contribute to 
processes outside of their roles, and 
students have a high attendance rate.

member in order to identify causes and brainstorm 
ways to improve their performance in the latter 
weeks. 
 In the final weeks leading up to the compe-
tition, each team was observed further to deter-
mine whether the discussion of their performance 
affected their team dynamic and performance. In a 
final survey at the culmination of the club, students 
were asked whether they found the meeting to be 
beneficial for their teams and if it affected the team 
dynamic at all. 
3.2.3 Student Collaboration 
 While encouraging collaboration can posi-
tively affect the students as a whole, it is important 
to provide a collaborative medium through which 
they can communicate and document their interac-
tions (Nag et al., 2013).  Such mediums can take 
many forms, ranging from a class discussion board, 
to a Facebook group, to a wall dedicated to photos 
and questions on the matter.  Instead of these, a 
Google Drive was set up so students had access to 
private folders in which they could upload their 
designs, thoughts, programming codes, and have 
access to any presented lectures, provided files, or 
feedback surveys.  This provided a place for the 
members of the individual teams to store their 
work and collaborate on files, while also allowing 
us, the mentors, to view their progress and assist 
when they had problems.  The Google Drive was 
chosen among other options as it was decidedly 
the best means of private documentation, since 
there was fear that collaboration and idea sharing 
too early on in the design process may result  
“Our teamwork has been good overall, but it could have been better. Everybody has been busy with 
 doing [academic studies]. So I can say that we didn't give our full potential.” -Club Student

in a lack of creativity and individuality as occurred 
in previous years (Titus et al., 2017). 
 In their assigned team folders on the 
Google Drive, students could also fill out reflec-
tion documents, such as the one seen in figure 16, 
to make it easier for us to track their problem solv-
ing process and difficulties encountered.  Using 
these, each student team could be assessed at the 
various stages leading up to the final competi-
tion.  The various discussions, design changes, 
parts requests, or ideas that the students noted 
could be easily observed and discussed, 
which  further influenced our interactions with in-
dividual student teams.  Routinely, the teams were 
tasked with submitting documents, such as re-
quests for particular motors or desired sen-
sors.  Through these documents, students were 
able to more clearly define their goals, in order to 
allow them to share their ideas with other groups 
more confidently once their ideas were flushed out 
and agreed upon. 
3.3 Develop narratives to record 
thoughts and observations 
 One of the more important aspects of this 
project concerns the personal impact; our ability to 
teach, to mentor, and to communicate with people 
of a different culture in order to understand how 
to most effectively serve them and connect with 
them.  To do this most effectively, each group 
member wrote a journal entry daily to highlight 
successes, failures, personal and student reactions, 
as well as the magnitude of both our and the stu-
dents’ motivation.  Each group member used these  
“Alpha had a question for me, but Edge Logic jumped in to help before I had the chance.”  
-Marek Travnikar 
Figure 16: Team Reflection Template Provided on Google Drive 
    
Chapter 3: Process 21 
journal entries to note findings that could pertain 
and prove useful to other project objectives.  Any 
questions or trouble the students had that particu-
larly stood out were noted, to help influence lec-
tures or activities, as discussed in Section 3.1.3 
above. Furthermore, by keeping a journal, one can 
record thoughts and observations that might be 
lost in retrospect (Alaszewski, 2006).  
 Each entry was reviewed and analyzed by 
selecting key phrases or words from the text which 
would then be categorized based off of their con-
tent.  The act of categorizing like this is called 
“coding,” which is a judgement call on behalf of 
the researchers to identify key information 
(Saldaila, 2009).  In this fashion, consistent trends 
or themes were identified and used to adapt our 
approaches and interactions with the stu-
dents.  Through the final analysis of these themes 
at the conclusion of our project, we were able to 
provide better advice to future mentors in similar 
situations. 
3.4 Explore feasibility of           
expansion of robotics education 
in Albania 
 One way to expand the benefits of a robot-
ics competition is not only to take steps to ensure 
it continues in the years to come at the Harry Fultz 
Institute, but also to expand and encourage other 
schools in the greater Tirana region to participate 
in robotics education.  To do this, we conducted 
semi-structured interviews with representatives 
from schools, organizations, and companies that 
were considered as having an interest in discussing 
the possibility of implementing robotics curriculum 
in Tirana.  Semi-structured interviews can be con-
sidered more appropriate for formal contacts, and 
were thus deemed more applicable than formal 
interviews.  Since these interviews will become a 
source for those continuing the exploration of 
this topic, it was important to record them for 
later verbatim transcription (Jamshed, 2014). 
 In order to assess the possibility of ex-
pansion, key factors were explored, including:   
 Each interview had the interviewee reflect 
on how robotics could be integrated into the or-
ganization they are associated with, the current 
state of and future hopes for the robotics indus-
try, and what resources may be available to give 
rise to widespread robotics education.  These in-
terviews concluded by asking if the respondent 
was aware of any other organizations, schools, 
businesses or individuals that were similarly in-
vested in the expansion of robotics locally, do-
mestically, or internationally, and by asking how 
to take the next steps with each interested party. 
 By gaining an understanding of the inter-
est and available resources of other parties, we 
wanted to start a conversation that will hopefully 
blossom into an expansion of robotics education 
in Albania.  It was intended to connect the people 
that have the ability and drive to make such an ex-
pansion happen, if possible, and who would feel 
responsible for keeping the conversation going in 
order to then turn that conversation into action. 
3.4.1 Parties of Interest 
 The primary parties of interest that were 
contacted for interviews on this subject included 
Protik, the Tirana International School, the Minis-
try of Education and Science in Tirana, and Educa-
tionUSA. 
Protik 
 Protik is a Tirana-based company dedicated 
to inspiring growth within the information and 
communications technology (ICT) industry within 
Albania.  Already, they have exhibited some inter-
est in robotics, seen in their Young Innovators 
Club, which has produced a remotely controlled 
robot (Protik.org, 2013).   
 
Tirana International School 
 The Tirana International School, founded 
in 1991, is a private, not-for-profit school that fol-
lows the American style, K-12, college preparatory 
curriculum (Olson, 2017).  In the past, the Interna-
tional School has sent a team of students to Wash-
ington D.C. to compete in a FIRST world compe-
tition.  Besnik Zylka, a technology professor at the 
International School who helped to found this 
school’s FIRST team, has been in contact with 
WPI’s Professor Peter Christopher and expressed 
to him interest in expanding robotics education 
and competition in Albania.

Albanian Ministry of Education and Science 
 Officially the Ministry of Education, Sport, 
and Youth (MESY), the Albanian Ministry of Edu-
cation is in charge of drafting up and implementing 
nation-wide educational policies.  Located in Tira-
na, MESY is in charge of the annual budget for 
schools and is responsible for following up on any 
new policies or teaching strategies that are present-
ed to schools.  Working with local governments, 
MESY constantly seeks to improve the overall ed-
ucational value available to all citizens of Albania. 
(ACCE, 2017) 
 Further, MESY has demonstrated a signifi-
cant interest in the advancement of robotics educa-
tion, in addition to other essential fields.  A 2015 
article stated that the Ministry has been attempting 
to implement the ERASMUS+ program which 
encourages institutions of higher education to 
improve some aspect of their offered educa-
tion.  The program prioritized improvement of 
aspects of the current education system in four 
categories: subject areas, quality of education, 
management and operation, and higher education 
development.  One of the subject areas of inter-
est is the improvement of robotics education as a 
part of the general engineering discipline.  For 
this reason, the Ministry is of particular interest 
to this team. (Ministry of youth, Sports, and Edu-
cation, 2015).

including one at the Marin Barleti University in 
Tirana, each of which is staffed by highly trained 
professionals, many of whom have first-hand 
experience studying in such institutions.  At each 
advising center, students can find free infor-
mation on various schools, universities, or colleg-
es as well as the process for applying to higher 
education institutions.  Additionally, advising 
centers frequently participate in outreach events 
such as fairs as well as reaching students websites 
and social media. 
 As more students look to the United 
States for both undergraduate and graduate de-
grees, the EducationUSA advising center in Tirana 
has become prepared to assist all students in 
achieving their goals.  The center is open to the 
public and offers a multitude of sources on Ameri-

24 Chapter 4: Findings 
The robotics club students had about five 
and a half weeks to learn the basics of robotics, 
analyze the game, and then design, build, and pro-
gram their robot.  The competition was the tool 
used to engage the students in a fun and challeng-
ing way; however, the implementation of VEX 
parts this year reduced some challenge in order to 
maximize the time students had to embrace the 
engineering design process.  Many of the parts that 
were used this year were purchased and brought 
from America to Albania.  Thus, the students were 
able to utilize provided structural components ra-
ther than salvaging metal from sources such as old 
computer cases, as was the case in previous 
years.  When asked about their experience in the 
club, the overwhelming majority, especially of stu-
dents returning to the club, referred to the VEX 
parts as useful and stated that they made building 
the robots easier than in past years.  One member 
from the winning team at the competition, Alpha, 
stated that: “you are giving us so much stuff. Last 
year I had to cut all of it myself and it was not fun. 
I am not cut out for that.” 
 When asked what parts the students 
wished they could have had at the start of the club 
that they did not, most of the students referenced 
concepts such as knowledge or ideas rather than 
structural components as can be seen in the word 
cloud in figure 20. This indicates that the quantity 
and quality of the parts provided was adequate for 
the students to successfully construct their robots. 
However, it also indicates that there is interest for 
additional classes in robotics subjects prior to join-
ing the club. 
  
""Everything that we have discussed until now about design, building, mechanisms, etc. is about to 
become real.” -Club Student

25 Chapter 4: Findings 
weeks of teaching robotics topics, mentoring students, and preparing them for the competition were the 
catalyst allowing us to study the larger questions of this project: namely the effects of mentoring, student 
engagement, and student teamwork.  The findings on these topics are each discussed in their respective 
sections as follows. 
By the time of the competition, all six 
teams were able to score points in the competition 
with their completed robots as much of the manu-
facturing time was cut down. This marked im-
provement can be attributed to the provided VEX 
parts as they streamlined the building process and 
allowed for more trial and error in the designing 
process.  In addition to this, by making it easier for 
the students to iterate through different designs 
and get creative, each robot was completely differ-
ent from the others.  In the very first lecture that 
we gave to the students, we gave examples of how 
two completely different robot designs could just 
as effectively complete the same tasks.  Seeing how 
unique each team’s design was and how excited the 
students were to describe their strategies for the 
game over the course of the club, as well as during 
the final competition, showed how much the stu-
dents embraced the experience and made it fun 
and enjoyable for everyone involved. On the last 
day of the club, we asked the students to reflect 
over their experience in the club this year. We 
asked them to think about what they learned, how 
their team worked, and what we, as mentors, could 
have  done differently. The word cloud illustrated 
in figure 21 highlights the students feelings of their 
club experience based off of the eleven responses 
that we received. This shows that the robotics club 
was an overall positive experience for the students, 
helping them to learn, think, and experience team-
work. 
 While the competition was a critical mile-
stone for this project, it’s important to emphasize 
that it was only one part of this project. The five

only at this age but at all, so it was a new cool experience” -Club Student

time.   Some groups, in fact, seemed to learn best 
when copying designs until unique personal ideas 
emerged through attempted implementation.  In 
the first week, one group, in particular, would 
simply copy whatever mechanism was covered in 
lecture on that particular day, resulting in their de-
sign and strategy to change daily.  In order to en-
courage the students to commit to a design and try 
disappointment for all who were involved.  As a 
result of these pressures, we were occasionally 
more heavy handed with our advice and guidance 
than we had originally desired. 
 While failure is a highly effective way to 
learn (Starch, 1910), trial and error is a lengthy 
process which we wanted to limit in order for 
every team to be able to finish their robots on 
4.1 Mentoring 
 One of the most challenging aspects of this 
project was becoming good mentors to the stu-
dents. Following Crutcher’s guide to successful 
cross-cultural mentorship which states that 
“Mentors must avoid becoming too invested in 
their mentee’s choices” (Crutcher, 2014), we need-
ed to be able to adapt to the students’ changing 
ideas, plans and directions for their robot designs 
and allow them to try, fail, and try again whenever 
they wanted to try a new mechanism or design 
idea.  At times, students would have ideas that 
were completely unrealistic to successfully imple-
ment.  In these instances, it was necessary for us to 
steer the team in a new direction in order to pre-
vent them from wasting time on mechanisms or 
plans that could not ensure at least some limited 
success for their final robot. We did our best to 
guide the students towards designs that coincided 
with the team’s own original, ideas while still being 
feasible given their resources, knowledge, and time 
constraints.  That said, it was challenging for us to 
step back and not bias the students’ unique designs 
in order for the students to learn through failure 
when their designs did not operate in practice as 
they had originally planned. This was partly due to 
a determination on our part to improve the club 
from previous years, as we felt pressure to achieve 
success as it was defined by the Harry Fultz Insti-
tute wherein every team must have a functioning 
robot by the day of the competition.  It was ex-
pressed to us both by several students as well as 
the Professors that only having four functional ro-
bots at the competition last year caused significant

me for eventual problems that I will face in future projects in my life."" -Club Student

27 Chapter 4: Findings 
to implement it rather than theorize and continual-
ly rework, checkpoint deadlines, as seen in section 
3.1.2, were set up.  At each of these check-ins, we 
expected the students to have completed some as-
pect of their robot.  The students were not held to 
these checkpoints- considering that there were no 
repercussions or consequences of missed deadlines
- yet they were routinely reiterated in order to re-
mind the students of the approaching competition. 
 The students were extremely eager to begin 
building and testing their robots. Despite this, we 
made a point of stressing the engineering design 
process, as teaching it was one of the goals since 
the founding of the robotics club and one of the 
priorities for Professor Moisi Xhaferaj.  To do 
such, we made a point not to give the students 
their kits until after they had finished a design for 
their robots.  This served several purposes, includ-
ing incentivizing the students to think about their 
design rather than just start building with no guide-
lines to follow.  As they were required to think 
ahead of time and draw out their designs on paper, 
the students worked together and came to a con-
sensus as a team as to what they wanted to do be-
fore actually doing it.  Had a team failed to work 
together, their respective kit was withheld long-
er.  Withholding the VEX parts served as leverage 
for us to assert our power as teachers of the club 
and organizers of the competition.  We found as-
serting our power to be an important step for sev-
eral reasons.  Firstly, the Crutcher guide to success-
ful cross-cultural mentorship states that “Mentors 
[must] refrain from becoming friends with their 
mentees in the beginnings of the mentor-
ship”(2014).  In the first few weeks of the club, we 
had desired to build a positive relationship with 
the students.  This went against the guidance of 
Crutcher- and ultimately proved the validity of 
his claim- as no team submitted their designs by 
the initial checkpoint.  It was important for us to 
gain the students’ respect and instill a sense of 
urgency in them to fulfill our expectations and 
comply with our requests. When we began hold-
ing their parts as leverage, all of the students that 
day discussed in detail and submitted their de-
signs to us.  Asserting our power over the stu-
dents also helped during lectures when students 
refused to quiet down.  By “putting our foot 
down” we were able to gain command of the 
classroom and significantly improve student at-
tentiveness and participation. This was expressed 
in one mentors reflections: 
""In a loud voice, I asked the     
students to quiet down and listen 
up, and I made it clear I was not 
going to take any disruptions. 
Amazingly they were near silent 
the entire time.”                             
-Marek Travnikar 
 We found that when we asserted our au-
thority, the students respected our requests and 
instructions significantly more and without re-
sentment.  According to Crutcher, mentors must 
be able to see the mentee as an individu-
al.  Therefore, despite the need to maintain a 
sense of authority, it was important to us to relate 
to the students, make them comfortable, and to 
adapt our lectures to fit their individual personali-
ties and needs.  The students had a good sense of 
humor.  This was not only recognized by us, the 
mentors, but also by Professor Moisi Xhaferaj who 
stated that when he lectures, he tries to crack jokes 
at the beginning of class so that the students can 
get their humor and laughs out of their system 
(personal communication, 2017).  This 
“preemptive” fun, he argued, helps the students to 
focus better throughout the remainder of the 
class.  Therefore, our lectures incorporated jokes, 
references to popular movies, and our surveys in-
cluded fun questions such as “Which member of 
the Justice League is each of your team-
mates?”.  The hope was that if the surveys were 
fun, students would start talking about them and 
each person would want to complete it for them-
selves.  Instead of having to remind students to 
take the survey once the last person finished, stu-
dents made the first move to walk up to the com-
puter, as they were intrigued by the conversations 
they overheard.  As for humorous lecture material, 
we believe our “preemptive fun”, as suggested by 
Professor Moisi Xhaferaj, released some energy in 
the classroom, allowing the students to focus on 
the material more.  This was a successful tactic as 
multiple students directly referenced the fun details 
that were included in the surveys and lectures as 
positive improvements to the club in their feed-
back. As a member of team Vortex said: “It was 
the small stuff, at least for me, the small stuff for 
me personally the little cute friendly questions like 
‘which superhero would you be’ or the little intro-
ductions you would do in the beginning or that 
you’re joking some of the times or when you’re

mechanics and stuff that you have to know- the basics.” -Professor Moisi Xhaferaj

interacting with other people on topics outside 
made us feel more like friends other than people 
who came from another land.  And it was nice.” 
 While it was important to relate to the stu-
dents, make them feel comfortable and have fun 
with the club, we wanted to help them to learn as 
much as possible both about robotics as well as 
about their own interests in STEM and engineer-
ing.  Therefore, in an effort to engage the students 
and give physical examples of systems to use on 
their robots, we structured as many lectures as pos-
sible around hands-on activities that were either 
directly applied to their robot or demonstrated ex-
amples of a concept.  The breakdown of the 44 
collected student responses to these hands-on ac-
tivities and demonstrations can seen in figure 23. 
 While we implemented as many hands-on 
demonstrations as possible, once we gave the stu-
dents their kits of parts, we began to limit lectures 
and class-wide demonstrations to allow the stu-
dents as much time to work on their robots as pos-
sible.  While multiple students were noticeably un-
interested in lectures that did not utilize hands on 
activities, the activities had their own successes and 
failures.  For instance, the students, despite their 
specializations, were highly engaged in the drive 
train demonstration which allowed them to see the 
effects of different gear ratios.  However, in hands-
on demonstrations that were solely design or pro-
gramming oriented, such as the Inventor and Ar-
duino lectures respectively, many students who did 
not specialize in the topic would simply get up and 
leave the room.  Despite this, through analysis of 
the students weekly reflections, nearly 90% of the 
responses for lectures that included hands on 
components were positive.  That is, they viewed 
the activities as fun, useful for their future, appli-
cable to their robot, or stated that they learned 
something from the experience. Table 3 details 
each hands-on activity, its goal, and the result.

4.2 Student Engagement 
 As previously discussed, we insisted on a 
quiet environment, wove humor into the lecture, 
or used some combination in order to gain the stu-
dents’ attention.  Each student had a particular 
field in which they were primarily focused and, ini-
tially, few were willing to branch out and pay atten-
tion to lectures outside of their field of inter-
est.  There were a few factors that led to the stu-
dents’ specializations, such as the fundamental 
structure of the robotics club and education at the 
Harry Fultz Institute itself.  When students enroll 
at the Harry Fultz Institute, they choose an area to 
specialize in- auto-mechanics, electronics, business- 
which dictates the classes that they take for the rest 
of their high school careers.  Further, when they 
applied to the robotics club, the students were re-
quired to state which area they were interested in, 
and they were selected and placed into groups of 
four to ensure a rounded team skillset (Hoxha, K., 
2017). As a result, the students were used to being 
specialized in one area of study and therefore less 
comfortable branching out. 
 From our experience in the United States, 
classes were usually silent during lecture.  This has 
been true throughout high school as well as in col-
lege.  In Albania, however, the classes are much 
different in environment, content, and style 
(Gjokutaj, M., Dr., 2013; Sahlberg, 2010).  One 
theme that was maintained in our personal reflec-
tions throughout this project was the frustration 
concerning student attention and how there was 
always a handful of students who would revert to 
their phones or talk when we lectured.  Across our 
72 personal reflection entries, we explicitly noted 
lack of student engagement during lectures in 21 
of them.  After observing a lecture from Profes-
sor Hoxha where the students were, based on our 
experiences, loud and disrespectful, we began to 
realize that our frustration was attributed to a 
significant cultural difference in what is consid-
ered acceptable behavior in classrooms in Alba-
nia compared to our experiences in the United 
States.  According to the testimonies of several 
students in the robotics club, students are often 
loud and disrespectful of the professors during 
class.  In the words of one student: 
“If  you don’t want to listen you 
can’t just go outside. You can just 
disturb the others, but everyone 
has to stay inside the class and so 
when they are not interested they 
start fooling around or chatting 
with the others that are not        
interested.” -Club Student 
This helped us to realize that, compared to their 
behavior in their normal classes, the students 
were actually relatively  attentive and respectful 
during our lectures, contrary to our original im-
pression.  There are several possibilities for what 
caused the discrepancy between our lectures and 
their normal classes.  The first possibility is that 
the students had a greater level of respect for us 
as Americans, compared to their normal profes-
sors with whom they were more familiar and felt 
more comfortable being rowdy around.  One stu-
dent described this to us by theorizing that when 
students misbehaved during the lecture by Profes-
sor Hoxha, the students were thinking along the 
lines of: “Oh [the professor is] a cool guy he won’t 
mind if we don’t listen” 
 Although the students, as a whole, were 
indeed more attentive during our lectures than in 
their regular classes, there were still several stu-
dents who would not pay attention during lecture. 
One factor that was pointed out to us by a student 
was that the language barrier likely played a large 
role. According to the student, the English lan-
guage classes that are taught in school focus mainly 
on reading and writing, with less emphasis on 
speaking and listening.  Due to this, students who 
were less fluent in English would tend to tune out 
and not pay attention to lecture.  One group that 
lacked any fluent students, as we noted in our re-
flections, often paid the least attention during lec-
tures, and eventually stopped showing up to class 
entirely.  On two separate occasions, we met with 
Professor Hoxha to discuss repercussions and the 
possibility of withholding credit for completing the 
club for these students.  Once Professor Hoxha 
addressed the issue by speaking to each team, stu-
dents began to work together better and started 
showing up more often. For a while still, however, 
our reflections expressed significant frustration in 
this one team’s apparent lack of effort in the club 
along with the absences of multiple other team 
members on a regular basis.  However, once we 
realized that these students did not seem to be 
nearly as confident in their English-speaking abili-
ties as other members of the club were, we under-
“I appreciate the ideas of the students, but… they tend to build things they already know how to 
build.” -Professor Moisi Xhaferaj 
    
 
31 Chapter 4: Findings 
stood that we did not cater to them nearly 
enough.  It is difficult to say for certain whether 
the two are connected, yet the most likely explana-
tion for this teams lack of participation during club 
time is a feeling of intimidation of being faced with 
native English speakers, discomfort being ap-
proached, and self-consciousness when forced to 
explain themselves 
in an unfamiliar 
language.  This 
team did almost all 
of their work out-
side of class time 
and had one of the 
first robots that 
could drive, but as 
they were never all 
together in the 
club, it was diffi-
cult for us to ob-
serve their team-
work.  In order to 
remedy this dis-
comfort that these 
students exhibited, 
it would have been 
beneficial had we 
enlisted the help 
Professors Moisi 
or Hoxha to repeat 
each of our lectures in Albanian. 
 While the students openly admit to being 
rowdy during their regular classes, it is possible 
that they were especially so during the lecture by 
Professor Hoxha, as several students that day com-
plained that the lecture was too long, taking up 
the entire two hour period, and had too much 
information such that they “could not absorb it 
all.”  As a result, many of the students simply 
shut down and stopped even pretending to pay 
attention to the lecture. Although none of our 
lectures ever lasted a comparable amount of time, 
we found that the stu-
dents were significant-
ly more attentive when 
the lectures were kept 
to between ten and 
twenty minutes in 
length.  This lines up 
with numerous studies 
that state that student 
attention and retention 
of material decreases 
significantly after 15 
minutes (Prince, 
2004).  We chose to 
limit the lecture length 
for several reasons: 
firstly, to avoid the 
information overload 
that the students com-
plained of in Professor 
Hoxha’s lecture, and 
secondly, to keep the 
club fun and different 
from their routine classes.  By the time the stu-
dents arrive at the club, they have spent all day 
sitting in lectures and no longer want to sit 
through any more.  Oftentimes, when students 
were approached to discuss why they were not 
working, they would tell us that they were tired 
from their classes and did not want to work any 
more.  It was important to us that the students not 
only learn as much as possible from the club but 
that they also enjoyed their experience.  Therefore, 
we decided to keep the lectures as short and engag-
ing as possible so that the students could get the 
information they needed and have more time to 
actually work on their robots. 
 In order to facilitate the students’ under-
standing of the material presented, the lecture 
slides were routinely posted on the Google Drive, 
such that the students could review the material 
and have it translated into Albanian if need-
ed.  Several students cited the 
slideshow  presentations that we prepared for each 
lecture as unique and useful elements to their 
learning.  This came as a surprise to us as slide 
show presentations are standard practice in our 
American classes. One student stated: 
“I think the slides play a big role. 
The moment you get visual         
information, it’s much easier to 
memorize it. And also bringing  
examples. Our normal classes are 
more like authority. We write a lot 
we read a lot and it’s always the 
same thing.” -Club Student 
  
  
“In general it’s difficult to maintain the student attention when they work on projects because they 
only see the work side of it but not also fun of it.” -Professor Klarens Hoxha 
Figure 24: Student playing a video game during a club meeting. 
    
 
32 Chapter 4: Findings 
In addition to the lecture slides, the Google Drive 
also provided a space for the students to record 
their ideas and process over the course of the pro-
ject.  To our surprise, only two teams utilized their 
team folders on the drive.  When asked why this 
was, several students expressed that they simply are 
not used to recording their thoughts, or using the 
Google suite in general. While in the United States, 
we, as students, tend to use Google Drive for the 
majority of our studies.  In contrast, the robotics 
club students at the Harry Fultz Institute do 
not.  While a handful of students expressed that 
they found being able to look at lectures on the 
drive as helpful for them, many did not see the 
point in recording their designs on it. In the words 
of one student: 
“The fact that we meet every day 
during school and after school we 
don’t fancy using the Google 
Drive. Physical contact with each 
other is much better.”                      
-Club Student 
 Despite the fact that the Google Drive also 
contained the weekly lecture review surveys, it was 
difficult at first to get any responses.  However, 
this lack of student initiative was supplemented by 
putting the survey on a computer in the classroom 
and asking students to fill it out during club 
time.  In doing this, the responses increased signifi-
cantly.  Many teams chose to fill out the weekly 
surveys together and, as a result, the actual number 
of student participants increased from 4 individuals 
to every team having responded.  One survey, 
however, never received any responses despite 
our best efforts.  The suggestion box, where stu-
dents could point out ways in which the class 
could be improved remained empty for the dura-
tion of the club.  When asked why suggestions or 
feedback were never submitted, nearly all of the 
students stated that they simply did not have any-
thing to suggest.  One student stated that he did 
not know that the survey existed despite us 
bringing it up in several lectures.  This particular 
student was absent for a large portion of lectures, 
which could explain why he did not know about 
it, yet perhaps a better attempt could have been 
made of advertising its existence. 
“Above all we had fun and learned very much, that's very important at the end of the day.”

4.3  Teamwork and Collaboration 
 The students’ teamwork and collaboration 
were analyzed through the following surveys: 
Team Success Potential, Team Evaluation, Student 
Reflection, as well as through our personal reflec-
tions as mentors. As discussed in the process sec-
tion, the Team Success Potential survey was filled 
out each day by mentors and was influenced by 
Adams’ seven constructs for successful team be-
havior (Adams, Zafft, Molano, & Rao, 2008).  We 
ranked a team with a low score in a construct if 
they did not fulfill its expectations and a high score 
if they did. A limitation with this method of scor-
ing teams is that even though we predefined what 
each level of scoring meant, as mentors, we may 
have filled out the survey differently depending on 
what we experienced with that team or how we 
understood the ranking system. The teams did not 
know that these constructs that we were ranking 
them in existed until the fourth week. We met with 
each team and gave the teams overall scores for 
each construct, and we explained the observed 
progress in their teamwork and work ethic.  In 
these meetings, we also showed the students a 
graph, as seen in figure 15 that illustrated their pro-
gress over time, and explained why certain days 
had lower scores than others.  The lower dips were 
often due to a student not showing up, so a team 
would be clueless of what to do, only one person 
would actually be working, or they wouldn’t be 
listening to each other.  One student said, “I was 
very impressed with the graph [the WPI students] 
had made us and that helped us understand how 
important each every one of us in this group [is].” 
An example of the feedback provided to the stu-
dents can be seen in “3.2.2: Student teamwork” 
section of the process chapter. 
 The student body president, a member of 
team Alpha, who has previously held a team lead-
ership position on the a school newspaper said, 
“I love to cooperate and I adapt very much to my 
teammates, and I want to make them think the 
way I think. This is very important to me. I have 
studied for that, and I read a lot about that.” 
These thoughts strongly identify with few of Ad-
ams’ constructs, namely common purpose, psy-
chological safety, mature communication, and pro-
ductive conflict resolution. Furthering the support 
for these constructs, team Alpha was consistently 
ranked among the highest two teams in the Team 
Success Potential, as shown in figure 25. Their ex-
emplary teamwork and work ethic was what al-
lowed them to build the robot which ultimately 
won the competition.  Using the constructs was a 
simple way to understand what teams seemed to be 
functioning better than others; however, the teams 
with the highest scores do not perfectly correlate 
to the teams which ended up in the final rounds of 
the competition. 
“I think robotics is a necessity of nowadays for the students to understand the technology and to 
find answers for everything.” -Professor Klarens Hoxha 
Figure 25: Averages of Each Team in Each Construct from the Team Success Potential Survey Completed Daily by WPI 
Mentors 
    
 
34 Chapter 4: Findings 
Teams Alpha and E-4 had the highest 
scores throughout, and we had predicted in our 
reflections that one of them were going to win. 
From our study, its difficult to determine if a team 
that scores well in these constructs will 
be  successful, as Edge Logic made it to the final 
round of the competition. It is likely this method 
of analysis did not predict which teams will be 
most successful in winning the game due to the 
unpredictability of robotics competitions. Exam-
ples of the technical difficulties that ensued during 
the competition include boost converters blowing, 
failed USB/Bluetooth connections, and accidental-
ly cutting wires due to poor placement. This was 
even supported by the previous year’s WPI team, 
who suggested that in robotics, the success of the 
final product is not a good indicator of the amount 
of work put in (Titus et al., 2016). Figure 25 does 
provide a good understanding of which teams had 
a better club experience, as Vortex usually consist-
ed of two working members, and Caliber consisted 
of only one on a typical day.  Through the feed-
back we gave to each team, our hope was to raise 
awareness of the students’ teamwork skills in order 
to prepare them better for future teamwork experi-
ences. Most of our data comes from the teams that 
were doing well, as they were the most open to 
spending time giving responses. The teams that 
were lacking members were usually the most busy, 
so they did not contribute a lot of time to answer-
ing surveys.  This means that it was hard for us to 
gauge if the students benefited from reflecting up-
on their experience through speaking with us and 
through surveys, as not every student participated 
in every survey and those that did did not give par-
ticularly detailed answers. 
 According to figure 25, the constructs 
that the teams, as a whole, scored lowest in in 
were overall teamwork, role clarity, and accounta-
ble interdependence. All of which can be based 
off of each other. When students were not show-
ing up to fulfill their role on the team, others had 
to sit around without accomplishing anything 
while trying to contact that teammate or step up 
and fill their role. Upon reflection, this is why we 
scored teams lower in those categories.  
 At the end of each day, we would each 
individually reflect on our experience in the class-
room, addressing things that particularly stuck 
out to us about the student teams or how we felt 
about any situations that were worked 
through.  The codes that were used to analyze 
our reflections are shown in table 4. These codes 
can be related to the constructs in the Team Suc-
cess Potential Survey, especially to those that the 
teams scored lowest in: overall teamwork, role 
clarity, and accountable interdependence.  As our 
reflections allowed us to record events while they 
were still fresh in our minds, we were able to 
keep track of the students teamwork over the 
course of the club. By coding these reflections 
for the quality of student teamwork, it was found 
that we observed good teamwork almost twice as 
much as bad teamwork, as this was what we saw 
a lot of and was most notable to us, but also what 
we expanded upon the most. We wrote about 
teams ignoring their problems just as much as 
teams fixing their problems, and more often not-
ed when students were engaged compared to 
when they were not. We also took note of when 
we saw students working outside of their special-
ties and when we saw students slacking, which can 
be compared to the amount of times we addressed 
everything else.  
""You should work a lot, but not too much, so you have to work exactly how much time you have.”

35 Chapter 4: Findings 
The Team Evaluation and Student Reflec-
tion surveys were filled out by the students to-
wards the end of the project. According to the 
chart in figure 27, when reviewing their teammates, 
a very small number of students addressed issues 
with their teammates or gave suggestions for im-
provement. These issues included communication, 
role clarity, and engagement between teammates. A 
vast majority of the students gave positive feed-
back for every team member. Upon reading 
through the comments, while some students did 
take the opportunity to address their teammates’ 
strengths and some of those comments may have 
been deserved, it’s more likely due to how many 
students ranked their teammates high and submit-
ted simple answers as to why they did so, such as 
“Because he's good.” instead of taking the time to 
dig deeper. We believe the numbers of substantial 
criticisms are low not just because of time con-
straints, but because the students do not have ex-
perience reflecting on their experiences. According 
to Professor Moisi Xhaferaj, the students have 
never even kept lab notebooks in their classes. Al-
so, the students are not normally exposed to many 
teamwork opportunities. One club member who is 
also the president of the physics club explained 
that the only teams he worked on before were 
through physics or robotics. Because of the lack of 
teamwork experience, we assume it was difficult 
for the students to both form expectations for how 
their team should operate and reflect upon what 
issues they were having as a team simultaneous-
ly.  On top of this, even though the students were 
told they could fill out the surveys in Albanian, 
very few ever did. One student in particular, from 
team Caliber, always enlisted the help of a mem-
ber of team Edge Logic to complete the surveys 
in English.   These inferred reasons also explain 
the lack of constructive criticism or feedback that 
we received about our lectures or how the club 
was run. 
 Students had the opportunity to submit 
any additional comments in the Team Evaluation 
Survey to discuss what they thought of their time, 
and most of the surveys lacked a response. Stu-
dents would submit short, simple phrases such 
as, “My team will win.” and, “We [are the] best.” 
instead of truly reflecting or suggesting that there 
was room for improvement in the two weeks be-
fore the competition. A couple of thoughtful re-
sponses that still did not dig very deep included, 
“All in all, I'm lucky to be in a team that gets along 
as individuals and function smoothly to make the 
best robot we can.” and, “At the end of the day we 
are proud for our group and the robot we are 
building, so for me this is the most important 
thing.”  
 The Student Reflection Survey had eleven 
responses providing slightly more in depth than 
the Team Evaluation Survey. The graph in figure 
28 shows how many students addressed teamwork 
and what their general feelings about their experi-
ences were.  As one student stated, “Our team had 
a pretty good work progress. [A WPI mentor] actu-
ally pointed out that we were a little separated in 
work groups but I think that's a good thing. I had 
really good communication with our programmer 
and that helped us a lot.”  A member of the same 
team explained, ""Our group consist in four mem-
bers, which we work in pairs by two, keeping two 
works at the same time. If one of two pairs finish 
the work, try to help the other pair to keep things 
in the way, and mostly to save more time."" The 
majority of the time the responses were pretty gen-
eral and did not involve significant reflection or 
analysis. An example of this is ”The team wasn’t so 
productive”, coming from a student that built ma-
jority of the robot himself.

so far at the halfway point through the brainstorm-

ing activity, 65% addressed teamwork. This was a 
relatively knew experience for the students, so 
teamwork stuck out as something new that they 
had to learn. When asked what they had learned in 
the robotics club, the majority of students re-
sponded that they learned how to work in teams as 
can be seen in the word cloud in figure 29. 
 As stresses increased, and as the competi-
tion drew closer, more team members were found 
working outside of their specializations than in first 
weeks of the club.  A student that started the club 
more interested in electronics said in the Student 
Reflection Survey: 
 
“I learned how to use the Arduino 
and program it to do different 
tasks and by doing so I learned 
that I am capable of  program-
ming if  I broaden my horizon on 
this field.” -Club Student 
 This may be attributed to certain team 
members not contributing to the project and the 
increased working hours that were necessary to 
finish the robots on time.  Due to their obliga-
tions of classes, jobs, and homework, some stu-
dents spent more hours working than others on 
things that may have been accomplished by a 
teammate. A member of team Alpha addressed in 
the Student Reflection Survey, “We had one prob-
lem in our team last week about the absences of 
the group leader. We found a solution and it is not 
going to happen again. Hope to work harder and 
longer this week.” However, some teams were not 
able to address and find solutions to the difficulties 
they were having.  One student took on a lot of 
extra work, as a teammate of his became so frus-
trated with the programming, that he had to give 
up on it. This student expressed through an anony-
mous survey, “I had to do the rest by myself...if it 
wasn’t for me the robot would not move at all.” 
 Though it is likely that expanding beyond 
students’ specializations was due to team issues, it 
""“In the robotics club I learned that only one person can’t do anything, but if we are in group, the 
project will be done in a short period of time and it will be successful.” -Club Student

 allowed students the opportunity to realize new 
interests or confirm original ones. When asked 
what he learned in his time at the club, a student 
said, “Me personally, I learned much more about 
programming. As a senior year for me, robotics 
also helped me decide better for my studies. I saw 
where I was better.”  A quote from another stu-
dent- “Maybe I will go for electronics and electrical 
engineering, then I’m going to go for mechatron-
ics, or robotics. If I don’t fit that very well, I will 
try artificial intelligence“- confirmed what we were 
emphasizing to the students over the course of the 
project: as high school students, they may not 
know exactly what they want to do, what they per-
form well doing, or what they most enjoy.  We 
wanted to give the students the opportunity 
through the competition to realize their interests 
through practice. A student said that the thing he 
liked most about the club was, “that we have the 
opportunity to just try everything out and just ex-
periment with everything.”  When a student was 
asked about his experiences with the club, he said, 
“I want to study, later, electronics or electrical en-
gineering, so this is going to help me very much. 
Also, the teamwork, is very important, in all your 
life, and this is a good example of how you can do 
it.”   
 We arrived at the classroom two hours pri-
or to the official start of the club each day in order 
to be more available to the students and provide 
assistance in overcoming challenges.  Due to the 
smaller number of students that attended these 
early hours, we observed students discussing their 
ideas and asking each other for help, contributing 
to inter-team collaboration.  Teams came to each 
others aid in the weeks before the concluding event of the project, where they would be competing 
against each other. 
“I learnt a lot this year, starting from my teammates, I learnt how well we can co-
operate if  we put our thoughts together by sharing ideas, even with other groups, 
we got so well with each other, even with the other groups, which we were sup-
posed to be opponents with each other, we were friendly instead, but not for long, 
when the competition is about to start, we will have to choose [to be opponents], 
in order that the competition would not be boring,” - a robotics student regarding 
completing their robot the day before the competition. 
 The quote is quite nuanced. The student notes that she can count on others beyond her team-
mates for help, but understands that while collaboration would lead to a more successful project, she 
would be competing against them in the end.  Based on an analysis of our reflections, we found that the 
vast majority of times that teams collaborated with each other, it was to help each other and to share ide-
as. There was rarely any conflict between the teams despite the competitive atmosphere. 
""Each of us has decided to make a design… to combine them together in order to have a final design 
that all of us can agree."" -Club Student

4.4 Feasibility of Robotics        
Education Expansion 
 Robotics is a complex subject with many 
contributing factors, and expanding robotics edu-
cation is equally complex.  The point of the section 
is to map out the key components and relation-
ships that support robotics education in the USA , 
and to compare the American example (figure 30) 
with the current state of robotics in Albania (figure 
31). The following discussion, is based solely on 
our collective experience as American robotics stu-
dents. 
 
“[The club] was an immediate hit and it's been growing since then along with our school               
population.” -Besnik Zylka 
In figure 30, the three cycles shown need a catalyzing 
moment or action in order to set each cycle in mo-
tion.  They can be initialized and self-sustained with 
just three things: interest, a mentor, and a competi-
tion.  These cycles include club alumni returning as 
mentors, team-generated interest encouraging new 
members to join, and competitions fueling the for-
mation and continuation of robotics teams.  Take, 
for example, that through the introduction of WPI 
robotics mentors in 2014, and the additional intro-
duction of a competition in 2016, the Harry Fultz 
Institute was able to create and sustain a robotics 
club of its own, albeit with the assistance of mentors 
from WPI.  Through the informal outreach of the 
students and professors involved in the club, more 
students applied each year, ensuring the continuation 
of the club.  Further, after the initial year, students 
returning to the club served as peer mentors to the 
more novice members.  In our personal experience, 
these cycles, once initiated, continue to operate with 
minimal issues year after year.

 In figure 30, we have identified the key ele-
ments and parties that contribute to the creation 
and sustainability of a robotics team and the educa-
tion system that supports it.  While this is not a 
comprehensive list by any means, these key ele-
ments fall into four main categories: interest, edu-
cation, facilitation, and goals.  Several parties, such 
as the government and local businesses, contribute 
to each key element.  Each of these will be dis-
cussed in turn. 
INTEREST 
Robotics teams cannot exist without the following 
interested parties: students to participate, individu-
als to mentor, and companies to provide sup-
port.  Interest in robotics is encouraged by school 
programs, clubs, and through competitions; it is 
generated through participation and conversation. 
Outreach spreads the general awareness of the ro-
botics team to more parties, including organiza-
tions, donors, and other students- some of which 
end up joining as new team members.  Through 
outreach, such as fundraisers and presentations, 
sponsors and general funding can be obtained for 
the team as well as other educational opportunities 
and resources. 
EDUCATION 
Robotics education in the US encourages teachers 
at the high school and college level who specialize 
in one aspect of robotics- physics, electrical engi-
neering, or programming- to collaborate on a ro-
“ If they go to purely electronics, they have to understand one thing: we don’t have factories here 
that produce electronics components” -Professor Moisi Xhaferaj 
botics curriculum.  Oftentimes, teachers will de-
cide to become coaches for robotics 
teams.  Since they still do not know everything 
about robotics, they learn along with the stu-
dents, and assist with administrative processes as 
well as providing knowledge and guidance to the 
team.  Alongside these coaches, robotics mentors 
also sometimes play a role in a team’s collective 
education.  These mentors are typically either 
alumni from past iterations of the robotics team 
or are provided by an outside source, such as a 
sponsoring organization or company, and pro-
vide guidance through hands-on experience ra-
ther than just theoretical knowledge.  In the in-
stance that a gap in the knowledge base exists, an 
overabundance of external resources exist to sup-
plement educators, mentors, and coaches of all 
levels. 
FACILITATION 
As mentioned, coaches also play an additional 
role in team management and facilitation.  In the 
context of a robotics team, facilitation is the act 
of assisting the team in obtaining tangible assets, 
through funding or action from school admin-
istrations.  One of the foremost assets for any 
team, the materials to construct the robot, is ob-
tained through raising external funding from 
fundraisers or sponsors, such as technology-
focused companies, or even grants from govern-
ment or non-government organizations.  Local 
technology-focused companies, such as the Bose 
Corporation near WPI, sponsor teams not only 
as a means of advertising, as their logo is shown 
during presentations and competitions, but also 
for tax purposes as the American federal tax code 
incentivizes such charitable actions.  The govern-
ment also sometimes provides grants to teams and 
schools looking to expand their robotics pro-
gram.  The school administration also, along with 
the team’s coach or manager, assists the team by 
allocating appropriate time and space for them to 
meet and construct the robot.  Additionally, the 
administration helps organize the necessary trans-
portation to and from competitions, and other 
larger logistics.  
GOAL 
A productive robotics team works together to-
wards a common goal, typically to be successful in 
competitions against other robotics 
teams.   Additionally, in our collective experience, 
members have joined robotics teams in order to 
gain experience in engineering, gaining valuable 
problem solving skills which can, in turn, help stu-
dents when applying to higher education, intern-
ships, or job opportunities.

Robotics in Albania 
 When discussing the potential for robotics 
expansion in Albania, the same graphic seen in fig-
ure 30 was compared and edited against infor-
mation gathered from the interviews we conducted 
with Professor Besnik Zylka of the Tirana Interna-
tional School, Professor Moisi Xhaferaj, Professor 
Klarens Hoxha of the Harry Fultz Institute, and 
Aida Hudhri an educational advisor at Educa-
tionUSA.  As can be seen in figure 31, many of the 
links that support robotics teams in the United 
States are missing in Albania.  Our research identi-
fied several key missing components that, in effect, 
facilitate supporting relationships for robotics 
teams in the US to flourish. 
“Here in Albania, we tend to be really bureaucratic state in general...and we tend to stop ourselves, 
like the progress, we stop the technology progress with bureaucracy” -Professor Moisi Xhaferaj 
Figure 31: Map Highlighting the Key Components and Relationships Missing from Robotics Education in Albania  
    
Chapter 4: Findings 41 
Facilitation and Funding 
 The primary barriers to robotics education 
in Albania are facilitation and funding.  While 
school administrations have helped to set up select 
robotics programs- namely the Harry Fultz Insti-
tute’s robotics club, FIRST Global team at the Ti-
rana International School, and robotics classes at 
Preca College (Hudhri, A., 2017) -, funding for ma-
terials and other essential assets has been cited as a 
challenge (Zylka, B., 2017; Xhaferaj, M., 2017; 
Hoxha, K., 2017).  This can be traced back to mo-
tivating factors and a perceived lack of technology-
focused companies in the area.  According to Pro-
fessor Zylka, some funding can be obtained from 
school administrations, and some from local fund-
raising, but getting businesses to donate is chal-
lenging in its own right, as “Philanthropy, or giving 
money away, is not subsidized by the state. There's 
no tax write-off...” (2017). Without some incentive 
to do so, companies are less likely to provide mon-
ey to purchase materials for robotics or to support 
teachers and coaches, which in effect cancels out 
the opportunity for schools to provide robotics 
opportunities to students, if another source of 
money, such as charitable donations, is unavailable. 
Materials 
 Alongside the challenge of obtaining exter-
nal  funding from companies, one-time donors, 
and grants, teams are faced with the issue of ob-
taining parts.  The Harry Fultz Institute club was 
not the only robotics organization to encounter 
this issue.  When discussing the issue and high cost 
of receiving essential parts for his team, Professor 
Zylka said “You just have to deal with it and pay 
20% over what it is at customs and you have to 
pay all of that nice shipping cost 
[too]” (2017).  This tariff, which was confirmed by 
Professor Moisi, charges an extra 20% on what-
ever is passing through customs if the evaluated 
price is greater than a particular benchmark.  This 
causes a great deal of strain on the coaches and 
other facilitators to get parts to their teams, con-
sidering more money must be spent on fewer 
materials.  Should the tariff be reduced or re-
moved entirely, it would allow more teams to 
acquire the parts necessary to maintain a func-
tioning robot.  Furthermore, if parts for robotics 
were manufactured in Albania, the cost would be 
cheaper and there would be, arguably, less de-
lays.  The shortage of factories that produce elec-
tronic components in Albania was cited as not 
only a leading reason to order the parts from 
abroad but also a discouraging factor for students 
to pursue STEM education in the first place 
(Xhaferaj, M., 2017).   
Interest 
 Regardless of the constraints on robotics 
education in Albania, students have shown a keen 
interest in robotics both at the Harry Fultz Insti-
tute and elsewhere in Tirana.  This interest has 
been observed at outreach events and competi-
tions that took place throughout the time of this 
project.  While the students involved may not 
have the ability to push for institutional change 
themselves, the pressure they can exert on their 
school administrations or on their parents help 
form new robotics programs.  Student interest 
continues to be generated by outreach, both for-
mally with the use of such presentations and 
competitions or informally via student interac-
tions, but without an outlet such as a class or a 
team to participate in, this interest and student 
potential will go untapped. 
 
Outlets 
 Earlier, it was discussed that students join 
teams in the United States in the hopes of being 
more easily admitted to an institution of higher 
education, internship, or simply to participate in 
the competition the team is geared for.  While a 
couple of robotics competitions have been ob-
served within Albania, the shortage of higher edu-
cation opportunities presents an issue to students 
seeking such higher degrees.  As stated in the back-
ground chapter, an estimated 80% of students who 
seek higher education with the help of Educa-
tionUSA choose to pursue applied sciences, such 
as computer science or electrical engineering 
(Hudhri, A., personal communication, December 
4, 2017), outside of Albania, pointing to what 
many see as a shortage of opportunities within the 
country.  This was also seen with several of the 
Harry Fultz robotics club, who discussed the insti-
tutions they were interested in based in Germany, 
the United Kingdom, or France.  With students 
leaving the country to pursue higher education 
elsewhere, the population available to be mentors 
in STEM environments stays small, reducing the 
likelihood of robotics teams forming. 
 In addition to limited higher education op-
portunities for robotics within Albania, few intern-
ship opportunities are available for students inter-
ested in STEM.  Both Professors Moisi and Hoxha 
stated that, at the time of this project, students at 
the Harry Fultz Institute did not have opportuni-
ties similar in fashion to internships offered in the 
United States, but did praise the concept, saying 
“...it would be really good to have one in place, you 
go there and you measure yourself up to the [other 
employees] there” (M. Xhaferaj, personal commu-
nication, November 16, 2017).  The perceived lack 
of companies offering partnerships with the Harry 
 
    
 
42 Chapter 4: Findings 
Fultz Institute, despite being a well established 
high school in the region, is not indicative of the 
regional trend; however, it does go to show that 
students of well established institutions preparing 
to enter the workforce are lacking in work experi-
ence opportunities outside of the class-
room.  Without established competitions, higher 
education opportunities, or potential intern-
ships,  student motivation may wane along with 
the energy and commitment to robotics clubs.  Ba-
zylev et al. (2014) discovered that, for students to 
value their experiences and learn the most, they 
must be motivated by some ulterior motivating 
factor, such as a competition.  In order to initiate 
and maintain student involvement in a robotics 
program, such a motivating factor needs to be in 
place. 
 As discussed, robotics education is a com-
plex topic, and the many sources and elements es-
sential for robotics teams are vastly interconnect-
ed.  Student opportunity, being a multi-pronged 
issue with a perceived shortage of solutions, is not 
the sole detriment to current formation of robotics 
programs in Albania, considering that government 
participation, or the lack thereof, also causes rip-
ples throughout the web of organizations de-
scribed in figure 31.  Despite this, some advances 
are being made on this front, as seen in Professor 
Zylka’s plan to establish his own non-
governmental organization solely for the wide-
spread implementation of robotics. 
“When it comes down to funding, they need to be the right person or know the right person.     
Funding is impossible.” -Professor Besnik Zylka

5.0: Conclusions 
 The overarching goal for this project was 
to help the robotics club students at the Harry 
Fultz Institute to learn about robotics and apply 
that knowledge to build robots that would com-
pete in a final game. The term “success” when re-
ferring to this project means understanding how 
we could best assist the students in developing a 
passion for robotics and gaining essential experi-
ence in teamwork in a fun and enjoyable environ-
ment with cross-cultural mentors.  Over the course 
of this project, we came to realize that it took time 
for the students to develop the teamwork skills 
necessary to function together effectively; for many 
of them, if not all, this was their first experience 
working in teams.  We also observed that, despite 
being averse to it in the beginning of the six weeks, 
the student teams were willing to collaborate to 
solve common problems.  Outside of the club, we 
assessed the feasibility of expanding robotics.  In 
doing this, we observed that several key elements 
that allow for the success of established programs 
in the United States were missing in Albania.  
5.1: Limitations and                       
Recommendations 
 While the majority of feedback we received 
was positive, not every student expressed their 
views.  This may be attributed to the fact that the 
students knew we would be reading the results of 
the surveys, even though there was an option for 
them to remain anonymous. In talking with the 
students and professors, the students are not usual-
ly asked to give feedback on their classroom expe-
riences, however, so it is likely that they did not 
know what constructive feedback to give. Our 
surveys were certainly flawed, as they failed to 
trigger more reflective responses. We found it 
difficult to phrase questions in a way that they 
guided the students but were not leading them. 
Limited time to explore the students’ feelings 
about the opportunity or environment of the ro-
botics club frustrated us throughout the course 
of the club.  Because the students had less than 
six weeks to design and finish their robots, much 
more time was spent focusing on the physical 
products instead of the effects on the students’ 
thoughts about the development of their skills or 
desires to continue their development.  Many tech-
nical problems arose during our time with the stu-
dents, and it was often difficult to interject during 
the times the club met in order to further explore 
this topic.  Many times we would walk into the 
classroom and immediately be greeted by frustrat-
ed students clamoring for help on a particular 
problem.  Further, we wanted to maintain a more 
“When you get out of technical school, like here, professional development is something you have 
and you can produce actual things.” -Professor Moisi Xhaferaj

professional mentor-mentee relationship with the 
students. Therefore, we did not meet with the stu-
dents outside of the classroom. This would have 
allowed us more time to explore the students’ 
thoughts, expectations, and experience, but our 
concerns caused our direct interactions with the 
students to be limited to the hours the club would 
meet every day. Admittedly, our own limitations 
are what truly kept us from meeting with the stu-
dents outside the club, as the thought of maintain-
ing two separate relationships: one that was profes-
sional and one that was friendly, made us nervous. 
We did not know how it would affect our class-
room dynamic, and we did not want to risk it. 
 Were the students given access to the pro-
ject, game rules, and materials that would be availa-
ble one month prior to the start date, they would 
have had more time to experience the engineering 
design process.  This allotted month would have 
allowed design-, programming-, and electronic-
inclined teammates time to thoroughly discuss a 
general plan for the competition and use computer 
aided design programs, such as Autodesk Inventor, 
to generate a more complete design, before ever 
touching materials.  As the students had prior ex-
perience with AutoCAD through the Harry Fultz 
Institute, it would not be difficult for the students 
to experiment and become familiar with Autodesk 
Inventor, considering they are similar software de-
veloped by the same company.  Further, the pro-
fessors at the Harry Fultz Institute have the 
knowledge base and skills that would make it pos-
sible to guide the students through the early stages 
of the design process and motivate them with the 
prospect of receiving their parts.  With more time 
to pursue the engineering design process, stu-
dents could be prevented from jumping straight 
into the project with the first idea they came up 
with and relying primarily on trial and error to 
achieve at their final design, while maximizing the 
use of their materials and time along the way. By 
devoting much of the club time in the beginning 
weeks to design, many teams were scrambling to 
finish tasks such as programming by the end; and 
few teams were able to tackle the problem of 
building an autonomous program at all. 
 Despite the building time lost to design, 
construction speed for each robot was greatly im-
proved through the parts that we sup-
plied.  Accumulating donations and buying VEX 
mechanical sets prior to arriving in Albania certain-
ly reduced the stress on us- as components did not 
need to be manufactured- as well as the stu-
dents.  While we brought parts with us from the 
USA,  the  parts the school ordered from, such as 
DC motors, were delayed several weeks.  The delay 
of the DC motors presented the greatest obstacle, 
""There’s not only the skill part, there’s also the dedication part."" -Professor Moisi Xhaferaj

Chapter 5: Conclusions 46 
as many students used their absence as an excuse 
not to work. It was difficult for us to make it clear 
to the students that it was possible to focus on dif-
ferent aspects of their robots or at least possible to 
better prepare their robots for when the motors 
did arrive. When the motors finally came in, these 
teams felt rushed and frustrated, needed to decon-
struct and reconstruct their chassis, and failed to 
test their robots until the last few days before the 
competition. We shared this feeling of frustration 
with the students, as they felt they could not con-
tinue, and we felt we could not make them under-
stand how to keep working. We wanted to see the 
students making progress; however, we had to ac-
cept that at certain points for certain teams, there 
was nothing that we could do about the situation 
apart from distribute what motors we did have for 
the teams to test programs with. Though the com-
petition was a success, this demonstrates that in a 
project with a restricted time table, such as this six 
week club, it is critical that the appropriate compo-
nents are gathered ahead of time to reduce as 
much stress as possible on both the students and 
mentors.   
 The information presented herein concern-
ing the expansion of robotics education was signif-
icantly curtailed by the availability of 
sources.  Interviews with several key informants- 
such as representatives from Protik, the Ministry of 
Education, and assorted public and private schools 
throughout Albania- failed to take place, despite 
our efforts.  Various methods of contacting these 
representatives were implemented, however, re-
plies were never received.  Therefore, the infor-
mation presented is largely dependent on a smaller 
sample of interviews and our own personal experi-
ences. With the information we were able to ob-
tain, we would like to recommend two courses of 
action in respect to Albanian robotics education 
in regards to the Harry Fultz Institute and 
throughout Albania. 
 We recommend that the Harry Fultz In-
stitute look into establishing a VEX robotics 
competition team in the near future.  When com-
pared to other established international competi-
tions, VEX is inexpensive to participate in and 
has teams from numerous countries around the 
world.  Should the Harry Fultz Institute be home 
to the only VEX team in all of Albania, they 
would immediately qualify to participate in the 
annual international competition.  With the metal 
kits and parts provided to the robotics club this 
year, the Harry Fultz Institute is well situated to 
begin the transition into starting a team and par-
ticipating in VEX competitions.  VEX robotics 
also supplies its own curriculum and lessons that 
have been used in classrooms around the world, 
a helpful resource in the instance the leaders of 
the club feel they do not possess adequate 
knowledge for a particular topic.  In general, ac-
cess to robotics parts and funding is necessary 
for the success of robotics education. In order to 
set something in motion, we recommend reach-
ing out to organizations outside of Albania, such 
as the U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID), the Peace Corps, or a similar Eu-
ropean non-profit to sponsor events that may 
raise awareness and funding. 
5.2: Ethics 
 The primary ethical concerns for this pro-
ject involve providing an opportunity for stu-
dents to engage in STEM in a country where 
such opportunities for students that want to pur-
sue it are lacking beyond high school.  Instilling a 
passion for robotics was our hope, but we do not 
want our work to lead to a feeling of frustration 
among the Harry Fultz Institute students by em-
phasizing  a lack of local opportunity for them, and 
a world of opportunity for us.  Additionally, 
throughout our time here, we have taken note of 
who robotics education is accessible to, and for the 
most part, it seems that students at private schools 
receiving specialized educations, such as at the 
Harry Fultz Institute or Tirana International 
School, have the most opportunity.  Though we 
were unable to contact the Ministry of Education 
or any public schools in our time here, to our un-
derstanding, public school students do not have 
any robotics opportunities.  The ethical issue be-
ing, robotics education should not only be offered 
to those with money. For these reasons, we hope 
our interviews created the beginnings of a conver-
sation among students, schools, and organizations 
that will stimulate the growth of robotics education 
within Albania 
5.3: Reflection 
 Overall, this project has been a great expe-
rience for all of us.  We learned how to solve prob-
lems under various pressures such as when parts 
are delayed due to circumstances out of our con-
trol or when students weren't paying atten-
tion.  When issues with the students arose, we did 
our best to understand their perspective and tune 
our teaching and mentoring styles to better main-
tain student attention and interest.  Each of us be-
came more confident in our abilities as teachers 
and mentors as we worked to adapt to the stu-
dents’ needs through increased communication 
and knowledge of the material, as well as pushing 
the boundaries of our personal comfort 
zones.  Each of us had our own shortcomings as 
well as strong-suits with regards to different as-
    
 
47 Chapter 5: Conclusions 
pects of this project.  We had varying levels of ro-
botics knowledge, public speaking skills, and lead-
ership abilities.  Our shortcomings in any of these 
skills contributed to an overall sense of frustration 
early on in this project, as we worked to improved 
ourselves in the areas we were the weakest. 
In addition to this, it was inspiring to watch the 
students grow and begin to develop the essentials 
skills to become capable engineers over the course 
of the six weeks of this project.  They repeatedly 
came up with innovative new ideas and began im-
plementing them with less and less requests for 
help.  Each team individually came up with unique 
designs for their robots, reinforcing the fact that 
there is more than one way to approach a prob-
lem.  Over the course of our time with the stu-
dents, it was interesting to see how their attitudes 
became friendlier and more open towards us over 
time.  In the beginning of our presence at the club, 
we were repeatedly referenced as “the foreigners” 
in student survey responses. One student, in the 
first weeks of the club stated: “Each of the foreign-
ers was very cheerful and happy to take on any 
question we would throw at them.” This seemed to 
be the overarching first impression of us as men-
tors to the club.  The students became more famil-
iar with us over time which allowed us to develop 
positive mentor-mentee relationships.  Being able 
to joke with the students and be a part of their ro-
botics experience helped each of us grow as we 
became more confident, yet humbled, mentors and 
individuals.  Throughout this project, we not only 
learned how to communicate across cultural 
boundaries, but also how to communicate with 
people of different backgrounds and personalities 
in general.  We feel that this has been the most 
valuable team experience thus far in our time at 
WPI, as the lessons learned about how our team 
and others’ function when dealing with stress, 
frustration and when in close contact for extend-
ed periods of time will provide valuable experi-
ence when managing future teamwork-based pro-
jects.  We also believe this is an important skill 
that we will carry with us as students, employees, 
and into any other roles life may put us in.   
Our priority was supporting our students through-
out this process and evaluating what we could do 
that was most beneficial for them, which led to 
sacrificing some of the hands-on activities and self-
directed learning opportunities that were originally 
planned.  Through the experience we were able to 
provide and the environment we were able to cre-
ate, the students saw the value in teamwork, in 
keeping an open mind, and in expanding their in-
terests.  In this, we pride ourselves. 
""This experience has really helped me to become more confident both in myself as well as my ability 
as an engineer.” -Rebecca Miles

Semi-Structured Interviews with Outside Organiza-
tions: 
Script 
We are a group of students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 
Massachusetts, USA.  We are working with the robotics club at the Harry 
Fultz Institute on a competition. We are interested in learning more about 
how to include other schools in the city or region in a robotics competition 
and would like to learn your views. Your participation in this interview is com-
pletely voluntary and you may withdraw at any time.  This interview will take 
approximately 30-40 minutes.  Please remember that your answers will remain 
confidential.  No names or identifying information will appear in any of the 
project reports or publications unless consent is given. Your participation is 
greatly appreciated.  If interested, a copy of our results can be provided at the 
conclusion of the study. 
We can be reached via email at a17robotics@wpi.edu. 
Protocol 
 Coordinate time and location for the interview such that they are con-
venient for the Outside Organization.  Should an in person interview not 
be possible, a video-meeting could be conducted instead, though this is 
not recommended. 
 If applicable, submit predefined list of questions and or topics to the 
interviewee such that they have ample time to consider responses.  The 
questions should likely be reviewed by the project advisor(s) prior to sub-
mission. 
 After introductions and making the interviewee aware of the infor-
mation presented in our script, reconfirm permission to audibly record the 
interview, and give brief summary of what the interview is designed to 
achieve. 
 The interviewers should consist of two to four project members, busi-
ness casually dressed, who remain professional at all times.  Interviewers 
can share the responsibility to ask questions if necessary, though it’s not 
required.   
 During the interview, interviewers should note interesting points or 
other notable facts and the time of the interview.  These points should 
later be reviewed and transcribed from the recording if deemed signifi-
cant.   
 Interviewers should promote the responses of the interviewee by re-
maining attentive and with periodic affirmations of understanding, but 
   
53 
Appendix B: Interview Protocol and Questions 
 
should also avoid changing the contented of the conversation extensively 
by seeming overly interested or excited about a topic.  The interviewers 
should attempt to keep a calm but positive persona, regardless of topic.  
 After completion of the predefined topics, the interviewers should 
bring up a limited number (0-2) of additional topics if deemed pertinent to 
the conversation.  The interviewers should also prompt the interviewee 
for any other topics they would like to share.   
 The interviewers should then thank the interviewee and conclude the 
meeting.  Later, the Interviewers should follow up with an email, if possi-
ble, thanking the interviewee for their time and responses.   
 The interviewers should transcribe written notes to the Drive, and link 
to uploaded recording.

ppendix C: Brainstorming Procedure and Questions 
Protocol: 
 The exercise should be completed in a distraction-free environment as possible.  It should be conducted by one group member, though others may be in 
attendance.   
 Each participants of the sample group should be provided paper and a writing utensil.   
 The format of the exercise should be explained clearly, though the overall purpose of collecting the data (i.e.  what it will be analyzed for) should not be 
revealed.  Should a participant be concerned, they should be informed that responses are optional yet encouraged, and they should not feel pressured. 
 The conducting member should ensure that participants are informed that there are no correct answers, and that they should simply write what comes to 
mind, without much additional thought.   
 The conducting member should ensure that the participants know that the responses are anonymous, and that their name should not be written on it.   
 The conducting member should read a question aloud to the students. During this the conducting member should attempt to not speak or risk influenc-
ing the answers.   
 At the end of the question period, the papers should be collected and the participants should be thanked.   
Questions 
 What have you learned in robotics club so far? 
 What is necessary for a winning robotics team? 
 What things can robots be used for in Albania? 
 What do you like/dislike about the Robotics Club?

Appendix H: Game Manual 
 
Objectives: 
Teams will present the knowledge that they have learned throughout the 
course in the form of a remote controlled robot that is able to collect and 
score objects on the field. At the end of the match, the team with the highest 
number of points will win. 
1.0 Gameplay: General Rules 
1.1 Common sense applies to all rules. 
1.2 All referee decisions regarding rules of play and judgements are final 
1.3 Any team that attempts to damage or pin robots, or otherwise violate the 
rules of the game will be disqualified and automatically lose the match. This 
includes flipping. 
1.3.1 A robot is considered pinned when an opposing robot is held 
against a field obstacle and rendered unable to move either forward or 
backward due to the presence of another robot. 
1.4 At the start of the match, teams must place their robot in the starting loca-
tion of their color defined by the outer boundary of the tape. 
1.5 Robots may not physically interact with anything outside of the field. 
1.6 Any Birdie that leaves the field during a match will not be returned to the 
field and is ineligible to be scored. 
1.7 If the Savage Ball leaves the field during the autonomous period, it will be 
returned to the neutral position before the start of driver control. If the Sav-
age Ball leaves the field during driver control, it will not be returned to the 
field during the match. 
1.8 Referees reserve the right to disqualify any robot that is determined to be a 
safety hazard. 
1.9 Team members may only interact with their robot during a match through 
the use of their joystick. Only designated Drivers may be in contact with the 
joystick controllers during the match. 
1.9.1All team members must stand behind their respective side lines 
for the duration of the match. 
1.10 Damage to the playing field, objects, other robots, or the control system 
may result in disqualification at the discretion of the referees. 
1.10.1 Referees may request that teams alter any portion of their ro-
bots that are considered safety hazards or damaging to the playing 
field or scoring objects at any point during the competition. It is the 
right of the referees to prevent teams from playing in matches until 
such changes are made to the robot. 
1.11 All parts of the robot must remain attached to the robot for the duration 
of the match and must not cause any hazard of entanglement to the other ro-
bots. Any infraction of this rule may result in an immediate disqualification. 
Minor pieces which unintentionally become detached from the robot, or are 
the result of improper design/construction and do not affect the outcome of 
the match, will not cause a disqualification. 
1.12 Teams are allowed to modify their robots between matches so long as the 
robot continues to follow all of the rules and specifications outlined in this 
manual. Any modification must be brought to the attention of the referees or 
head inspector prior to the start of the team’s next match. Teams may be sub-
ject to re-inspection at the discretion of the referees/head inspector. 
1.13 Multiple robots per team are not allowed. 
1.13.1 A robot must meet the specifications outlined in section 6. 
1.14 Teams will not be permitted to touch their controllers during the autono-
mous period.

Appendix H: Game Manual 
 
2. Gameplay: Game Definitions 
2.1 Landing Zones (LZ): Areas at the ends of the field, indicated by colored 
tape where the robots begin the match. 
2.2 Birdies: Irregularly shaped plastic game objects typically found in badmin-
ton tournaments. 
2.3 Box:  a 15 cm tall, 61cm wide, 30cm deep clear, walled off area within the 
LZ wherein the Birdies are scored. 
2.4 Tubular Birdie Source (TBS): Tubes at the forward edge of the field and in 
front of the ramps where teams may get Birdies. 
2.5 Savage Ball: A regulation size 4 soccer ball. 
2.6 Trough: the area that contains the Savage Ball. 
2.7 Ramp: Structure at the rear edge of the field that leads up to the Trough. 
2.8 Red and Blue colored panes located at either end of the trough, which are 
used to determine control of the Savage Ball. 
2.9 Birdie Button (BB): Buttons that deliver Birdies when pressed during au-
tonomous mode. 
2.10 Birdie Starting Location (BSL): Marked squares on the field where Bird-
ies are located at the beginning of each match. 
3. Field Specifications: 
3.1 The game will be played on a 2.4m (8ft) by 3.7m (12ft) field with a ground 
surface of “high-traffic” carpet that may have minor bumps and surface irreg-
ularities. 
3.2 Robots will begin the match in the LZ area for their respective team colors 
(Red or Blue). 
3.3 There are 16 Birdies located on the field at the start of the match. Eight 
will be red; eight will be blue. There are an additional 16 white Birdies at the 
start in the TBSs, four per TBS. 
3.3.1 The red and blue Birdies will be arranged as follows: 
3 groups of 2 red and 2 blue Birdies each, one group located 
in each of the separate Birdie starting locations. 
4 Birdies (2 red, 2 blue) start the match on top of the ramp, 
against the wall opposite the Trough. 
Birdies in the BSLs and on the ramps start feather-side down, 
with the team’s color Birdies closest to their LZ. 
3.4 All field dimensions should be considered to be +/-  2cm

4. The Match: 
Each match will last a total of 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the first 20 seconds 
of which will be autonomous where team members will not be allowed to 
touch their controllers. Once the winner of the autonomous period has been 
determined, the drivers for each team will pick up their controllers and the 
match will continue under driver control. After one minute, there will be a 10 
second period of time for the drivers to hand over the controls to another 
teammate to continue as driver for the remainder of the match. 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Scoring: 
5.1 All scoring will occur after all robots, Birdies and the Savage Ball have 
come to rest. 
5.2 A Birdie is considered to be in a scoring position if the Birdie is supported 
only by the field wall, the floor of the LZ, the BOX, or another Birdie consid-
ered to be in a scoring position. Additionally, the Birdie must be at least par-
tially within the LZ and not in contact with a robot from the scoring coalition. 
5.2.1 Red and Blue Birdies are considered to be in scoring position if they are 
within the zone of their color, in addition to meeting the above criteria. 
5.3 The Savage Ball is considered controlled by a team if the ball is in contact 
with the BOP corresponding to its team color and with both edges of the 
Trough. 
5.3.1 Robots that are touching the Savage Ball at the end of the match will be 
removed in reverse order in which they made initial contact before control of 
the Savage Ball is assessed.

Abstract
Although Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is considered a leader in robotics research
and education, it has never specifically hosted a collegiate robotics competition. Through
background research on other collegiate robotics competitions, discussions with both rep-
resentatives from universities and robotics companies, and stakeholders at WPI we have
developed a proposal for a collegiate robotics competition. This event would be hosted at
WPI in collaboration with TouchTomorrow, a campus-wide event showcasing science and
technology in early June. This event would consist of three separate challenges based on
real-world problems. These challenges combined with a robotics career fair and networking
opportunities would provide many long-term benefits to the school.

1 Introduction
For decades society has acknowledged the importance and relevance of robotics as it continues
to become a larger part of everyday life. In recent years, many educational institutions
have begun to realize the importance robotics has in the world today and have started
to integrate robotics programs into their curriculum. In 2007 our university, Worcester
Polytechnic Institute, was the first ever to offer a Bachelor of Science in Robotics Engineering
[1]. Through robotics programs and industry, the field continues to grow and develop, but
these are not the only ways the field has advanced.
Another way the field has advanced over the years is through robotics competitions.
Competitions cultivate a competitive and challenging environment that drive the innovation
and creativity necessary to develop new technologies. While most robotics competitions have
the intention of fostering creativity and innovation, particularly at the collegiate level, not
all of them are successful and sustainable. Many collegiate robotics competitions have faced
problems that have led to renewal delays or even cancellation. These problems in part come
as a result of the rapid pace of technological advancement where challenges quickly become
obsolete.
This Interactive Qualifying Project delivers a proposal for a successful and sustainable
collegiate robotics competition hosted by Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). We have
studied the successes and failures of other competitions and have gathered information from
potential participants, sponsors, and WPI stakeholders. We have developed this competition
to increase opportunity for undergraduate involvement in cutting-edge innovation and to
elevate WPI’s peer-to-peer recognition amongst other institutions.
In the pursuit of our goals, we have researched and discussed a broad range of general
questions and considerations. Each of these hurdles have been addressed during the course
of our IQP:
• What do we define as a ‘successful’ collegiate robotics competition?
• What causes some collegiate robotics competitions to fail while others succeed?
• What do successful collegiate robotics competitions have in common?
• What do failed collegiate robotics competitions have in common?
• What do events outside of the academic world, or even outside of the world of tech-
nology, do to be successful? Are any of these design aspects transferable to the kind
of event we are planning?
• How can we grow the scale of interest in this competition beyond people already active
in similar ones?
• How do we get potential sponsors interested in our competition?
• What can we do to encourage concrete undergraduate involvement in this competition?
• How will our competition interest peer institutions?
1
• What resources will be required to host our competition at WPI?
By comprehensively answering these questions using effective methodology, and by learn-
ing from the triumphs and failures of others, we have created a presentable roadmap for a
realistic, implementable, and impactful collegiate robotics competition hosted by WPI.

2 Background
In order to develop a successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competition at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute (WPI) it is important to understand the background of the school,
its Robotics Engineering Program, and other collegiate robotics competitions. It is also
important to understand why a collegiate robotics competition hosted by WPI is relevant to
the interests of the school, and the benefits that a collegiate robotics competition hosted by
WPI can provide.
2.1 About Worcester Polytechnic Institute
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, founded in 1865, was established to provide the masses with
an exceptional science and engineering education. It was not until the late 1960’s that WPI
adapted its signature “Plan,” combining both theory and practice. Doing this arms each
student with the ability to carry a wide range of theoretical knowledge mixed with industry
experience [11]. WPI’s curriculum structure is designed to foster teamwork rather than
harbor competition. Part of this is WPI’s innovative robotics engineering program which
began in 2007 and was the first of its kind [1].
2.2 About WPI’s Robotics Engineering Program
The robotics engineering program began in 2007, offering just two courses. Now it has grown
to include more than twenty courses, combining the disciplines of computer science, electrical
and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. It awarded its four bachelor’s degrees
in 2009 to students who had switched majors into the program. In 2016 the program awarded
75 undergraduate degrees in Robotics Engineering, adding to the total 391 bachelor’s degrees
awarded to date. In recent years the program has also expanded to the graduate level and
awarded 56 Master’s degrees and 2 PhDs this past academic year [1].
2.3 Previous and Existing Collegiate Robotics Competitions
The following section conveys research into the most relevant collegiate robotics competitions
today, providing insights into the resources needed for a collegiate robotics competition, the
potential impacts of such an event, and the potential benefits. This section also discusses
the factors that can attribute to a collegiate robotics competition’s success and provides the
groundwork for later sections where we use this information to present a solution to the
problems asserted in the introduction.
2.3.1 FIRST
The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) began in 1992 when 28 teams from around New
England came together for the first FRC season. Since then FRC has seen tremendous
growth and today has 3,357 teams in 24 countries with over 83,000 students [20]. Although
it is a high school competition, it is worth mentioning as it is the largest robotics competition
in the world [19].
3
FRC tasks high school teams to design and build robots in six and a half weeks to play
a field game. The rules and game change every year but still fall within certain parameters,
allowing teams to reuse base robots each year and only requiring designing and building
specific components.
2.3.2 VEXU
The VEX Robotics Competition started in 2007 by Innovation First International to help
promote their STEM education product line [2]. Compared to the already existing FIRST
Robotics Competition that was also available to high school students, the robots were much
smaller and the rules varied considerably. For example, for the FIRST Robotics Competition
robots could be a maximum of 120 lb and individual parts could be sourced from multiple
suppliers as long as each individual part did not exceed $400 in cost [3, 4]. This differed
from the VEX Competition rules where there was not a weight limit and robots could not
be a larger than an 18x18x18 inch cube at the start of the match only using VEX brand
parts. This new competition found a home with many high school students as it was far less
expensive than FIRST but more sophisticated than FIRST Lego League. Unlike FIRST,
the participants in VEX were not limited to a six-week build season, allowing them to spend
more time working on their robot designs and going to competitions.
After the VEX Robotics Competition’s first year the program continued to grow. A new
non-profit organization, RECF or the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation, was
created in order to help organize competitive events. This allowed for the competition to
expand to middle school and internationally, with more than 10,000 teams from more than
30 countries competing in the various programs.
Starting in 2014, the VEXU division was formed out of the existing VEX competition.
This new division was created specifically for college and university students with rules nearly
identical to the high school and middle-school level VEX competitions, but with greater
customization and flexibility. Additionally, this competition offered teams the ability to
work on real-world problems and engineer robotic solutions.
Through our research, we have identified these factors that contribute to the success of
the VEXU Competition:
• Compared to most competitions the VEXU Competition is less expensive to participate
in since most teams spend a maximum of $1000 per robot their first year.
– Since the parts can be reused the cost of participating each year can decrease.
• The competition grows every year with more teams and qualifying events from around
the world. For example in the upcoming 2017-2018 there will be a new VEXU quali-
fying event in Singapore.
• The field is small (12x12ft) and easy to set up it makes running events simple.
Through our research we have also identified the following drawbacks to the VEXU compe-
tition:
4
• Unlike the high school and middle school VEX competitions, VEXU allows for sensors
supplied by outside vendors and 3D printed parts which allow for some creativity, but
teams are still limited to VEX brand parts for mechanical and structural components
which puts a cap on what is possible by teams.
• The dynamics of the VEXU competition are generally similar to that of a sports match
and have less relation to solving real-world problems.
2.3.3 RoboMasters
The RoboMasters competition is one of the newest competitions we have researched, having
only started in 2015 by DJI, a worldwide quadcopter company based out of China. For the
first two years of the competition only Chinese universities could compete, but it was still a
huge success, drawing in over 240 teams from more than 150 universities in its first year. Its
rapid growth is largely due to DJI, who gave each team two kit-bots which was the minimum
required to compete in the competition, lowering the barrier to entry [6]. The field is much
larger (28x10 meters) than other robotics competitions and each team is able to field up
to four robots and one quadcopter at a time. Another major difference with RoboMasters
compared to most competitions is that each robot has a health bar and armor plates. If
these armor plates are hit by the opposing teams pellets then the health of the robot can
decrease and even disable it if the health of the robot is depleted. The structure of the
competition makes its dynamic similar to that of an eSports event and brings in fairly large
online audiences in the tens of thousands. Its international popularity has even produced a
Japanese anime based on the competition.
Although the RoboMasters Competition is the newest we have researched, we consider
it as one of the most successful for the following reasons:
• In its short run it has expanded from a Chinese National competition to an Interna-
tional Competition with more than 240 teams from more than than 10 countries. This
shows the competition only continues to grow.
• DJI assistance through two free kit-bots and other various parts makes it easy for new
teams to join RoboMasters.
• Its interesting competition structure and dynamic brings elements popularized in eS-
ports to attract media attention.
Through our research we have also identified the following drawbacks to the RoboMasters
Competition:
• RoboMasters Competition Events only occur in China which can make participation
difficult for international teams.
• Besides the fully autonomous base-bot, the competition does not heavily focus on
autonomous robots or real-world applications as part of the competition.
• Although DJI supports teams by supplying two kit-bots, most teams still spend up-
wards of $10,000 which can make participation in RoboMasters difficult for some or-
ganizations.

2.3.4 RoboCup
RoboCup is a non-profit organization led by a Board of Trustees, a President and Vice
Presidents as well as a combination of committees designed to fill specific organizational
needs. Robocup has hosted international robotics competitions annually since it was founded
in 1997 [7]. RoboCup started as a competition for robots to play soccer against each other as
a demonstration of artificial intelligence capabilities and to inspire innovation in the industry.
Since then, it has evolved to include more advanced challenges such as search and rescue,
open industrial challenges and humanoid assistant competitions.
It is clear that Robocup aims to promote innovation and research in artificial intelli-
gence through five different levels of the competition: RoboCupSoccer, RoboCupRescue,
Robocup@Home, RoboCupIndustrial and RoboCupJunior. Each league has a different tar-
get demographic allowing for RoboCup to draw in a larger audience from primary school
students making dancing robots in the RoboCupJunior league to college students tackling
research and industrial challenges. Within the RoboCupSoccer division there are further
divisions: small, middle size, standard platform, humanoid, and simulation. This allows
organizations that choose to compete in RoboCup divisions that fit with their resources and
goals.
RoboCup also promotes innovation and research by providing a database of publications,
presentations and research from leading scientific journals and conferences in artificial intel-
ligence. Robocup currently indexes 277 research articles from 720 authors. This provides
participants with accredited sources of information and research on which to base their de-
signs and strategy. On their website they state that their database is “constantly updated
and [they] estimate to reach about 1,000 papers” [7].
RoboCup also takes into consideration their public image via a “News” section on their
website for the press. They hold databases of promotional newsletters, announcements,
images and videos for public and press use in order to promote their brand. RoboCup also
live-streams their events with commentary for international viewers that earn, on average, a
few thousand views per stream [7].
Through our research we have identified the following factors for RoboCup’s success:
• RoboCup has developed many divisions of multiple levels and interests in order to
make the competition available and appealing to a wide range of organizations.
• RoboCup events have been held annually since its inception in 1997 showing that
the competition has been sustainable. It is also the longest running competition we
researched.
• The competition has consistently had around 400 teams from over 40 countries over
the course of the last decade.
Through our research we have identified the following the following drawbacks to the RoboCup
competition:
• The RoboCupSoccer Competition does not change its rules often, making it possible
for teams with successful designs to continue to achieve, while newer teams struggle to
compete on the same level.
6
• Even RoboCupSoccer Small League requires a significant amount of resources to par-
ticipate in. Many teams spend upwards of $10,000 for this division alone.
2.3.5 RoboNation
RoboNation is a robotics community founded by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle
Systems International (AUVSI) that offers multiple educational competitions and programs
[8]. Their mission is to allow middle school to graduate students to apply their STEM and
robotics knowledge outside of the classroom through the various competitions they have to
offer such as:
• RoboSub - Autonomous robotic submarines fully built by students must complete
a difficult series of visual and acoustic-based tasks. These tasks simulate the work
required of robotic subs in many facets of underwater activity [12]. In 2017 RoboSub
saw significant participation at 44 registered teams [21].
• RoboBoat - Student teams design autonomous, robotic boats to navigate and race
through an aquatic obstacle course. The behaviors demonstrated by these boats mimic
tasks that are being developed for coastal surveillance, port security and other types
of oceanographic operations [13].
• Maritime RobotX Challenge - This international competition is designed to evolve
into a multi-platform competition that will include maritime, aerial and submersible
tasks. Currently the competition is primarily focused on autonomous surface vehicle
platforms and sensors [14].
• The National SeaPerch Challenge - A high school and middle school competition
geared towards the construction and operation of remotely operated underwater vehi-
cles to complete certain tasks. Most of these vehicles are actually constructed from
kits as part of the educational program associated with the challenge [15].
• IGVC (Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition) - For this competition under-
graduate and graduate students compete to design, power,and construct an intelligent
ground vehicle that can follow lanes, detect obstacles, and follow waypoint navigation
[16].
• SUAS (Student Unmanned Air Systems) - Students research, design, integrate,
and demonstrate an unmanned aerial system that is capable of autonomous flight and
navigation, remote imaging and communication, and execution of a specific set of tasks.
These tasks can include sensing, detecting, and avoiding obstacles [17].
• IARC (International Aerial Robotics Competition) - The longest-running colle-
giate aerial robotics challenge in the world, IARC advances autonomous aerial robotic
behavior through competition. For IARC international teams must create fully au-
tonomous flying robots that demonstrate behaviors never before demonstrated while
completing missions with real world applications [18].
7
Each competition is held annually with the same technological focus, however they are
given different objectives which allow teams to maintain similar designs from year to year.
Each of the challenges mentioned have real world applications which holds relevance to the
competitors and companies in the industry of that respective competition.
Based on our research we have identified feel the following reasons attribute to the success
of RoboNation:
• RoboNation consists of multiple competitions which allow organizations to participate
in the competitions that suit their interests.
• Since only the tasks/objectives change from year to year teams can use the same
design for their robot every year. This also allows newer teams to draw inspiration
from previous participating teams.
• All competitions have real world applications and are research based.
Through our research we have identified the following the following drawbacks to the RoboN-
ation competitions:
• RoboNation as a whole has not grown as the number of teams competing in challenges
has not increased in the last five years.
• Because of the scale and nature of the Maritime RobotX Challenge it happens every
2 years which is not ideal for many college organizations.
2.3.6 NASA Robotic Mining Competition
The NASA Robotic Mining Challenge began in 2009 as competition for undergraduate and
graduate students to develop a mining robot designed to navigate and operate on the martian
surface [9]. Since then the competition has been held annually at the Kennedy Science Center
and has consistently hosted 45-50 teams.
Through our research we have found that the following factors can be attributed to the
NASA Robotics Mining Competition’s (RMC) success:
• The Robotics Mining Competition features both undergraduate and graduate level
competitions.
• In its first year, RMC offered teams $5,000 need-based grants for travel expenses and
supplies.
• Teams can win Judge’s awards based on innovation and efficiency within their team
and design [9].
• RMC maintains event-specific social media pages to promote their competition and
draw in viewers.
• RMC live streams the events in order to reach a wide audience and potentially inspire
other students to join.
8
Through our research we have also discovered the following drawbacks to the NASA Robotics
Mining Challenge:
• The competition does not seem to have grown in size from year to year.
• Travel and material costs are high as teams are coming from around the country,
making it difficult for lower budget colleges to enter.
2.3.7 SAE Collegiate Design Series
The SAE Collegiate Design Series is a set of college competitions held by the Society of
Automotive Engineers. The competition is designed to provide participants with an oppor-
tunity to improve their engineering and project management skills outside of the classroom
[10]. Students who participate have a chance to show their engineering skills to companies
in the automotive industry, land internships and even earn scholarships. The most popular
of these competitions are Formula SAE and Baja SAE.
• Formula SAE - For this competition, students are contracted by a fictional manu-
facturing company to develop a Formula-style race car. The cars are evaluated as a
potential production item. The cars are targeted at non-professional weekend autocross
racers. Each team is expected to design, build and test a prototype. Within the For-
mula Division, teams can choose to build various types of cars for different events. For
example, teams have the option to build Combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles,
or hybrids and compete in the respective events for those divisions. The nature of
the events can change from year to year, but the most consistent events include timed
races and endurance races to test how long the vehicles can last [10].
• Baja SAE - Students are expected to build a single-seat off-road vehicle that will
survive the harshness of rough terrain. All vehicles are powered by the same 10 HP
engine from Briggs Stratton. The Baja competition is not as large as the Formula
SAE competition, but it is able to draw a different crowd to SAE competitive events
[10].
Through our research we have found that the following factors can be attributed to the
success of the SAE Collegiate Design Series:
• Baja SAE gives each team an engine, allowing students to focus on the durability of
the car as well as lowering the cost of entry.
• Event locations on both the east and west coast of the US as well as international
events allow for more colleges to participate.
Through our research we have also discovered the following drawbacks to the SAE Collegiate
Design Series:
• Due to the nature of automotive engineering, the cost of entry is very high, making it
difficult for colleges with lower budgets to join.
9
• The space required for this event makes it one of the hardest logistically to hold of the
competitions we have researched.
• Since teams work with car sized vehicles it can also be difficult to travel to competitive
events with all of the ideal equipment needed to maintain their vehicles.
10
3 Methodology
This sections outlines the methodology used to complete this IQP. Each of these steps cover
a specific area in the development of a robot competition to be hosted at WPI.
3.1 Background Research
As part of our development process we spent much of our time researching previous and
existing collegiate robotics competitions. This research allowed us to better understand
several key topics:
• The resources necessary to execute a collegiate robotics competition.
• What makes collegiate robotics competitions appealing to participants and sponsors.
• The benefits of a collegiate robotics competition for the host.
• The potential impact a collegiate robotics robotics competition hosted by WPI.
• The factors that attribute to successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competi-
tions.
The background research on various collegiate robotics competitions can be found in
section 2.3 of this report.
3.2 Interview and Discussions
In order to develop a successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competition at WPI it is
important to have discussions with parties that would be involved in the event. These par-
ties include WPI stakeholders, potential participants from other universities, and potential
sponsors.
3.2.1 WPI Stakeholders
Before work began on designing a robotics competition to be held at WPI, interviews were
conducted of key stakeholders at the school who would be instrumental in making it a reality.
The main stakeholders would be those who would have direct involvement in running the
competition and those who would benefit from the exposure. These stakeholders would be
directly involved in the execution of the event:
• The Robotics Engineering Program
• The Robotics Resource Center
• Corporate Engagement
• TouchTomorrow
The stakeholders that would potentially benefit from the event would be:
11
• Admissions
• Marketing
• Pre-Collegiate Outreach
• TouchTomorrow
3.2.1.1 WPI Robotics Engineering Program
The Robotics Engineering Program is the most obvious benefactor and stakeholder of a colle-
giate robotics competition at WPI. The Robotics Engineering program faculty had valuable
insight on hosting such a collegiate robotics competition and on which key individuals we
should be speaking with.
3.2.1.2 WPI Robotics Resource Center
The Robotics Resource Center at WPI is responsible for running every competitive robotics
event on campus such as FIRST Robotics Competitions and formerly the NASA Centen-
nial Challenge. Their relevance to such events makes them a primary stakeholders for our
proposed event, so it was critical for us to have discussions with them.
The Robotics Engineering Program would also have direct involvement in the event as
they could serve as a source of funding and volunteers in the form of students and professors.
The Robotics Resource Center and TouchTomorrow would be the primary organizer of the
event and as such is a primary stakeholder.
3.2.1.3 WPI Admissions Office
The nature of the WPI Admissions Office is to review students and admit them into WPI, so
we decided to meet with them as we felt they had relevant information pertaining to student
statistics and interests.
3.2.1.4 WPI Office of Pre-Collegiate Outreach
Another benefactor of a robotics competition held at WPI would be Pre-Collegiate Out-
reach. Pre-Collegiate Outreach designs programs for middle school and high school students
designed to help them explore the STEM field and to ultimately get them inspired to choose
WPI when it’s time to apply to colleges.
3.2.1.5 WPI Office of Corporate Engagement
It was very important to have a discussion with the Office of Corporate Relations as they
are the point of contact for many WPI benefactors and they should have a relevant opinion
on the subject of our IQP.
12
3.2.2 Potential Participants
A competition is not a competition without participants, which is why we conducted inter-
views with representatives from 18 universities in order to better understand their interests.
We wanted to find out what they would want to get out of a robotics competition as well
as how to make the competition as inclusive as possible. When finding interviewees from
each university we made sure they were representatives of a relevant STEM organization
or involved in STEM related activities on campus. Because of this, the representatives we
interviewed had a deep understanding of the resources available to students at their univer-
sity and a relevant opinion on the kind of robotics competition their university would be
interested in participating in.
While developing our competition we wanted to both make it interesting to peer insti-
tutions with a reputation in robotics as well as universities that are new to the field. In
order to gain diverse range of opinions on the subject we planned to contact and interview
representatives from the following universities in relevant STEM organizations:

When interviewing each of these universities we asked the following questions to gain
a better understanding of the interests of potential participants and to help identify what
types of competitions WPI could ultimately host:
• What is the member size of your organization?
• What is the annual budget of your organization?
• Does your organization have membership fees?
• Is competition travel covered by your school?
• Do students have access to fabrication resources? If yes, what kind?
14
• What is your ideal frequency for the competition? (Annually, every 2 years, etc.)
• How often do you feel the rules should change?
• What is your ideal date for a competition to take place?
• Do you prefer an indoor or outdoor challenge?
• Should there be robot to robot interaction?
• Should there be a multi-robot aspect to the competition?
• If you answered yes, how many robots should there be?
• If you answered yes to a multi-robot competition then should those robots be different?
• Should there be any legged robots?
• Should there be any underwater robots?
• Should robots be fully autonomous or should there be an autonomous portion to the
challenge?
• If you answered yes to a multi-robot competition then how many robots should be
fully autonomous?
• Should there be alliances?
3.2.3 Potential Sponsors
Another important aspect of developing a collegiate robotics competition at WPI is con-
tacting potential sponsors for the event. Through discussions with sponsors we gained an
understanding of how to make our competition appealing to potential sponsors, how to form
relationships, and eventually partnerships with them.
Throughout the course of the IQP we contacted the following companies in order to
understand what should be included in our event to properly incentivize sponsors:
• iRobot
• Uber ATG
• Symbotic
• MASSrobotics
• New Stone Soup, LLC
15
3.3 Development and Drafting
Through our research, we developed a proposal and plan of action for a collegiate robotics
competition hosted by WPI. We have developed severial documents for this IQP: this report,
which contains our findings as well as conclusions on them, a rules handbook, targeted
towards potential participants and includes details on each competition and a tentative
schedule, and a logistics document, which contains details on the resources necessary to host
this event.
In developing a proposal for this event we have identified several main decision and
development points:
• Potential event dates
• Potential competition locations
• Proposed event schedule
• Logistics plan
• Sponsorship packages
• Proposed competitions
• Selected competitions
As part of this report we provide details for each of these points.
16
4 Findings
The following section describes the results of executing the methodology outlined in section
three of this report. It begins with an overview of our discussions with WPI, potential
participants, and potential sponsors. It then concludes with our work on a proposal for a
collegiate robotics competition to be hosted by WPI.
4.1 Discussions and Information Gathering
This section summarizes the information gathered over the course of the IQP. It begins with
details on discussions with WPI stakeholders, continues with details on discussions with
potential participants, and concludes with details on discussions with potential sponsors.
4.1.1 Discussions with WPI Stakeholders
Before work began on designing a robotics competition to be held at WPI, interviews and
discussions with key stakeholders at the school were conducted to identify event requirements.
These stakeholders are the people and offices who would be directly involved in running the
event and those who would need to give approval for it.
4.1.1.1 Robotics Engineering Program
Over the course of this IQP we had many discussions with key figures of WPI’s robotics
engineering program. Many of these discussions were with two of our advisors for this IQP,
Professors Nicholas Bertozzi and Brad Miller during weekly meetings and outside discus-
sions. They consistently provided valuable insight due to their knowledge of the industry
and experience with mentoring competitive robotics teams. The competitive robotics teams
they have mentored have participated in competitions such as the FIRST Robotics Com-
petition and the VEX Robotics Competition. Because of their experience and position as
robotics faculty, our frequent discussions with them were extremely helpful in drafting the
competition. These discussions also kept the project on track by ensuring that the vision of
the competition stayed in the best interest of all parties involved.
We also had several productive and insightful discussions with Professor David Cyganski,
the interim director of WPI’s robotics engineering program. Professor Cyganski had been
involved with the program since its inception and had a good understanding of how to
represent the WPI Robotics Program well. Professor Cyganski advised that cost would be
a huge consideration when attempting to execute our event and that it would be best to
couple the event with a large existing WPI event such as TouchTomorrow. This would
prove advantageous as both events could enhance each other in a variety of ways if hosted in
conjunction. He added that with since the NASA Sample Return Challenge has ended and
is no longer a part of TouchTomorrow, adding a new competitive robotics event could be of
benefit for all parties involved.
Professor Cyganski received the idea of having a collegiate robotics olympics with multiple
events positively. Of his major opinions on the dynamic of the event was that he felt that
we should stray from having events such as combat robotics if we wanted all events to be
17
academic, but he did admit having those as one of the events had the potential of bringing
a maker and hobbyist type of crowd. Professor Cyganski felt that having events that were
directly related to real world applications would represent WPI well. Some examples of
these events would include a legged robotics challenge, an underwater robotics challenge,
and an item sorting challenge. He made it clear that if we were to have events like that
there proper planning was necessary in order to make it feasible for an event like that to
be executed successfully. The events would also have to be designed to be as accessible to
other universities as possible, but should also remain fair to all potential participants. His
concern was that if undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students were allowed to compete in
this competition then undergraduate students might be at a disadvantage. This is because
some graduate or PhD students may have developed technology associated with a certain
event over the course of several years. His last major point in these discussions was that it
would be of high interest to WPI to market this sort of event to peer U.S institutions in
order to draw more domestic students into WPI’s graduate programs.
4.1.1.2 Robotics Resource Center
Over the course of our IQP we had many discussions with Colleen Shaver, the Associate
Director of the Robotics Resource Center and one of the advisors for our IQP. As the As-
sociate Director of the Robotics Resource Center, Colleen is in charge of the planning and
execution of many large robotics competitions hosted on WPI campus. Such robotics com-
petitions include one of the FIRST Lego League Championships, an Annual FIRST Robotics
District Event, BattleCry, and the NASA Sample Return Challenge. Throughout the IQP
her knowledge and experience on running robotics events on WPI campus proved to be ex-
tremely valuable in reaching our goals for this IQP. She consistently gave valuable insights
and feedback on the information we gathered and the competition proposal could not have
been drafted without her.
4.1.1.3 WPI Admissions Office
As a benefactor of the potential outreach, admissions materials created in the form of pic-
tures and videos, and the increased attention given to WPI from any robotics competition
held, admissions was an important stakeholder in the event. We met with Ashley Johnson
and Katie Phung, both Assistant Directors of Admissions. Ashley specializes in robotics
applicants and Katie specializes in minority outreach.
During the meeting, various strategies were discussed on what what interests potential
high school applicants when it comes to robotics. Due to the complicated and visual nature
of the subject, videos were brought up as being an important tool. They allow high schoolers
to get excited when they see it for themselves. They saw a robotics competition held at WPI
as a great way of generating content for these videos as well as a mechanism for outreach to
potential domestic graduate students. They mentioned that the admissions office in general
would love a spectator element combined with interactive parts for potential high school
applicants.
18
4.1.1.4 WPI Office of Corporate Engagement
Our main discussions with the Office of Corporate Relations were with Rachel Leblanc, the
Vice President of Corporate Engagement. As mentioned in section 3.2.1.5, we thought it
was very important to meet with this office as they are the point of contact to many of
the companies and organizations associated with WPI. Rachel Leblanc also sits on the New
England Board of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI).
AUVSI is an entity that heavily supports the advancement of robotic technologies and hosts
several robotics competitions and conferences. Similar to David Cyganski, Rachel felt that
AUVSI and other potential sponsors would be heavily interested in a robotics competition
hosted at WPI. A robotics competition with different focused events would have the potential
of drawing in specific sponsors for each event. For example Bluefin Robotics, an underwater
drone company, may be interested in sponsoring an underwater drone challenge. Hosting
challenges with real world applications would provide WPI with a good amount of peer to
peer recognition with similar universities.
Overall, our discussions with Rachel proved productive in connecting with potential spon-
sors for our event and she felt that at a high level our proposed event was executable and
would provide many benefits for all parties involved.
4.1.1.5 WPI Office of Pre-Collegiate Outreach
Discussions primarily took place with Sue Sontgerath who guided us through the three main
avenues in place to direct middle school and high school students towards the school:
• Through parents
• Through educators
• Direct contact with students
In general the first two were far more effective than the third for off-campus outreach.
She stressed that using “multiple touchpoints” is important because it brings pre-collegiate
students to the campus and WPI-hosted events as often as possible so that they associate
the the school with college when it comes time for them to apply. The event TouchTomorrow
is one of the largest examples of this. The event brings thousands of students, as young as
10, from around New England to the campus and gets them introduced to the school and
the types of things undergraduates get to do.
Discussions also circulated around female inclusion in the event and the types of things
that work for that. Sue mentioned that most of the research surrounding this says that
women have heavy interest in helping and improving people’s lives.
4.1.2 Discussions with Potential Participants
Through our efforts we were able to interview 20 student representatives from 18 universities,
including the ones we originally planned to interview listed in section 3.2.2. During these
interviews we made sure to answer similar questions in order to produce metrics that would
simplify drawing conclusions. The following universities were interviewed:
19
• Massachusetts Institute of Technology
• Harvard University
• Olin College
• Stanford University
• Duke University
• Rice University
• University of Pennsylvania
• Pennsylvania State University
• Purdue University
• California State Polytechnic University
• Colorado School of Mines
• Southern Methodist University
• University of Texas at Austin
• University of Texas at Dallas
• Texas AM
• University of Houston
• University of Alabama
• University of Auckland
The gain a better understanding of the resources available to students at each university
we asked representatives the following questions:
Table 4.1: Potential participant university statistics
Question Response Summary
What is the member size of your
organization?
The average membership size was 21.625 members.
What is the annual budget of
your organization?
The average annual budget was $18,895.
Does your organization have
membership fees?
Only two of the 18 universities interviewed had
membership fees. These were both for VEXU and at
UT Austin and UT Dallas.
Is competition travel covered by
your school?
Responses ranged from “no” to “sometimes” with 25%
of the answers being the latter.
20
Do students have access to
fabrication resources? If yes,
what kind?
Most universities have access to fabrication resources.
These range from small makerspaces to full-fledged
machine shops. Only 25% of the universities
interviewed do not have access.
Since these representatives would be potential participants of our competitive event we
felt it was important to ask their opinions on how the competition should be structured.
The questions we asked every representative and a summary of those question responses can
be found in the table below:
Table 4.2: Potential participant opinions
Question Response Summary
What is your ideal frequency for
the competition? (Annually,
every 2 years, etc.)
All interviewed representatives preferred annual
frequency. This is because students are only in college
program for four years so an annual competition would
keep students engaged in the competition.
How often do you feel the rules
should change?
Every representative felt that the rules of the
competition should change annually in order to keep
the competition interesting and engaging.
What is your ideal date for a
competition to take place?
All representatives felt a date during the summer
would be the best timing. Most had a preference for
the beginning of the summer(Late May/Early June)
Do you prefer an indoor or
outdoor challenge?
All representatives felt that an indoor competition was
preferable. Some felt that an outdoor competition is
interesting, but did not like that it would be reliant on
the weather.
Should there be robot to robot
interaction?
With the exception of a few representatives, most felt
that robot to robot interaction should be a part of the
competition.
Should there be a multi-robot
aspect to the competition?
About 80% of representatives felt that there should be
a multi-robot aspect to the competition.
If you answered yes, how many
robots should there be?
About 87% of representatives felt that 3 robots would
be a good number to a multi-robot competitions. The
other 13% felt fewer or more robots was ideal.
If you answered yes to a
multi-robot competition then
should those robots be different?
All representatives that felt there should be a
multi-robot competition said that the robots should be
different types.
Should there be any legged
robots?
About 67% of representatives were interested in seeing
a legged robot competition.
Should there be any underwater
robots?
All representatives were interested in an underwater
robotics challenge.
21
Should robots be fully
autonomous or should there be
an autonomous portion to the
challenge?
About 75% of representatives felt that there should be
an autonomous portion of the challenge rather than
fully autonomous robots.
If you answered yes to a
multi-robot competition then
how many robots should be fully
autonomous?
About 60% of representatives who were interested in a
fully autonomous robot thought all robots should be
autonomous while 40% felt only at least one robot
should be autonomous.
Should there be alliances? Only about 21% of representatives were interested in a
competition with alliances. Most felt that if there were
alliances in the competitions it should not be
multi-robot.
The full interviews of each representative(including representative details) can be found
in the Appendix section of this report.
Based on the interviews we have made several conclusions that are fully outlined in
the section 4.2 of the report. These representative interviews were extremely helpful in
understanding the capabilities of most universities and how to design the competition in a
way that will attract competitors and satisfy their interests.
4.1.3 Discussions with Potential Sponsors
Over the course of our IQP we attempted to contact all the companies and organizations
we listed in section 3.2.3. We were not able to establish communication with all of these
groups, but the following section outline the discussions we had with the groups we were
able to properly contact.
4.1.3.1 Uber ATG
One of the potential sponsors we were able to contact was the Uber Advanced Technologies
Group. Uber ATG is the autonomous vehicle development division of Uber, based out of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Because of their mission to advance autonomous vehicle tech-
nology we felt it was important to contact them about potentially sponsoring our event.
We were able to contact Alan Nuttle, a senior engineer at Uber ATG. Allan had previous
experience partnering with the FIRST Robotics Competition and was heavily interested in
the prospect of sponsoring a collegiate robotics event. We felt that it would be best if Uber
was a title sponsor for an autonomous navigation challenge and Alan agreed. Uber would
be interested in sponsoring a specific event and providing volunteers support in the form of
judges.
4.1.3.2 iRobot
We were able to reach out to Lisa Freed, a public relations representative from iRobot.
Through our communications with Lisa we discovered that iRobot does not sponsor com-
petitive events monetarily. According to Lisa, iRobot is focused more on participants rather
22
than the actual competition. If they were to assist in a competition at WPI they would
provide volunteers that would mentor or judge competitors of the competition. iRobot feels
that as long as the competition is giving students the opportunity to find their passion, be
it building, coding, team leadership or some other area of the STEM fields, it would be of
value to them. One last way iRobot might participate in our event that Lisa mentioned
would be by having a booth in an exhibition area for recruiting purposes.
4.1.3.3 MASSrobotics
MASSrobotics is a robotics startup accelerator in the Boston Seaport District that was
founded less than two years ago. Despite being so young, MASSrobotics has made a large
impact in the robotics community and has more than a dozen different robotics companies
residing in their offices. Because of their nature we felt that it was important to talk with
them and the companies they house as these parties could be potential sponsors of our
event. Most of our communications were with Joyce Sidopoulos, one of the directors of
MASSrobotics, mainly in charge of their community programs. As a parent, Joyce was
interested in the prospect of a competition that would be in collaboration of TouchTomorrow
and felt that the timing of the competition would be ideal for many. As an organization
MASSrobotics would be interested in having exhibition space for their multiple companies
and providing judges for the event. Joyce also gave helpful competition design suggestions
such as gearing an underwater robotics challenge towards aquaculture, a challenge their
company Hydroswarm is trying to tackle. One of MASSrobotics’s residents is American
Robotics, an agriculture robotics company that utilizes drones to actively track crops. Joyce
brought up the idea of this event to them and they were interested in seeing an outdoor
autonomous drone challenge that utilized computer vision to actively track some sort of
target.
4.1.3.4 Rita Vasquez Torres
Over the course of this IQP, we had several discussions with Rita Vasquez Torres, CEO
of engineering consulting company, New Stone Soup. Rita’s background and experience
provided a lot of insight while developing our competition. Since Rita had partnered with
the army and research institutions such as Natick Labs on many occasions she was confident
that our intent to have competitive events with real world applications was the best approach.
Overall she was satisfied with the initial proposal for our event and felt it would be successful,
but she wanted our event to emphasize more than the technical aspect of things. In her
experience she felt that many bright engineers she had worked with lacked fundamental non-
technical skills that are just as important as technical ones. She felt that it was important
to foster a business and entrepreneurial mindset in engineers so she suggested adding an
entrepreneurial aspect to our event. This event should emphasize real technology rules and
regulations currently set in place so that students will understand how to properly bring
technology to market and how to commercialize it.
23
4.1.3.5 Symbotic, LLC
Symbotic, LLC is a warehouse robotics company based in Wilmington, MA. As of Fall 2017,
this company started a small collegiate competition of their own. This competition is struc-
tured to be more like an engineering project, but has increased their interest in working
with universities for future competitions. To discuss this topic we met with Maggie Weeks,
Symbotic’s Marketing Communications Specialist, and Taylor Smith, one of Symbotic’s Cor-
porate Recruiters. Through this discussion, we learned that Symbotic would be interested in
sponsoring a robotics competition of any kind and that they would most likely be available
to provide both monetary and volunteer support, but more specific details about the final
event will be required. If Symbotic were to sponsor an event they would like for the event
to focus on engineering undergraduate students and for students to have opportunities to
develop mechanical engineering, hardware engineering, and software engineering skills. From
a recruiting standpoint they see it as an opportunity to groom potential employees and see
what those potential employees have to offer. From a marketing standpoint they simply feel
that by being involved it would be a good opportunity, especially since Symbotic is starting
to become more public.
4.2 Competition Development
Through our information gathering and discussions with stakeholders at the school, potential
sponsors, and participants we developed a proposal for a robotics competition to be held at
WPI. This section outlines this proposal and includes:
• Potential dates
• Potential locations
• A proposed schedule
• General logistics requirements
• Sponsorship
• Initially proposed challenges
This section ends with a decision matrix to determine which proposed challenges should
be hosted in the first year of the event.
4.2.1 Potential Dates
Choosing a potential date for a robotics competition hosted at WPI was challenging as there
are a lot of factors to take into account. First, the school year for WPI goes from April 24th to
May 1st, with commencement on the 12th. Any event in the summer would need to happen
after this date as the whole campus is reserved to that event. Additional factors include
the dates that participating colleges adjourn for the summer and students start internships.
Internships typically start at the beginning of June and go until mid August.
24
Through talking with potential participants and WPI stakeholders we concluded that the
ideal date for the competition would be late May to early June with the event starting Friday
morning and ending Saturday evening. This would make the event accessible to participants
with internships, even by those traveling from outside of New England, as it would allow
them to take Thursday and Friday off and return on Sunday.
Late May to early June is also ideal for WPI as it would be after commencement and the
quad would no longer be in use. After we determined this time frame was the ideal date,
we realized that having an event in conjunction would TouchTomorrow would be ideal as it
typically takes place in early June and was originally created to be hosted in collaboration
with NASA’s Centennial Challenge in 2012 and still has a strong theme of robotics even now
that the challenge is over.
4.2.2 Potential Locations
If this competition were to be in collaboration with TouchTomorrow then the following
locations that would be available for use:
• Harrington Auditorium
• Recreation Center Robot Pits
• Recreation Center Swimming Pool
• Riley Commons
• WPI Football Field
• WPI Rooftop Field
• Institute Park
We had discussions with Meredith Merchant, the Assistant Recreation Director and Fa-
cilities Director, to determine if use of facilities, such as the swimming pool in the recreation
center, for a competitive robotics event would be possible. Meredith was open to the idea
as long as the Varsity Swimming Coach approved as well.
Institute Park would also be available for the event. For example, the NASA Centennial
Challenge was held there and the entire park was fenced off. In order to organize this, the
Worcester Parks and Recreation Center would need to be contacted in order to make sure
that the park was available for our desired event dates. The fees associated with renting the
park were fairly low and the it would be possible to fence it off.
4.2.3 Proposed Competition Schedule
Through discussions with potential sponsors, participants, and WPI stakeholders we gath-
ered information on what should be included in a robotics competition schedule. We also
determined that this event would be executed best if it occurred over the course of two days
to provide enough time to execute everything that should occur in such an event.In this
25
schedule there are several important parts that differ from most collegiate robotics compe-
titions. First, we decided it was important to include networking events for participants.
These events would be an opportunity for college students studying engineering with experi-
ence in robotics to gain connections within industry. These connections would be especially
helpful for rising seniors when seeking out jobs during the coming school year. Second,
there will be keynote speakers at the provided lunches. These speakers will be experts from
industry discussing a relevant topic in the field of robotics. The following is our proposed
schedule:

4.2.4 General Logistics Requirements
Behind every successful event lies extensive organizational planning. We decided to create a
logistical plan to outline where, when and how the events would be run in conjunction with
TouchTomorrow. We first identified the required resources to run this competition:
• Volunteers
• Event space
• Event materials
• Audio and video
27
The competition will require a wide variety of volunteers to operate smoothly. Each
challenge will follow the same volunteer structure. The volunteer structure outlines the
expected tasks for each position and is as follows:
• Standard Volunteers
– Misc. - Volunteer Positions that are to be determined to help with event flow.
– A/V Crew - In charge of lighting and audio/video for challenge venues and
would be provided by LNL (WPI’s A/V club).
– Challenge Reset - Assists in challenge venue maintenance.
– Queuing - Maintains time flow of each challenge by directing teams to necessary
destinations.
– Referee - Assists in upholding event challenge rules.
– Challenge Admin - Who teams check-in to and an informational guide for the
event.
• Judges
– Robot/Safety Inspector - Inspects robots and confirms if they comply to
event/challenge standards, makes sure that event is up to safety standards, and
able to restrict teams from competing if they are in violation of safety standards.
– Technical Judge - Scores posters and the designs of team’s robots and evaluates
robot performance.
– Scoring Judge - Maintains scoring of challenges.
• Key Volunteers
– Head Referee - Oversees all the referees for all challenges.
– Head Inspector - Oversees all the inspectors for all challenges.
– Head Judge - Oversees all technical judging for all challenges.
– Emcee - Master of ceremonies and narrator of challenges.
– Field Supervisor - In charge of field maintenance.
– Volunteer Coordinator - Organizes and oversees volunteers for a challenge.
– Challenge Coordinator - Also organizes and oversees volunteers for a challenge.
The majority of the potential sponsors we contacted expressed intent to provide vol-
unteers to help run the event. Between our sponsors as well as volunteers from the WPI
volunteers we anticipate to have enough sponsors to staff our selected challenges.
One of the most important resources required would be funding. The main costs for
running the event would be materials for field construction as well as audio and video pro-
duction for the event. All of the fields will be constructed out of basic materials such as
cardboard and plywood. Below are the materials costs for the selected challenges:
28
• Indoor Drone Challenge - $1,000
• Warehouse Swarm Challenge - $1,000
• Miniature Fire Fighting Challenge - $1,500
Audio and video production will be provided by the student run club, Lens and Lights
(LNL). They have provided price estimates for each challenge location:
• Harrington Auditorium - $3,500
• Riley Commons - $500
• Robot Pits - $200
Based on our positive feedback from potential sponsors, we believe that we can generate
the funds needed solely through sponsorship. This would allow the event to be cost neutral
to the school.
4.2.5 Sponsorship
In order to host a successful event it is vital to recruit sponsors that can provide resources
that will enhance the event. Sponsors can provide support in the form of both monetary and
volunteer capacities. Therefore, in order to entice sponsors of different sizes we developed
sponsorship tiers based on what a sponsor provides for the event. These tiers were developed
in collaboration with Colleen Shaver, one of our IQP advisors. A sponsor is considered within
a sponsorship tier if they provide at least one of the bullets under the following sponsorship
tiers:
• Standard
– Donation of $1,000
– 10 standard volunteers provided
– 5 judges provided
– 2 key volunteers provided
• Bronze
– Donation of $2,500
– 20 standard volunteers provided
– 10 judges provided
– 5 key volunteers provided
• Silver
– Donation of $5,000
– 25 standard volunteers provided
29
– 15 judges provided
– 10 key volunteers provided
• Gold
– Donation of $10,000
• Platinum
– Donation of $20,000
In order to incentivize potential sponsors we developed a benefits matrix based on the
sponsorship tiers. This benefits matrix outlines what we felt was appropriate to provide
sponsors based on what they provided to the competition:

4.2.6 Proposed Challenges
Through discussions with potential participants we learned several key things about what
types of competitions they were interested in. First, we learned that different schools with
were interested in different types of competitions of varying sizes. Because of this, we decided
that instead of designing one specific robotics competition we would propose designing and
hosting multiple. That way, universities with different interests and resources could choose
which events they would want to compete in and still participate in the event as a whole.
This would also allow us to ask potential contributors to sponsor a specific event relevant
to them. For example, Symbotic, a warehouse automation company, could sponsor an item
sorting challenge and could be entitled the “Symbotic Item Sorting Challenge”. Another
important item we learned was that both potential participants and sponsors were interested
in competitions based on real-world problems. They felt that working on solutions to these
would provide students with relevant experience and make it easier to get sponsors.
Taking all of what we learned into consideration we went back to potential participants
and sponsors with numerous ideas for competitions and asked for their opinions. The fol-
lowing is list of the competitions that stood out:
• Underwater robotics challenge
• All-terrain robotics challenge
• Item-sorting challenge
• Indoor drone challenge
• Fire Fighting challenge
• Autonomous vehicle challenge
• Warehouse swarm robotics challenge
Each of these competitions are based on current real-world problems that sponsors we
have been in contact with are currently working on.
4.2.6.1 Underwater Robotics Challenge
With the increasing demand for fish and the reduction of fish populations around the world,
the aquaculture industry has grown to account for half of the world’s seafood. Despite its
large success, the aquaculture industry still face many problems today.
For coastal aquaculture farms, nets require constant inspection as they have a tendency
to break, causing thousands of fish, often non-indigenous, to escape into local waters. This
31
causes both substantial losses to the farm and untold ecological problems. Every aquaculture
farm also faces the problem of diseased fish. Since there are no current systems to identify
and separate diseased populations, farms have suffered heavy losses.
This challenge was created in order to foster the development of technologies that solve
these problems as well as create a competition for universities interested in underwater
robotics. Teams are tasked with building a robot to autonomously find and identify items
underwater. These items could be waste or escaped fish. Robots could also be tasked with
finding tears in a fish farm net. Specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules
handbook.
4.2.6.2 All-Terrain Robotics Challenge
For this challenge, teams must build robots that are capable of traversing a variety of terrain.
This is meant to simulate real life exploration and navigation problems as well as foster
technology geared for disaster relief. Points will be rewarded based on how far each robot
travels. Robots will not be required to complete each terrain track, but an additional bonus
will be awarded. There will also be an additional assessment task conducted by each robot.
Specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules handbook.
4.2.6.3 Item Sorting Challenge
To accommodate the growth of ecommerce and demand for more efficient sorting and dis-
tribution, warehouse automation has grown to be one of the largest industries in the world.
With the advancement of automated technologies it only continues to grow. For this chal-
lenge teams must build and design robots that will be able to pick and sort different objects
that might be found in a typical warehouse such as boxes and containers. Specific details on
this challenge can be found in the rules handbook.
4.2.6.4 Miniature Fire Fighting Challenge
Fire fighting is one one of the most dangerous professions today. In order to foster the
development of technology that can complete fire-fighting tasks without a human individual,
this challenge was created. For this challenge teams must construct robots that autonomously
navigate an “indoor maze” and extinguish a candle that is somewhere in the arena. The
rules for this challenge drew inspiration from the Trinity Firefighting Challenge and specific
details on these rules can be found in the rules handbook.
4.2.6.5 Autonomous Vehicle Challenge
Due to recent advancements, the autonomous vehicle industry is currently experiencing rapid
growth and as such the demand for engineers in this field is growing. For this challenge,
teams will build vehicles that will autonomously complete a small track and avoid obstacles.
Specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules handbook.
32
4.2.6.6 Warehouse Swarm Challenge
Swarm robotics is an active area of research in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence.
It is based on the principle of emergent behavior seen in social insects, such as ants and bees,
were the actions of each individual are heavily influenced by those around them. Swarms in
nature make use of many redundant separate entities to accomplish tasks that would have
been difficult to complete alone. This challenge will give college students the opportunity
to develop multi-robot systems on a hardware and software level as well as specific software
skills such as computer vision and environment navigation. Details on the competition are
in the rules handbook.
4.2.6.7 Indoor Drone Challenge
The market for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing. Companies like Ama-
zon, who is working on UAVs to deliver packages from warehouses directly to consumers
in minutes, and Uber, who is working on UAVs to transport people from place to place
on demand, are spending millions of dollars on development [23, 24]. This challenge tasks
teams to build a miniature autonomous drone to navigate within a mock city and transport
packages from a pickup location to a destination. Specific details on the competition can be
found in the rules handbook.
4.2.6.8 Existing Competitions
Based on feedback, to augment the new robotics competitions we are proposing, we decided
to add an already existing competition. This would allow participants of these competitions
to enter their already-built robot a second time for another chance to compete. The following
are competitions we have considered:
• Trinity Fire Fighting Robotics Challenge
• Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle Challenge
• Drone Racing
• VEX Robotics Competition
• Smart Mouse Maze Competition
4.2.7 Engineering Design Judging
For each event we decided there should be a judging section to augment the performance
of the robot in the competition. For this, teams will have the opportunity to present their
engineering design process and their overall approach to the challenge they competed in. We
outlined the following topics for teams to demonstrate for this judging:
• Understanding - Define the problem
• Define - Determine solution specifications
33
• Ideas - Generate concept solutions
• Prototype - Learn how your concepts work
• Choose - Determine a final concept
• Refine - Improved design
• Implement - Implement the detailed solution
• Test - Does the solution work?
• Iterate - Are there changes between iterations?
Based off our research of other competitions and discussions with relevant parties we
decide that the best way for teams to demonstrate the factors listed above would be in the
form of a technical paper and a poster that would be reviewed before and during the event
respectively. Additional details are available in the rules handbook.
4.2.8 Competition Survey Results
As mentioned before, our research and initial discussions with teams led us to discover
there was interest in a variety of competitions. In order to accommodate these interests we
decided to create proposals for each. However, if this event were ever to be hosted it would
be unrealistic to host all of the challenges we created in the first year, so we decided to choose
only three of them. This decision was made with our advisors and was intended to focus
our proposal for a competitive robotics olympics. In order to determine which three of the
competitions we should focus on we created a rubric that compared each of the challenges
we created. This rubric considered the following factors:
• Potential cost to competitors
• Interest of potential participants
• Resources required to host event

5 Conclusions and Recommendations
This section outlines the conclusions and findings of this IQP. It begins with an overview of
our conclusions based off the background research on other collegiate robotics competitions,
discussions with potential participants and sponsors, and interviews with key stakeholders
at WPI. Next we will give an overview of our selected competitions based off feedback from
interviews and survey results on drafted competitions. We conclude by explaining how this
proposal fits within the greater WPI ecosystem and recommendations for future work.
5.1 What We Discovered
Through background research on popular collegiate robotics competitions, discussions with
potential participants and corporate sponsors, and stakeholders at WPI we discovered several
key points about hosting a robotics competition:
• Based on our research we identified that successful competitions typically have been
around for many years, are audience friendly, and are based on real-world problems.
• Our initial interviews showed that potential participants had a wide range of interests
prompting us to develop proposals for several competitions in the context of hosting
them at WPI.
• After developing these proposals and discussions with WPI stakeholders, such as the
Robotics Resource Center, we decided it was unrealistic to host all seven of the chal-
lenges we initially proposed.
• Surveying potential participants on each of these proposed events helped to determine
which were both the most popular and feasible, for both the competing university,
students, and sponsors.
• With these survey results we chose three challenges that struck a balance between
the required resources for WPI to host, popularity, cost for participants to enter, and
sponsor interest.
5.2 Selected Challenges
As mentioned in the previous section, through survey results and the decision matrix outlined
in section 4.2.8, we discovered that potential participants had a wide range of interests. As
such, three of the seven proposed challenges in section 4.2.3 were selected:
• Indoor drone challenge
• Warehouse swarm challenge
• Miniature fire fighting challenge
These challenges provide a good balance between feasibility and the resources required
for WPI to host, potential participant interest, and the resources required to enter. They
also help develop skills that are highly relevant in the robotics industry, and experience with
them would put participants at an advantage when seeking a job.
38
5.2.1 Indoor Drone Challenge
The first of the selected challenges is the indoor drone challenge. This challenge would task
participating teams to build a miniature autonomous drone to transport packages from a
pickup location to a destination. This is designed to simulate tasks that companies like Uber
and Amazon are building full-sized drones for. This miniature scale of this competition is
important because it means that:
• Low cost to host - One of the largest benefits of an indoor drone challenge is the
low cost to host. The resources required to host this competition are as follows: a 100
by 100 by 50 foot indoor netted space, cardboard boxes to be used as obstacles, and a
grid on the floor made from tape and plywood.
• Low cost of entry - For those looking to enter this challenge, the cost to entry is
relatively low due to the high availability of parts. It is estimated that teams would
have to spend between $500 and $5,000 on hardware, depending on the size of the
drone, the compute modules chosen, and selected sensors.
• Marketable skills - For this challenge, the skills developed are mostly software-based.
These skills include computer vision, obstacle avoidance, and advanced autonomous
navigation. Mechanical skills are also developed, such as designing impact-resistant
systems and with general computer aided design.
• Spectator value - Highest among all selected challenges is the spectator value of
drones. For example, drone racing has grown to become highly popular in the last
few years with it expected to keep growing as companies such as ESPN beginning to
broadcast it [25].
5.2.2 Warehouse Swarm Challenge
The warehouse swarm challenge would task participating teams to create both a hardware
and software platform for five robots to interact with a miniature warehouse and pick up
and deliver packages from and to specified locations. This challenge was chosen because:
• Low cost to host - As with the indoor drone challenge, the warehouse swarm challenge
also has a low cost to host. The resources need are as follows: up to 100 by 100 foot
indoor space and several boards with miniature packages and shelves to simulate the
warehouse.
• Low cost of entry - Again like the indoor drone challenge, this challenge has a low
cost of entry for participating teams. The hardware required are all fairly simple, with
components readily available. It is estimated that teams would have to spend between
$1,000 and $7,500 on hardware, depending on the complexity of mechanisms, sensors,
and compute modules.
• Multi-robot challenge - This challenge satisfies the interest we had for a multi-robot
competition with the potential of collaboration with other teams possible.
39
• Marketable skills - Skills developed through participation in this challenge are both
mechanical and software based. Software skills, such as computer vision, obstacle avoid-
ance, autonomous navigation, and swarm algorithms, are developed with mechanical
skills, such as computer aided design and the design of mechanical manipulators.
5.2.3 Miniature Fire Fighting Challenge
The miniature fire fighting challenge would task participating teams with creating robots to
seek out and extinguish a flame on a small table-top field. It was primarily chosen because it
would allow existing participants of the Trinity Fire Fighting Competition have their robots
compete for a second time. This challenge would also have the following benefits:
• Low cost to host - As with the other two proposed challenges, the miniature fire
fighting challenge has a low cost to host. The resources required to host this competi-
tion are as follows: a 100 by 100 foot indoor space and several boards with the layouts
described in the rules handbook.
• Low cost of entry - this challenge has a low cost of entry for participating teams.
The hardware required are all fairly simple, with components readily available. It
is estimated that teams would have to spend between $100 and $1,000 on hardware,
depending on the complexity of mechanisms, sensors, and compute modules.
• Low difficulty - This challenge was originally targeted at high school students, so the
expected technical difficulty is low.
• Marketable skills - Skills developed through participation in this challenge are both
mechanical and software based. Software skills, such as computer vision, autonomous
navigation, and obstacle avoidance, would be developed as well as basic mechanical
skills, such as computer aided design.
5.3 Future Work and Implementation
This IQP identified three robotics challenges that WPI could feasibly host in a first iteration
of a collegiate robotics competition, when and where it could take place on campus, and how
it could be funded. The actual execution of our proposed competition was not in the scope of
this IQP so an actual committee should be formed to execute the event for the first time. This
committee would ideally include key members from offices of TouchTomorrow, Corporate
Engagement, the Events Office, and the Robotics Resource Center as well as professors from
the robotics program who are experts in the technical and educational aspects robotics.
The earliest this event could happen would be during TouchTomorrow 2019, with the rules
and competition being announced no later than June of 2018. This would give universities
enough time to form teams, get funding, and build a competing robot.

ABSTRACT 
Some of the most dynamic and demanding careers are in the areas of science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  However, when analyzing gender, there are great 
disparities among gender in STEM.  Statistics indicate females are vastly underrepresented and 
males are employed double the rate of females.  Leading STEM companies are creatively trying 
to attract future STEM laborers by means of science and engineering competitions.  The purpose 
of this quantitative causal comparative study was to investigate if there are differences in 
attitudes between male and female students participating in a robotics competition.  A 
convenience sample of public school students (N = 194) from grades 7-12 that participated in a 
southeastern state robotics competition were used in this study.  The sample consisted of 69 
females and 125 males.  The researcher administered a modified version of the Student’s Attitude 
toward Science Fairs Survey customized for use at a robotics competition.  The instrument 
measured students’ overall attitudes toward science and engineering competitions and further 
explored two constructs: usefulness (utility value) and enjoyment (intrinsic value) of the 
competition.  A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to determine if 
differences existed between male and female students’ attitudes towards science and engineering 
competitions and results were disclosed.  The MANOVA results determined that there are no 
significant differences found among male and female students and their enjoyment, value 
(usefulness), and total (overall attitude) values towards a robotics competition, Wilks’s Λ = 1.00, 
F(2, 191) = 0.10, p > .05, partial η2 = 0.001.  Thus, the researcher failed to reject the null 
hypothesis.  Implications of this investigation and future recommendations for future studies 
were discussed.  
Keywords: robotics competitions, attitude, gender, usefulness, enjoyment

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION 
Overview 
This chapter will introduce the reader to the concept of student attitudes towards robotics 
competitions.  It will expound on pertinent background information that establishes the 
importance of robotics competitions as a means for attracting individuals to the science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce.  This section will also explain the 
problem within the STEM workforce and establish the clear purpose for this research study.  The 
significance of the study will be outlined, and research questions will be established that directly 
relate to the stated problem and purpose of the study.  The researcher will conclude this chapter 
by defining key terms that are necessary for the reader to understand the context of the research 
study as it pertains to student attitudes towards robotics competitions.   
Background 
 One of the most innovative and competitive career fields within the modern global 
workforce is within the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  
These careers in STEM are crucial for the competitiveness of a nation and direct the future of the 
global workforce (Langdon, McKittrick, Beede, Khan, & Doms, 2011; National Science Board, 
2010, 2015, 2016).  The STEM workforce has expanded fervently in recent years.  Landivar 
(2013a) revealed that economic developers/leaders throughout the globe cite their primary goal is 
to expand and promote the STEM workforce to strengthen and create competitive global 
markets.  According to reports by the United States Census Bureau, employees within the STEM 
workforce comprise approximately 6% (i.e. upwards of nine million workers in 2015) of the 
overall workforce in the United States (Landivar, 2013b; Noonan, 2017).  In such a demanding 
and competitive employment area, there are notable inconsistencies present when examining 
13 

 

STEM workforce demographics.  One example is the evident disparity gender gap, specifically 
among female presence, within the STEM workforce (National Science Board, 2010, 2015, 
2016; National Science Foundation, 2017; Witherspoon, Schunn, Higashi, & Baehr, 2016).  This 
disproportionality between males and females in STEM has fueled initiatives that seek to narrow 
the disparity gap.  Gender disparity is an apparent problem within the STEM field.  Rationale for 
this problem is due to the overwhelmingly untapped potential of skilled females not represented 
in the STEM workforce, gender identity issues influenced by societal pressures, and 
expectancy/value relationships interpreted by genders in pursuit of STEM fields.  There have 
been variations of disparity among ranges in the age of females within the STEM workforce.  
Specifically, recent data emphasized that younger women have demonstrated a smaller amount 
of improvement (Landivar, 2013a).  Furthermore, Landivar (2013a) highlighted that females are 
exceedingly underrepresented in specific STEM fields that comprise the bulk of the STEM 
workforce, such as engineering and computer science, in an arena where men are employed at a 
ratio of 2:1 to the opposite sex.  Many initiatives to close the disparity gap are evoked by STEM 
employers. 
According to Van Langen and Dekkers (2005) leading STEM companies and numerous 
countries are investing significant capital in sponsorship of scientific and engineering 
competitions such as robotics competitions and related educational programs to attract the next 
generation of laborers (i.e. highly qualified men and women) to effectively sustain the demands 
of the STEM workforce.  The area of robotics has become extremely popular among school-age 
boys and girls around the globe and continues to grow due to its technical and innovative nature 
(Menekse, Schunn, Higashi, & Baehr, 2015).  These robotics competitions allow young men and 
women to demonstrate their scientific knowledge and fine-tune their problem-solving skills as 
14 

 

they apply them to real world scenarios (Aroca et al., 2016).  These qualities are greatly pursued 
by employers in the STEM industry.  As a result, these competitions seek to attract young men 
and women into the competitive and demanding STEM work areas and get participants excited 
about STEM fields. 
Historically, the idea of scientific and engineering competitions such as robotics 
competitions began in the form of science fairs, beginning in the early part of the 20th century 
(Westbury, 2016).  Over time, these competitions became more specialized and diverse.  Due to 
the stringent industrial demands of society and potential competitiveness of foreign countries, the 
field of robotics was mainly developed as an outgrowth of the Industrial Revolution (Petrina, 
2008).  The field of robotics has been used to effectively increase production in the 
manufacturing industry.  As the supply and demand of materials and goods persisted to increase, 
the robotics industry was being heavily relied upon to meet the demands of consumers (Petrina, 
2008).  This phenomenon, in turn, increased the need for large numbers of skilled men and 
women laborers within STEM careers to fuel the global marketplace.  Workers that were 
attracted mainly to STEM careers historically held jobs in areas that were mostly dominated by 
males (Iskander, Gore, Furse, & Bergerson, 2013; Mann & DiPrete, 2013), and this trend has 
contributed to the gender disparity within the STEM workforce (Beede et al., 2011; Landivar, 
2013a; National Science Board, 2010, 2015, 2016; National Science Foundation, 2017; 
Witherspoon et al., 2016).  In recent decades, there has been progress made to narrow the gender 
gap in the STEM workforce (Wang & Degol, 2016), but disparity still persists, and STEM 
employee shortfalls are being projected for the future.   
As the former generation of STEM laborers approach retirement, the demand for highly-
skilled and trained young men and women are needed to fill the demands of the STEM 
15 

 

workforce.  Although trends tend to forecast an immense shortage of workers in STEM careers 
(Welch, 2010), country leaders have made bold initiatives to increase the production of highly-
skilled and trained laborers that possess 21st-century skills to seek positions in the STEM field 
(Brown, Thoman, Smith, & Diekman, 2015).  To attract the needed workforce in STEM, 
programs such as FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) have been 
developed to promote STEM learning and showcase STEM careers through distinct types of 
robotics competitions based on age appropriateness.   
Developed in 1989, FIRST, a non-profit international organization founded by Dean 
Kamen was developed to promote STEM initiatives for young men and women students and to 
enhance their interest in the STEM field with hopes of those individuals securing future careers 
within the STEM workforce (FIRST At A Glance, 2017).  These robotics and engineering 
competitions are very beneficial to students and promote needed skill sets that embody STEM 
from multiple academic disciplines (Andic, Grujicic, & Markus, 2015).  Student participation in 
these robotics competitions fosters complex learning concepts through a hands-on learning 
approach and forces students to develop team building skills and solve complex problems based 
on real-world scenarios (Aroca et al., 2016; Shen & Prior, 2016).  These learning concepts are 
rooted within various theoretical ideologies and frameworks. 
The theoretical basis underlining the concept of student attitudes obtained from 
participating in robotics and engineering competitions are rooted in three ideologies: expectancy-
value theory, gender schema theory, and intersectionality theory.  The expectancy-value theory 
(EVT) establishes “positive relationships between students’ subjective task values and academic 
achievement” (Westbury, 2016, p. 15).  The EVT articulates an individual’s belief regarding 
their ability to accomplish a specific task (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000).  An individual that believes 
16 

 

he/she can accomplish a specific task naturally would have a positive attitude towards 
completing the task (i.e. sense of confidence).  The participation in robotics and engineering 
competitions can also be rooted in gender schema theory.  The gender schema theory (GST) 
establishes that the driving force of an individual’s ideology of gender is highly influenced by 
stereotypical constructs and cognitive predispositions that are established by societal 
perspectives (Bem, 1981; Starr & Zurbriggen, 2017).  Ultimately, the pressures and influence of 
society greatly shape an individual’s perspectives on the concept of gendering.  Another ideology 
related to this research study is the intersectionality theory.  This is a specialized ideology that is 
specific to the analysis of issues related to gender, social class, and race and ascertains that 
complex issues as these must focus on the interconnections (i.e. or “intersectionality”) of 
multiple variables related to the situation/problem being studied (Crenshaw, 1989, 1991).  This 
theory further establishes that the integration of all societal oppression aspects (i.e. related to 
gender, social class, and race), when analyzed collectively, also establish a cooperative construct 
that reveals solutions to problems (Collins, 1986, 1998).  It is more imperative to study the sum 
of all parts regarding societal problems than analyzing individual variables one at a time. 
The STEM arena has greatly changed over the course of history with the goal of 
positively impacting society by means of meeting its demands and that of its consumers globally 
(Andic et al., 2015; Samuels, 2016).  The field of robotics was developed to meet the 
requirements of the global societal market and fueled by consumers’ supply and demand.  STEM 
companies became innovative and began investing money in educational programs to ensure 
they had a highly-trained workforce of men and women that possess the necessary skills to meet 
21st-century demands and drive global competitiveness (Brown et al., 2015; Landivar, 2013b; 
Samuels, 2016).  Programs such as FIRST were developed in the form of robotics and 
17 

 

engineering competitions to attract and recruit young men and women to the STEM community 
with future aspirations of pursing STEM careers to improve society (FIRST At A Glance, 2017).  
However, with projected future job shortages and noted disparity gender gaps within the STEM 
workforce, the challenge persists of how to meet societal demands and future requirements to 
sustain the future STEM marketplace for future generations.  The goal of overcoming this 
challenge is by means of attracting and recruiting highly-qualified men and women to the STEM 
workforce and assessing student interest and attitudes towards the STEM field as a potential 
future career choice. 
Problem Statement 
 In order to have a highly-trained and skilled STEM workforce comprised of talented men 
and women, it is important to develop and sustain programs such as robotics and engineering 
competitions, which allow students to apply their scientific knowledge and develop the necessary 
21st-century skills to be successful within the field (Andic et al., 2015, Aroca et al., 2016; Shen & 
Prior, 2016; Van Langen & Dekkers, 2005).  Due to anticipated job shortfalls in the future and 
noted inequalities in gender within the STEM workforce (National Science Board, 2010, 2015, 
2016; National Science Foundation, 2017; Witherspoon et al., 2016), it is crucial that these 
programs and/or competition participants be surveyed to assess their attitudes towards STEM 
(Huddleston, 2014; Westbury, 2016).  It is beneficial for students to have a positive experience 
and attitude at these competitions in hopes of future recruitments to the STEM field and 
workforce (Aroca et al., 2016; Drazan, Loya, Horne, & Eglash, 2017; Witherspoon et al., 2016).  
The attitudes of men and women participants should be investigated at these competitive events 
so that continual and methodical initiatives can be made to the competition to emphasize the 
enjoyment and usefulness of these extracurricular academic programs and stimulate future 
18 

 

STEM recruitment.  The students’ attitude is measured by combining usefulness and enjoyment 
values.  Shumow and Schmidt (2014) characterized usefulness as the value that one feels from 
completing a particular goal.  On the other hand, Wigfield and Eccles (1992) explained that 
enjoyment is the individual worth received by the participation in an event.  The National 
Science Teacher Association (2016) openly advocates for science competitions such as robotics 
and engineering competitions because of their value in reinforcing the STEM program in 
education.  Some research studies manifest more positive attitudes expressed by females in 
comparison to males at these science and engineering competitions (Dionne et al., 2012; 
Huddleston, 2014) despite the gender disparity within the STEM field (National Science Board, 
2010, 2015, 2016; National Science Foundation, 2017; Witherspoon, Schunn, Higashi, & Baehr, 
2016).  The problem is there are limited studies that specifically examine attitudinal differences 
and explore the two constructs of usefulness (utility value) and enjoyment (intrinsic value) 
between male and female students who participate in robotics competitions. 
Purpose Statement  
The purpose of this quantitative causal comparative study was to investigate differences 
in attitudes between male and female public-school students participating in a southeastern state 
robotics competition.  The independent variable, the sex of the individual, was used to analyze 
differences between gender groups (i.e. males and females) in order to investigate attitudes 
between groups towards robotics competitions.  The dependent variable, student attitude, had 
two separate components that were identified from student responses given as a result of the 
administration of the survey instrument they completed during the robotics competition.  Student 
attitude responses were measured by the Student’s Attitude towards Robotics Competitions 
(SATRC) survey (see Appendix A), which is a modified version of the Student’s Attitude 
19 

 

towards Science Fairs Survey (SATSFS), developed by Michael & Huddleston (2014) and 
abbreviated by Westbury (2016).  The instrument was specifically tailored for use at the FIRST 
robotics competition.  Overall, student attitude can be defined as “a feeling about the object, like 
or dislike” (Kind, Jones, & Barmby, 2007, p. 872).  The student attitude component of usefulness 
(utility value) is expressed as how useful the student perceives the life experience or participation 
in the robotics competition in influencing future career choices.  The enjoyment (intrinsic value) 
component is characterized as the self-gratification/positive meaning acquired by participation in 
the robotics competition.  The integration of analysis between variables of gender and student 
attitude at the robotics competition through the perspective of usefulness and enjoyment sheds 
some light on the gender discrepancy within STEM.  This research study provided valuable 
attitudinal information among genders to provide critical feedback on attractive forces present at 
the robotics competition that can mold future career choices within STEM.  
Significance of the Study 
This study investigated the attitudes of students between males and females towards 
robotics competitions, an area of research that has been minimally studied.  Considering future 
shortages in the STEM workforce (Welch, 2010) and apparent disparities in gender among 
STEM laborers (Beede et al., 2011; Landivar, 2013a, National Science Board, 2010, 2015, 2016; 
National Science Foundation, 2017; Witherspoon et al., 2016), this area of research is crucially 
important because of the need to attract new highly-trained and skilled STEM laborers (Aroca et 
al., 2016; Drazan et al., 2017; Witherspoon et al., 2016).  In order to expand the needed STEM 
workforce, it is essential to ascertain the attitudes of young men and women participating in 
robotics and engineering competitions, which are attractive events sponsored by STEM 
companies, to attract future STEM employees and sustain the field long-term.  These competitive 
20 

 

events serve as beacons of attraction for future STEM laborers; they are necessary to research in 
order to develop an understanding of the essential skills that are required to succeed in the next 
generation of STEM employees.  Investigating and analyzing robotics competition participant 
attitudes of potential future STEM employees is essential.  This analysis is important for future 
improvements of attractive programs (such as scientific competitions) so the needed skilled 
STEM laborers can be acquired to meet the demands of a thriving global economy and sustain 
the field for future generations.  Although there have been limited studies (i.e., Huddleston, 
2014; Westbury, 2016) that investigate student attitudes towards these science competitions by 
using a surveying instrument such as Student’s Attitude towards Science Fairs survey, this study 
expanded to other competitive events such as robotics competitions to acquire attitudinal 
knowledge as well as new populations, seeking input from students attending public schools.  
This research study is significant for a number of reasons due to the need to (a) address the 
gender disparity gap and assess student attitudes (both males and females) towards these STEM 
area competitions (National Science Board, 2010, 2015, 2016; National Science Foundation, 
2017; Witherspoon et al., 2016), (b) recruit/attract needed men and women to sustain the future 
of the STEM industry (Aroca et al., 2016; Drazan et al., 2017; Witherspoon et al., 2016), and (c) 
allow students the opportunity to explore STEM fields and apply their knowledge and skills in a 
competitive collaborative setting (Andic et al., 2015; Aroca et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2015; 
Landivar, 2013b; Samuels, 2016; Shen & Prior, 2016).

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW 
Overview 
The purpose of this quantitative causal comparative study was to investigate attitudinal 
differences between male and female students participating in a southeastern state robotics 
competition.  This chapter thoroughly discusses the three theoretical frameworks (i.e. 
expectancy-value theory, gender schema theory, and intersectionality theory) that are directly 
related to this research investigation.  Moreover, a brief history of robotics competitions is 
discussed to inform the reader of how these scientific competitions emerged and reveal their 
importance in recruiting future laborers (i.e. skilled men and women) to the science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce.  This chapter also focuses on specific topical 
aspects within the STEM field such as attitude and gender categorical characteristics while 
performing a thorough review of the literature that supports the research question within the 
study and validates the need for this and more research studies to be conducted that seeks to 
understand attitudinal and gender differences present within the STEM arena.  
Theoretical Framework 
Expectancy-Value Theory 
 One theory that has been extensively utilized within the study of educational ideology 
and behavior is the expectancy-value theory (EVT).  This theory is widely used by scholars in 
investigating the motivation of an individual’s achievement (Flake, Barron, Hulleman, McCoach, 
& Welsh, 2015; Guo, Marsh, Parker, Morin, & Dicke, 2017; Guo, Marsh, Parker, Morin, & 
Yeung, 2015; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000; Wu & Fan, 2017).  The EVT was developed by 
Atkinson in the mid 1950’s to investigate and understand an individual’s attitudes and 
motivation for achievement of academic tasks.  According to Eccles-Parsons et al. (1983), the 
23 

 

EVT, as explored by Atkinson (1957), primarily focused on “individual differences in the motive 
to achieve and on the effects of subjective expectancy on both this motive and the incentive 
value of success” (p. 79).  The three variables used to establish the EVT are motive, expectancy, 
and incentive (Atkinson, 1957).  These variables can be mathematically formulated into an 
equation to compute an individual’s motivation value.  Expectancy is defined as actions that 
occur within a given situation that leads to an outcome, incentive is conceptualized as a lure or 
attractant that entices an individual to produce a desired behavior or outcome, and motive is 
characterized as an individual’s determination to be satisfied at a desired level in which they are 
comfortable or internally fulfilled (Atkinson, 1957).  Atkinson’s EVT was later improved upon 
by the work of Eccles-Parsons et al. (1983) that transformed the theory from its traditional 
motivational roots to a more modern cognitive construct.   
The new cognitive construct expanded the classic EVT as presented by Atkinson (1957).  
The cognitive construct is defined in terms of “causal attributions, subjective expectancies, self-
concepts of abilities, perceptions of task difficulty, and subjective task value” (Eccles-Parsons et 
al., 1983, p. 79).  Eccles-Parsons et al. (1983) outlined that this approach is rooted on the 
assumption of reality interpretation and is facilitated by several factors, such as “causal 
attributional patterns for success and failure, the input of socializers, perceptions of one’s own 
needs, values, and sex-role identity as well as perceptions of the characteristics of the task” 
(Eccles-Parsons et al., 1983, p. 81).  Eccles-Parsons tended to focus on expectancy and value as 
related to achievement behaviors.  Overall, the EVT establishes that an individual’s success to 
perform a given task is rooted in their confidence to complete the task, subjective task value (or 
value they put on the task), and the individuals level of interest in the task (Petri & Govern, 
2004; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000, 2002; Wu & Fan, 2017).  As a result, an individual who has high 
24 

 

confidence to complete a given task and that task is deemed of high value to the individual, the 
more likely they are to have a more positive behavior associated with that choice and result in a 
higher level of determination to compete the given or sought task (Wu & Fan, 2017).  The 
success of individuals is more prevalent in a task they value as being important.  Ball, Huang, 
Cotton, and Rikard (2017) stated that “students will choose to persist in activities in which they 
expect to succeed in and for which they personally value” (p. 373).  As a result, an individual’s 
personal value of a given task fuels their rate of success. 
Within the EVT there are various constructs that comprise and/or influence specific 
variables.  For example, Eccles (1987) established that task value could be framed in multiple 
components, such as attainment value, intrinsic/interest value, utility value, and cost.  The EVT 
directly correlates with the research question used in this research study.  The research focuses 
on the following criteria: student teams building a robot (task value or task itself) through hands-
on learning/achievement, the measurement of student enjoyment (intrinsic value) of building 
robots and competing against other school robotics teams, the determination/drive of doing well 
in the competition (attainment value) and sense of pride or self-worth acquired at the 
competition, the method by which this learning process influences future decisions (utility value) 
to pursue a STEM career, and the time planning/management involved and/or sacrifices (cost) 
incurred that detracts from participating in other desired tasks.  This research investigation was 
deeply rooted and representative of the EVT theoretical framework and grows the base of 
knowledge by investigating EVT through the lens of attitudinal differences among gender of 
students participating in robotics competitions. 
25 

 

Gender Schema Theory 
 In embryo, all individuals begin to develop their physical traits that will characteristically 
define them for their natural lives, especially their gender. However, once born and exposed to 
the societal environment, individuals are exposed/programmed to societal gendered stereotypes 
that will greatly shape their social and cognitive development throughout their lives.  The gender 
schema theory (GST), a social-cognitive theory, was developed by Bem in 1981 for the purpose 
of investigating and focusing the manner that society defines and influences gender by means of 
stereotypical constructs that influences an individual’s cognitive perceptions and social behavior 
(Bem, 1981; Starr & Zurbriggen, 2017).  In other words, gendering is driven by society’s 
perception and influences the individual’s cognitive perceptions of gender.  Bem (1981) 
established that GST is primarily derived from sex-typing (rooted in gender specific social 
behaviors) that establish the gender schema, which are highly influenced by society.  On that 
premise, a society’s gender schema is very influential in shaping the cognitive perceptions of 
children from a very young age (Donnelly et al., 2016; Donnelly & Twenge, 2017; Woodington, 
2010).  Children are very easily influenced to integrate their society’s gender schema into their 
own perceptions of sex typing and identity (Bem, 1981; Starr & Zurbriggen, 2017; Woodington, 
2010).  Throughout the child’s life, he/she will integrate aspects of the society’s gender schema 
into his/her own.  According to Bem (1981), during this shaping of gender schema, the child will 
also “evaluate his or her adequacy as a person in terms of the gender schema, to match his or her 
preferences, attitudes, behaviors, and personal attributes against the prototypes stored within it” 
(p. 355).  This also leads into the child’s fitting into one of two categories as deemed or defined 
by society, masculine (or maleness) or feminine (femaleness). 
26 

 

 The dichotomy of ideologies related to masculinity and femininity for individuals are 
heavily influenced by societal factors.  Bem (1972, 1981) emphasized that these gender schema 
characteristics or dichotomies are conceptualized as an “internalized motivational factor” (p. 
355), and the individual will equivocate their behavioral characteristics to fit into one of these 
categories as defined by their culture.  These categorical sex-typing constructs are viewed as 
“sex-typed individuals not primarily in terms of how much masculinity or femininity they 
possess, but in terms of whether or not their self-concepts and behaviors are organized on the 
basis of gender” (Bem, 1981, p. 356).  Essentially, the degree to which an individual’s 
society/culture establishes masculinity or femininity determines that individual’s gender schema.  
GST directly correlates with the present research study due to the fact of the presence of societal 
sex-typing (Bem 1981, 1984, 1993) and inequality of gender prevalence within STEM careers 
(Beede et al., 2011; Bergeron & Gordon, 2017; Gayles & Ampaw, 2014; Heilbronner, 2013; 
Landivar, 2013a, 2013b; MacPhee, Farro, & Canetto, 2013; National Science Foundation, 2017; 
Simon, Wagner, & Killon, 2017).  This societal sex-typing of individuals calls for further 
research to investigate its effects related to specific gender dominated career paths.  
Intersectionality Theory 
 When investigating research studies/topics related to gender, race, social classes, and/or 
disparities among one or any of the topics mentioned, a theoretical framework that surfaces is 
intersectionality theory.  In 1989, Crenshaw, a skilled legal scholar of feminism and a prominent 
civil rights activist, developed the intersectionality theory.  Crenshaw (1989, 1991) established 
that topical studies regarding race and gender, mostly involving Black women, should not be 
studied or examined via variable isolation, but by investigating the interactions among the 
variables related to societal issues, such as issues among gender, race, and social classes.  Thus, 
27 

 

one must look at the sum of the parts as they interact instead of looking at just one independent 
variable.  Crenshaw (1989) stated, for example, that “because the intersectional experience is 
greater than the sum of racism and sexism, any analysis that does not take intersectionality into 
account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black women are 
subordinated” (p. 140).  It is important to analyze the interrelatedness of the variables to fully 
assess and understand the problem. 
 The intersectionality theory was also expanded and broadened by Collins (1986, 1998).  
Collins involved the issues and societal aspects of the 1990s and tried to modernize the theory 
based on new societal impacts and ideologies.  Collins (1998) stated that it is important to study 
the family structure and “as opposed to examining gender, race, class, and nation, as separate 
systems of oppression, intersectionality explores how these systems mutually construct one 
another” (p. 63).  It is implied that the variables examined build upon one another and are 
interdependent.  Collins (1998) focused on the traditional family and how the variables of 
gender, race, and nation intersected.  One particular aspect of study in the traditional family 
system was the concept of home and the variable that impacted the home, such as place, space, 
and territory.  Collins (1998) established the traditional societal establishment of men and 
women, particularly related to gender.  Collins (1998), for example, established the observation 
that “within gendered spheres of private and public space, women and men again assume 
distinctive roles” (p. 67).  The traditional idea of male and female roles during that time period 
was identified to suggest that men are providers of the family and household while women are 
caregivers for the children and their “place” is within the home (Collins, 1998).  On the other 
hand, this ideology establishes that the role of men is to “support and defend the private, 
feminized space that houses their families” (Collins, 1998, p. 67).  Although this ideology for the 
28 

 

traditional role of women has been disavowed by feminist (Collins, 1998), Collins still agreed 
with Coontz (1992) that this rationale is still thriving and accepted by much of society.  
Intersectionality theory associates with the present research study due to the presence of gender 
disparity within the STEM workforce (Beede et al., 2011; Bergeron & Gordon, 2017; Gayles & 
Ampaw, 2014; Heilbronner, 2013; Landivar, 2013a, 2013b; MacPhee et al., 2013; National 
Science Foundation, 2017; Simon et al., 2017) and the need to further investigate the 
intersections (Collins, 1992, 1998; Crenshaw, 1989, 1991) of traditional family roles of men and 
women (Collins, 1992, 1998) and that pronounced disparity.

History of Robotics Competitions 
 One of the most exciting and growing aspects within the STEM field is within the realm 
of robotics.  Since ancient times, the idea of robotics was first envisioned as “mechanical 
machines” (Petrina, 2008).  Some of the first “mechanical machines” were observed in the early 
16th century.  Leonardo da Vinci, well known for his sensational painting ability, is also known 
for intertwining that talent with the early forms of engineering to produce a mechanical lion for 
the King of France, Francis I (Petrina, 2008).  Da Vinci intended for the lion to walk towards the 
king and take him lilies which were enclosed in the lion’s chest (Burke, 2006).  The actual term 
“robot” did not become known until much later, specifically in the early part of the 20th century 
and the term “robotics” did not become well known until 1942 by the famous scientist, Isaac 
Asimov (Petrina, 2008). 
 The concept of robotics competitions for school age children began in the late 1980’s.  In 
1989, a non-profit organization known as FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and 
Technology) was developed by Dean Kamen. FIRST is recognized and known internationally 
29 

 

around the world as a leader in the promotion of STEM initiatives (FIRST Vision and Mission, 
2017).  FIRST was primarily developed as an attractant to entice new and young faces to the 
STEM workforce, promote STEM learning, and showcase STEM careers through distinct types 
of robotics competitions based on age appropriateness such as Junior FIRST LEGO League (Jr. 
FLL) for ages 6-9, FIRST LEGO League (FLL) for ages 9-14, FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) for 
ages 14-18, and FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) for ages 14-18.  Each of these competitions 
is based on a specific challenge or project and expose young men and women to STEM concepts 
through hands-learning applications (FIRST Educators, 2017).  The mission of FIRST is “to 
inspire young people’s interest and participation in science and technology, and to motivate them 
to purse education and career opportunities in STEM fields” (FIRST At A Glance, 2017, p. 1). 
 In 1990, the First Robot Olympics was launched in Scotland and developed by Peter 
Mowforth (Buckley, 2015).  The competition was sponsored by The Turing Institute.  This was 
the first international robotics competition of its kind in the world (Buckley, 2015).  The 
competition consisted of various categorical events, and winners would be judged on three 
criteria: quality of material used, complexity of robot movements, and innovation (Buckley, 
2015).  Only three years later, in 1993, another robotics competition was developed called BEST 
(Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology) Robotics that is very similar to FIRST 
Robotics Competitions, specifically the FIRST Tech Challenge designed for ages 14-18 (Strobel 
et al., 2014).  BEST Robotics is a yearly robotics competition that is held in the United States.  
The competition was founded by Ted Mahler and Steve Maruum, engineers for Texas 
Instruments (Best History, 2017).  According to Strobel et al. (2014), BEST Robotics is 
identified as “a project-based robotics competition in which students learn to analyze and solve 
problems using the engineering design process” (p. 390).   
30


In 1997, another prominent robotics competition was developed called RoboCup.  
RoboCup is a conceptual idea in which the game of soccer is played by robots; it was first 
envisioned by Alan Mackworth, professor for the University of British Columbia, Canada (“A 
Brief History of RoboCup,” 2017).  RoboCup is an international robotics event and is held in 
various countries throughout the globe.  The RoboCup organization has a primary objective that 
“by the middle of the 21st century, a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot soccer players 
shall win a soccer game, complying with the official rules of FIFA, against the winner of the 
most recent World Cup” (“RoboCup Objective,” 2017).  Just one year later, the Eurobot robotics 
competition, an international contest, was developed by Planète Sciences, a French association 
and the producer company VM Group (“Eurobot History,” 2017).  The objective of the Eurobot 
is to expose youth to a fun and exciting robotics event where they can learn fundamental 
principles that will prepare them for future avenues and all robots developed for this competition 
are completely autonomous robots (“Eurobot Objective,” 2017).  This event is set up similarly 
like the FIRST Robotics Competitions in which a new yearly scenario or game is developed that 
requires the robot to be programmed to perform specific tasks. 
In 2001, the RoboRAVE International robotics competition was created in New Mexico.  
RoboRAVE International was developed by Russ Fisher-Ives and is a program of Inquiry 
Facilitators, Inc.  The program seeks to educate students about how to develop a functional robot 
by design, building, and programming that can complete a specific task (“About RoboRAVE,” 
2017).  The event is the largest robotics competition of its kind in New Mexico.   
In 2004, two other robotics competitions were developed called World Robot Olympiad 
(WRO) and RoboGames.  The World Robot Olympiad was developed by four founding 
countries: China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore.  The mission of WRO is “to bring together 
31 

 

young people all over the world to develop their creativity, design and problem-solving skills 
through challenging and educational robot competitions and activities” (“WRO Association 
Introduction,” 2017, p. 1).  The WRO has various learning objectives established for their 
competition participants.  The WRO seeks to promote STEM learning across the globe, advocate 
a forum for young people to come and learn about the field of robotics in hopes of expanding and 
inspiring students to pursue STEM careers, and develop the necessary 21st-century skills 
necessary to be successful in STEM (“WRO Association Introduction,” 2017). 
 RoboGames is a robotics competition that is held in California, founded by David 
Calkins, and is considered the world’s largest robotics competition as reported by Guinness Book 
of World Records (RoboGames History, 2017).  RoboGames is a multidimensional robotics 
competition in which robots can be entered in a variety of events, such as Humanoids, Combat, 
Sumo, Autonomous Humanoid Challenges, Robot Soccer, Open Categories, Art Bots, Jr. 
League, and Autonomous Autos (“RoboGames Event Schedule and Rules,” 2017).  These 
complex challenges force the robot designer to apply knowledge from real-world scenarios and 
apply scientific principles.  These robotics competitions are rich learning environments that 
foster complex problem-solving skills, team building principles, and expose young people to the 
STEM arena, which is widely responsible for a competitive global economy (Andic et al., 2015; 
Aroca et al., 2016; Haynes & Edwards, 2015; Melchior, Burack, Hoover, & Marcus, 2017; 
Melchior, Cohen, Cutter, & Leavitt, 2005; Nugent, Barker, Grandgenett, & Welch, 2016; 
Petrina, 2008). 
Attitudes in STEM 
 One of the most critical issues within the science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) arena is the need to attract competent young men and women to the field to 
32 

 

meet the global demands, fueled by societal needs, for future generations.  In order to attract the 
needed workforce to sustain the future STEM needs around the globe and attract new men and 
women, it is essential to create positive attitudes of individuals towards STEM for those who are 
exposed to the highly-energetic workforce (Ali, Yager, Hacieminoglu, & Caliskan, 2013; Najafti, 
Ebrahimitabass, Dehghani, & Rezaei, 2012).  The attitude that an individual possesses towards a 
specific task is a key factor in determining behavior intentions and the likelihood for future 
participation in the task (Huang, Chiu, & Hong, 2016).  One area conducive to fostering more 
positive attitudes towards STEM begins in schools.  Alsup (2015) stated “educational reforms 
that help maintain high attitudes towards STEM subjects any improve the likelihood of high-
attitude students pursuing STEM-related careers, regardless of academic level” (p. 33).   
Attitudes are rooted in various constructs that can contribute to the desired meaning as it relates 
to this research investigation and illuminate a more thorough understanding of the overall 
attitude of an individual.  Alsup (2015) postulated that an individual “responds to ideas, 
concepts, and in this context, school subjects, with conditional thought patterns based on 
internalized opinions” (p. 33).  Thus, an individual essentially pre-forms opinions as to various 
stimuli and completion of task and that pre-determined judgement is greatly influential in 
developing one’s attitude towards a specific concept. 
The term attitude can be interpreted in many approaches.  However, for the purposes of 
this research study, the attitude of an individual can be defined and conceptualized as “a feeling 
about an object, like or dislike” (Kind et al., 2007, p. 872).  Attitude can be conceptualized in 
terms of the intrinsic (enjoyment) value and utility (usefulness) value.  According to Alsup 
(2015), the term attitude can be conceptualized in terms of “internal perception of a target” and 
the ability of that target to position itself “on the continuum between favor and disfavor” (p. 34).  
33 

 

These variables complement and influence the overall attitude of an individual.  An individual 
that finds enjoyment in a particular task will also foster a positive attitude towards the task 
(Tyler-Wood, Ellison, Lim, & Periathiruvadi, 2012).  Likewise, an individual that finds a task 
useful has a greater probability of having a positive attitude towards the performed task because 
the task has meaning to their overall cognitive ideology (Ali et al., 2013).  However, little 
research has been conducted regarding overall attitudes among gender of individuals involved in 
robotics competitions.  There is justification that research needs to be conducted to analyze 
attitudinal differences at robotics competition. 
Gender in STEM 
A distinguishing factor that has been studied extensively within the dominion of the 
STEM workforce and is very apparent when looking at STEM recruitment initiatives is 
interconnected to the concept of gender.  Since the emergence of the STEM initiative, one 
repeated characteristic that has not subsided within the STEM workforce is the apparent gender 
disparity among male and female laborers occupying STEM careers in society (Beede et al., 
2011; Bergeron & Gordon, 2017; Gayles & Ampaw, 2014; Heilbronner, 2013; Landivar, 2013a, 
2013b; MacPhee et al., 2013; National Science Foundation, 2017; Simon et al., 2017; Yonghong, 
2015).  The research is still completely unclear as to the severity of gender disparity prevalent in 
the STEM workforce.  Some research has suggested that disparity regarding gender has 
improved while other studies still suggest underrepresentation of females in STEM is 
increasingly apparent and still a significant issue (Beede et al., 2011; Bergeron & Gordon, 2017; 
Gayles & Ampaw, 2014; Heilbronner, 2013; Landivar, 2013a, 2013b; MacPhee et al., 2013; 
National Science Foundation, 2017; Simon et al., 2017; Yonghong, 2015) that must be given 
attention to successful resolve issues and recruit needed men and women for future STEM 
34 

 

positions.  Gayles & Ampaw (2014) emphasized the need to resolve the gender issue and 
explained that “the rate at which women persist in and obtain undergraduate degrees in some 
science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (stem) majors is an issue of national concern” 
(p. 439).  There have been studies that have attempted to explain methods of making the 
prevalence of gender difference more equitable (Reilly, Rackley, & Awad, 2017; Wang & 
Degol, 2016), but none have found an ideal solution to completely close the gender disparity gap.   
Some research suggests that societal stereotypes (Starr & Zurbriggen, 2017) influence 
this gender dichotomy.  However, it is not definitive if societal stereotypes are the primary 
reason of underrepresentation of females in STEM.  Many researchers agree (as cited in Gayles 
& Ampaw, 2014) that there may be various causes for this underrepresentation and “several 
explanations have been put forth to account for why women remain underrepresented in STEM, 
such as bias and gender stereotypes, biological differences between men and women, and lack of 
female role models in STEM fields” (p. 440).  From the onset of child development, gender 
stereotypes are instilled into children from birth throughout adulthood by societal influences 
and/or parental rearing.  Alsup (2015) explained the possible mindset of females to be one where 
they “may view science as incompatible with aspirations for relationship-oriented careers or jobs 
conducive to family life” (p. 44).  It is possible that society has molded females to only like 
certain types of content.  Archer et al. (2013) explained that more boys are interested in science 
than girls, and girls tend to see themselves within careers with a high degree of socialization, 
innovation, and occupations that allow them to spend ample times with their families.  Although 
there are more women working in the workforce than men, women tend to leave the STEM 
workforce to fulfill “family responsibilities” and end up in a work environment that does not 
conflict with family life (Heilbronner, 2013, p. 41).  As a result, there are apparent differences 
35 

 

between males and females and their pursuit in the STEM field and conceptualization of an ideal 
workforce.  Many research studies suggest that STEM careers are primarily male dominated 
(Bergeron & Gordon, 2017; Gayles & Ampaw, 2014; Heilbronner, 2013; Landivar, 2013a, 
2013b; National Science Board, 2016; National Science Foundation, 2017).   
The disparity can also be traced back to secondary and post-secondary educational 
training.  Female students in post-secondary education that take classes within the STEM 
disciplines do not complete the needed coursework to obtain a completed degree and/or pursue 
STEM careers (Bergeron & Gordon, 2017; Tyson, Lee, Borman, & Hanson, 2007).  Although 
females take STEM courses in college, they tend not to be enrolled at as high enrollment 
frequencies as males.  Bergeron & Gordon (2017) stated specifically that “females have 
significantly higher enrollment frequencies in six of the STEM subjects, while males have 
significantly higher enrollments in nine of the STEM subjects” (p. 436).  These statistics are 
perplexing due to relevant statistical outcome of college enrollment between men and women.  
Gayles & Ampaw (2014) established that “women outnumber men in college enrollments” and, 
despite these numbers, women are still “severely underrepresented in terms of undergraduate 
degree attainment in critical areas of study (such as STEM) in comparison to their male peers” 
(p. 439). 
It is obvious that research is not definitive as to the reasons of gender disparity within 
STEM and the present study sought to investigate attitudinal difference between males and 
females participating in robotics competition.  As stated previously, the literature is inconclusive 
as to the reason for this underrepresentation of women among STEM careers.  The lack of 
gender studies investigating differences in attitudes regarding robotics competitions validated the 
need for this research study.

Research Studies Investigating STEM Competitions   
Huddleston.  Huddleston (2014) conducted research related to survey instrument 
development to assess student attitudes at scientific competitions within the STEM field.  
Specifically, Huddleston (2014) stated the purpose of the study was to “further develop and 
refine a valid and reliable instrument to measure Student Attitudes towards Science Fairs” (p. 
15).  The researcher conducted an extensive literature review and found that few studies could be 
identified with focus particularly on survey instrument development that seek to assess the 
attitudes of students participating in science fairs.  As a result, Huddleston (2014) developed a 
survey instrument, originally researched by Michael (2005), that integrated nine areas important 
in assessing attitudes of students towards science fairs.  The resulting survey instrument that was 
produced consisted of 45 questions and assessed nine domains for student attitude.  Huddleston 
(2014) developed the survey instrument by building from the original survey instrument, 
developed by Michael (2005), that assessed overall attitudes of students at science fairs by 
utilizing Osborne’s (2003) nine domains.  The survey used to collect the data for this research 
study was the Student Science Fair Attitude Survey (SSFAS).   
The SSFAS was developed by incorporating nine domains that assess the attitudes of 
students towards science fairs.  The nine domains are achievement, anxiety, enjoyment, 
motivation, self-efficacy, social influences of parents, social influences of peers, social 
influences of teachers, and value (Huddleston, 2014).  Each domain specifically examines 
student attitudes from a specific perspective.  For example, achievement examines an 
individual’s aptitude to complete a specific task (Huddleston, 2014).  The next domain that 
examines attitude is anxiety, which is explained as a negative emotional state that examines the 
dichotomy of an individual’s feelings towards participating in a competitive environment such as 
37 

 

a science fair (Huddleston, 2014).  Another domain that was defined is enjoyment.  This term is 
explained as a positive emotional state acquired by an individual as a result of completing or 
participating in a specific academic task (Huddleston, 2014).  Motivation is another domain that 
is examined in the SSFAS.  This refers to an individual’s inner ambition and/or value placed on 
performing a specific behavior/task (Huddleston, 2014).  The SSFAS also assesses the domain of 
self-efficacy.  That is conceptualized much the same as self-esteem or the belief in oneself 
regarding how they relate themselves to a specific situation/circumstance (Huddleston, 2014).  
The next three domains are related to social influences from various external entities, such as 
parents, peers, and teachers.  Social influences of parents are simply the attitudinal actions of an 
individual as a result of parental association in a given task or event (Huddleston, 2014).  Much 
is the same with peer involvement.  Social influences of peers are explained as the effects of peer 
relationships on influencing an individual to perform a specific task (Huddleston, 2014).  The 
next social influence integrated into the survey instrument is that of teachers.  This domain is 
where individuals are inclined to participate in academic events due to teacher motivation and 
support (Huddleston, 2014).  Lastly is the domain of value.  Value is an individual’s worth 
placed on a task or “judgement by people as to what is important in their lives” (Huddleston, 
2014, p. 16). 
Huddleston (2014) conducted a quantitative research study.  This study postulated three 
research questions ascertaining validity, reliability, and number of dimensions comprising the 
Students’ Attitudes towards Science Fair scale (Huddleston, 2014).  The researcher documented 
the results of the research study in three parts.  Part I yielded statistical analysis of demographics 
from the study.  The sample size for this study was 111 middle school students from two 
different inner-city schools.  Student participants were enrolled in either seventh (69 students) or 
38 

 

eighth grades (41 students).  Huddleston (2014) stated that the final sample was 110 students, 
due to one survey being dismissed due to submission of one incomplete survey.  Students in the 
sample were predominantly white, female, seventh-grade students, and their science fair projects 
were primarily entered among one of three categories: behavioral & social sciences, chemistry, 
and physics & astronomy (Huddleston, 2014).  Data was also analyzed regarding awards and 
student participation in science fairs.  According to Huddleston (2014), most of the research 
subjects participating (97.3%) reported the science fair was a required part of their educational 
program.  Most subjects had participated in at least two science fairs in the past, and many (59%) 
were given an award for the science fair, the majority placing second (Huddleston, 2014). 
Part II of the results focused on the attitude of students towards science fairs.  The 
original unpublished survey developed by Michael (2005) with integrated research from Osborne 
et al. (2003) initially consisted of 45 questions (Huddleston, 2014).  Through principal 
component factor analysis and scree plot results, the domains of the survey instrument were 
decreased from nine to two domains, enjoyment and value.  Huddleston (2014) explained that the 
results guided to the reduction of the survey instrument from 45 questions to only 10 questions 
and was named the Student’s Attitude towards Science Fairs Survey (SATSFS).  A principal 
component factor analysis with a Varimax rotation was then performed on the remaining 10 
survey questions focused on the two domains of enjoyment and value (Huddleston, 2014).  
Internal consistency and reliability was reported using Cronbach’s alpha and yielded good 
internal consistency and reliability among the two domains of enjoyment and value.  The results 
of the factor analysis yielded a high correlation between the domains of enjoyment and value.  
There is a significant relationship found between enjoyment and value domains.  Huddleston 
(2014) concluded that “if a student enjoyed participation in science fairs, then they valued the 
39 

 

experience, and vice versa” (p. 68).  Part III of the results focused on future subject selections 
and career choices of students participating in science fairs.  According to Huddleston (2014), 
the results concluded the following: (a) the majority of students participating in the science fair 
(39.4%) do not intend to choose a STEM career, (b) the bulk of participants report (71.6%) that 
the science fair did not influence their future career choice, (c) participants in the science fair 
(27.8%) do not seek to enroll in advanced science courses; however, 25% of students state they 
will enroll in AP Biology as a result of the science fair, and (d) student participants 
overwhelmingly (70.0%) stated that participation in the science fair did not help them determine 
future class selection. 
This study discussed gender relationships regarding student attitudes towards science 
fairs.  During this research study, survey demographics of the sample concluded that females 
tended to have more positive attitudes towards science fairs than males; female participation and 
engagement were greater than males (Huddleston, 2014).  Research implications were also 
deduced regarding ethnicity, science fair categories, and awards.  There was no difference in 
attitudes among ethnicities and science fair categories entered; however, there were differences 
identified between attitudes and awards.  Huddleston (2014) stated that “about half of all 
participating students received an award of first, second, third, or fourth place” and “students 
who placed high in their category were rewarded by continuing onto a regional science fair” (p. 
72).  The researcher cited recommendations for future research studies, establishing the need for 
future perfections of instrument design and development to access student attitudes towards 
science fairs, investigating the impacts of influences on students and how that plays role in 
STEM career selection, and evaluating the relationship of awards on psychological feedback 
mechanisms of students.  Huddleston (2014) concluded the research study by emphasizing the 
40 

 

importance of recruiting the needed students required for future STEM careers and having good 
survey instrument tools that are needed to assess student attitudes regarding science fairs.  The 
researcher explained these tools would positively impact education personnel decision-making in 
their design of courses in STEM and educational opportunities offered to students to develop the 
STEM workforce. 
Westbury.  Westbury (2016) conducted research to evaluate differences in attitudes 
towards science fairs of students in Christian private schools based on gender.  The purpose of 
Westbury’s (2016) research study was to “determine if there is a difference in overall attitudes 
towards science fairs, enjoyment of science fairs, and usefulness of science fairs of male and 
female Christian private school students in fifth through eighth grades” (p. 18).  The researcher 
performed a thorough review of the literature discussing the historical account of science fairs 
and establishing the theoretical context and framework for the research study.  Westbury (2016) 
also focused the literature review on targeted attitudinal domains such as value, enjoyment, and 
motivation extracted from Huddleston’s (2014) research study previously mentioned.  Other 
major targeted areas in this research study focused on gender and religiosity implications 
regarding student attitudes within STEM.  Westbury (2016) used the Student’s Attitude towards 
Science Fairs Survey (SATSFS), as revised by Huddleston (2014) from the original work of 
Michael (2005).  The researcher altered the demographic section of the survey instrument to 
align with her research study and to assess religious affiliation to later assess relationship on 
student attitudes towards science fairs. 
 Westbury (2016) conducted a quantitative research study using a causal comparative 
design.  The researcher examined one research question evaluating differences of Christian 
private school students between gender as related to attitudes towards science fairs (Westbury, 
41 

 

2016).  The sample size for this study was 146 students (consisting of 72 males and 74 females), 
chosen by convenience sampling methods from four private, Protestant schools containing 
students in grades K-12.  According to Westbury (2016), the sample consisted of students in 
grades five through eight from schools participating in science fairs within the school district 
being surveyed.  The average age for both male and female groups were between the ages of 10 
and 14.  Westbury (2016) reported among the male group, the majority of students were from 
grade seven and eight (consisting of 25 students in each grade level participating in the research 
study) while within the female group, the majority of student participation originated from grade 
eight (comprising of 30 student participants of the overall female group).  The researcher 
revealed sample ethnicity results and recognized the majority of participants in the study 
identified themselves as Caucasian subjects in both male (95.8%) and female (86.5%) groups.  
When religious affiliation was assessed on the SATSFS instrument, Westbury (2016) revealed 
that research subjects identified themselves from one of three affiliated groups: Baptist (38.4%), 
Methodist (19.9%), and Non-denominational (17.1%).  The researcher also inquired as to the 
number of years that research subjects within the study had participated in science fairs.  
Westbury (2016) established that responses ranged primarily from one of three time-frames: one 
year (25.3%), three years (24.7%), and two years (21.2%).  Lastly, the researcher assessed 
science fair projects by the categorical discipline to which they were related; the majority of 
participants in the research study entered projects either related to chemistry (24.1%), other 
(20.7%), or physics & astronomy (14.5%) overall.  As previously mentioned, the entirely of the 
data was gathered by administration of the Student’s Attitude towards Science Fairs Survey 
(SATSFS) to student research subjects.   
42 

 

The results and findings from the research study were carefully documented after 
administration of the SATSFS.  Westbury (2016) stated that “a one-way multivariate analysis of 
variance (MANOVA) was conducted to determine the difference in attitudes between male and 
female participants towards science fairs on the dependent variables, overall attitude, student’s 
usefulness, and student’s enjoyment” (p. 65).  The researcher established that prior to 
administering the MANOVA, the data was screened for outliers and all testing assumptions were 
maintained.  The descriptive statistics revealed that the female group had marginally higher 
attitudes towards science fairs than the male group; however, males were observed to find 
science fairs more useful than females, and females tended to find science fairs more enjoyable 
than males (Westbury, 2016).  Student participant grade level group comparisons were also 
assessed.  Westbury (2016) revealed that overall (i.e. combined enjoyment and usefulness 
scores) fifth grade students had the highest totals while eighth grade participants had higher 
scores in usefulness and fifth grade students had higher scores in enjoyment.  Data analysis was 
also conducted among groups related to religious affiliation and years of participation in science 
fairs.  Overall, students who identified themselves in the Episcopal group had the highest overall 
average and greatest individual averages in enjoyment and usefulness; the same result was found 
in years of participation within science fairs where students identified the science fair as year one 
of participation had the highest overall average and greatest individual averages in enjoyment 
and usefulness.  As mentioned previously, prior to administering the MANOVA, the data was 
screened for outliers and all testing assumptions were tenable.  As a result, the MANOVA was 
conducted and revealed “there are no significant differences on the dependent variables 
(enjoyment, usefulness, and overall attitude toward science fairs) by gender of fifth through 
43 

 

eighth-grade students in Christian private schools” and “null hypothesis one failed to be 
rejected” (Westbury, 2016, p. 81). 
Upon completion of reporting the results of the research study, the researcher discussed 
the conclusions revealed in the investigation and how results are related to other studies 
investigating similar research subjects and content.  As stated earlier, the null hypothesis failed to 
be rejected as there were no significant differences found between the variables and gender.  The 
results of this research study were also compared to similar research studies.  The results of this 
study were compared to Huddleston’s (2014) research.  Westbury (2016) stated that initially the 
results “appear to contradict the study of Huddleston (2014, p. 63) who found a significant 
gender difference in attitudes between seventh and eighth-grade students” (p. 83).  The 
researcher explained that although the focus of the research studies were different, overall both 
Huddleston’s (2014) data and data from Westbury’s (2016) study correlated regarding gender 
implications/effects in relation to science fairs.  These findings and correlating agreement among 
researchers strengthen the data produced within these research investigations.  Westbury (2016) 
also suggested that the data collected and analyzed in this study agreed with results of other 
research in the field.  Furthermore, there is also agreeing research among studies investigating 
religious affiliation as well as school environment types (i.e. private and public-school models).  
Westbury (2016) revealed that other research correlates with information found in this study that 
“religious affiliation did not have any influence on students’ attitudes towards science fairs” (p. 
83) and, related to school environment types, as correlated with Huddleston’s (2014) study, 
“both private Christian school and public-school students share a positive attitude towards 
science fairs” (p. 83). 
44 

 

In reflecting on the research study, Westbury (2016) made some prominent conclusions 
from assessing the data.  As established previously, Westbury (2016) identified that from the 
initial review, this study contradicted some results of Huddleston’s (2014) research study in four 
specific circumstances.  The circumstances that were different between the research studies are 
“the instrumentation, the participants, time the survey was administered to the students” as well 
as school types surveyed (Westbury, 2016, p. 84).  The structure and mechanics of the survey 
instrumentation was a stark difference.  The original and revised surveys used and produced in 
the Huddleston (2014) study were based on a four-point Likert scale and altered to a five-point 
Likert scale in this research study (Westbury, 2016).  There were several notable differences 
identified among the student populations investigated between each study.  One significant 
difference was among student academic backgrounds being investigated.  The students in 
Huddleston’s (2014) study were those taking advanced science courses as opposed to this study 
defined by a student population that were sampled from various backgrounds of scientific 
understanding (Westbury, 2016).  Another change was observed with grade levels of students 
being surveyed.  Westbury (2016) revealed that her study used a wider range of grade levels (i.e. 
used grades five through eight) versus Huddleston’s (2014) study that focused on grades seven 
and eight.  There was also the difference among school demographics, specifically of school 
location types.  Westbury (2016) explained that students from her study were from private, 
Christian schools versus students in Huddleston’s (2014) study that were comprised of students 
from public inner-city schools.  Lastly was the difference regarding survey administration and 
timing.  The survey administered in Huddleston’s (2014) study was not given to students while 
the science fair was taking place but after the fact, whereas Westbury’s (2016) study was 
conducted during the science fair.  These four-distinct differences are noteworthy and should, 
45 

 

according to Westbury (2016), be investigated further to ensure that future data results are not 
prone to possible deficiencies in data gathering and analysis methodologies.  The researcher 
offered future research study areas and suggests that emphasis should be placed on studies that 
focus on relatedness and differences among genders, different grade levels (i.e. such as focus 
given to high school students), and studies that compare ethnic diversity.  Westbury (2016) 
explained that focusing on these future research topics may lead to much needed growth in 
diverse individuals pursuing STEM careers. 
There is a multitude of various factors that cause students, both males and females, to 
pursue STEM career pathways.  Although the research tends to suggest that STEM careers are 
typically male dominated (Iskander et al., 2013; Landivar, 2013a, 2013b; Mann & DiPrete, 
2013), females are also being drawn (Venture, 2014; Welch & Huffman, 2011; Witherspoon et 
al., 2016) to STEM careers by means of attractive factors.  One stimuli that can draw both males 
and females to the STEM arena is by means of scientific competitions (Aroca et al., 2016).  
Research studies establish that scientific competitions, such as robotics competitions, offer 
excellent benefits other than recruiting individuals to the STEM workforce.  Robotics 
competitions have been noted to increase academic achievement in a variety of learning 
subgroups.  The primary goal of a robotics competition is “the development of skills, interest, 
and awareness toward STEM and computing, a focus on the ability to effectively work in teams, 
and the development of cooperation and respect towards the other teams participating in the 
competitions” (Menekse et al., 2015, p. 1).  By participating in robotics competitions, students 
enhance their complex problem-solving skills, develop leadership qualities, and are more apt to 
seek college admission (Melchior et al., 2017; Melchior et al., 2005; Morgan, Gelbgiser, & 
Weeden, 2013).  The participation in these scientific competitions also foster needed team 
46 

 

building skills (Abernathy & Vineyard, 2001; Grote, 1995; Hayes & Edwards, 2015, Melchior et 
al., 2017; Melchior et al., 2005; Welch & Huffman, 2011).  Students also tend to perform better 
on standardized tests and are more apt to take more science and mathematics classes, which lead 
to pursuit of STEM majors in college (Nugent et al., 2016; Shen & Prior, 2016). 
 One specific type of learning modality that is manifested at a robotics competition is the 
ideology of learning through doing or hands-on learning.  Hands-on learning is a type of 
experiential learning where students learn complex content, like programming computer code or 
physically building robotic structures that effectively carry out a specific task.  Hands-on 
learning is a very common learning method in STEM fields.  Schwichow, Zimmerman, Crocker, 
& Hartig (2016) suggested that hand-on tasks are common and are often utilized in training 
individuals’ skills essential to experimentation.  Experiential learning was primarily developed 
from acknowledging that all individuals learn in a unique and preferred manner.  These learning 
methods are done through hands-on learning mechanisms.  Research suggests that hands-on 
learning fosters a learning environment where students maintain maximum retention 
(Schwichow et al., 2016).  This type of learning is effective in that it allows the learner to 
successfully master content by providing a learning opportunity of learning through doing and 
many times learning through repetition as well as trial and error.  Researchers have documented 
that hands-on learning is a very effective learning modality where students are more likely to 
master additional content due to the student being able to associate themselves with the learning 
activity (Alkan, 2016; Novack & Goldin-Meadow, 2015; Schwichow et al., 2016; Wiek, Xiong, 
Brundiers, & Van der Leeuw, 2014). 
The review of the literature revealed little research on the investigation of differences in 
attitudes among gender of individuals participating in robotics competitions.  It is clear that the 
47 

 

present research study should be conducted, due to the many studies that tend to research around 
the desired topic being presented. 
Summary 
There have been minimal research studies that investigated student attitudes, especially 
on the constructs of usefulness and enjoyment of robotics competitions between male and female 
students participating in robotics competitions.  The research study addressed the following 
theoretical constructs: expectancy-value theory, gender schema theory, and intersectionality 
theory.  The expectancy-value theory was addressed by investigating student enjoyment 
(intrinsic value) and usefulness (utility value) of robotics competitions as deemed by student 
participants.  The gender schema theory was examined by investigating societal sex-typing and 
inequality of gender prevalence within STEM careers.  The intersectionality theory was 
evaluated by investigating gender disparity within the STEM workforce and the need to further 
investigate the intersections of traditional family roles of men and women as related to the 
disparity.  This research also identified gaps in the literature, related to attitudes within STEM 
and issues related to gender.  This research study adds to the body of knowledge as it relates to 
the differences in attitudes towards robotics competitions between male and female students 
participating in a southeastern competition.  Although gender and attitudinal studies have been 
conducted on STEM aspects, few studies have focused on robotics specifically.  This study is 
valid and adds to the greater body of knowledge.

CHAPTER THREE: METHODS 
Overview 
This chapter discusses the research design of the study that investigated differences of 
attitudes of male and female students towards robotics competitions.  The researcher outlines the 
research question(s) and hypothesis(es) of the study.  Moreover, the researcher discusses a 
detailed perspective of the methodology in this research study, including participants and setting, 
instrumentation, procedures, and data analysis.   
Design 
This quantitative research study utilized a causal comparative research design to 
determine if there is a statistically significant difference in overall attitudes as measured through 
the lens of usefulness (utility value) and enjoyment (intrinsic value) between male and female 
students participating in robotics competitions.  The causal comparative research design was an 
appropriate design for this study, due to the independent variable being both categorical and non-
manipulated (Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2007).  The independent variable in this research study was 
gender, and this variable is categorical as it was comprised of male and female groups.  The 
dependent variable within this study is student attitude, measured by two sub-scales, usefulness 
(utility value) and enjoyment (intrinsic value).  According to Kind et al. (2007), student attitude 
can be defined as an individual’s emotional response or impression to an object or event, the 
degree to which the individual likes or dislikes the object or event.  Usefulness is described as 
the value of an individual’s experiences from completing a goal or task (Shumow & Schmidt, 
2014).  Enjoyment refers to individual worth received by the participation in an event (Wigfield 
& Eccles, 1992).

Research Question 
 RQ1: Is there a difference in overall attitudes towards robotics competitions between 
male and female students participating in a southeastern state robotics competition?  
Null Hypothesis 
H01: There is no significant difference in the overall attitudes towards robotics 
competitions, usefulness of robotics competitions, and enjoyment of robotics competitions 
between male and female students participating in a southeastern state robotics competition. 
Participants and Setting 
Population and Sample 
The population used in this research study consisted of public school student participants 
from official qualified school robotics teams, recognized by For Inspiration and Recognition of 
Science and Technology (FIRST), participating in a 2018 southeastern state robotics competition, 
sponsored by a private university.  There were 198 public-school students surveyed at the 
robotics competition.  Four student surveys were removed due to incomplete surveys and 
extreme scores.  As a result, a convenience sample of public school students (N = 194) in grades 
seven through 12 was utilized in this research study.  The sample was selected by the researcher 
from participants by which permissions were granted by either their division superintendents 
and/or team coaches, depending on their team type (i.e. public-school team or community team).  
Students that participated in the sample were on a volunteer basis.  The researcher provided an 
incentive for participating in the research study.  Each team had the opportunity to be entered in 
a raffle for a chance to win a $200.00 Visa gift card.  The raffle was completed near the end of 
the robotics competition, prior to closing ceremonies.  The adjusted study sample of public 
school students (N = 194) exceeded the minimum participants required for statistical analysis.  
50 

 

According to Warner (2013), a minimum of 108 participants, with a minimum of 54 participants 
in each group, is required for this study for a medium effect size with a statistical power of .7 at 
the .05 alpha level.  Table 1 provides the overall sample population demographics observed at 
the robotics competition.

Instrumentation 
The instrument used in the research study was the Student’s Attitude towards Robotics 
Competitions (SATRC) survey, a modified version of the Student’s Attitude towards Science 
Fairs Survey or SATSFS (Michael & Huddleston, 2014) customized for use at the southeastern 
state robotics competition (see Appendix A for survey instrument).  The researcher obtained 
permission to use and alter the survey instrument for use at the robotics competition from the 
survey developers.  The only alterations to the instrument itself were to replace the phrase 
“science fairs” from the original science fair survey to “robotics competitions” in the survey 
instrument that was used in this research study.  The researcher also altered the demographic 
information from the original survey to meet the information surveying requirements that is 
needed for this research study.  The SATRC instrument demographic section acquired student 
information regarding grade level, age, race/ethnicity, and a few questions regarding each 
participant’s robotics team make-up with regard to team size, gender statistics, requirements for 
robotics participation, and quantity of robotics competition participation.  The purpose of the 
original instrument was to measure student’s attitudes towards science fairs; this was 
55 

 

accomplished by combining two sub-scales, enjoyment (intrinsic value) and usefulness (utility 
value).   
The unpublished instrument was developed by Michael (2005) and was derived from the 
meta-analysis of literature produced by Osborne et al., (2003) that stemmed over a 20-year 
period.  The original instrument contained 45 questions and addressed nine domains 
(Huddleston, 2014; Westbury, 2016).  The nine domains that were addressed in the instrument 
were anxiety, value, efficacy, motivation, enjoyment, achievement, social influences-parents, 
social influences-teachers, and social influences-friends.  Huddleston (2014) conduced factor-
analysis on the original 45 question instrument inspired by Osborne et al. (2003) and derived the 
two present sub-scales used to measure student attitude, enjoyment, and usefulness.  The 45-
question instrument that was modified by Huddleston (2014) was based on a four-point Likert 
scale that ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The instrument was reduced to only 
10 questions that measured enjoyment and usefulness (Huddleston, 2014; Westbury, 2016).  The 
shorter version of the instrument, used by Westbury (2016), was based on a five-point Likert 
scale that ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree, but incorporated the neutral response.  
Responses were as follows:  strongly agree = 5, agree = 4, neutral = 3, disagree = 2, and strongly 
disagree = 1.  The instrument was reported by previous researchers to take approximately 10 
minutes to administer.  The instrument was used in two previous studies (Huddleston, 2014; 
Westbury, 2016).  The score on the instrument ranges from 10-50 points; a score of 10 represents 
low enjoyment and usefulness and a score of 50 represents maximum enjoyment and usefulness.  
The instrument is a valid and reliable instrument in measuring student attitudes based on 
enjoyment and usefulness.  The Cronbach’s alpha value was .94 among the combined sub-scales; 
both enjoyment and usefulness individually ranged from .89 to .90 (Huddleston, 2014; Westbury, 
56 

 

2016).  Permission to use the instrument was granted to the researcher (see Appendix B for 
permission to use a modified version of the Students Attitudes towards Science Fairs survey that 
can used at a robotics competition.) 
Procedures 
Permissions 
The researcher gained approval from FIRST Chesapeake to administer a survey called 
Student’s Attitude towards Robotics Competitions (SATRC) at a 2018 southeastern robotics 
competition (see Appendix F for permission from FIRST Chesapeake to administer the 
surveying instrument at the robotics competition).  Prior to data collection, the following 
approvals were pursued and obtained: Liberty University Institutional Review Board (IRB), 
necessary superintendents for public school teams, and/or robotics team head coaches whose 
teams identify themselves as neighborhood/community teams (i.e. not representing a public 
school).  See Appendix C for Liberty IRB approval, Appendix D and E for public school 
superintendents’ permission, and Appendix J and K for neighborhood/community team 
permission from coaches for those that participate in the robotics survey.  Once all approvals 
were granted from FIRST Chesapeake, Liberty University IRB, public school superintendents, 
and neighborhood/community teams, the researcher worked with the robotics competition 
organization by contacting the Director of Programs (DOP) of FIRST Chesapeake two weeks 
prior (middle of January 2018) to discuss details regarding administering the survey at the first 
robotics competition (see Appendix F for permission from FIRST Chesapeake).   
Pre-Competition Preparation 
The researcher copied paper-pencil surveys (500 copies), consent forms (500 copies), and 
coaches’ direction sheets (55 copies) prior to traveling to the robotics competition site.  Also, 55 
57 

 

bundles of pens were created containing 10 pens per bundle for average size robotics teams.  
There were also extra materials (i.e. paper-pencil surveys, consent forms, coaches’ direction 
sheets, and pens) brought for larger student teams and the possibly of misplaced items during the 
competition.  The researcher traveled to the location of the robotics competition one day prior to 
the competition to meet with the Director of Programs (DOP).  The researcher acquired the team 
participants’ lists from the DOP.  Robotics team packets were created for each participating 
robotics team by the researcher.  The packets contained the required components and materials to 
complete the paper-pencil survey for each team.  Head robotics coaches were asked by the 
researcher to administer the paper-pencil surveys to their team members after their teams first 
qualifying match during the competition.  The researcher provided the head coach of each 
participating team with a large 11x14 manila envelope with their team number written on the 
front of the envelope.  The researcher included in each packet the directions for the coach to 
administer the survey to their team members (see Appendix I for coaches’ directions), a letter to 
student participants explaining the research study (see Appendix G), an assent form (see 
Appendix H) for each team participant to read explaining survey information and procedures, a 
paper-pencil survey (see Appendix A) for each team member to complete, and the needed 
number of pens for each student to complete the survey.  The consent form was attached to the 
front of the paper-pencil survey with a paper clip.  The robotics team packets were sorted by 
competing divisions that correlated with the team participant’s lists (as acquired earlier by the 
DOP).   
Survey Administration at Robotics Competitions 
During the morning of the robotics competition, the researcher arrived at the competition 
location a few hours prior to the event start time to get organized for survey administration.  
58 

 

After opening ceremonies and when all robotics students had participated in at least one 
qualifying match, the researcher visited each team in their designated pit area during a time that 
did not conflict with their judging or match schedule times.  The researcher gave each robotics 
team head coach a robotics team packet with their team number on the front.  The head coaches 
were informed about the purpose for the study, the need for completed surveys at the robotics 
competition, an explanation of the steps for completing the survey (see Appendix I for coaches’ 
directions), the approximate time to take the survey, and an explanation of the contents in the 
robotics team packet.  The researcher also informed head coaches that upon completion of the 
surveys by team participants, participants could keep the pens provided by the researcher.  It was 
also explained that teams were eligible to enter a drawing for a chance to win a $200.00 Visa gift 
card after completing the survey.  The researcher explained to the coach that once they have 
administered the survey to their team, the researcher would revisit each team at their designated 
pit area within the next 35-40 minutes of the first visit to collect the completed surveys.  During 
that time, the researcher gave the coach one raffle ticket for each completed survey returned by 
their team members and asked them to print their team number on the back of each ticket.  The 
coach gave the tickets with team numbers to the researcher.  The researcher placed each ticket in 
a plastic bucket with a lid.  Once the surveys had been collected by the researcher and all raffle 
tickets had been placed in the bucket, the bucket was agitated to mix the tickets.  One ticket was 
drawn from the plastic bucket by the Director of Programs (DOP) and the winner of the gift card 
was announced at closing ceremonies.  Once all data was collected from the competition, all 
surveys were coded (i.e. each survey was assigned a number) and later entered into IBM SPSS 
for data analysis.  
59 

 

Data Analysis 
A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to determine if 
differences exist between male and female students’ attitudes toward robotics competitions.  A 
MANOVA was utilized for this research study because each participant “will have a score on 
two or more dependent variables” (Gall et al., 2007, p. 321).  Each research participant was 
scored on student attitudes (dependent variable) that was measured by the combination of two 
specific attitudinal components, enjoyment (intrinsic value) and usefulness (utility value) as 
measured on the Student’s Attitude towards Robotics Competitions (SATRC) instrument. 
There are several factors that must be considered when conducting a MANOVA.  First, 
the data was screened to assess for outliers and inconsistencies within the data by means of box 
and whisker plots.  The observations of all variables were independent of one another and 
random sampling was performed.  According to Warner (2013) and Green and Salkind (2011), 
there are several key assumptions in conducting a MANOVA.  Scatterplots were used to 
illustrate a normal multivariate distribution of the data.  The Kolmorgorov-Smirnov test was 
utilized to validate the assumption of normality; this test is selected for samples with greater than 
50 participants (Warner, 2013).  In order to test the assumption of homogeneity of variance-
covariance, the Levene’s test was utilized in this research study.  Lastly, the researcher analyzed 
the Pearson r to test for the assumption on multicollinearity as recommended by Warner (2013).  
Once all assumptions were met, the MANOVA was conducted.  All data was tested and 
considered significant at the 95% confidence level for all statistical tests. Results were reported 
using Wilks’s lambda (Green & Salkind, 2013), and effect size was measured using partial eta 
squared.

CHAPTER FOUR: FINDINGS 
Overview 
This chapter discusses the data findings from the study as revealed from the 
administration of the Student’s Attitude towards Robotics Competitions (SATRC) instrument at 
a southeastern state robotics competition.  The researcher reports and discusses all descriptive 
statistics for all variables in the research study (i.e. statistics from independent and dependent 
variables, population and sample statistics, etc.).  This chapter discusses statistical procedures 
used in the study and data screening methods and assumption tests results.  All inferential 
statistics are reported as related to the hypothesis for all variables (reporting alpha level and 
effect size), and the research study null hypothesis is evaluated.  
Research Question 
RQ1: Is there a difference in overall attitudes towards robotics competitions between 
male and female students participating in a southeastern state robotics competition? 
Null Hypothesis 
H01: There is no significant difference in the overall attitudes towards robotics 
competitions, usefulness of robotics competitions, and enjoyment of robotics competitions 
between male and female students participating in a southeastern state robotics competition. 
Descriptive Statistics 
A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to evaluate if 
differences exist between male and female students’ attitudes toward a southeastern robotics 
competition.  A causal comparative research design was utilized in this study to determine if 
there is a statistically significant difference in overall attitudes as measured through the lens of 
usefulness (utility value) and enjoyment (intrinsic value) between male and female students 
61


participating in robotics competitions.  A convenience sample of public school students (N = 
194) were selected at the robotics competition.  Each participant was administered the Student’s 
Attitude towards Robotics Competitions (SATRC) survey instrument.  Data collected for 
enjoyment, value (usefulness), and total (overall attitude) towards robotics can be found in Table 
4.

The enjoyment domain overall (M = 23.52, SD = 2.17) was marginally higher in females (M = 
23.59, SD = 2.03) than in males (M = 23.47, SD = 2.26).  The value (or usefulness) domain 
collectively (M = 21.48, SD = 3.12) was numerically identical among males (M = 21.48, SD = 
3.13) and females (M = 21.48, SD = 3.13).  The overall attitude among females (M = 45.07, SD = 
4.55) was higher than males (M = 44.95, SD = 4.77).  Descriptive statistics was also performed 
by comparing means of enjoyment, value (usefulness), and total (overall attitude) among grade 
levels and can be found in Table 5.

The value for enjoyment was found to be greatest among seventh grade (M = 24.07, SD = 2.46) 
students and lowest among 10th grade (M = 23.24, SD = 2.08) students.  The value domain was 
also found to be greatest among seventh grade (M = 23.07, SD = 1.73) students while the lowest 
was among ninth grade (M = 21.00, SD = 3.37) students.  Overall attitude was observed to be 
highest in seventh grade (M = 47.14, SD = 3.72) students while the lowest was found among 11th 
grade (M = 44.45, SD = 5.04) students.  Most student participants within this study were from 
ninth grade (n = 53), the second largest group from 11th grade (n = 42), and the third largest 
group from 10th grade (n = 41).  Data was also reported on enjoyment, value, and total (overall 
attitude) by race and can be found in Table 6.

The data documenting the total number of robotics competitions that students participated within 
the robotics season revealed the highest values for enjoyment (n = 1, M = 25.00, SD = 0.00) were 
students reported they participated in 18 competitions, the second highest for enjoyment (n = 60, 
M = 23.78, SD = 1.96) were students that reported they participated in two competitions, and 
third highest (n = 112, M = 23.50, SD = 2.19) were students that reported they participated in 
three competitions.  The highest value for usefulness (n = 1, M = 23.00, SD = 0.00) occurred 
with students that participated in 18 robotics competitions, the second highest for usefulness (n = 
66 

 

60, M = 21.78, SD = 3.12) was students that reported they participated in two competitions, and 
third highest (n = 112, M = 21.57, SD = 3.03) were students that reported they participated in 
three competitions.  Overall attitude was observed to be highest in students that participated in 18 
(n = 1, M = 48.00, SD = 0.00) robotics competitions, second highest were students that 
participated in two (n = 60, M = 45.57, SD = 4.61) robotics competitions, and the third highest 
were students that participated in three (n = 112, M = 45.07, SD = 4.60) robotics competitions.  
Overall, enjoyment and usefulness values tend to increase as students participate in more 
robotics competitions but tend to differentiate beyond students participating in more than two 
robotics competitions. 
Results 
Data Screening 
Data screening was conducted by the researcher on each dependent variable (i.e. 
enjoyment, usefulness, and overall total attitude) to assess for data discrepancies and extreme 
outliers.  There were four surveys removed from the total number of surveys collected due to 
student participants’ incomplete survey responses.  The sample used in this research study was 
194 public-school students.  Student #180 appeared to be an extreme score (z-score = -2.98).  
The raw score was converted to a standard z-score.  According to Warner (2013), this score fell 
between acceptable tolerances that were between -3.30 to +3.30 and was determined not to be an 
outlier.  Outliers were analyzed using box and whisker plots for each dependent variable (see 
Figures 1, 2, and 3).

Assumptions 
This research study utilized a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to 
determine if differences exist between male and female students’ attitudes toward robotics 
competitions.  Scatterplots were used to illustrate a normal multivariate distribution of the data 
(see Figures 4, 5, and 6 for scatterplots of enjoyment, value, and total attitude).

All scatterplots for enjoyment, value, and total attitude showed a normal distribution; thus, the 
assumption for normal multivariate distribution was tenable.  The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was 
used to evaluate the assumption of normality (see Table 8 for the Test of Normality).

The assumption of normality was not tenable among male and female sub-levels for the 
enjoyment, value, and total group (p < .001 for all groups and subgroups).  However, Warner 
(2013) stated that an ANOVA is considered robust enough to withstand a violation of the 
normality assumption.  The assumption of homogeneity of variance was tested by analyzing the 
Levene’s test (see Table 9).

The assumption for homogeneity of variance was tenable for enjoyment (p = .339), value 
(p = .935), and total (p = .381).  The researcher also analyzed the Pearson r value to test for the 
assumption on multicollinearity.  See Table 10 for Pearson r value analysis.

The value for enjoyment and total revealed a large level of collinearity (r = .830).  It was also 
observed that the value for value and total revealed a large level of collinearity (r = .921).  These 
data findings were consistent due to the value for total (attitude) being derived from adding the 
enjoyment and value (usefulness) subscales together to get a total value for attitude.  It was also 
found that collinearity (r = .547) existed between enjoyment and value.  Thus, the assumption of 
multicollinearity was maintained.

Null Hypothesis 
This research study utilized a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to 
determine if differences exist between male and female public-school students’ attitudes towards 
robotics competitions.  The MANOVA yielded that there are no significant differences found at 
the 95% confidence level among the gender of students and their enjoyment, value (usefulness), 
and total (overall attitude) values, Wilks’s Λ = 1.00, F(2, 191) = 0.10, p > .05, partial η2 = 0.001.  
The effect size was small.  Thus, the researcher failed to reject the null hypothesis signifying 
there was no significant difference in the overall attitudes towards robotics competitions, 
usefulness of robotics competitions, and enjoyment of robotics competitions between male and 
female students participating in a southeastern state robotics competition.  Because the null 
hypothesis was not rejected, no post hoc analysis was required.

CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSIONS 
Overview 
This chapter discusses the results obtained from the present research study by re-
examining the purpose statement and outlining a brief synopsis of the entire study to this point.  
The findings of this study are compared to results obtained by other researchers that conducted 
similar research investigations.  Implications that resulted from the completion of this research 
study are thoughtfully reviewed.  The researcher identifies limiting factors as it pertains to this 
quantitative investigation and discusses recommendations for future research based on the study 
findings.   
Discussion 
The purpose of this quantitative research study was to determine if there was a 
statistically significant difference in the overall attitudes, as measured through the sub-scales of 
usefulness (utility value) and enjoyment (intrinsic value), between male and female public-
school students participating in a southeastern state robotics competition.  The population 
investigated was public school students from grades seven through 12 that participated in a 
southeastern state robotics competition.  The data was collected during the spring semester of the 
2017-2018 school year in February.  The appropriate permissions, consents, and approvals were 
acquired prior to survey administration.   
The researcher administered the Student’s Attitude towards Robotics Competitions 
(SATRC) survey at a southeastern state robotics competition.  During the robotics competition, 
there were 198 student surveys collected from public school students; four surveys were 
discarded, resulting in a sample population of 194 public school students.  Among the sample 
population, there were one-hundred and 25 males and 69 females.  All data collected at the 
77 

 

robotics competition was coded and prepared for data analysis.  The researcher conducted a one-
way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to investigate if disparities exist between 
male and female public-school students’ attitudes towards robotics competitions.  Data was 
screened for outliers and data discrepancies (as mentioned earlier), and all assumptions for 
MANOVA were tenable.  The independent variable was biological sex (i.e. male and female) 
and the dependent variables were overall attitudes (i.e. total), usefulness (utility value), and 
enjoyment (intrinsic value).  The research question postulated was, “is there a difference in 
overall attitudes towards robotics competitions, between male and female students participating 
in a southeastern state robotics competition?”  The results of the MANOVA validated that there 
was no significant difference among the means between the independent and dependent 
variables.  Thus, the researcher failed to reject the null hypothesis in this quantitative research 
study and, therefore, confirmed there is no statistical difference between the overall attitudes of 
public school students (as measured by usefulness and enjoyment) between males and females at 
a southeastern robotics competition. 
The results of this research study as compared to similar studies seeking to investigate 
student attitudes towards STEM related competitions, such as the studies conducted by 
Huddleston (2014) and Westbury (2016), have similarities and differences.  Huddleston’s (2014) 
results are found to be in stark contrast when compared to the results of the present study.  For 
example, Huddleston’s (2014) study focused on ascertaining student attitudes at science fairs by 
refining and administering the Student’s Attitude towards Science Fairs Survey (SATSFS) to 
seventh and eighth grade middle school students (N = 110) from the inner city.  Huddleston 
(2014) concluded in her study that “a significant difference between males (M = 23.0, SD = 7.06) 
and females (M = 26.2, SD = 7.38) was found: t(98) = 2.04, p = .04” and specifically she stated 
78 

 

that “overall, females had a more positive attitude towards science fairs than males” (p. 63).  
This is totally opposite to the results of the present study that found there to be no significant 
differences in the overall attitudes between male and female public-school students towards 
robotics competitions (i.e. a type of STEM competition like science fairs) as measured by 
usefulness and enjoyment.  However, when compared means of enjoyment, usefulness, and 
overall attitude were analyzed in present study, the enjoyment and total (overall attitude) values 
revealed similarity to Huddleston’s (2014) study.  In fact, the present study revealed that females 
had slightly higher enjoyment and overall attitude values towards robotics competitions (i.e. a 
type of STEM competition comparative to science fairs) as compared to males.  This finding did 
correlate with Huddleston’s (2014) statement that “females had a more positive attitude towards 
science fairs than males” (p. 63). 
Another study that investigated science fairs (or type of STEM competition) was 
conducted by Westbury (2016).  When compared to the Westbury (2016) study, the present study 
investigating student’s attitudes towards robotics competitions revealed several direct parallels to 
the findings revealed by Westbury (2016).  The present study was a replication study of 
Westbury’s (2016) study but chose a different student population and type of competitive STEM 
competition.  Westbury’s (2016) research study focused on the attitudes of male and female 
Christian private school students (N = 146) in grades five through eight towards science fairs 
while the present study concentrated on student attitudes of public school students (between 
males and females) towards robotics competitions in grades seven through 12.   
In analyzing the compared means of the dependent variables (i.e. enjoyment, usefulness, 
and overall attitude) between the present study and Westbury’s (2016) study, both studies 
compared mean values show agreement regarding female values for enjoyment and overall 
79 

 

attitude.  This present study paralleled Westbury’s (2016) findings that female participants’ 
enjoyment and overall attitude mean values appear to be higher than males.  However, the mean 
values between males and females for usefulness did not agree among the two studies.  For 
example, Westbury (2016, p. 66-67) discovered the usefulness mean value to be lower in females 
(M = 14.73, SD = 4.60) than males (M = 15.04, SD = 5.40) opposed to the present study results 
that revealed the mean values for usefulness to be identical between females and males (M = 
21.48, SD = 3.13).  Although the present study and Westbury’s (2016) study analyzed different 
grade level intervals, a common parallel was identified.  In both studies, the means for enjoyment 
and overall attitude are higher in students from lower grade levels.  As mentioned earlier, 
Westbury (2016) investigated students in grades five through eight while the present study 
focused on students in grades seven through 12.  Enjoyment and overall attitude mean values 
were observed to be highest in fifth grade students in Westbury’s (2016, p. 67) study while they 
were revealed to be the highest in seventh grade students in the present study.  Thus, the highest 
mean values were observed in students from the lowest grade levels studied in each research 
study.  Lastly, when comparing the null hypotheses from both research studies, the null 
hypothesis failed to be rejected in both the present study and Westbury’s (2016) study.  
According to Westbury’s (2016), the MANOVA test results for her research study were “not 
significant at an alpha level of .05, where F(2, 143) = 2.52, p = .08, partial ƞ2 = 0.034” (p. 81).  
The present studies MANOVA statistical test results were Wilks’s Λ = 1.00, F(2, 191) = 0.10, p 
> .05, partial η2 = 0.001.  Both studies agreed that there were no significant differences in the 
overall attitudes towards the STEM competition (being investigated in each study as mentioned 
previously) as measured by usefulness and enjoyment values between male and female students 
participating in a specific type of STEM competition. 
80 

 

Another notable parallel that this research study established is related to the 
proportionality between enjoyment and the usefulness of a task.  This study reaffirmed and 
supported the ideology supported by Tyler-Wood et al. (2012) that when an individual finds 
enjoyment within a task or event, an overall positive attitude is fostered by that individual.  For 
example, as mentioned earlier, when comparing mean values of enjoyment and overall attitude, 
individuals with higher enjoyment scores also had higher overall positive attitudes regarding the 
event or task that they participated; in this study it was the female group.  Similarly, the data in 
this present study also supported the perspectives of Ali et al. (2013) by the general premise that 
individuals who find something useful tend to manifest more positive attitudes. 
The data in this study also supported the literature (Beede et al., 2011; Bergeron & 
Gordon, 2017; Gayles & Ampaw, 2014; Heilbronner, 2013; Landivar, 2013a, 2013b; MacPhee et 
al., 2013; National Science Foundation, 2017; Simon et al., 2017; Yonghong, 2015) of the 
known gender disparity still apparent in STEM.  For example, the convenience sample (N = 194) 
noted in this study demonstrated that disparity due to the proportion of males (n = 125) to 
females (n = 69) resulting in an approximate 2:1 disproportionality that directly supported 
Landivar’s (2013a) report on gender trend statistical information within STEM.  Also, this 
current study supported the ideology of Archer et al. (2013) that established the viewpoint that 
males tend to be more attracted to fields within science than do females.  
Implications 
Investigating the attitudes of students towards science and engineering competitions 
(such as robotics competitions) is crucial to research so future needs can be met within STEM.  
The competitions ignite positive attitudes within individuals towards the STEM workforce (Ali 
et al., 2013; Alsup, 2015; Najafti et al., 2012).  These research investigations, like the current 
81 

 

study, helped identify areas of improvement at these competitions.  Once these areas of 
improvement are identified and addressed, this will result in attracting more skilled men and 
women to the STEM field and facilitate optimized recruiting to fulfill future employment needs 
in the STEM workforce. 
Very little research has been conducted within the area of assessing attitudes of students 
towards science competitions.  This research study was developed and ultimately is an extension 
of former studies conducted by Huddleston (2014) and Westbury (2016) investigating the 
attitudes of male and female students (of different school types) towards science fairs.  This 
study aspired to replicate Westbury’s (2016) study but expand the study to a different type of 
STEM competition (i.e. from science fair to robotics competition) and different student 
population (i.e. from Christian private school students to public school students).  It is important 
to gain student attitude perspectives at diverse types of science and engineering competitions so 
untapped potential can be discovered among skilled men and women from various academic 
backgrounds.  As a result, this research study positively added to the limited body of knowledge 
addressing student attitudes towards STEM competitions.   
Limitations 
This research study only focused on public school students from one southeastern state 
robotics competition and one specific type of robotics competition that is recognized by For 
Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST).  Thus, the results of this 
research study can only be relative to the specific population being studied.  These results cannot 
be used as universal statistics to explain results of other states or student attitudes towards other 
types of robotics and/or science and engineering competitions.  Among the different 
demographic variables collected, there were not uniform participation observed among gender in 
82 

 

the convenience sample (N = 194).  As mentioned previously, the sample population consisted of 
125 male and 69 female public-school students, which is approximately a 2:1 ratio of males to 
females.  This statistic directly correlates with the information in an American Community 
Survey Report produced by Landivar (2013a).  Thus, this research study should not be overly 
generalized regarding female attitudes towards STEM due to their underrepresentation in this 
study.  Another limitation of this research study resides around ethnicity.  Data collected on 
ethnicity resulted in half the sample population at the robotics competition identifying 
themselves as being Asian with approximately the other half being White.  As a result, the lack 
of representation among other ethnicities such as African Americans and Hispanics in this study 
must be considered when making inferences regarding students’ attitudes towards robotics 
competitions as compared across all ethnicities.  
Recommendations for Future Research 
It is highly imperative that future studies encompassing this research topic be conducted 
to further gain much needed insight regarding attitudes of future STEM laborers towards science 
and engineering competitions pertaining to robotics.  There are so few research studies exploring 
differences among student attitudes towards STEM, resulting in the need for more studies to be 
conducted.  One area of future research needs to further investigate the continued reasons for 
gender disparity still present within the STEM workforce.  In analyzing the plethora of literature, 
many scholars postulate as to the reasons for the apparent gender disparity.  However, further 
research needs to focus on why females are still underrepresented in these scientific competitions 
such as robotics competitions and in the workforce.  More studies should be investigated that 
focus on the female gender that assess reasons for disparity.   
83 

 

A second area of future study should focus on the relationship between parental 
occupation influence and their children’s desired future occupation.  For example, another 
question item should be added to the demographic section of the survey instrument used in this 
research study that asks the student participant if their parents are currently or have been 
employed in a STEM-related occupation.  Thus, student responses can be compared to their 
current attitudes towards the STEM field as an influencing factor for their future career selection.   
Thirdly, there should be more research studies conducted ascertaining public-school 
students’ attitudes towards other types and/or levels of robotics competitions such as FIRST, 
Eurobot, RoboRave, and BEST Robotics.  More research is greatly needed not only at the 
primary, middle, and secondary education levels (i.e. among both public and private school 
models), but also student attitudes towards these robotics competitions should also be assessed at 
the post-secondary level.  Investigation at this educational level will allow researchers to analyze 
and postulate potential future trends in the STEM workforce. 
Another area that could also be explored for future research is the variable of ethnicity.  
Whites were predominantly represented in the former research studies conducted by Huddleston 
(2014) and Westbury (2016).  This research study found most of the sample population to be 
Asian (50.0%) and the next highest percentage to be White (43.3%), while African Americans 
and Hispanics were minimally represented.  This is consistent with the statistical information 
compiled by Landivar (2013a) that emphasized that “Blacks and Hispanics have been 
consistently underrepresented in STEM employment” (p. 2).  Follow-up interviews in future 
research studies are greatly recommended for students from minorities to ascertain what 
factors/aspects primarily attract them to participate in these science and engineering 
84 

 

competitions.  Future studies focusing on the disparity of these ethnic backgrounds and their 
attitudes towards participating in these types of scientific competitions is greatly warranted.

Lynchburg, Virginia 24515 
 
Dear Dr. Michael: 
 
As a graduate student in the School of Education at Liberty University, I am conducting research 
as part of the requirements for a doctorate degree. The title of my research project is 
“Differences in Attitudes towards Robotics Competitions of Male and Female Students 
participating in the Virginia FIRST Tech Challenge State Robotics Competition” and the purpose 
of my research is to investigate if there will be a difference in attitudes between male and female 
students participating in the Virginia FIRST Tech Challenge State Robotics Competition. 
 
I am writing to request your permission to use and modify your instrument entitled Student’s 
Attitude towards Science Fairs Survey (SATSFS) so it can be used to assess student attitudes at a 
robotics competition.  I would be conducting my study during the 2017-2018 school year, spring 
semester.   
 
I plan to administer a survey, entitled “Student Robotics Competition Attitude Survey”, to 
students from school divisions that participate in the 2018 Virginia FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) 
State Championship, sponsored by ECPI University, on February 24, 2018 in Richmond, 
Virginia. 
 
Participants will be asked to complete the survey at a robotics competition.  Thank you for 
considering my request. If you choose to grant permission, please provide a signed statement 
indicating your approval or you can respond by email to jneece@liberty.edu. 
 
Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Michael: 
 
As a graduate student in the School of Education at Liberty University, I conducted research as 
part of the requirements for a doctorate degree. The title of my research project is “Attitudinal 
Differences towards Robotics Competitions of Male and Female Students Participating in a 
Southeastern State Robotics Competition” and the purpose of my study was to investigate if 
there was a difference in attitudes between male and female students participating in a 
southeastern state robotics competition. 
 
I am writing to request your permission to reproduce and publish the survey in my dissertation 
(see Appendix A) that was used in this research study entitled Student Robotics Competition 
Attitude Survey. 
 
Thank you for considering my request. If you choose to grant permission, please provide a

However, when analyzing gender, there are great disparities among gender in STEM.  Statistics indicate females are vastly underrepresented and males are employed double the rate of females.  Leading STEM companies are creatively trying to attract future STEM laborers by means of science and engineering competitions.  The purpose of this quantitative causal comparative study was to investigate if there are differences in attitudes between male and female students participating in a robotics competition.  A convenience sample of public school students (N = 194) from grades 7-12 that participated in a southeastern state robotics competition were used in this study.  The sample consisted of 69 females and 125 males.  The researcher administered a modified version of the Student’s Attitude toward Science Fairs Survey customized for use at a robotics competition.  The instrument measured students’ overall attitudes toward science and engineering competitions and further explored two constructs: usefulness (utility value) and enjoyment (intrinsic value) of the competition.  A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to determine if differences existed between male and female students’ attitudes towards science and engineering competitions and results were disclosed.  The MANOVA results determined that there are no significant differences found among male and female students and their enjoyment, value (usefulness), and total (overall attitude) values towards a robotics competition, Wilks’s Λ = 1.00, F(2, 191) = 0.10, p \u3e .05, partial η2 = 0.001.  Thus, the researcher failed to reject the null hypothesis.  Implications of this investigation and future recommendations for future studies were discussed","['text', 'Attitude', 'Enjoyment', 'Gender', 'Robotics Competitions', 'Usefulness', 'Curriculum and Social Inquiry', 'Education', 'Educational Psychology', 'Other Education']",disabled
