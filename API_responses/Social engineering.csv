Abstract 
The purpose of the current study is to examine the complexities that female engineers 
experience in a male dominated industry. These complexities are compounded further when 
the element of race is intertwined with their gender. A review of the current literature notes the 
influence that gendered constructions have on society and therefore, perpetuates into the 
choices that men and women have based on their gender, especially in terms of appropriate 
career choices. The research focuses on social constructionism and intersectionality as a 
theoretical framework. As the study aims to understand the experiences of the female engineers 
and how their race intersects with their gender, a qualitative analysis was conducted, as it was 
the most appropriate for the study. Hence, semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine 
employed female engineers from various companies and engineering sectors. The semi-
structured interviews took place from May 2017 to June 2017. A thematic analysis was 
conducted on the interviews, which formed three focal themes, viz. Negotiating Multiple 
Identities; The Two Extremes and Proving Yourself.  
The nature of the identities in which the participants narrate can be seen as an act of intersection 
of the various identities, which the participants acknowledged in their narratives. The various 
identities are viewed as manifestations that form from the social interactions in which the 
participants immerse themselves in. In addition, the women would note ‘subtle issues’ that 
would arise in the engineering workplace, which differentiated the women from the men, 
however, would not acknowledge the severity of the inequality that perpetuated from the 
differentiation. However, many of the women would acknowledge the positive experiences 
they have had as a female engineer and were therefore treated as an engineer and not a female 
engineer.

Chapter One 
Introduction 
“Like not having children, choosing to be an engineer demands an explanation, if you are a 
woman. The reactions of outsiders are a constant reminder that being a woman engineer 
marks them out as unusual; it begs a remark.” 
(Faulkner, 2009, p. 173). 
Since the dawn of democracy, the South African government has implemented various policies, 
labour laws and legislations to empower women in organizations (Constitution of Republic of 
South Africa, 1996). Additionally, the South African government has stipulated in the National 
Development Plan of 2030 that South Africa aims to reduce gender inequality (National 
Planning Commission, 2012). However, despite the efforts made by the South African 
government, gender disparity is still evident in various industries, such as the engineering 
sector (ECSA, 2016). Based on the engineering registration statistics reported by the 
Engineering Council of South Africa (2016), men continue to outnumber women in all 
registration categories (professional and candidate Engineers). Similarly, racial disparity is also 
evident in the engineering registration statistics. Female candidate engineers are characterised 
by the following racial groups: Black African (41%); White (37%); Asian (18%) and Coloured 
(3%), however, Professional female engineers followed a differed order: White (58%); Black 
African (23%); Asian (17%) and Coloured (2%) (ECSA, 2017). These statistics demonstrate 
the prevalence of male domination in the engineering profession in contemporary society 
(Faulkner, 2009b).  
2 
 
Furthermore, a dearth of literature is found on female engineers in South Africa, as most studies 
conducted on engineering students and professionals have been conducted internationally 
(Ayre, Mills, & Gill, 2013; Bastalich, Franzway, Gill, Mills, & Sharp, 2007; Buse et al., 2013; 
Holth, 2014; Pardo, Calvet, Pons & Martinez, 2016). Eurocentric studies cannot attempt to 
understand the dynamics of all female engineers. Therefore, this study intends to highlight the 
lived experiences of female engineers of all racial groups and the impediments they may face 
in a male-dominated and racially dispersed industry. It will do this in the context of South 
Africa, which has often been overlooked in the literature.  
In order to operationalise the National Development Plan of 2030 (National Planning 
Commission, 2012), empirical research is necessary to understand the prevailing issues that 
perpetuate gender inequality in various occupations. In this study, the experiences of female 
engineers are explored to uncover the narratives, discourses and lived experiences of female 
engineers and the manner in which they achieve professional growth in an industry that 
perpetuates gender inequality. It is fundamental that women of all races and engineering 
disciplines are studied to unravel the reasons why women are in the minority in the field of 
engineering. With that being noted, this study will contribute to the body of knowledge that 
attempts to address gender inequality in a male-dominated profession, such as engineering. 
Therefore, the focus of this study is to unpack the discourses and narratives of women engineers 
in order to understand their experiences in a male-dominated and racially dispersed field.  
1.1 Historical Context 
South Africa’s history is characterised by inequality and injustice as a result of the Apartheid 
era. In order to overcome the painful history of discrimination and segregation, South Africa 
has introduced various legislations (e.g. Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act; 
3 
 
Employment Equity Act; Labour Relations Act) to reduce inequalities amongst South Africans, 
in terms of racial and gender inequality (Constitution of Republic of South Africa, 1996). 
However, despite the efforts made to introduce legislations and policies, the effects of these 
inequalities and injustices that were experienced in the Apartheid era are still evident in current 
society, due to the discriminatory practices that took place during the Apartheid era  (Buthelezi, 
Alexander, & Seabi, 2009; Digby, 2013; Fiske & Ladd, 2004; Hills, 2015; Reddy, 1994; 
Thobejane, 2013). These inequalities are perpetuated in the career choices that are available to 
South Africans in a post-Apartheid society, as the inequalities of the past have limited the career 
choices available to black and female South Africans, resulting in a lack of progression in the 
workforce (Buthelezi, et al., 2009; Lewis-Enright, Crafford, & Crous, 2009; Reddy, 1994). 
Dass-Brailsford (2005) asserts that the previously disadvantaged racial groups are still affected 
by socioeconomic challenges. Consequently, the youth’s self-efficacy is negatively impacted, 
hence, hampering their career choices and development. It is therefore crucial that the historical 
context of South African is reflected upon, as these inequalities are perpetuated into the post-
Apartheid society.  
A crucial component of Apartheid was the Bantu Education Act of 1953, which aimed to 
dehumanise and hinder the education for Black African and other marginalised racial groups, 
as well as the female gender in South Africa (Thobejane, 2013; Mhlauli, Salani, & Mokotedi, 
2015; Zungu, 1997). This was done to continue the legacy of white supremacy and domination 
(Thobejane, 2013; Mhlauli, Salani, & Mokotedi, 2015). Black Africans received poor quality 
education in order to impair them from entering the modern sector, guaranteeing a consistent 
supply of cheap labour, especially in the mining, agricultural and domestic service sectors 
(Fiske, & Ladd, 2004; Thobejane, 2013). The poor quality of education for Black Africans was 
a result of the National Government under-spending on Black students in urban townships. 
Moreover, the purpose of these policies was to perpetuate white supremacy by affording white 
4 
 
South Africans higher quality education than the other racial groups (Fiske, & Ladd, 2004; 
Buthelezi et al., 2009; Bonner, & Sengal, 1998; Thobejane, 2013).  
Higher level science and maths, as well as advanced technical and vocational subjects were 
only made available to white South Africans, hence, disadvantaging other racial groups in the 
career choices available to them (Fiske & Ladd, 2004). Additionally, black Africans received 
minimal training in science and maths and more training in the social sciences (Fiske & Ladd, 
2004; Reddy, 1994; Thobejane, 2013). This facilitated a cycle of uneducated Black Africans. 
White South Africans were granted the opportunity to have access to universities of a good 
quality, whereas, black South Africans were transferred to institutions with inferior instructors, 
facilities and courses (Thobejane, 2013; Mhlauli, Salani, & Mokotedi, 2015). Black Africans 
were underrepresented in universities and were disproportionately enrolled in Technikons 
(Fiske, & Ladd, 2004). Segregation within universities was also experienced as the universities 
made available to Africans were primarily located in rural locations (Fiske & Ladd, 2004; 
Thobejane, 2013). This demonstrates the low-quality mathematics and science education in the 
Apartheid era and the labour policies which encouraged Black Africans to semiskilled or 
unskilled jobs, resulting in a lack of career opportunities available in the science, technology 
and engineering industries (Fiske & Ladd, 2004; Mhlauli, Salani, & Mokotedi, 2015; Mujal-
Leon, 1988;  Thobejane, 2013).  
Furthermore, a lack of interest in scientific training may also stem from the lack of employment 
opportunities for Black Africans (Fiske, & Ladd, 2004; UNESCO, 1967). Additionally, very 
little training took place in agriculture or engineering, despite the greatest need for African 
engineers (UNESCO, 1967). It was also challenging for Black Africans to pursue engineering 
careers due to the lack of courses available at African colleges and the impediments faced when 
attempting to study full-time at a University (Mhlauli, Salani, & Mokotedi, 2015; UNESCO, 
5 
 
1967), in addition, science faculty admissions at university were limited to Africans. White 
collar, skilled, technical, professional and administrative jobs were reserved for Whites, 
whereas the unskilled, menial jobs were occupied by Black Africans (Buthelezi et al., 2009; 
Gerber & Newman, 1980; UNESCO, 1967).  
These Apartheid policies may have affected the career choices available to marginalised racial 
groups, as well as the female gender. Additionally, women experienced double marginalisation 
pertaining to their race and gender. Women were forced to be dependent on men, as well as are 
given jobs that are of an inferior status, whereas men are afforded the superior occupations, 
which includes managerial roles. Therefore, income and employment disparity continues to be 
prevalent in society (Hills, 2015). Additionally, due to the low quality of mathematics and 
science education in the Apartheid era, many Africans may not have had the opportunities to 
pursue engineering as a career. As many Africans received education in the social sciences and 
humanities sector, as opposed to the science and mathematical training, this may result in the 
underrepresentation of female engineers in current society (Buthelezi et al., 2009; Fiske & 
Ladd, 2004; Mhlauli, Salani, & Mokotedi, 2015; Thobejane, 2013; UNESCO, 1967). 
Furthermore, these effects are evident in contemporary South Africa, as rural young females 
continue to face impediments in obtaining an education in the post-Apartheid era. These 
impediments include the poorly resourced schools; the responsibility of domestic duties; the 
long distances to reach schools and the drop-out rates to head households in cases where family 
members are orphaned due to HIV-AIDS (Hills, 2015). 
Despite the continuation of the inequalities in the post-Apartheid South Africa, there have been 
improvements since the dawn of democracy in South Africa which allows for previously 
disadvantaged groups, including women access to education and consequently, workplace 
opportunities. These legislations and policies include the Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998; 
6 
 
The Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995; The Broad-Based Black Economic Empower Act 53 of 
2003; The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 and the Preferential 
Procurement Framework Act 5 of 2000.  
The Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 was introduced to promote the constitutional right of 
equality and to exercise democracy; to eliminate unfair discrimination in employment; to 
redress the effects of discrimination; to achieve a diverse workforce and to promote economic 
employment (Employment Equity Act, 1998). The Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 aims to 
reduce discrimination in the workplace as well as address past inequalities (Labour Relations 
Act, 1995). The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (B-BBEE Act 53, 2003) has 
created more opportunities for the previously disadvantaged, including women. The 
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996 also upholds the equality of citizens in 
South Africa, as per sections 9 (1 – 5), which emphasises the equality of South African’s and 
that an individual may not be discriminated directly or indirectly against due to their race, sex, 
gender, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, 
religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth. 
These legislations have been introduced in order to achieve equality both in and out of the 
workplace. Furthermore, South Africa’s National Development plan of 2030 aims to reduce 
inequality by the year 2030 (National Planning Commission, 2012). However, as noted various 
professions such as engineering are still represented in a manner that illustrates gender 
inequality, as demonstrated in the statistics of female engineers in South Africa. As the 
National Development Plan of 2030 is to increase diversity and empower women, this study 
will add to the body of knowledge that attempts to redress gender inequality in the engineering 
field.

1.2 Gendered Constructions of Women in Non-Traditional Occupations 
Gottfredson (1981; 1996) states that at an early stage of an individual’s life one begins to 
associate occupations with gender and therefore when an individual chooses a career, the 
congruency between the occupations and one’s gender is a crucial deciding factor (Adachi, 
2013). Therefore this limits many young adults in terms of the career choices available, due to 
the emphasis on occupations which are gender specific (Adachi, 2013; Glick, Wilk, & 
Perreault, 1995. Images of occupations are often associated with gender and therefore create a 
sex segregation in occupations. Prestigious occupations and high wages are often associated 
with masculinity. Similarly, female-dominated occupations require ‘feminine’ characteristics 
and male-dominated occupations require ‘masculine’ characteristics (Cejka & Eagly, 2015). 
Therefore, women who pursue male-dominated occupations are required to behave in a manner 
which may be considered unnatural to them as women, resulting in the women adopting 
aggressive and competitive characteristics in order to succeed in the workplace (Martin & 
Barnard, 2013). 
As a result, very few women enter male dominated occupations, as a woman is not expected to 
partake in a male dominated occupation, much less excel in a man’s job (Lemkau, 1979). 
Therefore, women entering what is known to be a masculine occupation is deemed as deviant 
to the norm (Long, 1989). In this way, a gendered organisation or occupation is formed. Acker 
(1990, p. 146) conceptualises gendered organizations by stating that, “advantage and 
disadvantage, exploitation and control, action and emotion, meaning and identity are patterned 
through and in terms of a distinction between male and female, masculine and feminine.” 
Therefore, by stating that an organization is gendered implies that the organization is 
perpetuating gender differences, by defining and structuring the organizations in such a manner 
that it forms a distinction between masculinity and femininity (Male, Bush, & Murray, 2009).  
8 
 
Females entering male dominated occupations experience challenges which manifest from the 
traditional gender hierarchies and norms which are evident in society. These stereotypical role 
expectations are leaked into organizational policies in order to maintain women’s stereotypical 
roles in society. These norms are also engrained in the organizational culture, preserving gender 
discrimination in organizations (Bobbitt-Zeher, 2011; Cha, 2013; Davey, 2008; Martin & 
Barnard, 2013; Prescott & Bogg, 2011). Additionally, there have been minimal changes in male 
dominated occupations to accommodate females as the masculine culture is still evident. Power 
dynamics are also evident in organizations as men possess more resources and power to 
maintain the discriminatory policies, practices and ideologies in an organization to perpetuate 
the distinction between genders (Damaske, 2011; Martin & Barnard, 2013; Mathur-Helm, 
2006). 
Despite the underrepresentation of females in a male dominated field, females that pursue 
occupations which are male dominated are likely to leave the field, as females tend to return to 
occupations that allow them to fulfil their primary caregiver role, due to the association of the 
caregiver role and the mother (Ashraf, 2007; Cha, 2013; Danziger & Eden, 2007; Frome, 
Alfeld, Eccles, & Barber, 2006; Martin & Barnard, 2013). As a result of women leaving 
organizations, the ‘leaky pipeline’ is created (Frome, Alfeld, Eccles, & Barber, 2006; Oakes, 
1990). Therefore, many women enter traditionally female dominated occupations in order to 
fulfil their family and work responsibilities simultaneously as opposed to entering a male 
dominated occupation, which requires a primary focus of work responsibilities (Frome et al., 
2006). 
It is, therefore, crucial to question the manner in which these occupations have been constructed 
and maintained over time. Based on these gendered occupations, it is imperative to ask: What 
are the consequences for women occupying a stereotypically ‘masculine’ occupation, such as 
9 
 
engineering? What are the implications for women of varied races entering a profession which 
perpetuates gender inequality? Various theoretical viewpoints are available in order to 
investigate these concerns. The two theoretical viewpoints adopted in this study are Social 
Constructionism and Intersectionality to understand these dynamics.    
Social Constructionism places emphasis on the way people describe, explain and perceive 
reality (Burr, 1995; Gergen, 1985). This is usually done through the language in which one 
uses, hence, language has a performative role when constructing reality (Burr & Dick, 2017; 
Gergen & Thatchenkery, 1996). Reality is circumstantial and is perceived differently based on 
the circumstances and the context, therefore it rejects the notion of objectivity (Burr & Dick, 
2017). Emphasis is placed on the discourse in order to understand reality, however, discourse 
lies in productive power and can influence the manner in which an individual acts (Knights & 
Morgan, 1991; Speer, 2005). Therefore, those in power are able to set the norms and have 
authority over others (Burr & Dick, 2017). Foucault (1977) argues that these constructions are 
a function of power relations within society. Hence, those that are able to dominate other groups 
are part of the dominant group, as power is able to be transferred through them (Hoy, 1986). 
Furthermore, Foucault (1980) also postulates that power and resistance are inseparable, 
therefore, power cannot operate without resistance. The current study will examine the power 
dynamics which avail themselves in the female engineer’s accounts of working in a 
stereotypically ‘masculine’ environment. Consequently, the implications of the female 
engineer’s sense of identity will also be investigated, by allowing the female engineers the 
opportunity to narrate their lived experiences to describe their reality as a female in a 
masculinized profession.  
Intersectionality highlights the emphasis of individuals comprising of multiple identities. These 
identities operate simultaneously, resulting in differed forms of marginalisation. 
10 
 
Intersectionality rejects the notion that individuals’ identities operate on a single-axis 
framework, but rather postulates that individuals comprise of various identities resulting in 
oppression and marginalisation (Crenshaw, 1993). These identities include but are not limited 
to race; gender; age and sexual orientation. Intersectionality aims to understand how oppression 
is experienced in individuals based on these multiple identities operating simultaneously (ibid, 
1993). Intersectionality is crucial in the “study of inequality, identity and power relations” 
(Cho, Crenshaw & McCall, cited in Rodriguez et al., 2016). Intersectionality allows for the 
various characteristics which constitute one’s identity to be explored simultaneously. 
Therefore, the female engineers race and gender will be explored simultaneously to understand 
how these characteristics operate to shape the lived experiences.  
The fundamental question in this study is how female engineers of varied races narrate their 
experiences of occupying a profession which is stereotypically ‘masculine?’ Are female 
engineers equal to their male counterparts or are there limitations? The crucial elements to be 
uncovered include: understanding the identities of female engineers of varied race categories; 
analysing the liberties and confinements that female engineers experience and the implications 
thereof. Therefore, an analysis of the impediments that female engineers experience will be 
undertaken; an understanding of the ways the women negotiate their identities in a male 
dominated workplace and lastly, the impact that these experiences have on their well-being, 
their varied identities and their role in society.  
The social constructionist approach will allow for the female engineers to provide the narrative 
and to allow them a voice in how they have constructed their reality and the implications 
thereof.  As the experiences of women of all racial groups in engineering are uncovered, it is 
then possible to analyse whether South Africa is developing to achieve their vision of racial 
and gender equality. A comparison can also be made to existing literature, which states that 
11 
 
women are currently isolated in the engineering workplace (Bastalich et al., 2007; Buse et al., 
2013; Pardo et al., 2016). However, although the literature acknowledges challenges in the 
experiences of female engineers, many women continue to persist in the engineering field 
(Ayre et al., 2013). By reviewing the narratives of South African female engineers of various 
races, the study is able to analyse the challenges faced as well as the persistence of female 
engineers in South Africa.  
1.3 Study Aim 
The aim of the study is to provide narratives of women’s lived experiences as female engineers 
of various races within various disciplines of engineering. The study will unpack how the 
constructs of race and gender shape and influence female engineers lived experiences in the 
engineering field and therefore inform their identity. This will be undertaken through the lens 
of social constructionism and intersectionality as the theoretical frameworks. 
1.4 Research Questions 
1) How do female engineers narrate their experiences of the engineering field? 
2) What challenges do women face in a workplace that is male dominated? 
3) How does gender and race shape the experiences of female engineers? 
4) What are the implications of these experiences on the women’s well-being and 
personal, relational, cultural and social identities? 
1.5    Research Objectives 
1) To uncover the experiences of female engineers in the engineering field 
12 
 
2) To determine challenges that female engineers experience in the engineering field 
3) To understand how race and gender shapes the experiences of female engineers in the 
engineering field 
4) To understand the implications of the experiences on the women’s well-being and 
personal, relational, cultural and social identities 
1.5 Demarcation of Chapters 
The dissertation comprises of five chapters: Chapter One (Introduction); Chapter Two consists 
of two components; the first section is the empirical review of literature and the second section 
comprises of the theoretical view, namely social constructionism and intersectionality; Chapter 
Three (Methodology); Chapter Four (Results and Discussion) and Chapter Five (Conclusion, 
Recommendations and Limitations).  
1.6. Conclusion 
In summary, in contemporary society there still tends to be an underrepresentation of females 
in the engineering industry. This may have elucidated from the injustices of the Apartheid era, 
as there were many injustices that hindered females and Black Africans from pursuing such 
careers. However, various legislations have been implemented in order to overcome such 
injustices of the past. Additionally, there are gendered constructions pertaining to career 
choices, which may prevent females from pursuing engineering, as this may be considered a 
male-dominated field. Social constructionism and intersectionality are also briefly explained 
in relation to the current study and the applicability of the frameworks to the study. The study 
aims, research questions and objectives have also been highlighted.

Chapter Two 
Literature Review and Theoretical Framework 
2.1 Introduction 
This chapter consists of two empirical components, these include the literature review and the 
theoretical framework. Firstly, the literature review explores the literature surrounding 
gendered organizations and occupations, such as engineering, and the implications of 
traditional gendered roles for women, as these are still prevalent in the contemporary society. 
Secondly, the theoretical frameworks utilised in the study will be reviewed. These include the 
Social Constructionist and the Intersectionality paradigms. The assumptions and findings of 
the studies will be reviewed and included in the literature review. The final statements of the 
literature review will consist of the relevance of the literature to the study, as well as a summary 
of the epistemological approaches will be provided.  
2.2 Literature Review 
2.2.1 Historical Context of Labour in South Africa 
During the Apartheid era, organizations were governed by discriminative legislation in order 
to maintain white supremacy. Within this strategy, women bore the brunt of gender 
discrimination. Therefore, females were granted inferior education, her identity often tied to 
the home and underrepresented in organizations. Additionally, many Black South African’s 
career choices were limited due to the education system that was utilised during the Apartheid 
era, which may be a plausible explanation for the underrepresentation of Black female 
engineers in South Africa (Buthelezi et al., 2009; Fiske & Ladd, 2004).  
However, the post-Apartheid constitution has introduced human rights which emphasise racial 
and gender equality as a constitutional right. Chapter One of the Constitution of the Republic 
15 
 
of South Africa (1996) postulates that South Africa is founded on the values of the elimination 
of racism and sexism.  
Chapter Two, Section 9 (3) of the South African Constitution, states that, “The state may not 
unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including 
race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, 
age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth” (Constitution of 
Republic of South Africa, 1996, p. 8).  Subsequently, the Constitution highlights that in Chapter 
Two, Section 9 (4), that, “No person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against 
anyone on one or more grounds in terms of subsection (3). National legislation must be enacted 
to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination” (Constitution of Republic of South Africa, 1996, 
p. 9). These Constitutional rights have been incorporated into the Employment Equity Act, 55 
of 1998 as Chapter Two, Section 6 (1), states that, “No person may unfairly discriminate, 
directly or indirectly against an employee. In any employment policy or practice, on one or 
more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, family responsibility, 
ethic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, HIV status, 
conscience, belief, political opinion, culture, language and birth” (Constitution of Republic of 
South Africa, 1996, p. 9).   
Based on the aforementioned laws that have been put in place to eliminate the injustices of the 
past, gender or racial discrimination is unlawful. In line with this, various legislations and 
policies have also been introduced to eliminate the exclusion in the workplace. These laws 
include: 
 The Labour Relations Act (LRA, No 66 of 1995);  
 The Employment Equity Act (EEA, No 55 of 1998); 
 The Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA, No 75 0f 1997); and 
16 
 
 The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (B-BBEEA No 53 of 2003). 
Additionally, initiatives have been developed locally and internationally to empower women 
in science, technology, engineering and mathematical careers. Many organizations and 
foundations have encouraged women to pursue science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics careers by providing bursaries to women (e.g. WISE; SAWISE; WomEng; Intel). 
These initiatives have been developed to encourage and retain female engineers by creating an 
awareness of the engineering industry, therefore, increasing the participation of female 
engineers, as well as providing a support structure and skills development programme for 
female engineers (WISE; SAWISE; WomEng). 
Despite the efforts made by the government, initiatives and organizations, Mostert (2009) 
postulates that minimal change has occurred since the apartheid era pertaining to gender role 
expectations. Therefore, it is understandable that women are still largely underrepresented in 
organizations, elucidating the underrepresentation of women in the engineering industry 
(Lewis-Enright et al., 2009). Gender role expectations are still pertinent in society and therefore 
continues to be perpetuated in organizations (Foucault, 1980). This study places emphasis on 
equality and redressing the inequalities in gendered occupations, by exploring the narratives of 
female engineers of varied races and the strategies employed to overcome the power dynamic 
that is evident in the engineering profession.  
2.2.2. Discourse Surrounding Females in the Organizational Context 
The South African government, as well as many initiatives, have aimed to empower women 
and to minimise the marginalisation experienced in the workplace. However, despite these 
contributions, women continue to be outnumbered in the engineering sector (Engineering 
17 
 
Council of South Africa, 2016). Research conducted locally and internationally highlight the 
tensions that female engineers (as a minority group) experience in a male dominated industry.  
2.2.2.1 ‘Ideal Worker’ 
Many changes have been made in the post-Apartheid and contemporary society, therefore, 
women are beginning to view work as a dominant focus in their lives (Haworth & Lewis, 2005). 
The dominant perception of the ‘ideal worker’ in society is someone who is able to enter a 
career after graduating, who then progresses upwards in an organization without interruptions. 
Hence, a significant devotion of time to an organization is made (William, 2000, cited in April, 
Dreyer & Blaas, 2007). However, these expectations have great implications for women who 
aspire to reach executive roles. Many women in South Africa are unable to adhere to the ‘ideal 
worker’ based on the dual roles that women play in society, as both a mother and a professional. 
Thus, the ‘ideal worker’ is usually conceptualised as a male, due to the employee having 
unlimited availability to dedicate to the organization, as well as is not having distractions such 
as familial commitments outside of work (Lewis-Enright et al., 2009; Munn & Greer, 2015; 
Watts, 2009).  In South Africa, many women take breaks in their careers, usually occurring in 
the middle of their career to raise children, in which is the time when the ‘ideal worker’ is 
moving up the career ladder (April et al., 2007). Therefore, these societal norms are 
discriminatory towards South African women.  
Contemporary society has experienced an increase in the number of working women (Delina 
& Raya Prabhakara, 2013; Grossman, 1981). However, traditional gender roles are still 
prevalent in contemporary society, in which women often have to perform the housework 
chores as opposed to men, despite working full time (Bianchi et al., 2000; Boye, 2009; 
Saunders, 2016). Despite legislations and the contemporary economy, employers still expect 
18 
 
employees to prioritise work over their familial responsibilities, which in traditional norms is 
perpetuating the masculinity of the ideal worker (Williams, 2000; Brumley, 2014). In dual-
income homes, it has been asserted that the primary role for men is to pursue a career, whereas 
women are deemed the primary caregiver of the children and the home (Doucet, 2000; 
Windebank, 2001). Therefore, women are often excluded from managerial or supervisory roles 
and are usually allocated the secretarial duties (Brumley, 2014; Denis 2003; Freeman 2000). 
Additionally, Zietsmann and Naidoo (1997) have also stated in a study conducted in South 
Africa that employers prefer male employees, as female employees are required to take 
maternity leave, which incurs a cost to the company. Moreover, success is also often associated 
with masculine characteristics, which include assertiveness, the ‘long working hours culture,’ 
competitiveness and ambition (Maskell-Pretz & Hopkins, 1997; Palermo, 2004; Watts, 2009). 
Therefore, as women do not possess these characteristics they experience a lack of progression 
(Brumley, 2014). As a result, a ‘glass ceiling’ is experienced, limiting women from achieving 
success. The ‘glass ceiling’ refers to invisible barriers evident in organizations, obstructing the 
vertical mobility of women. Women reach a certain level in organizations, but experience 
impediments in progressing further due to the ‘glass ceiling’ (Baxter & Wright, 2000). Hence, 
women experience stagnations in their career advancement, based on being a woman, despite 
their qualifications and experience (Cotter, Hermsen, Ovadia, & Vanneman, 2001; Morrison, 
White, & Van Velsor, 1987). 
As organizations are demanding overtime from their employees, this becomes challenging for 
women who perform dual responsibilities, restricting them from entering male dominated 
occupations and forcing them into lower paying, ‘feminine jobs’, due to the time availability 
constraints (Cha, 2013; Correll, Kelly, O’ Connor, & Williams, 2014). It is, therefore, often 
very challenging for women to pursue an engineering career, as well as be the primary 
caregiver, creating implications for gender equity in the organization and society. This is due 
19 
 
to the social discourses perpetuating gender inequalities in society (ibid, 2014). Furthermore, 
women are seen as naturally weak and therefore require protection from men, consequently 
resulting in women remaining in sheltered domains and performing their socially constructed 
responsibilities such as “giving birth to children, raising them, caring for their husbands and 
doing housework” (Zengin-Arslan, 2002, p. 405). Subsequently, men are able to protect 
themselves and can, therefore, perform occupations that require physical strength (ibid, 2002).  
Based on the dedication and commitment required for employees to advance in their careers, 
especially for females in male dominated environments, women have to negotiate their roles 
in order to advance their careers, creating additional stress for women (Ayre et al., 2013). As 
women are deemed the primary caregiver for both children as well as a disabled or ill adult 
(Saunders, 2016), it often results in women choosing careers that allow them to balance their 
family responsibilities as well as pursue a career (Cech, Rubineau, Silbey, & Seron, 2011). 
Additionally, married women need to synchronise three conflicting clocks. These are known 
as the career clock, their biological clock and their companion’s career clock (Sonnert, 1999). 
Young women also felt the need to plan their level of success before taking time off due to 
pregnancy to avoid the result of professional damage. This would usually result in the women 
requiring an urgent promotion in a highly competitive profession, resulting in the women 
working longer hours and requiring a level of good fortune to reach this level (Gill, Sharp, 
Mills, & Franzway, 2008).  
A South African study conducted by Mamabolo, Langa and Kiguwa (2002) on student 
perceptions of motherhood with regards to career aspirations, reported that young educated 
women acknowledged that being a ‘good’ mother and pursuing a career is a concern. Therefore, 
female engineers may decide to pursue one at a time, alternatively, women may opt for part-
time work in order to balance both identities. However, these have implications in terms of 
20 
 
career advancement (Jorgenson, 2002; Watts, 2009). These findings were congruent with Rowe 
and Crafford’s (2003) study on women in the banking industry, as women were forced to make 
a choice between motherhood and a career. The assumption made is that women acknowledge 
that career progression may be a limitation of their role in their family and are, therefore, less 
interested in attaining a career. This is demonstrated in Zengin-Arslan’s (2002) study on female 
engineers, as the women reported that long site visits are incompatible for married women, as 
they would have to leave their home and children alone.  
Furthermore, Australian female engineers in Ayre et al’s study (2013) were criticised due to 
the provisions that they had to make to ensure that their motherly responsibilities were also 
met. One of the common provisions required was women opting for part-time work. However, 
these women encountered criticism and negative remarks, which was an attempt to demonstrate 
their inadequacy and lack of commitment to their profession. Surprisingly, these remarks were 
not only made by men, but also by women that did not have children. Hence, the engineering 
culture, which expects long hours of commitment by their employees, is problematic for 
women who have family responsibilities. Therefore, these women are unable to conform to the 
culture of the organization, consequently affecting their acceptance in the organization. As a 
result, their commitment to the organization and their profession is undermined (Ayre et al., 
2013; Watts, 2009). Studies have further found that using flexible practices in the workplace 
or taking leave has decreased wage growth (Coltrane, Miller, DeHaan, & Stewart, 2013; Glass, 
2004), resulted in fewer promotions, lower performance appraisals (Judiesch & Lyness, 1999) 
and are perceived as less committed and motivated (Rogier & Padgett, 2004) than full-time 
employees with no interruptions in their careers (Correll et al., 2014). Furthermore, engineering 
firms in Palestine stated that although they were willing to hire female engineers, the majority 
preferred to hire males which may be due to women not having as much freedom to work on 
21 
 
sites or travel as the men do, due to their obstructive values and religious beliefs (Baytiyeh, 
2013; Enhassi, Ihsen, & Hallaq, 2008; Enhassi & Liska, 2000). 
Women trying to negotiate a balance between their roles to create a work life balance has been 
acknowledged as one of the major impediments South African working women face (Booysen, 
2007; Broadbridge, 2008; Mostert, 2010; Rowe & Crafford, 2003). It is therefore unsurprising 
that women who prioritise having a family in the future are less likely to pursue an engineering 
or science degree than those who are not as committed to having a family (Burge, 2006; Ware 
& Lee, 1998). Family flexible careers are available and women are aware of those careers, 
however, it has been proclaimed that engineering is not one of those professions (Frome et al., 
2006). Hence, female engineers that persist in the engineering workplace are less likely to be 
married with children, whereas women who had left the profession were more likely to have 
children (Ayre et al., 2013; Bastalich et al., 2007; Buse et al., 2013; Jagacinski, 1987). 
Additionally, the support structures that women had in place would affect their persistence in 
the engineering field. Buse et al. (2013) noted in their study of female engineers, that three of 
the persistent engineers were married to stay-at-home fathers.  Moreover, Jagacinski (1987) 
found that women engineers were more likely to be married to professionals, whereas, this was 
unlikely for the male engineers. A quantitative study conducted by Fouad et al. (2016) 
demonstrated that those who persisted in the field of engineering and those who left was based 
on a factor of support and understanding by their managers about their work and family roles, 
therefore the hypothesis of “women who leave engineering have experienced lower levels of 
social support than women who stay” (p. 82) was accepted. 
Studies have emphasised the need for family-friendly policies, which will assist women in 
negotiating their work-life balance, as a result of the challenges faced by women when 
negotiating part time and flexible hours. These negotiations may explain their under-
22 
 
representation in the field due to women requiring career breaks when becoming mothers 
(Bastalich et al., 2007; Donovan et al. 2005). However, although managing childcare is a 
common challenge for mothers who are also engineers, Mills et al. (2006) study reported that 
very few of the participants reported this as the primary reason for leaving the profession. 
Furthermore, part-time work and extended leave are a concern for females pertaining to their 
career progressions, as once females begin to balance their career and family roles, their male 
colleagues are devoting more time to work and taking advantage of the available career 
opportunities. Evidence has also been found that men who are fathers still devote more time to 
work. A possible reason for this could be either to compensate for the loss of income from the 
mother or to use work as a ‘safe haven’ (Figes, 1994; Watts, 2009).  
Despite the need for an emphasis on family-friendly policies, the counterargument is that it can 
create a contradiction for women. This is because women are emphasising that they are equal 
to men and do not need special provisions, however, by placing an emphasis on family-friendly 
policies it reinforces the idea that women do indeed need special concessions to succeed in the 
field (Bastalich et al., 2007; Ranson, 2005). This may be due to women no longer being seen 
as ‘one of the boys’ which accentuates the differences between men and women which creates 
challenges for women to be accepted (Ranson, 2005). This was found in a study conducted by 
Watts (2009) on civil engineers, in which women were treated as equals to their male 
counterparts until they became pregnant. Therefore, the struggles that women are facing 
demonstrates the masculinity of the field and how the culture of the workplace is male-
dominated (Jorgenson, 2002).  
Anderson (2004) notes that certain organizational cultures along with the discourses that are 
entrenched in them will encourage gendered behaviour, which influences one’s gendered 
identity. Certain contexts require gendered behaviour, in which individuals will adapt 
23 
 
themselves accordingly, for example the engineering environment requires the individuals to 
adapt accordingly to the masculinised environment (Bastalich et al., 2007; Faulkner, 2009). 
These behaviours become entrenched in specific norms and codes, which are then infiltrated 
into one’s social identity (Bastalich et al., 2007).  Additionally, power relationships are formed, 
as within gendered identities, particular behaviours may be considered more appropriate than 
others. Furthermore, if these behaviours deviate from the gendered norms, the behaviour may 
be considered problematic for others and therefore require discipline by those in power. Hence, 
women who deviate from the social norms are subjected to criticism and discipline by men. 
Furthermore, Bastalich et al., (2007) notes that those who do not conform to the culture of the 
engineering workplace (which is largely based on masculine norms that are inherent in the 
profession) are considered ‘outsiders’ and ‘foreign’.  
In addition, individuals possess varied identities which merge and diverge depending on the 
context. These include but are not limited to one’s professional; personal; social and relational 
identity. As female engineers are often required to adapt to the gendered norms in which society 
subscribes to them, their personal identity is affected. This is especially true for female 
engineers as their personal identity is affected by their professional identity as an engineer 
(Anderson, 2004; Bastalich et al., 2007). As female engineers are required to adopt 
characteristics that are suitable for the context in which they are placed, which is the male-
dominated environment, feminine characteristics are counterproductive, hence, women need 
to adopt characteristics which are considered masculine (Faulkner, 2009; Jorgenson, 2002; 
Maskell-Pretz & Hopkins, 1997). Dehing, Jochems, and Baartman (2013) define one’s 
professional identity as the process of becoming a professional engineer. The authors further 
explain that to there are two dimensions in the development of a professional engineer, these 
include: social and individual dimensions. The individual dimension can be likened with one’s 
personal identity, as this dimension includes the ‘feeling’ of becoming an engineer, hence is 
24 
 
the commitment that one has to the organisation. Thus, for female engineers, their professional 
identity merges with their personal identity.  
As a result of social constructions of the traditional roles for men and women, women choose 
careers that would be more appropriate based on their gendered identity. The perceived 
appropriate behaviour for women would be to be emotional, caring, a listener, sensible, people 
oriented and emphatic. However, men are subjected to behaviours that are self-centred, 
assertive and controlling (Fondas, 1997; Saavedra, Araújo, Taveira, & Vieira, 2014).  Based 
on these gender-appropriate behaviours, women are often estranged to technology, science and 
engineering professions, as these are less emotional and deemed appropriate for men. This type 
of gendered thinking explains why the engineering field is male dominated, especially due to 
male’s interests in the hard sciences (Schiebinger, 1999; Saavedra et al., 2014). Furthermore, 
women are believed to be inadequate in technical issues and good at social issues. Therefore, 
the gendered image of femininity is often not associated with technology and technical issues, 
deeming engineering inappropriate for women, as women are considered more people oriented 
rather than object-oriented (Lippa, 1998; Rosenberg-Kima, Ashby Plant, Doerr, & Baylor, 
2010). This association between sexual imagery and occupations is known as ‘gendering’ of 
professional identities (Evetts, 1993). Robinson & Mcllwee (1991) state that to be a competent 
engineer, one needs to possess the image of being aggressive, technically oriented and 
competitive, which are traits that are commonly found in men. Thus, to be an engineer, an 
individual should talk, look and act like an engineer, which is usually associated with the 
individual looking, acting and talking like a man. Additionally, the imagery of the engineering 
profession to the public is seen to be synonymous to that of a labourer, resulting in the 
incongruity between femininity and the engineering profession (Phipps, 2002). Hence, the 
‘dirty hands’ stereotype is prevalent in society pertaining to the roles of an engineer. As a result 
of the masculine and ‘dirty hands’ imagery of the engineering profession, a segregation is 
25 
 
created between men and women, deeming engineering inappropriate for women, as it is a 
‘man’s world’ (Evetts, 1993; Newton, 1987; Phipps, 2002). Therefore, women entering the 
engineering profession are considered to be ‘atypical’ and hence, a deviation from the norm 
(Evetts, 1993).  
Faulkner (2009b) postulates that women are highly visible in the engineering profession based 
on their gender, yet highly invisible as engineers, creating implications for women attempting 
to place themselves in the engineering workplace. In order to combat this, being an engineer 
requires one to ‘do gender,’ implying that one needs to conduct masculine behaviours in order 
to create a sense of belonging to the culture of the organization (Faulkner, 2009). As the 
engineering profession is dominated by men who make up the majority of individuals within 
the field, these men would play a role in shaping the culture of the organization (Ayre et al., 
2013; Bastalich et al., 2007; Faulkner, 2009b; Fouad & Singh, 2011; Masket-Pretz & Hopkins, 
1997; Powell, Dainty, & Bagilhole, 2011). As men usually value individualism and 
competition (which are not common values for women according to literature), this may result 
in women experiencing the environment to be additionally stressful, resulting in women feeling 
isolated (Gibson, & Espino 2016; Tang 2000; Wentling & Camacho, 2008). Furthermore, the 
competitive nature which constitutes the engineering environment reflects masculine traits 
such as detachment, self-reliance and independence, which may result in women experiencing 
anxiety and fear of loss of their femininity or rejection if these traits are not developed (Evetts, 
1993; Seymour & Hewitt, 1994). This may suggest why women experience the engineering 
workplace as challenging as they struggle for acceptance and to feel included, leading to a 
hindrance for females (Ayre et al., 2013; Bastalich et al., 2007; Faulkner, 2009b; Fouad & 
Singh, 2011; Masket-Pretz & Hopkins, 1997; Powell, Dainty, & Bagilhole, 2011). 
26 
 
Female engineers enter the industry with preconceived prejudices and discouragements, 
resulting in women experiencing discontent with the environment and leaving the profession 
(Zengin-Arslan, 2002). Furthermore, as the environment is comprised of masculine 
characteristics, women acknowledged the competitive environment, and stated they felt 
ignored and unwelcome (Buse et al., 2013). Many female engineers that left the engineering 
profession, specified that the engineering climate and culture to be problematic (Ayre et al., 
2013; Buse et al., 2013; Fouad & Singh, 2011; Johnson & Asce, 2013). Thus, the inclusiveness 
of the organisational culture may possibly have a bearing on the persistence of female engineers 
as an inclusive organisational culture could give women a sense of acceptance and career 
progression (Faulkner, 2009b). These prejudices and discriminatory behaviour impact women 
in the field of engineering, as women have to adapt their identities to master the profession and 
regulate their behaviour in order to fit into the expectations that others have of them (Zengin-
Arslan, 2002).  
Furthermore, Faulkner (2009b) notes that engineering is remarkably resistant to gender change 
in comparison with other occupations in many countries. Mather-Helm (2005) suggests that 
women experience difficulty in achieving senior positions based on the organizational culture, 
as it is not yet ready to accept women as professionals. This becomes a barrier to women in the 
workplace, as ideologies are encouraging women to pursue work in order to obtain 
independence and self-fulfilment (Naidoo & Jano, 2002), however, limitations may occur from 
the work environment to the extent of advancement the women may achieve.  
2.2.2.2 Workplace Challenges 
Numerous impediments have been identified in the engineering profession for female 
engineers. Gill et al.’s (2008) study on Australian female engineer’s states that women in their 
27 
 
study have highlighted experiences of being excluded and treated differently in the workplace 
based on their gender. Women were reminded of their ‘femaleness,’ as men treated them 
differently and not as equal colleagues (Gill et al., 2008). Women are also often excluded from 
social events and discussions by their male colleagues, as a common ground cannot be 
established (ibid, 2008), resulting in limitations to the women’s career advancement (Morrison 
et al., 1987). As a result of the exclusion to social events, a mentoring network cannot also be 
established, as these mentoring and social activities usually take place during social situations 
outside of the workplace, such as the golf course (Maskell-Pretz & Hopkins, 1997). 
Furthermore, the existence of an ‘old boys network’ is considered a challenge for women, as it 
disadvantages women based on their identity, as women cannot easily place themselves in these 
groups, as the dominant discourses are about sporting events (Phipps, 2002; Schäfer, 2006).  
A common challenge in a male dominated industry, such as engineering, is sexual harassment. 
Female engineers would often be discouraged due to the sexual harassment that was 
experienced in the profession (Johnson, 2013; Servon & Visser, 2011). Servon & Visser (2011) 
noted that 69% of their respondents experienced sexual harassment. These findings are 
congruent with other studies (Bastain, Lancaster, & Reyst, 1996; DeSouza & Solberg 2003; 
Illies, Hauserman,  Schwochau, & Stibal, 2003), as these authors have noted that women that 
are in the minority in the workplace, or work in non-traditional occupations are exposed to 
greater amounts of sexual harassment and sexism (Saunders, 2016). Moreover, sexual 
harassment, unfair gender expectations, gaining acceptance of male colleagues and 
pornography were common amongst all female engineer interviewees in Bastalich et al’s 
(2007) study of female engineers. Women in the United States have stated experiences of not 
being awarded the same opportunities as their male counterparts, experiencing inequality with 
regards to remuneration, promotions and treatment in the engineering workplace. Therefore, 
based solely on their gender their competencies have not been acknowledged or rewarded 
28 
 
(Ayre et al., 2013; Bagilhole et al., 2007; Buse et al., 2013; Fouad & Singh, 2011). Servon & 
Visser (2011) also noted that female engineers experienced discrimination when undergoing 
performance appraisals. Moreover, due to the women’s minority status, their needs and 
sensitivities were often overlooked, such as women having to use the men’s lavatories, as well 
as the lunch rooms would be filled with posters of naked women (Ayre et al., 2013). Male 
engineers in the United States have reported that they have greater supervisory responsibility 
and salaries compared to women, however, in some cases these factors were also dependent on 
experience (Jagacinski, 1987; McAfee, 1974; Rossi, 1972; Vetter, 1981). Furthermore, men 
were also more satisfied with their career opportunities compared to women (Jagacinski, 1987). 
These gendered norms and social constructions are not only a hindrance in the workplace, but 
also for girls choosing to pursue studies in engineering. Lent (2005) postulates that one’s 
gender may influence career decisions due to the development of self-efficacy and outcomes 
expectations as a result of how an individual is socialised. Therefore, an individual will choose 
a career that is most appropriate for their gender as a result of the stigmas, stereotypes and role 
expectations regarding male and female dominated professions (Buse, 2013; Hackett & Betz, 
1981). Romkey (2007) affirms that the perceived masculine imagery of engineering may have 
a negative effect on children and teenager’s perceptions of women in engineering, therefore 
discouraging them in pursuing the field. School girls also often shy away from physical 
sciences in school, which is problematic as physical sciences and mathematics are a 
prerequisite in studying engineering at a University in South Africa (Jawitz & Case, 1998). 
One of the suggested reasons for girls not pursuing physical sciences at school may be due to 
the manner in which physical sciences are taught and portrayed at school (Kahle et al., 2000; 
Zietsman & Naidoo, 1997). Chikuvadze & Matswetu (2013) stated that teachers are 
discriminatory towards girls in science classes, along with the dominant perception that science 
can only be pursued by men, which may result in girls rejecting science careers. These social 
29 
 
constructions can restrict career interests and impact on the opportunities available for women 
(Buse et al., 2013; Lent, 2005). Additionally, girls at a young age underestimate their 
mathematic abilities, despite the fact that their performance is on par with boys from the same 
age group (Rosenberg-Kima et al., 2010).  
Furthermore, the underrepresentation of females in science and engineering careers may be due 
to the lack of identification with these fields. According to Tietjen (2004) many women in the 
United States of America are unaware of what an engineering job entails, which can be a result 
of the lack of interaction with engineers on a daily basis. It is common for citizens to interact 
daily with dentists, doctors and other professionals, but rarely engineers, which therefore 
results in society not understanding the role of an engineer. Moreover, engineers are also rarely 
the topic of television movies and shows (Johnson, 2013). It has also been proposed that 
females will pursue a career in which value is seen, however, if there is a lack of understanding 
of the job it is challenging to see the value. Hersh (2000) also notes that the engineering 
profession can sometimes be viewed as destructive to the environment, which constitutes a 
negative reputation for the engineering field. 
As certain gendered social constructions are prevalent in society, females deviating from these 
constructions are subjected to discrimination. When women choose a career that is considered 
masculine and is characterised by masculine traits, these women may experience 
marginalisation, discrimination and subjection (Saavedra et al., 2014). These subjections may 
be experienced from school up until their professional career, as women that pursue physical 
science and mathematics at school are more inclined to an engineering career, as these abilities 
are seen as ‘natural gifts’ (Gill et al., 2008). These women have to work harder to prove their 
abilities to their male counterparts. However, the driving factor to pursue engineering is highly 
influenced by the individual’s capabilities and enjoyment of mathematics and science, which 
30 
 
was found in several studies from a variety of countries (Baryeh, Obu, Lamptey, & Baryeh, 
1999; Buse et al., 2013; Evetts, 1993; Holth, 2014; Jorgenson, 2002). Females in Ghana stated 
that their curiosity towards the engineering profession was the main driving factor, followed 
by their mathematics and science abilities (Baryeh, Obu & Lampety, 2000). Another common 
influence for females pursuing an engineering career is family and role model influences as it 
has been found that women that pursued engineering were more likely to have a family member 
as an engineer, as well as a teacher or counsellor whom encouraged the women to pursue the 
field (Ambrose, Lazarus, & Nair, 1998; Baytiyeh, 2013; Buse et al., 2013; Evetts, 1993; Gill 
et al., 2008; Holth, 2014; Jagacinski, 1987; Pardo et al., 2016). Many women would be 
encouraged by their parents to pursue a field that they wanted to do, however, this was not 
always supported when choosing a career in engineering due to the stereotypes surrounding 
the field (Ambrose et al., 1998). 
In South Africa, career influences differ across racial groups. White female students pursue an 
engineering career for the same reason as in the Western society, these influences are the 
natural abilities of mathematics and science, as well as a supportive family structure (Jawitz, 
Case, & Tshabalala, 2000). Whereas, Jawitz & Case (1998) stated that black female students 
pursued an engineering degree due to opportunities to serve the community and the ability to 
prove themselves in a white male-dominated field. 
Females also experienced a denial of practical experience based on their gender and were 
therefore treated as observers rather than engineers, resulting in the women not acquiring the 
same practical experience and expertise as their male counterparts (Holth, 2014). As a result of 
the discrimination, women lacked confidence to use the tools, machinery and computers, 
despite the mathematical and science abilities they possessed, whereas the male students were 
more comfortable with the necessary machinery (Schreuders, Mannon, & Rutherford, 2009). 
31 
 
As women are perceived as technically incompetent, male students in Mexico had a tendency 
to support and care for the females, however, this may due to the women lacking confidence 
as a result of an underestimation of their abilities and lack of exposure to the technical 
components (García Villa & González y González, 2014; Peterson, 2010; Powell et al., 2011). 
Moreover, the masculine imagery of engineering also affects women’s external attractiveness, 
as women that pursued engineering were viewed as masculine and less attractive (García Villa 
& González y González, 2014). Pardo et al. (2016) notes that females experienced the structure 
of the universities in Spain to be problematic, as the facilities in universities would only 
accommodate men. Female toilet facilities were deficient in the classroom areas, resulting in 
the women locating toilet facilities in other areas such as the administration and secretarial 
departments. 
The hindrances experienced by female engineering students are amplified for black women 
choosing to pursue a career in engineering. Black women in the United States are largely 
underrepresented in the enrolment and graduate rates as opposed to their white peers (Snyder, 
Tan & Hoffman, 2006; Gibson & Espino, 2016). The National Science Foundation (2009) 
reported that engineering student enrolment rates for white women in the United States were 
10.9%, whereas, African American women comprised of 1.3% of students in engineering. 
Studies conducted by Smallwood (2002) and Solorzano, Ceja & Yosso (2000, as cited in 
Gibson & Espino, 2016), state that black women experience racism and sexism on college 
campuses, with negative gender and racial stereotypes as well as unspecified expectations 
being common. These racist ideologies stem from stereotypes such as ‘the strong black woman’ 
which implies that all black women are more resilient in the face of adversity (Gibson & 
Espino, 2016). However, this may not be the case for all black women and due to the 
underrepresentation of black women at colleges in the United States, many faculty staff are not 
equipped to notice the isolation and stress that black women are experiencing (Beauboeuf-
32 
 
LaFontant, 2009; Gibson & Espino, 2016; Watt, 2003). Despite the impediments experienced 
by black female engineering students, black women perceived themselves as hard working, 
strong and team players. The black women in Gibson & Espino’s (2016) study would also 
acknowledge that their presence created value to the decision making and planning process of 
the project in which they were working on. Positive attributes such as independence, strength 
and confidence would allow for black women to negotiate their identity in a white male-
dominated hostile culture (Gibson & Espino, 2016). However, several black women also 
reported that it was frustrating to continuously prove oneself as competent, as a result of not 
being offered the same privileges as their white male counterparts (ibid, 2016). Seymour & 
Hewitt (1997) postulate that in the universities in the United States, white faculty members and 
students’ perception of black women having lower abilities, is likely to affect the black 
women’s self-confidence. Black women engineering students in the south east of the United 
States believed that the expectations were lower for them than the rest of the class, due to their 
race and gender. Men also demonstrated feelings of astonishment when black women proved 
their abilities in mathematics and science, over and above a friendly personality (Gibson & 
Espino, 2016). This, however, was a common theme amongst all women engineering students, 
nonetheless, it may be more challenging for black women (García Villa & González y 
González, 2014; Pardo et al., 2016). Additionally, black women felt the need to prove their 
abilities even more due to their racial grouping. Black women have experienced their 
engineering studies to be more complex, as black women are in the minority for both their race 
and gender, resulting in double marginalisation (Gibson & Espino, 2016). Students often 
experience a lack of acceptance when there is a difference in the environment, this is especially 
true for multi-racial students. White females can easily identify with their racial group, 
however, due to the lack of female engineers of colour, it is more complex for multi-racial 
33 
 
students and they are unable to easily identify themselves in a category (Gibson & Espino, 
2016).  
Baryeh et al. (2000) found that female engineering students that had attended a girls schools in 
Ghana felt at ease with their male colleagues after a few months. Most of the male engineering 
students in Ghana were cooperative and helpful towards the female engineering students, whilst 
a few others behaved in a stereotypical traditional manner. Therefore, female engineering 
students in Ghana perceived being treated as equals to their male counterparts. Likewise, 
female engineers in Turkey also noted the absence of discrimination during their university 
education, resulting in a similar experience to the Ghanaian students (Zengin-Arslan, 2002). 
However, discrimination can occur in more subtle forms, such as the gendered distribution of 
engineering and the disciplines thereof is a sign of discrimination in itself. The gendered 
distribution has an impact on who enters engineering and which discipline they pursue (Zengin-
Arslan, 2002). 
Furthermore, not only is engineering in its entirety perceived as masculine, but discourses have 
further segregated the disciplines of engineering, by labelling some as feminine and others as 
masculine. Disciplines which consist of more than 50% female students have been labelled 
‘feminine’ (Zengin-Arslan, 2002). Therefore, by labelling the various disciplines as feminine 
and masculine, this does not imply that some disciplines are more suitable for females or that 
females naturally choose such a field.  These preconceived ideas are internalised and in some 
instances, women choose a particular engineering discipline based on these gendered 
ideologies (Zengin-Arslan, 2002). 
Mechanical, electrical, civil, electronics, metallurgical and petroleum engineering are 
perceived as masculine, whereas food, environmental and chemical engineering are portrayed 
34 
 
as feminine. Additionally, the following disciplines have been labelled as mixed sex: 
geological, computer, mining, nuclear energy, hydrogeological, aeronautical and geophysical.  
As each engineering discipline is characterised by certain demands which may be labelled as 
more ‘feminine’ or ‘masculine’ it is important to understand the current stereotypes and 
discourses available for each engineering discipline (Zengin-Arslan, 2002).  
Industrial Engineering is stereotyped to be one of the ‘easier’ engineering disciplines to pursue 
at an undergraduate level (Brawner, Camacho, Lord, Long, & Ohland, 2012). Brawner et al. 
(2012) found that in their study at multiple universities, industrial engineering graduated more 
women than any other engineering discipline. Similarly, Zengin-Arslan (2002) stated that 
industrial engineering has a relatively high representation of women in Turkey, which may be 
due to industrial engineering being a combination of administrative practices and mechanical 
engineering.  
Despite the discipline being perceived as easier, it was found that the curriculum is similar to 
that of any other engineering discipline. Brawner et al. (2012) found in their study of female 
undergraduate industrial engineering students (at various universities in Midfield) numerous 
themes developed which attracted females to major in industrial engineering. The themes that 
emerged were warmth; flexibility; efficiency; feminine and the vast career opportunities 
available. Additionally, a study conducted by the University of Oklahoma stated that industrial 
engineering is more feminine compared to the other disciplines, which may attract women. As 
the field is not as technical as the other engineering disciplines, this may result in the 
assumption that industrial engineering is easier. However, this results in Industrial Engineering 
being devalued within the engineering hierarchy (Brawner et al., 2012). By labelling the 
discipline as ‘imaginary engineering’ it suggests that engineering can be classified on a 
spectrum of hard to soft (Brawner et al., 2012). Similarly to industrial engineering, chemical 
35 
 
and environmental engineering are less likely to be associated with mechanical innovativeness, 
which may be a possible explanation for women’s greatest incursions to these disciplines 
(Bastalich et al., 2007). Chemical engineering is comprised of a large amount of work to be 
done in a laboratory as opposed to a production department, which may be a reason why women 
are more inclined to pursue chemical engineering (Pardo et al., 2016). Zengin-Arslan (2002) 
also postulates a reason why women are inclined to chemical engineering, as laboratories are 
comfortable and clean for women and do not require physical strength. The discipline does not 
deviate from the traditional female roles of being in the kitchen, as the laboratory is compared 
to a kitchen in which one mixes solutions and materials.  
Unlike industrial, chemical and environmental engineering, female civil and mechanical 
engineers experienced marginalisation in the field due to underrepresentation of females. 
Bastalich et al. (2007) noted in their study in Australia that a female civil engineer experienced 
a large amount of marginalisation when pursuing her studies, as she was one of two women in 
a class of 60 during her studies to pursue a career in civil engineering. Civil engineers play a 
crucial role in society as they are needed to creatively solve problems regarding infrastructure; 
global climate change impacts; natural resource depletion and access to clean water to name a 
few. However, despite their integral role in society, female civil engineers are largely 
underrepresented in the field, although there have been improvements since the 1970’s (United 
States Bureau of Labour Statistics, 2012; Johnson, 2013), as Isaacs (2001) states the percentage 
of women engineers has never reached 10% in the United States. Schreuder et al. (2009) states 
that females are underrepresented in the field of mechanical engineering in the United States. 
Female students tend to have a lack of interest in mechanical engineering (Byars-Winston & 
Canetto, 2011; Fernando Piera, Plana, Cageao, Lopez, & Fernando Piera, 2013; Hill, Corbett, 
& Rose, 2010; Knight et al., 2012; Medina, 2004). Fernado Piera et al. (2013) postulate that 
mechanical engineering in Spain is largely associated with cars and motorcycles, whereas, only 
36 
 
a small percentage of mechanical engineers work in such an environment. Furthermore, 
mechanical engineering is inaccurately perceived to be a blue-collar profession, that it is a 
dangerous, hostile and a physically demanding profession. However, most mechanical 
engineers are office-bound and are therefore not associated with these negative perceptions 
(Fernando Piera et al., 2013; Medina, 2004). However, based on these assumptions and 
preconceived ideas, many women do not enter the mechanical engineering discipline 
(Fernando Piera et al., 2013). Interestingly, mechanical and civil engineering were born during 
the industrialisation era, which may explain the association to masculinity and the perception 
of it as a convenient choice for men. 
As noted, female engineers tend to experience impediments in the engineering workplace, 
however, Ayre et al. (2013) state that many women continue to persist in the engineering 
profession, despite the challenges. As this is unexpected, many studies have attempted to find 
the relationship between the individual and their persistence in the engineering field by using 
conceptual and theoretical models (Buse et al., 2013; Cech et al., 2011). 
The models found that persistence is related to characteristics found in the individual’s 
personality, these include attitudes, behaviours, aspirations and the workplace culture. The 
models have shown that the cultural and individual contributing factors are facilitated by the 
female’s experience in the engineering work environment resulting in various degrees of 
persistence in the workplace or career commitment (Ayre et al., 2013; Buse et al., 2013; Cech 
et al., 2011; Van Antwerp & Wilson, 2015).  
Buse (2011) found that women who persisted in the engineering workplace demonstrated self-
efficacy and confidence, which assisted the women in negotiating and handling the challenges 
in the engineering workplace (Ayre et al., 2013). Persistent engineers demonstrated self-
37 
 
efficacy in relation to finding new assignments, being challenged by new products, projects 
and technologies, dealing with challenging work situations and undertaking tough technical 
problems. However, self-efficacy was developed over a period of time to manage 
uncomfortable or threatening situations (Buse et al., 2013). The factors that differentiate 
women who persist and those that leave are: those that are confident in engineering tasks, 
possess confidence in the ability to manage multiple life roles, and the ability to navigate the 
organisational culture (Fouad et al., 2011). Substantiating this, the women who left the 
profession stated that it was challenging to keep up with the engineering tasks, manage their 
work-life balance as well as deal with the organisational political challenges (Fouad, Singh, 
Cappaert, Chang, & Wan, 2016). Despite the challenges faced, many of the respondents in 
Ayre et al.’s (2013) study stated that being an engineer was enjoyable and that they enjoyed 
the challenge of the profession. Engineering is perceived as challenging and interesting which 
is what drew women to it (Bastalich et al., 2007).  
The culture of the environment is key to the persistence of female engineers, as female 
engineers that are personally and professionally accepted and respected, are more likely to stay 
in the organization. Therefore, the women in Ayre et al’s (2013) study felt included and 
respected by their male colleagues and clients, despite their numerical minority in the 
organization. It has also been found in various models that the stronger the women’s feelings 
of personal fulfilment and belonging to the profession, the more likely they are to persist in the 
field (Ayre et al., 2013; Buse, 2011; Cech et al., 2011) A factor that is likely to increase the 
womens’ confidence and workplace satisfaction is receiving positive feedback from their 
managers (Ayre et al., 2013). Fouad et al. (2016) states that women who persisted in the field 
experiences differed in terms of workplace support, career progression and their managers 
understanding their dual role as a mother and as an engineer.   
38 
 
Gill et al. (2008) also postulates that women enjoy the competition against their male peers. 
Furthermore, almost half of the women in Bastalich et al’s (2007) study of various engineering 
fields in Australia have acknowledged that they have experienced little to no difficulty 
regarding discrimination and adapting to the culture of the workplace. As women encounter 
both positive and negative experiences in the engineering workplace, it was found that the 
positive experiences would be compelling enough to overcome the negative experiences. It was 
also common for women to not notice the discrimination or to find it challenging, whereas 
other women that encountered challenges would ignore the discrimination or persist. It was 
also common for women to use these challenges as motivation to continue (Ambrose et al., 
1998). Female engineers would often disregard their minority status by suppressing any 
acknowledgement of gender differentiation (Eisenhart & Finkel, 1998; Jorgenson, 2002).  
Gender bias is often overlooked by female engineers and they believe they do not experience 
any direct discrimination. Furthermore, discrimination that did take place would be blamed on 
personality characteristics such as ego, rather than being based on gender (Jorgenson, 2002). 
Jorgenson (2002) noted that the majority of female engineers studied would state that 
engineering is gender neutral, therefore genders experienced equal opportunities.  
Fouad et al. (2016) found in a quantitative study that the difference between women that 
persisted in the engineering field and those who left was based on advancement opportunities 
which play a large role in women’s persistence in the field. Men were also more likely to persist 
in the engineering field, whereas young women who are engineering graduates are more likely 
to consider moving across firms and locations, and so age also influences the female engineer’s 
persistence in the field (Gill et al., 2008). 
39 
 
2.2.2.3 Strategies Employed by Women to Persist 
Despite women’s persistence in the engineering field, acknowledgement needs to be given to 
the challenges that women face in the engineering professions. Due to these impediments, 
women have adopted various strategies to overcome these challenges. As women often 
experience the challenge of being acknowledged in the engineering workplace, female 
engineers often felt the need to prove themselves, become more visible in the workplace, assert 
themselves or work harder than a man. Only once these have been done, does the female 
engineer gain respect from the organisation (Ayre et al., 2013). However, asserting oneself may 
portray a sense of dominance, which was found to intimidate men, which could then lead to 
additional challenges for the women (Palermo, 2004; Schaefer, 2006). Men have noted that 
women react to the environment in various ways, these include presenting themselves as overly 
confident in the field, for example, if comments were to arise, the women would laugh about 
it or ignore it. The latter have been noted to be more likely to succeed in the profession 
(Bastalich et al., 2007).  
Bastalich, et al. (2007) conducted a study in the Australian engineering workplace and 
concluded that it may be beneficial for women to demonstrate some form of masculine traits 
to conform to the environment and thus cannot demonstrate any form of emotion or femininity 
as this may result in derogation and a hostile workplace. It was also found that women that 
naturally conformed to masculine traits did not believe that the engineering workplace was 
challenging. These women also preferred and enjoyed working with men. An important 
component of surviving in the engineering field is to be independent and confident regardless 
of the derogatory comments made by others. When challenged in the workplace, many women 
would become more determined. There is also a feeling among female engineers to prove 
oneself to be as good as a man. It was emphasised among female interviewees to not react when 
40 
 
being teased and challenged, despite the extreme levels. Women would ignore the sexism, or 
otherwise regard it as amusing. Women demonstrated masculine behaviours, such as being 
assertive and confrontational, in order to counter the sexism in the workplace. It is also 
important to not allow one’s emotions to interfere with work, but to stick to the facts at hand 
and if women do not conform to the logical style, men would simply refuse to listen to them. 
Becoming one of the ‘boys’ is known to be an effective strategy. Other strategies include 
distancing themselves from the values and culture as well as challenging the hegemonic 
masculinity of the organisation (Jorgenson, 2002; Kvande, 1999). In addition, Gibson and 
Espino (2016) report on female engineering students having to adapt to the engineering 
environment by dressing in a masculine manner. As one of the participants were discriminated 
against if they did not subscribe to the masculine dress code, which included wearing make-up 
and tight clothing. Hence, the physical appearance of female engineers is also crucial to the 
acceptance of the culture of the organisation.  
Becoming self-employed was a strategy chosen by a few women whom were well-established 
in their careers. Whereas, part-time work was a more practical strategy for participants to create 
a work-life balance. However, this was not a common option (Maskel-Prettz & Hopkins, 1997).  
2.2.3 Relevance of the Literature to the Study 
The labour relations and historical context of South Africa is relevant to the study as it 
emphasises the effects of the Apartheid policies on contemporary roles and identities of women 
and Black Africans in South Africa. This is especially the case as career choices were limited 
due to the Apartheid era and therefore may have affected the underrepresentation of female 
engineers. The literature provides the dynamic and contradictory experiences women 
41 
 
experience in contemporary society, as well as how the women negotiate their identities in 
contemporary society, especially in a masculinised work environment.  
The literature review provided makes reference to the contemporary organisational practices 
pertaining to gender as well as how these gendered organisational practices create implications 
and challenges for women. Implicit in the literature is the traditional gender roles as well as the 
masculinised work environment of engineering. The literature also reveals the strategies that 
female engineers utilise in negotiating their identity with the masculinised identity of the 
engineering workplace. The persistence of various women in the engineering environment 
challenges the hegemonies prevalent in society. The extent of the strategies employed and the 
persistence of female engineers in a masculinised work environment is explored through the 
female participant’s voice in this research.   
Despite the thorough analysis of the literature, there tends to be a dearth of South African 
literature on female engineers, especially pertaining to race and gender. Therefore, this study 
aims to shed light on these topics by answering the questions of the experiences of all racial 
groups and the impediments they may face in a male-dominated and racially dispersed industry. 
2.3 Theoretical Framework 
2.3.1 Social Constructionism 
The social constructionist paradigm is grounded on subjective truths, as opposed to an objective 
reality. Social constructionism accentuates the process of how individuals describe, explain or 
perceive their reality (Burr, 1995; Gergen, 1985). A person’s reality emanates from their 
experiences and perspectives in society, however, it has been acknowledged that multiple 
perspectives exist resulting in several ‘truths’ (Burr, 1995; Freud, 1994). Furthermore, these 
42 
 
perspectives are social artefacts, therefore, are culturally and historically specific which 
manifests itself through the interactions between people (Gergen, 1985). As a result, knowledge 
is ever-changing due to perspectives changing (Gergen & Thatchenkery, 1996).  
Social constructionism places substantial emphasis on language, as language gains meaning in 
social interactions (Gergen & Thatchenkery, 1996). Therefore, language does not depict an 
action but is instead an action in itself, resulting in language being performative role in 
constructing reality (Burr & Dick, 2017; Gergen & Thatchenkery, 1996). Furthermore, how 
the world is perceived is not an objective reflection of nature but is a product of how reality is 
produced through language, therefore the defining characteristics of nature are represented 
through language (Burr & Dick, 2017). It is not surprising then that, social constructionists 
have a preference for qualitative methods such as semi-structured and narrative interviews, 
diaries and other forms of discourse (Burr & Dick, 2017).  
Social constructionists place large emphasis on discourse, which are a culturally significant set 
of ideas, used to understand reality (Speer, 2005). However, not every and all ideas are 
discourses as for social constructionists; the difference lies in its productive power. Therefore, 
ideas not only explain or describe reality but also influence how one acts (Knights & Morgan, 
1991). Furthermore, power relations referring to the status that an individual or group has in 
society such as class, gender, occupation and so forth allows them to have authority over others, 
due to the power that these groups have in society, therefore, they are able to set the norms and 
standards in which the rest of the society need to adhere to. Social constructionists have also 
analysed the power of certain discourses in society which create subject positions and 
identities, which may be problematic for individuals that are implicated in them, such as 
females working in a highly-masculinized field such as engineering. There are certain roles in 
43 
 
which females need to adhere to and by entering an engineering field, these roles are not 
fulfilled (Burr & Dick, 2017).   
The social constructionist paradigm opposes the fact that an individual’s identity is innate. As 
the social constructionist paradigm focuses on the shifting of identities; it proposes that one’s 
identity is not static, but is rather fluid and ever-changing (Burr, 1995). The motive for this is 
that one’s identity is constructed by the interactions between society and the individual, which 
are constantly being transformed (Shotter & Gergen, 1989). Thus, one’s identity is constantly 
being shaped by interactions, resulting in the identity needing to adapt to these changes. An 
individual’s identity is transformed and shaped by their social roles in society (Gee, 2003).   
The importance of social constructionism in this study is that the construct ‘gender’ is crucial, 
as the study is analysing the narratives of female engineers, whom have entered a profession 
that is recognized to be male-dominated. The concept ‘gender’ is socially constructed and 
therefore creates implications for women that do not ascribe to the norms of their stereotypical 
role expectations, based on their gender. Furthermore, the construct ‘race’ also has attached 
connotations, as it is also a social construct. Therefore, by the study analysing both race and 
gender as social constructs and the implications for women who do not ascribe to those 
connotations, various perspectives will be provided (Burr, 1995). Social constructionism is a 
valid paradigm to use in this specific study, as social constructionism focuses on one’s personal 
experiences, thereby engaging in various experiences and narratives regarding the women’s 
experiences in the engineering workplace. The paradigm focuses on subjective truths, in which 
the women engineers will be able to provide discourse on, as it is their own reality. Social 
constructionism is culturally and historically bound, resulting in differed narratives based on 
the women’s experiences in the engineering field, which is a result of the social and historical 
background.

2.3.1.1. Gender 
Gender is a social construct, in that one’s identity is not fixed, but rather fluid. ‘Gender’ as a 
construct is commonly misunderstood as the construct ‘sex.’ Gender refers to the socially 
“produced differences between being feminine and masculine” (Holmes, 2007 p. 2), whereas 
“sex refers to the biological differences between men and women” (ibid, 2007 p. 2).  The 
constructs of masculinity and femininity are not internalised through childhood socialisation, 
but are rather reconstructed via social interactions (Connell, 1987). Gender refers to the roles 
and responsibilities created by society that are assigned to men and women. As a result of the 
responsibilities and roles assigned to males and females, expectations are created regarding the 
aptitude, characters and behaviour of men and women. These gender roles and expectations are 
learned through one’s family, society and cultures (UNESCO, 2003). Gender is performed 
through one’s daily interactions and is therefore a socially constructed concept. West & 
Zimmermann (1987) have developed a construct of ‘doing gender’ as gender is not what one 
does, but how they act and behave, which manifests from social interactions. Gender is an 
important construct to consider in the study, as women are assigned responsibilities based on 
societal acceptance, however, it is not necessarily accurate. By viewing gender from this 
standpoint, there is an under emphasis on the institutional arrangements which construct gender 
relationships, therefore neglecting the political, economic and social advantages that current 
institutions award men. These institutions are developed by men and therefore possess the 
standpoint of men, directly disadvantaging women (Acker, 1992). 
Exploring gender in the study is significant as women are often encouraged to pursue careers 
which are more suitable and gender appropriated. These include nursing, home science and 
teaching, which has resulted in women being under-represented in high level education 
occupations (Baryeh, Obu, & Lamptey, 2000). Gender plays an essential role in the study of 
45 
 
female engineers as Faulkner (2007) highlights that engineers are expected to be men, therefore 
female engineers are a deviation both professionally and personally (Holth, 2014). 
Furthermore, women are pressured to ascribe to traditional female social norms which 
emphasise relationships in place of career goals, as well as to choose a ‘traditional’ female 
career. It is believed that women do not need to support their family’s financially and are 
therefore discouraged in investing in their career aspirations (Levinson, 1996). As a result, 
women neglect their academic aspirations to ascribe to their traditional feminine roles (Matyas, 
1996). Moreover, the media plays a vital role as the media and books usually perpetuate images 
of engineers and scientists to be men, hence female engineers are perceived as ‘atypical’ 
(Gallagher & Pearson, 2000).  
2.3.1.2 Race 
Race is also a socially constructed concept which one can physically observe. This indicator 
may be “imagined or observed bodily features presumed to be evidence of ancestral links to a 
certain geographical region” (Hanslanger, 2000 p. 43). These refer to the biological 
characteristics of an individual, however, as race is socially constructed, it is also defined by 
social interactions. Therefore, how an individual is perceived in society defines an individual’s 
racial group. Social constructions refer to society assigning characteristics to individuals who 
are classified in a certain racial group, this process is performed due to the socialisation and 
interaction processes that society is accustomed to. As result of such, racial stereotypes arise 
(Higginbotham & Anderson, 2006). Spickard (1992) postulates that multiracial individuals 
define race as a social construction. Therefore, race does not exist outside of the social world, 
and is not based on scientific or biological facts (Gaskins, 1999). Race as a social construction 
places emphasis on the individual’s role in society with regards to shaping their experiences 
and opportunities. Many studies have disregarded the biological characteristics of an individual 
46 
 
in terms of defining racial categories (Goodman, 2000; Seekings, 2008; Zack, 1995).  Shih, 
Bonam, Sanchez, & Peck (2007) state that individuals that interpret race as a social construct 
are more likely to believe that race is less informative about an individual’s innate traits and 
characteristics and therefore, are more likely to identify less strongly with their racial identity. 
Furthermore, Shih et al. (2007) states that early experiences associated with race play a role in 
an individual’s opinion and beliefs about race, therefore, their understanding of where racial 
differences come from.  
Due to South Africa’s past Apartheid ideology and the segregation of racial groups as well as 
current laws such as B-BBEE Act, South Africans still place emphasis on dividing themselves 
amongst their racial groups. Therefore, South African’s social worlds are largely characterised 
by racial groups and many continue to have negative views of other racial groups (Seekings, 
2008). However, the segregation of races is not only seen in South Africa, but also in Africa, 
the United States of America and Brazil to name a few (Seekings, 2008). Despite the 
movements to eliminate political, economic and social barriers for racial groups, society is still 
largely racialized according to Seekings (2008). Racial categorisation in terms of residences 
have largely remained unchanged since Apartheid (Seekings, 2008).  According to Walker 
(2005), the previous apartheid ideology has decreased in individual’s daily lives, however, has 
not been eliminated in society.  
South Africa’s past is characterised by the segregation of racial categories, where Black 
African citizens faced discrimination, while white citizens would be privileged economically 
in society. Better paid occupations and land were reserved for white citizens, which was further 
extended to better the education for white citizens. Furthermore, black citizens were restricted 
as to where they were allowed to work and live, which provided an advantage for white farmers 
as they were provided with black farmers without having to pay competitive wages (Seekings, 
47 
 
2008). During the 1970’s and 1980’s improvements began to occur in the labour market, 
educational systems and to remove other restrictions. However, the effects of Apartheid are 
that South Africans continue to view society in racialized terms. Furthermore, different racial 
groups define race differently, such as the white racial group will define race based on physical 
characteristics or descent, whereas, African and coloured South African’s refer to ‘culture’ 
(Seekings, 2008).   
Race is important to consider, especially in relation to South Africa’s segregated and 
discriminatory history. Various racial groups will experience the engineering field differently 
and possibly more challenging. This factor is based on their historical and cultural background. 
Various races need to be explored in order to view how the different races narrate their 
experiences.  
2.3.2 Intersectionality 
Kimberle Crenshaw (1993) coined the concept ‘intersectionality,’ however, numerous scholars 
during that period had also drawn attention to the limitations of highlighting and isolating race 
or gender as the primary category of difference, identity or disadvantage (Cole, 2009; Collins, 
1990; Hancock, 2007; Hurtado, 1989; Smith & Stewart, 1983). Crenshaw (1993) critiqued the 
emphasis on a single-axis framework for its emphasis on privileged members of inferior 
groups. The motive for Crenshaw’s analysis was to address the marginalisation of black women 
in antidiscrimination laws as well as feminist and antiracist theory and politics (Carbado, 
Crenshaw, Mays, & Tomlinson, 2013). Based on Crenshaw’s analysis, she stated that black 
women plaintiffs differed in experiences to others, as the women would sometimes experience 
discrimination similar to that of white women or otherwise black men, therefore black women 
would experience both racial and sexual discrimination. Additionally, these women would also 
48 
 
sometimes experience discrimination as Black Women, which constituted a different form of 
discrimination (Crenshaw, 1993). This therefore resulted in the analysis of how multiple social 
statuses may be experienced simultaneously, which led to the understanding of the limitations 
of using single-axis statuses such as gender or race, as these constructs function simultaneously 
in practice. However, intersectionality is not a theory of difference but rather a theory of 
oppression (""“We’re all just different!” How Intersectionality is Being Colonized by White 
People"", 2017). Furthermore, intersectionality is central to the “study of inequality, identity 
and power relations” (Cho, Crenshaw & McCall, as cited in Rodriguez et al., 2016). Power 
relations arise as once these constructs are analysed collectively, differing forms of 
marginalisation may occur, as noted by Crenshaw’s study of black women. However, members 
of inferior social groups also possess advantaged identities, such as middle-class blacks or 
white women. Therefore, intersectionality does not only analyse the dimensions of inferior 
groups but also how privileged groups are understood (Cole, 2009). The intersectionality of 
these constructs shapes the experiences of the individual (Hooks, 1981; Spelman, 1988). 
Intersectionality aims to create emancipation through social change. This is achieved by 
analysing the numerous manners in which social structures create and entrench marginalisation 
and power as well as draw attention to the way in which current paradigms produce knowledge 
which often function to normalise these dynamics (Carbado et al., 2013).  
The social categories of race and gender are pivotal to study, as previously marginalised racial 
groups have not had the same experiences as white women. Intersectionality is important to 
this particular study, as women are marginalised in the engineering field, however, there is a 
possibility that double marginalisation may occur when the social construct ‘race’ intersects. 
(Rodriguez, Holvino, Fletcher, & Nkomo, 2016). The recognition of multiple social categories 
results in multiple forms of discrimination, as opposed to single axes of discrimination and 
49 
 
therefore acknowledges that individuals can be discriminated against on the basis of more than 
one social category (Kantola & Nousiasinen, 2009). The intersection of race and gender 
informs the experiences of an individual (Hooks, 1981; Spelman, 1988).  
2.3.4 Theoretical Relevance to the Study 
This study adopts the social constructionist view that women in the engineering profession 
have rejected the traditional gender roles prevalent in society, therefore, demonstrate agency 
by reacting and challenging the changing roles in the South African society. Due to the 
intersectional framework also being utilised, multiple identities which women constitute of are 
analysed. Therefore, the female engineers are not considered absolute, but their various 
identities inherent in them, such as race and gender are analysed. These multiple identities are 
investigated in a manner that provides the researcher with the knowledge of how these multiple 
identities intersect with each other to inform the experiences of the individual.  
2.4. Conclusion 
In summary, there are various legislations that have been implemented in South Africa post-
Apartheid to overcome the injustices of the past. However, women remain outnumbered in the 
engineering industry and minimal change has taken place since the legislations have been 
implemented. Additionally, contemporary organisations still have the ‘ideal worker’ ideology 
which formulates hindrances for females to progress in male-dominated occupations such as 
engineering. These become more complex when females enter motherhood and are required to 
balance being an employee and a mother. Therefore, certain industries such as engineer favour 
male employees due to the commitment that males are able to provide, as opposed to women 
– creating a discriminatory environment. Females also experience workplace challenges when 
exposed to the engineering environment. These experiences are not only experienced in the 
50 
 
workplace but also when females pursue their studies in a male-dominated environment. These 
challenges become more prominent for Black women. However, these challenges are not 
experienced by all women and has been acknowledged that some women do not experience 
such hindrances, therefore, these experiences cannot be generalised to all women. However, 
certain characteristics and factors also play a role in female engineer’s persistence in the 
industry. Lastly, there are various strategies that women employ in order to overcome the 
hindrances of the engineering environment. The two theoretical frameworks utilised in the 
current study have been discussed, which includes Social Constructionism and 
Intersectionality. Social Constructionism has been utilised as female engineers have rejected 
the common gendered discourse by entering into a male dominated field, therefore, the current 
study aims to understand the discourse surrounding female engineers. Due to the study focusing 
on the factors race and gender, intersectionality aims to understand how the two constructs 
merge and diverge in the experiences of female engineers.

Chapter Three 
Methodology 
3.1 Introduction 
This chapter highlights the research questions utilised in the study and defines the research 
design that was most applicable to the study. Additionally, the relevant sample and sampling 
procedure was also outlined. The participants’ demographics have been outlined and tabulated. 
Furthermore, the data collection procedure and data analysis methods have also been 
emphasised. Thereafter, the ethical considerations that were adhered to are also outlined.  
3.2 Research Questions 
1) How do female engineers narrate their experiences of the engineering field? 
2) What challenges do women face in a workplace that is male dominated? 
3) How does gender and race shape the experiences of female engineers? 
4) What are the implications of these experiences on the women’s well-being and 
personal, relational, cultural and social identities? 
3.3 Research Design 
A qualitative approach has been used in this research in order to uncover the “how” and “why” 
questions exploring how female engineers construct their identities in what is considered a 
masculine environment. This allows for an explanatory approach to be undertaken, as opposed 
to the descriptive manner inherent in quantitative research (Liedle, 2008). A qualitative 
approach was adopted for this study due to the nature of the study, as the study focuses on the 
lived experiences of female engineers (Neuman, 2011). Qualitative research is a means for 
exploring and understanding the meaning individuals or groups assign to a human or social 
52 
 
issue. The focus of qualitative research is the participant in their natural setting and how the 
participants make sense of their lived reality without negating the complexities in their lives 
(Creswell, 2009). Qualitative research allows for an interpretative approach, which permits the 
researcher to make sense and provide meaning of the female engineer’s daily lives in a male-
dominated environment (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003). It is relevant to this study as it aims to 
understand the female engineers’ social and cultural circumstances in their everyday 
interactions, revealing complexities inherent in the women’s lived experienced (Philip, 1998). 
As the nature of the study is qualitative, face to face interviews were conducted (Myers, 2009). 
Aligned with the social constructionism paradigm, a constructivist approach was selected for 
this study. A constructivist approach argues that many constructions of reality are possible, due 
to the subjective nature of each participant’s reality. These constructions are based on the 
participant’s reality and therefore shaped by their social and historical background. The 
constructivist approach emphasises the subjectivity of the participant’s nature, resulting in 
multiple realities. In addition, it focuses on hermeneutics and dialectics, as the hermeneutics 
aspect aims to depict the participants constructions of their lived reality. Whereas, the dialectic 
aspect attempts to compare and contrast the participants and researcher’s constructions in order 
to confront these constructions. This aims to produce an informed construction. Therefore, 
constructivism intends to reconstruct the reality that exists for the participants, rather than 
intending to control or predict reality (Guba, 1990).  
As the study focuses on the narratives of female engineers of numerous racial categories, 
qualitative research will be conducted, as it aims to study the everyday lives of female 
engineers. Qualitative research allows for an interpretative approach, which permits the 
researcher to make sense and provide meaning of the female engineer’s daily lives in a male-
dominated environment (Denzin & Lincoln, 2003).  
53 
 
3.4. Population and Sampling Strategy 
The sampling strategy that was selected was non-probability purposive sampling. Purposive 
sampling allows the researcher to select participants that will provide value to the study, 
therefore explicit variables were selected in order for the participants to provide the greatest 
value to the study.  The explicit variables that were selected were gender (females), qualified 
engineers, various racial groups (Black African; Coloured; Indian and White), employed as an 
engineer for a minimum of 2 years; and above the age of 23 (Neuman, 2011). Purposive 
sampling allows the researcher to identify and select individuals that have the acquired 
knowledge and experience necessary for the study, therefore it was most applicable to the study 
as certain characteristics needed to be met (Cresswell, & Plano Clark, 2011). Furthermore, 
snowball sampling was used as the interviewees would refer the researcher to another possible 
participants who met the criteria (Palinkas, Horwitz, Green, Wisdom, Duan, & Hogwood, 
2015).

3.4.1 Demographics of Participants 
Table 2: Demographics of Participants 
All the women in the study were currently employed as engineers. As the study focuses on 
female engineers of the four major racial categories in South Africa, the sample consisted of 
nine female engineers: 3 White female engineers; 3 Indian female engineers; 2 Black African 
female engineers and 1 Coloured female engineer. The female engineers were of varied age 
groups. The sample was also dispersed in terms of the engineering disciplines that the female 
engineers pursued. Married and non-married women were included in order to provide the 
study with varied experiences. Additionally, one participant had children which provides the 
study with a varied experience based on being a mother and an engineer.  
3.4.2 Position of the Researcher 
My position in the study is an outsider, however, the commonality between myself and the 
participants was that I identified as a woman. Therefore, I have similar worldviews and tensions 
as the female engineers. However, I am an outsider in that I have not experienced the patriarchal 
engineering environment. I am a 23-year-old Psychology graduate and therefore do not have

knowledge surrounding the technicalities of the engineering profession. I am also not married, 
nor do I have children. Therefore, when analysing the narrations of the female engineers of 
various ethnic and racial groups, critical reflection needed to take place. Additionally, during 
the interviews, I would paraphrase and summarise what the participant had said in order to 
clarify any discrepancies.  
3.5 Data Collection and Procedure 
In line with qualitative research, the study used in-depth semi-structured interviews to conduct 
the data collection.  The method makes use of an interview schedule that directs the participants 
discussion around specific issues topics (Whitley, 2002). By using semi-structured interviews, 
a degree of flexibility is permitted, so that the researcher and participant can engage in 
narratives with a degree of flexibility, in which the researcher is able to probe important and 
interesting areas that the participants are able to generate light onto (Smith & Osborne, 2007). 
Furthermore, the participants are able to represent their reality and how they make sense of 
their reality, by providing narrations of their lived experiences (Smith & Osborne, 2007). The 
interview schedule is used as a guide rather than a set instrument that needs to be followed. 
Semi-structured interviews allow for the participants to provide their own subjective 
interpretation of their reality, which is important as it allows agency and a sense of control over 
their lives (Rappaport, 1990).  
Individual face to face interviews were conducted with seven of the female engineers at various 
sites. One of the interviews was conducted via Skype; another telephonically, due to the 
location of the participant. The initial interviewees referred the researcher to other participants 
and if the criteria were met, those participants were interviewed. Each interview lasted 
56 
 
approximately an hour to an hour and a half. The interviews were conducted at a venue that 
was suitable for the participants, hence, varied venues were utilised.  
3.6 Data Analysis Method 
Interviews were initiated, recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed through systematic 
procedures (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). These included research questions, participant responses 
and my experience in the interviews. The analysis of the data was guided by the four main 
research questions: (1) How do female engineers narrate their experiences of the engineering 
field? (2) What challenges do women face in a workplace that is male dominated? (3) How 
does gender and race shape the experiences of female engineers? (4) What are the implications 
of these experiences on the women’s well-being and personal, relational, cultural and social 
identities? These questions provided a framework for the interview process.  
Each interview was audio recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim by the researcher. The 
interview transcripts were read and coded for themes that were related to the research questions 
and the theoretical frameworks utilised.  
Various data analysis techniques are available in qualitative research; however, the thematic 
analysis technique was adopted due to its alignment with the social constructionist paradigm. 
Thematic analysis is also often used in a realist or experiential method; however, it is also 
compatible with constructionist and essential paradigms in psychology. The reason thematic 
analysis is compatible with the social constructionist paradigm, and this study is that it 
examines the manner in which meanings, realities and experiences are a result of the discourses 
that are prevalent in society (Braun & Clark, 2006). Additionally, “through its theoretical 
freedom, thematic analysis provides a flexible and useful research tool, which can potentially 
provide a rich and detailed, yet complex, account of data” (Braun & Clark, 2006, p. 78). 
57 
 
Thematic analysis is a method that identifies, analyses and reports patterns, also known as 
themes in the data. Therefore, it entails describing the data in detail, as themes emerge from 
the data. Thematic analysis is applicable to various theoretical frameworks, and is therefore, 
not restricted to one specific theoretical framework as opposed to the other data analysis 
methods (IPA or grounded theory), allowing the analysis method to coincide with the social 
constructionist paradigm (Braun & Clark, 2006).  
In order to perform a thematic analysis, the voice recordings need to be transferred into a 
verbatim written form, such as a transcript. The transcription of the voice recordings allowed 
the researcher to immerse themselves in the data before the analysis began, as a more thorough 
understanding was formed of the data (Braun & Clark, 2006).  
Braun & Clark (2006) state that there are six steps or phases when analysing data using a 
thematic analysis.  
Phase 1: Familiarising yourself with the data: this phase allowed for the researcher to immerse 
themselves in the data in order to understand the depth of the content. Therefore, the transcripts 
were read repeatedly in order to find meanings and patterns. 
Phase 2: Generating Initial Codes: once the familiarisation of the data and a list of initial ideas 
are formed, the production of initial codes took place. Therefore, the data was organised into 
meaningful groups and codes which are relevant to the research question (Braun & Clark, 2006; 
Tuckett, 2005). However, it must be noted that, this organisation phase is different to the 
generation of themes phase.  
Phase 3: Searching for Themes: once a list has been generated of different codes, this phase 
involved analysing the data for broader themes, therefore, sorting the codes into potential 
58 
 
themes and placing the relevant extracts or data in each theme. During this stage, the coded 
data was placed into broader themes and sub-themes, as well as various codes were discarded 
due to the inapplicability to the study.  
Phase 4: Reviewing Themes: based on the themes established in phase 3, the themes were 
refined, which involves discarding themes or merging themes into one. A pattern needed to be 
formed here in which the extracts collate with the themes, therefore, some themes were refined 
in order to create a more suitable theme for the data. The data was re-read in order to ensure 
that all data has been coded correctly and to ensure that no additional data has been missed.  
Phase 5: Defining and Naming themes: this phase involved understanding what each theme 
meant and which aspect of the data the theme captures. Therefore, a detailed analysis is 
implemented in which a story is formed regarding each theme. Sub-themes are also established 
during this stage. The themes and sub-themes were given appropriate names in relation to the 
data.  
Phase 6: Producing the Report: this phase allowed the researcher to relay the data to the reader 
in an interesting and coherent manner and in relation to the research questions.  
3.7. Ensuring Rigour 
Due to the complexity of qualitative research it is pertinent to the quality of the research that 
rigour is ensured throughout the research process. However, as qualitative research is largely 
subjective and is based on the narratives of the participants, ensuring rigour is more complex 
in qualitative research than in quantitative research. Quantitative researchers rely on numbers 
and statistics to determine the rigour of the research, which is not applicable to qualitative 
research (Cypress, 2017). Establishing rigour ensures that the research is both valid and 
59 
 
reliable, however, relating to qualitative research. Therefore, the quantitative measures to 
provide validity and reliability cannot be applied to qualitative research and need to be tailored 
to the research design. Despite the complexity of ensuring rigour in the qualitative research, in 
order to prove the quality of the research, rigour should be ensured throughout the entire 
research process, these are usually proven using four elements, which include: credibility, 
transferability, dependability and confirmability (Cypress, 2017).  
Credibility: Credibility refers to the interpretation of the data and whether the researcher has 
interpreted the participants narratives and views correctly, subsequently depicting an accurate 
portrait of the participants perspective and narrative (Anney, 2014). There are various strategies 
that can be utilised to determine the credibility of the research. The form of credibility that was 
used in the current research was triangulation. Triangulation has been used to determine the 
credibility of the research, as the researcher used multiple methods to formulate diverse 
perspectives. This method is used to reduce researcher bias. The manner which triangulation 
was used in the current research is that the researcher made use of a variety of participants from 
various workplaces, industries etc. The participants were also from diverse backgrounds, age 
groups and racial groups. By making use of a variety of participants, diverse perspectives were 
uncovered, hence, reducing the bias of the researcher (Anney, 2014; Shenton, 2004). 
Triangulation was also used as various sites were also used for the interviews, therefore, 
various organisations were utilised, providing a diverse basis for perspectives (Shenton, 2004).   
Transferability: Transferability refers to the extent in which the research results can be 
transferred to a different context (Bitsch, 2005; Tobin & Begley, 2004; Anney, 2014). By 
utilising purposive sampling, the research results are able to be transferred to a different 
context, as the sample group has been chosen based on answering specific research questions, 
based on a specific purpose. By using purposive sampling, the researcher is able to gain 
60 
 
knowledge that is specific to the research topic from participants that are knowledgeable about 
the topic. Therefore, female engineers were selected in the sample, that had at least two years’ 
experience as an engineer. The female engineers were chosen for a specific purpose and 
therefore, when using the same sample, the research should yield the same results if transferred 
to a different setting (Anney, 2014).  
Dependability: Dependability can be likened to the term ‘reliability’ in quantitative research. 
Hence, can be noted as the reliability and consistency of the research findings (Moon, Brewer, 
Januchowski-Hartley, Adams, & Blackman, 2016). The recordings of the participants 
interviews were initially listened to, to form the interview setting again. Once all the recordings 
were replayed, the transcription phase began. The recordings were then compared to the 
transcriptions to determine if there were any missing ques, which helped the researcher to 
replay the initial interview with the participant in the researcher’s mind. This essentially 
assisted in the analysis phase, as the researcher had a clear understanding of the interview 
process and had highlighted any factors that were missed during the collection of the data. A 
table was also formulated highlighting the codes of the analysis, which assisted the researcher 
in linking any themes that emerged from the data. This allowed the researcher to easily analyse 
the different narratives across all the participants and to highlight any themes. These themes 
were reviewed to determine the applicability to the research questions and topics (Krefting, 
1991).  
Confirmability: Confirmability refers to how the conclusions can be derived from the results. 
Therefore, a process can easily be followed to determine how the researcher derived the 
conclusion (Moon, Brewer, Januchowski-Hartley, Adams, & Blackman, 2016). The manner 
which confirmability was achieved was by keeping a research journal. This allowed the 
researcher to be self-reflexive throughout the process and to eliminate any biases. After each 
61 
 
interview researcher notes were made during the interview, which were incorporated into the 
analysis of the findings. This can be likened to an ‘audit trail’ in which the interview recordings 
were transcribed, as well as additional notes were made on the interview process, eliminating 
any researcher bias.  
3.8. Ethical Considerations 
The Higher Degrees Committee of the Faculty of Humanities, Development and Social 
Sciences at the University of KwaZulu-Natal granted the researcher permission to conduct the 
study, as an ethical approval was secured from the Ethics Committee of UKZN 
(HSS/0395/017M) (Appendix B). Each participant was approached individually for their 
permission to participate in the study. Each participant approved their participation by signing 
an informed consent form (Appendix C and D). 
At the outset of each interview, the aims and objectives of the study were relayed to each 
participant. Participants were also fully aware of their right to withdraw from the study at any 
stage if they felt the need to. As the form of data collection was interviews, the anonymity of 
each participant was guaranteed. Confidentiality was guaranteed to all participants, each 
participant was informed that their responses will be used but their names would be changed 
into pseudonyms, in order to protect their identity. Participants were interviewed at their 
convenience, at time and place that would be most suitable for the participant.  
3.9. Conclusion 
The methodology adopted in the current study is qualitative research, as the researcher attempts 
to understand the lived experiences of female engineers and how their race and gender intersect 
and the impact of such on their experiences. The Methodology chapter explains the use of a 
qualitative design as well as justifies the applicability of qualitative research for the current 
62 
 
study. The sample has also been discussed and justified per the current study, as purposive 
sampling was used due to the applicability to the study. Semi-structured interviews were used 
as the method is flexible to provide rich data. When analysing the data, the researcher used a 
Thematic Analysis data analysis method, as it was the most appropriate to the current study. 
The manner in which rigour has been ensured was explained, as well as the ethical 
considerations for the current study.

Chapter Four 
Results and Discussion 
4.1. Introduction 
The findings of the research were categorised into three fundamental themes. The first theme 
includes the negotiation of the Intersection of Multiple Identities. This theme uncovers how the 
female engineers negotiate the intersection of the multiple identities in which they possess, 
which include a: Negotiating a Personal and Professional Identity; Social, Relational and 
Professional Identity; Deconstructing Race and Gender; The Role of Motherhood; and lastly, 
the implications of the engineering environment to the female’s well-being. The second 
fundamental theme, Mediating the Two Extremes, uncovers the participants narratives in 
relation to the two extremes in which are experienced in the engineering workplace, the two 
extremes include, ‘standing out as female’ and ‘one of the boys.’ The participants’ narratives 
and experience of the two extremes are analysed and uncovered. As the two extremes contradict 
each other, these will be analysed in accordance to the female engineer’s experience. The last 
theme, Proving Yourself uncovers the varied narratives of proving yourself as a female 
engineer, and proving yourself as an engineer. The final part of the chapter includes a summary 
of the results found in the participants narratives.  
4.2 Negotiating the Intersection of Multiple Identities 
The female engineers narrated their various identities, however, these identities are not unified, 
but rather intercept with one another to form complexities and varied experiences in the females 
lives. Hence, the women do not only possess the identity of being a female, but also other 
varied identities which impact on their experiences as a female engineer. The female engineers 
commented on the role of their professional identity intersecting with their other identities, 
64 
 
which include their social, relational, personal and cultural identities. The female engineers 
also commented on the implications of their professional identity on their well-being.  
4.2.1 Negotiating a Personal and Professional Identity 
A pattern was formulated amongst the participants narratives in which their personal identity 
would inform their professional identity and vice versa. A common theme emerged amongst 
the female engineer’s narratives, which illustrated how the female engineers would have to 
find means to allow for the engineering environment to be effective for them. A few of the 
women would report that they would need to find ways to adapt to the environment, as a means 
to survive and thrive in the engineering sector. This indicates that there are characteristics or 
strategies needed to be adopted to succeed. In addition, five of the participants evaluated the 
impact of the engineering environment on their personal identity, as they proclaimed that the 
environment has ‘toughened’ and ‘created a thicker skin for them.’ Therefore, illustrating the 
influence of their professional identity on their personal identity. This was illustrated in 
Olivia’s narrative, in which she comments on the enabling characteristics to succeed: 
“…its male dominated but I would encourage females to go into it, there’s actually nothing, 
there’s no disadvantages being a female in there, in fact I think it makes you stronger. Ya, it 
makes you stronger, more resilient and you can survive at any time, I mean if you can be the 
only female all the time and hardly notice it anymore, and be just as strong as the guys, ya it 
definitely makes you stronger. But I would also say it’s not for everybody, like for females, you 
need to be tough, to go in there.” 
This was further illustrated by two other participants:  
Arianna: “…it takes a bit of getting used to and uh, like you have to get a bigger, thicker skin…” 
65 
 
Valerie: “So it really has created that thick skin sort of you know what its fine, I’ll do it, I’m no 
longer emotional about it.” 
Interestingly, Arianna notes that the engineering environment requires her to adapt, however, 
she asserts in her narrative that being an engineer has not affected her personal life or changed 
the way she is outside of the engineering industry.  
As noted in the above excerpts, female engineers are often required to adopt certain 
characteristics to enable them to survive and thrive in the engineering environment, as a result 
of the highly masculinised culture. These characteristics are usually associated with males; and 
so, the women would adopt masculine characteristics. This can be likened to Palermo’s (2004) 
study, as she reports on the incompatibility of the women’s sex role characteristics in 
managerial positions. She illustrates that these roles are infiltrated by stereotypically masculine 
characteristics, which include independence, aggression and dominance. As a result, women 
are assigned job roles that are compatible with their feminine characteristics and are therefore 
unsuitable for managerial positions. Hence, as illustrated by the participants, women would 
need to adopt and learn these masculine characteristics in order to conform to the engineering 
environment. This is amplified in Bastalich et al.’s (2007) study, as the authors note how those 
that do not conform to the masculine norms, are considered ‘foreign’ and ‘outsiders.’ 
In addition, two participants have also made reference to being ‘forceful’ and ‘assertive’ in the 
engineering industry, which illustrates that these ‘masculine’ characteristics should be acquired 
in the engineering industry: 
Emily: “… again, it’s a case of you have to learn to be forceful…”  
66 
 
Valerie: “…No it is but you really have to be assertive, it has been but it’s also made me grow 
as a person in terms of asserting myself…” 
As women are in the minority in the engineering sector, it is unsurprising that the engineering 
environment enforces ‘masculine’ characteristics, which women learn and adopt in order to ‘fit 
in’ with the culture. This is affirmed by Faulkner (2009) as she postulates that the largest group 
will determine the culture of the organisation, hence, as the engineering industry is male-
dominated, these men seem to dictate the culture of the organisation. As a result, the group that 
is in the minority is required to adapt and to ‘fit in’ to the predetermined culture in order to 
create a sense of belonging.  
Furthermore, Valerie elaborates on having to adopt the ‘assertiveness’ characteristic as a Black 
African female, as she notes that the ‘masculine’ characteristics need to be pronounced further. 
Valerie notes that being a female is challenging on its own, however, being a black female adds 
another dimension: 
Valerie: “…I think that it’s much more intense if you black and female, you really now have 
to, cause I have  seen other black guys who also have to really be assertive to get their point 
across, so you can only imagine how difficult it is then if you a female first, cause I’ve seen 
other white females having to be assertive when they talking to their male counterparts like 
okay, male white people, so now you have a combination  of both, you female and you black, 
so its 5 times harder for you basically, so you really have to be assertive and it is because you 
female and it is because you black.” 
Gibson & Espino’s (2016) study affirms that their undergraduate engineering student 
participants experienced similar challenges as black females, due to the stereotypes that are 
moulded for black females, as the women experience double minorities, being a female and 
67 
 
being black. Based on these double minority identities that black females possess, their 
experiences become more complex, as illustrated by Valerie. Valerie’s narrative demonstrates 
the intersectionality of varied identities which female engineers possess, as she comments on 
her race and gender influencing her experiences as a female engineer, illustrating Crenshaw’s 
(1993) statement of multiple identities being experienced simultaneously. Hence, identities 
cannot be viewed in isolation, nor can they operate in isolation, as illustrated by Valerie.  
Furthermore, the characteristics that female engineers are required to learn as well as assert in 
the engineering sector become normalised and internalised in the engineering environment and 
are therefore appropriated as reported in Palermo’s (2004) study. However, these qualities may 
not be normalised in the individual’s personal identity (as a female), as it is learnt behaviour, 
as noted by Emily and Valerie. 
Emily: “…like we have had shouting matches in front of other people and I’m like I just 
actually don’t care, for me that’s unprofessional but I’m like this is my area, these are my 
boundaries, you will maintain and I will not keep quiet. Buts that also horrible because then 
you constantly forced to this space where this is not how I deal with things, that’s not how I 
approach a situation, but you have to engage in like the male mindset to get them to 
understand…” 
Based on Emily’s excerpt, it is evident that Emily is forced into an approach which she may 
not be comfortable with, however, she asserts that this behaviour which is required in the 
engineering environment. This illustrates Faulkner’s (2009) statement of the minority group 
being required to adopt to the dominant culture of the organisation. Furthermore, gendered 
behaviour becomes entrenched in male-dominated organisations, and therefore, women have 
to adapt to such behaviour. When the accepted gendered behaviour is deviated against, 
68 
 
discipline will take place. Therefore, female engineers are ‘forced’ into acquiring the 
acceptable behaviour to avoid criticism and subjugation (Anderson, 2004).  
Additionally, Emily asserts that constant strategizing is required in order to engage in the male 
mindset: 
Emily: “…. its strategizing all the time, you can’t just be and go and we not a team. And its 
watching your back and trying to find out what else is happening…” 
By engaging in the ‘male mindset,’ Emily illustrates that female engineers are required to 
engage in the dominant mindset, and are therefore, required to adapt to the pre-existing culture. 
Similarly, Valerie reports on the implications of the acquired behaviour on her personal 
identity:  
“…I’m no longer emotional about it, I know this is how it is and not just there at work but even 
outside here in the world you really have to know like, not everyone is kind, not everyone is 
always going to be nice. Having that confidence now that I have now, that I didn’t have in the 
beginning, will, is what’s going to help me deal with all of this nonsense.” 
Valerie and Emily’s excerpt affirms Bastalich et al.’s (2007) study, as the authors comment on 
women depersonalising emotions and recognising the feelings of the males in order to succeed 
in the industry. Based on the above excerpts and experiences of the female engineers it is 
evident that a few of the participants conform and internalise traditional masculine behaviour. 
This can be likened to the notion of ‘doing gender’ by West and Zimmermann (1987). From a 
social constructionist point of view, participants engage in appropriate masculine 
characteristics such as, ‘assertiveness’, ‘aggressiveness’, ‘engaging in the male mindset’ and 
‘forcefulness.’ Therefore, due to the masculinised culture of the engineering environment, 
69 
 
‘doing gender’ requires the participants to adopt a ‘masculine identity’ in order to perpetuate 
the status quo of the masculinised engineering environment. As the women are adopting 
‘masculine’ characteristics these may not be considered appropriate behaviour for women and 
is therefore, learnt behaviour, forcing women into a space which they may not be comfortable 
with as noted by Emily. Valerie and Emily also note the inappropriateness of ‘feminine 
characteristics,’ as Valerie states, how she is ‘no longer emotional about it,’ and Emily asserts 
that ‘you can’t take it personally.’ Therefore, in order to conform to the engineering 
environment and to be a successful engineer, characteristics that are perceived as feminine are 
counterproductive in the engineering environment, as illustrated by Palermo (2004). However, 
by doing so, a divide is formed which perpetuates gender inequality (Lahiri-Dutt & Macintyre, 
2006). In addition, Robinson (1991) states that to be “taken as an engineer is to look like an 
engineer, talk like an engineer, and act like an engineer” (p. 406), illustrating why the female 
engineers tend to adopt masculine characteristics in order to succeed in the engineering 
environment and to be taken seriously. Furthermore, Emily, Maskell-Pretz and Hopkins (1997) 
affirm that women are uncomfortable when adopting aggressive and assertive characteristics, 
as by doing so, a devaluation of the women’s feminine attributes takes place. In line with this, 
Faulkner (2009b) postulates that despite the fact that women are highly visible as women in 
the engineering environment, they need to become invisible as women by downplaying their 
feminine characteristics and adopt these ‘masculine’ characteristics, which Jorgenson (2002) 
labels as, ‘disqualifying femininity.’  
Olivia’s notes this in her narrative, as she states that the appropriated workplace behaviour 
extends into her personal identity, which has a negative effect on her personal life: 
Olivia: “…I find that sometimes I’m overly aggressive, where the punishment doesn’t fit the 
crime, maybe because I’m still on that mode, that work mode…” 
70 
 
Olivia: “And I think that’s directly related to being in that field where constantly, where its 
allowed and encouraged and not seen as being strange, to be openly aggressive and feisty. So, 
because it’s a natural part of me I am openly so, like that at work, and we at work a lot of the 
time, I mean 8 hours a day, Monday to Friday so I’m usually like that and it’s difficult to just 
switch it off…” 
Olivia makes reference to the ‘aggressive’ behaviour that is normalised and encouraged in the 
engineering environment. As this behaviour is considered appropriate in the engineering 
environment, Olivia internalises this behaviour in her personal identity, which has formed 
complexities for herself pertaining to the relationships in which she engages in. Furthermore, 
Olivia experiences dichotomous feminine and masculine behaviour, as there is a tendency for 
her to negotiate a balance between masculine and feminine behaviour. These tensions have 
been experienced by female managers as they often experience tension in negotiating an 
intermedium between the dichotomous behaviours, as with Olivia’s narrative (Palermo, 2004). 
In addition, as masculine traits such as self-reliance, detachment and independence are 
infiltrated in the engineering industry, women experience dichotomy pertaining to whether they 
should adopt such characteristics, in fear of losing their femininity, as experienced by Olivia 
(Seymour & Hewitt, 1997).   
Based on the experiences that the females have had, many have noted the effects of the 
experiences on their personal identity. Most of the participants would have a positive stance on 
the implications of engineering environment which would motivate and encourage them to 
build own their own personal characteristics, in order to assist them in succeeding further. 
These characteristics include, developing myself (Sumitha), builds character (Valerie) and 
confidence (Emily). Moreover, an effective strategy that was evident in the literature was 
becoming ‘one of the boys,’ therefore, adopting masculine characteristics in order to create a 
71 
 
sense of belonging to the engineering culture, which ultimately affects the experiences of the 
engineers.  
4.2.2 Social, Relational and Professional Identity 
Many of the participants acknowledged that their social role was not affected by being a female 
engineer. Therefore, the participants were able to fulfil their social roles to the standard in 
which they preferred.  
One of the participants noted that being an engineer does not have as much impact on her life 
as one would imagine:   
Olivia: “The impact is not as big as what people would think because I know a lot of the time 
people get shocked that you an engineer and a female and thinking, yoh, what’s your world 
like, it’s pretty normal.” 
A stigma is formed around engineers lacking a social life (Gibson, & Espino, 2016), which 
Olivia confirms, as she asserts that even family members tend to believe that she will not have 
time for them due to her being an engineer. However, this was not evident in the participants’ 
narratives, as the majority of the participants acknowledged that they are able to fulfil the social 
life which they preferred. In addition, the participants asserted that their professional identity 
did not impact their social life as much as society would expect. Despite the majority of the 
participants asserting the lack of impact of their professional identity on their social identity, 
one of the participants stated that she does become discouraged to participate in social events, 
as a result of the challenges that she faces in the engineering environment. Hence, her 
professional identity of a female engineer plays a role on her social identity.  
Emily: “…. finding the energy to go out and socialise you like arg, I’d rather sit on the couch 
72 
 
and sleep, that plays a role.”  
As many of the participants’ social identity was not affected, it should be noted that many of 
the participants worked at companies that allowed for flexi-time, therefore, allowing the 
engineers freedom to choose their own hours, enabling their social life. Thus, the type of 
engineering industry may have played a role in the women’s social identity. An individual’s 
social identity constitutes of their belonging to a social group based on common characteristics 
(Tajfel, 1978). However, in this study social identity refers to the social identities and activities 
that one engages in outside of the engineering workplace, which includes the social activities 
that the female engineers involve themselves in.  
In addition, the stigma that is associated with engineers having a poor social life is evident in 
Garcia and Espino’s (2016) study on engineering students. The authors state that women in 
engineering are perceived as women that have a lack of self-care, wear glasses and do not have 
a social life, illustrating the stigma that surrounds engineers.  
Additionally, the majority of the participants asserted that the company was understanding 
towards the various social roles in which they maintain and therefore their professional identity 
had not influenced their social life. However, the social roles that women partook in apart from 
being an engineer influenced their professional identity, as the participants acknowledged that 
the social roles that they were involved in allowed for them to form and maintain relationships 
which enabled them to progress in their career: 
Emily: “…I think those roles, I think it’s a nice way to connect with other people.” 
This was shared by three of the participants, as their social lives allowed for the women to 
enable relationships that would be beneficial to their professional identity, as these 
relationships would allow them to network and form bonds with others that will be 
73 
 
advantageous in their career. These bonds and networks that the women form can assist them 
in terms of career advancement, as they are able to form mentoring networks which could 
ultimately assist in their career progression (Maskell-Pretz & Hopkins, 1997). These informal 
networks are especially important for female engineers to engage in, as the male-dominated 
culture of the engineering sector often does not allow for females to be included in these 
informal networks, as they are often controlled by men (du Plessis & Barkhuizen, 2012).  
Furthermore, the field of engineered is deemed ‘prestigious’, which was reported by many of 
the participants. As engineering is awarded such a status, this played a role in the female 
engineer’s social identity, as they are often considered role models in their communities, 
families and neighbourhoods. This was prevalent in the Black African, Coloured and Indian 
female engineer’s narratives, which was interesting as the literature notes that white females 
and black females chose careers in engineering for differed reasons. White female students 
would often choose engineering due to their innate abilities of mathematics and science, 
whereas black females chose engineering due to the opportunities to serve the community 
(Jawitz & Case, 1998). Therefore, as Black African female engineers were seen as role models 
and this allows for their purpose to be achieved.  
As a result of the status that surrounds the field of engineering, the majority of the participants 
did not experience resistance when pursuing engineering as a career, except for one of the 
Indian female participants who experienced racial and cultural resistance, however, continued 
to persist.  
Arianna: “Ya, so that’s why, they sometimes have this, their own uh, uh, whatever they have in 
their head, status thing or whatever, so ya engineering, it’s not, they didn’t have a problem, 
like issues with engineering…” 
It is interesting to note how many of the participants postulated that they are seen as role 
74 
 
models, as much of the literature have noted the importance of role models in retaining female 
engineers in the industry (Chubin, May, & Babco, 2005; Gallaher & Pearson, 2000; Rosenberg-
Kima et al., 2010; Seymour & Hewitt, 1997; Sonnert, 1999; Tang, 1997). In addition, many of 
the participants have explained the lack of female presence in the engineering industry. As 
many of the participants acknowledged their role model status, this seems to elevate their status 
in their communities. Furthermore, many of the participants acknowledged the increase in 
female presence in the engineering industry. By their presence as women and persistence in 
the industry they are able to provide mentorship for the ‘graduate’ female engineers that are 
entering the industry, which will hopefully retain the female engineers. In addition, the increase 
of female presence may also encourage females to pursue engineering and eliminate the 
competency doubts that females may have when choosing a career (Lyon, 2009). It should be 
noted, however, that only certain industries such as chemical and civil engineering had 
experienced an increase in female presence. It has also been noted by Etzkowitz, Kemelgor 
and Uzzi (2000) how gender-related barriers may discourage females from persisting as 
engineers. These barriers include the lack of role models and social isolation, however, as the 
women have asserted that they have made a difference in their communities and families, a 
positive effect manifests for the future generation of female engineers. As women are perceived 
as role models, this can assist in female engineers experiencing the ‘glass ceiling,’ as it has 
been asserted that it is easier for others to relate with people whom are similar to themselves 
(Palermo, 2004). Lo and Ramayah (2011) postulate that females are more inclined to be better 
mentors, due to their patience, caring nature and innovativeness. Increasing the female presence 
will not only allow for mentorship, but also an increase in informal networks amongst the 
females, increasing opportunities for growth in the organisation (Smith & Dengiz, 2010). 
Gibson and Espino (2016) also note in their study the importance of role models for their 
participants. This was especially true for the Black female engineers, as they believed that not 
75 
 
having a Black female role model was frustrating, due to the lack of understanding of the 
complexities of being a Black and a female.  
Although the majority of the female engineers did not report the intersection of their 
professional identity and their social identity, three of the participants asserted the relationship 
between their professional and relational identity. Relational identity in the context of the 
current study refers to the relational self of the female engineers, hence, the relationships that 
the female engineers engage in apart from being an engineer (Chen, Boucher, & Kraus, 2011). 
These women would report that being a female engineer was challenging as their ‘dating life’ 
was affected by being an engineer, even more so being a female engineer. An intimidation 
factor was reflected in two of the participants narratives, as they reported that their partners 
tend to feel intimidated because they were an engineer. Therefore, the female engineer’s 
professional identity played a role in their relational identity: 
Olivia: “…it’s a big hurdle to get over before things are normal, initially once they know what 
I do for a living.”  
In addition, Olivia emphasises the influence of her professional identity on her relational and 
cultural identity, as this was even more challenging for her being a Black African female. Olivia 
reported that men would question their ‘belonging’ in her life, due to her independence. In the 
Zulu culture, the norm is for the male to be the provider of the household, in which Olivia 
challenges by providing for herself. Hence, males would feel intimidated by Olivia’s success. 
In addition, Olivia notes that the ‘intimidation factor’ that is evident may not only be applicable 
to the Zulu culture, but to the ‘male ego’ in general.  This was confirmed by one of the Indian 
participants, as she states that males tend to be intimidated by the female being an engineer, 
however, this worsened if the male was not in the engineering profession himself.  
Palermo (2004) affirms the intimidation factor in men, as she states that some men have 
76 
 
displayed fear of powerful women. As women enter into a profession that is male-dominated, 
the women are challenging the hegemonic masculinity, even more so if the women persist and 
succeed in the industry. According to Connell (2005), hegemonic masculinity refers to the 
subordination of women and the domination of men. Hence, power relations are formed 
between the men and women, in which men dominate the ‘superiority status.’ However, 
Connell (2005) further asserts that hegemony can be challenged, as it does not have full control.  
This is illustrated by the participants, as by entering into a male dominated profession, as well 
as illustrate traits of independence, the men in their relational lives feel intimidated and 
challenged, as their status of domination is being contested. This is illustrated by one of the 
participants, as she states that this is worsened if the male is not an engineer. In this context, 
the male feels intimidated by a woman that is more successful and powerful than himself. 
Success in the context of the current study is based on the female’s career and remuneration. 
The notion of hegemonic masculinities is further challenged in cultures which perpetuate male 
dominance and the subordination of women, as the men are believed to be the bread-winner, 
however, Olivia provides for herself and is independent within her culture. Furthermore, Olivia 
states that this is not only applicable to her culture, but is generalised to the ‘male ego’, which 
was illustrated by another participant. Interestingly, these narratives were only reported by 
Indian and Black African participants, therefore, the role of culture may be significant, as the 
patriarchal ideologies may be more dominant in cultures such as the African and Indian culture.  
The notion of challenging hegemonic masculinity tends to be evident in the workplace as well, 
as Anika reported that her experience has been complex being an Indian female engineer. Anika 
asserts that the male engineers would formulate expectations for her based on her racial and 
cultural group, grounded on stereotypical and preconceived standards and expectations that 
Indian females should prescribe to. These standards and expectations were formulated by both 
the Indian racial group (her own racial group) and other racial groups in the workplace. Based 
77 
 
on the stereotypical expectations, the males would make decisions on her behalf based on 
assumptions they had about her race. In addition, Anika would not be consulted during the 
decision-making process. As Anika did not prescribe to these standards and expectations, she 
experienced a large amount of resistance from her own racial group. As a result, the Indian 
males would provide negative feedback as she did not meet the racial and cultural expectations 
that they had formulated for her. Furthermore, Anika notes that she is perceived as competition 
to her male counterparts, confirming the intimidation factor that is prevalent amongst 
successful women (Palermo, 2004). As a result of the masculinized culture of the engineering 
environment, men’s values are prevalent in such cultures which primarily consist of 
individualism and competition. However, as these values are not associated with women, they 
often feel isolated and experience the environment to be stressful as these are not common 
values for women (Tang, 2000; Wentling & Camacho, 2008). 
As noted with Olivia’s relational experiences, it seems as though Anika may be experiencing 
these challenges as a result of her challenging the hegemonic masculinity, as Anika feels that 
she is competition for the males and may therefore be considered a threat. As the men have 
cultural and racial expectations for her in which she does not subscribe to, the men’s dominant 
status in society is challenged. Furthermore, Faulkner (2009b) states that women that enter into 
male dominated fields tend to be harassed, sabotaged and resented, which may indicate some 
form of threat. Hence, the males tend to feel threatened in relation to their job security as well 
as their masculinity. Furthermore, Anika’s resistance to the cultural and racial standards and 
expectations can be viewed as her practising a form of ‘discursive resistance.’ This is illustrated 
in the above excerpts narrated by Anika, as ‘discursive resistance’ “allows those who are 
‘subjects’ of power to act otherwise and reject their confinement and self-subjugation within 
pre-determined discourses of power/knowledge” (Caldwell, 2007, p. 78). As Anika challenges 
the discourses and expectations that have been prescribed to her, she is illustrating the notion 
78 
 
of discursive resistance.  
Anika: “…No, I mean they are nice people but in terms of knowing you as a person, instead of 
asking you would you like to go wherever, oh no she can’t go because you know she’s Indian 
and Indians are very conservative.” 
Anika: “I didn’t come here to sit and do nothing so they like okay, so there was another white 
environmentalist female, and said to me, I was very shocked that you came and I’m like why? 
No because like Indian girls don’t go anywhere.” 
Based on the racial and cultural expectations and standards that have been prescribed, Anika 
evaluates the competitive culture that is formed between herself and the Indian males, which 
hinders her career progression.  This was also confirmed by another Indian female engineer as 
she has also experienced the competitiveness culture between the males and the females, which 
demonstrates that some males feel intimidated and competitive towards the female engineers.  
Contradictory to the other Indian female engineers, Arianna states that there may have been 
one or two incidents of competition between herself and the Indian males, however, she 
believes that this is dependent on the attitude of the individual, as she has also experienced 
helpfulness from the males. Therefore, if one has an attitude of eagerness and willingness as 
opposed to a threatening attitude, most of the males are willing to help.  
4.2.3. Deconstructing Race and Gender in the Engineering Field 
The female engineers narrated varying experiences in terms of the intersection between race 
and gender in their experiences as a female engineer. However, a common theme emerged 
between many of the participants, which was that senior engineers were primarily dominated 
by the white males, which effected their experience in some manner. As many of the 
participants acknowledged the male domination of the engineering environment, this affirms 
79 
 
Mostert (2009) and Lewis-Enright et al.’s (2009) statement of the underrepresentation of 
females in the engineering sector.  It is clear that the minimal changes that have occurred since 
the Apartheid era pertaining to gender role expectations.  
The white male dominance that was prevalent in the senior positions of the engineering 
industry effected three of the participants’ career progression in some manner, as barriers 
emanated between the female engineers and the white male engineers. These barriers mainly 
consisted of the lack of commonalities between the two groups.   
One of the participants noted the impediments in her career progression, due to the racial, 
language and cultural barriers that was evident in her experiences. These barriers formed 
complexities for her, as the organisation in which she worked was predominately Afrikaans.  
Valerie: “…I feel like race plays a huge role, race and gender they do play a role in how you 
progress in the company, cause again it’s all about networking, so it’s all about before you 
make relationships with at very beginning of your career I think…” 
As a result of the lack of ‘common ground’ to formulate informal networks on, Valerie’s career 
progression has been compromised. She noticed the differential progression between herself 
and an Afrikaans male colleague, as he was not experiencing the cultural, racial and language 
barrier that she was. Hence, he was able to establish an informal network with the male 
colleagues, due to the participation in male common discourse on a personal level, which 
Valerie was unable to participate in.  
Valerie: “So he got to tag along, and learnt a lot, I think learnt a lot more than I could at the 
time, also being, they have other things in common, even their personal lives , they will discuss 
rugby this, rugby that, their teams, so that as well helped them I think come close on a personal  
level so whenever there was something that experienced engineers thought of they’d 
80 
 
immediately think of him, oh no I think it’d be cool if he saw this cause they already have that 
like personal attachment because those discussions that they have amongst themselves so I do 
think that, ya it was partly because of female in terms of sport and things that you enjoy, friends 
altogether also the language as well like things just sort of jump over your head, you don’t 
know what to say half the time.” 
This was also asserted by two other participants, who stated that the racial barrier between the 
white males and the females has affected their career progression in the organisation, as it is 
more challenging to form relationships with them.  
Anika: “…you just don’t fit that profile of what they are looking for in the old white boys club 
so career progression is like a straight line.” 
Arianna: “…I don’t know what to talk to them about, it’s a little bit of uh, divide.” 
Palermo (2004) asserts that women have less contact with dominant networks, which comprises 
of men, as illustrated by the narratives above. This hinders females’ participation in networks. 
In addition, as the participants noted the senior male domination, complexities are formed for 
the Black African females, as there tends to be a lack of female role models in the engineering 
industry, forming impediments for the female engineers, which was confirmed by Gibson and 
Espino’s (2016) study. Additionally, the lack of commonalities are a hindrance to the women’s 
career progression, due to the lack of mentoring networks available. As a result of the lack of 
mentoring networks and the distinction between the male and female engineers, the ‘glass 
ceiling’ is formed for these participants, which is a barrier that hinders female engineers’ career 
advancement (Morrison et al., 1987). As women are unable to form mentoring networks with 
the senior male engineers, they are unable to progress further than the ‘glass ceiling’, as the 
mentoring relationships have been designed to provide the junior engineer with ways to achieve 
advancement through training and to negotiate barriers in the organisation that the individual 
81 
 
is experiencing (Baxter & Wright, 2000; Fagenson, 1988). Palermo (2004) reports that men are 
able to utilise these networks to advance their careers, and as noted in the narratives, women 
are unable to gain access to and therefore, their career progression is compromised.  
It is further emphasised in Valerie’s narrative that not only does she not have commonalities 
with the senior male engineers in terms of gendered activities, such as ‘hiking and watching 
rugby’ but also racial and language barriers are fixed, further complicating the relationship 
between the two. As with Valerie, Anika also experienced impediments when trying to form a 
relationship with her senior, based on being a female and an Indian. Anika asserts that she is 
unable to form a relationship, as she does not meet the criterion of what the male engineers are 
looking for. Therefore, due to the lack of commonalities, a barrier is established affecting her 
career progression, as with Valerie. Tang (1997) affirms that “being a member of two 
disadvantaged groups might have a divesting effect on the careers of black and Asian women 
in science and engineers” (p. 386). This is due to women being in the numerical minority and 
therefore experience difficulties forming professional networks and finding mentors and role 
models, as asserted by Valerie and Anika’s narrative. Tang (1997) asserts that the being in the 
double minority contributes to the lack of mobility in the field of engineering. However, despite 
this, Valerie and Anika assert the importance of establishing networks with the senior engineers 
in order to utilise the opportunities that are presented. It has also been emphasised in the 
literature that women experience a lack of opportunities compared to their male counterparts 
pertaining to career planning, mentoring networks and information sharing. These 
opportunities have been noted to be crucial in the upward mobility and therefore, as females 
are excluded, their career opportunities are affected (Cooper Jackson, 2001; Shantz & Wright 
2011; Smith 2003) 
It is further postulated by Faulkner (2009) that it may generally be easier to work with and 
82 
 
promote those that are similar and likeable to oneself. As men have common interests which 
may differ from females’ interests, social networks are formulated, which are powerful in the 
organisation. However, due to the differed interests, women find it difficult to place themselves 
in these networks as illustrated in the narratives.  
Although the women experienced challenges in forming relationships with the white male 
engineers, one of the participants acknowledged that once the barrier had been removed, 
forming a relationship seemed to be easier. Furthermore, she states that the intimidation factor 
that she experienced may not actually be true and may be a result of her own perceptions:  
Arianna: “…I’ve learnt so much more , I’ve learnt, I’ve made a lot more friends that way, not 
only friends I’ve got like mentors , a lot of them are that same old white men, but I can meet 
them anywhere and talk about anything , not just work stuff cause um, I kind of figured you 
know what? it might just be me feeling that intimidation  and uh, it doesn’t exist , so um working 
through that its actually opened up a lot of more doors and made it much easier to work in the 
industry. I think, it’s like now, I won’t feel uh intimidated in a situation, whatever it is, um much 
more confident and I, realised it’s a lot to do with what I’m actually  thinking so it’s, I know 
there are, I know there will, I know there are still people in the industry that will have that type 
of thinking that you not good enough  but there are very few now so…” 
Based on the above excerpts it may be that the barrier that is formed is a preconceived idea that 
women have when entering into a male dominated industry, however, may not necessarily be 
true. Additionally, despite the complexities that are formed due to the existing racial barriers, 
these complexities usually occur on a professional level, as the senior engineers have been 
reported to be ‘good people’ on a personal level.   
Despite the challenges that have been reported, the majority of the participants have noted that 
their race has not impacted their engineering experiences negatively. In addition, the 
83 
 
participants that experienced challenges, would generally not experience them with clients.  
Anika: “….Uh, I haven’t had a bad experience with any of the clients thus far…” 
Interestingly, it was also asserted by a white female engineer that based on her experience, 
being a white female is more well-received by clients than those of other races, but this was 
her own perception regarding what she has noticed in the engineering industry. However, many 
of the participants noted that their racial group has not created challenges for them.  
Isabella: “it, like me being a coloured doesn’t affect anything or um, change people’s 
perception of me…” 
Furthermore, company policies prevented any form of racial discrimination to occur, as 
narrated by two of the participants. Olivia also notes that the nature of the work eliminates the 
space to offend each other: 
Olivia: “Um…(pause), well because it’s such a, it’s not a, position or job where your 
interpersonal  skills need to be strong, we work with data, we work on equipment, we are 
designers, we are scientists, so there’s no room really for people to step on your toes. In terms 
of personal beliefs and culture, it just doesn’t come up, it doesn’t need to, cause of the nature 
of the work.” 
This was also confirmed by another one of the participants who stated that it is easier to bond 
with other engineers.  
Although many of the participants did not acknowledge the role of their racial group in their 
experiences as a female engineer, many of the participants would make reference to the B-
BBEE Act and the effects of such on their professional identity. Conflicting narratives were 
reported amongst the racial groups, regarding whether BEE was in their favour or not in terms 
84 
 
of career progression. Many of the white female engineers would acknowledge that BEE has 
not been in their favour. However, a few participants from the other racial groups have asserted 
that the BBBEE Act has favoured them in terms of career progression and the opportunities 
available for them.  
Valerie: “I really do think that there are sort of advantages to of being black and being female 
and being an engineer at the same time, in terms of career progressing, progressing further as 
an engineer, there’s definitely a number of opportunities.” 
The Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Act has been implemented in 
South Africa as a result of the injustices of the Apartheid era. The objectives of the B-BBEE 
Act are: to empower broad-based black individuals by promoting economic transformation to 
enable the participation of black people in the economy; to achieve change in the racial 
composition of management and ownership structures, as well as in skilled occupations of 
existing and new enterprises; to increase the extent which black women manage and own new 
and existing enterprises and to increase their access to infrastructure and skills training as well 
as economic activities; to promote investment programmes which leads to broad-based and 
economic participation by black people to achieve general prosperity and sustainable 
development and lastly, to promote access to finance for black economic empowerment. As 
many of the participants that are classified as ‘black’ in accordance with the B-BBEE Act have 
made reference to the B-BBEE act meeting its objectives for them (Republic of South Africa, 
2003). Therefore, the B-BBEE Act has enabled change in the South African workforce. This 
is especially important as many of the participants have noted that many of the senior positions 
are still occupied by white males, as well as many of their colleagues are white males (ibid, 
2003).  
85 
 
4.2.4. The Role of Motherhood  
Only one of the participants in the study performs a dual role of being a mother and a 
professional. However, Vanessa acknowledges the intersection of her professional identity and 
her role as a mother, as she narrates that being a mother in the engineering field is challenging 
due to the demands inherent in the job.  
Vanessa: “…if I had to go back and study again and knew about being a mom and knowing 
what engineering demands of you, I might not have chosen it.” 
An incongruence is formed in Vanessa’s narrative, as there is a sense that she feels as though 
she is missing out on her children’s childhood and lives, however, states that this may not only 
be applicable to the engineering industry, but any working mother in a profession. Therefore, 
Vanessa acknowledges the interception of motherhood and a professional identity. 
Furthermore, Vanessa also reports a contradiction in her narrative, as she states that she is 
working to give her children a better life, however, questions whether she is spending enough 
time with her children. In addition, Vanessa reports the complexities that manifest from a 
demanding field such as engineering as well as the role of motherhood, as there may be a need 
to take time off in order to fulfil one’s role of being a mother. However, one’s professional 
identity has the potential to suffer, as being an engineer requires one to meet deadlines, which 
may be in conflict with one’s role of being a mother, as these two roles do not always coincide, 
due to the unpredictability of being a mother.  
Elizabeth, although not a mother, also acknowledges how challenging it must be for a mother 
and believes that performing her various roles and duties would have been different if she had 
to have children. She asserts that being a mother and a professional is more challenging, due 
to the various responsibilities one has a mother and even more so, as a working mother in a 
demanding industry. The conflict that employed mothers experience was prevalent in the 
86 
 
literature, as Watts (2009) and Jorgenson (2002) acknowledge the difficulties mothers have 
when attempting to balance the role of a professional and a mother. However, as Vanessa 
asserts, these roles do not always coincide, which therefore, may have an impact on her career 
advancement. Additionally, Mostert (2009) acknowledges that a work-life balance is one of 
the greatest challenges that South African women experience. 
Schwartz (1992) notes that complexities are formed for working mothers, as the mother needs 
to balance their advancement opportunities and family aspirations. Substantiating this, Vanessa 
notes that balancing being a professional and a mother is a demanding and challenging role, as 
well as has implications on her psychological well-being as she doubts whether she is there 
enough for her children. Isabella, although not a mother, asserts the importance of dedicating 
one’s time to their career as a junior engineer as well as a female, as time becomes limited once 
becoming a mother. 
Isabella: “…all the juniors do that so that they can um, make a name for themselves, so I think 
now, being single and not having children might be the perfect time for you to move up in your 
career because when you become a mother one day you won’t have that time to do it.” 
Sonnert (1999) asserts that women have three clocks in which they need to consider, these 
include their biological clock, their partners clock, and their own career clock. This confirms 
Isabella’s narrative of having to plan one’s career progression before having children. In 
addition, Isabella’s narrative acknowledges the ideology of the ‘ideal worker’ who is able to 
progress vertically in the organisation without interruptions (April, Dreyer, & Blaas, 2007). 
Isabella devotes her time to the organisation in order to progress, hence, ensuring that when 
she enters motherhood, she does experience professional damage. This can be likened with Gill 
et al.’s (2007) study, as she states that women are often required to plan their pregnancy, to 
ensure that professional damage does not occur.  
87 
 
Despite the challenges that women experience as working mothers, Vanessa acknowledges that 
she has not experienced challenges when trying to balance the different roles in the company. 
However, she asserts that other female engineers have experienced comments by the other 
engineers when performing the dual role of being a mother and a professional. This can be 
likened with Ranson’s (2005) assertion that once a woman becomes a mother, she is no longer 
‘one of the boys,’ hindering her acceptance in the engineering environment. Additionally, one 
of the other participants, (who is also not a mother), states that many female engineer graduates 
are put-off by the environment and the lack of flexibility that the engineering environment 
offers when one has children, this was noted in the literature, as engineering is considered a 
profession that does not allow for family flexible policies. However, this assertion is 
contradictory to Vanessa’s experience (Frome et al., 2006). She also notes the commentary that 
takes place when women leave early in order to fulfil their role as a mother. These experiences 
are amplified in Watt’s (2009) and Jorgenson’s (2002) study, as the engineer’s commitment is 
questioned when using such a strategy to perform the roles as a mother and a professional. A 
belief in society is that it is not possible to be both a mother and a professional, as one of the 
roles needs to be sacrificed. Vanessa manages balancing both roles well, however, this may be 
due to the company’s policies and procedures. In addition, Vanessa acknowledges the 
importance of a support system when performing the role of a working mother. As a result of 
the support system in which Vanessa holds, this may be have enabled her role as a working 
mother.  
Watts (2009) notes that being a father is an obligation that is not associated with his 
professional career, however, a woman needs to negotiate her responsibilities in order to be 
able to maintain a professional and parental role. As a woman, this provides additional stress, 
and she may experience negative remarks from her colleagues questioning her commitment as 
an engineer. This indicates an undermining of her ability as an engineer, which men may not 
88 
 
necessarily experience. Vanessa confirms Watts (2009) statement in her narrative, as she states 
that women have a role to fulfil, whereas men don’t always notice these responsibilities, as it 
is more than likely going to be fulfilled by the mother of the children.   
As Vanessa has not experienced these challenges in the workplace, she reports that this may 
also be due to the role of her supervisor, who is also a mother. She also asserts that the company 
accommodates her needs as a mother and a professional, as the company allows for flexi-time, 
allowing the employees to work in their hours when they need to perform their roles outside of 
the workplace. Additionally, the literature suggests that once female engineers have children 
they are no longer visible as engineers (Faulkner, 2009a) and therefore, their male counterparts 
progress further in their career, however, in Vanessa’s narrative she does not report the 
competition in career progression between her and her male counterparts. This may be due to 
her already having a high status as an engineer and has a substantial amount of experience as 
an engineer. Additionally, Vanessa acknowledges the support structures in which she has in 
place, which Jagacinski (1987) asserts is influential in the persistence of female engineers.  
4.2.5. Engineering Implications 
Many of the participants would adopt a positive stance on the challenges that they may have 
experienced being a female engineer, however, a few participants have acknowledged the 
effects of the hardships on themselves. Despite the few reported negative implications, the 
participants in the study continue to persist as engineers. Only one of the participants 
acknowledged the negative effects of the engineering environment and being a female engineer 
and how this negatively impacted her life. 
Two of the participants asserted that the challenges that they had experienced allowed them to 
form a new outlook for themselves and benefitted them, as they would continue to persist and 
89 
 
‘push their limits’ as an engineer. Therefore, a positive outlook was taken on the challenges in 
which they faced.  
Arianna: “…and I found that it helped me because, I ended up knowing more than them, I made 
an extra effort to go and learn how these things work, sometimes the guys they have an idea of 
how it works, how certain things work, and then they just run with that idea and it might, might 
not be completely true, so whereas I went and I put in a little bit extra work to figure out how 
it works and then I understand it a bit better, so ya it just I think it makes you want to work 
more.” 
Valerie: “…instead of looking at all of these things as negatives, I managed to look at them  as 
positives, like you know what, at the end of the day what I presented he didn’t understand, 
wasn’t good enough simply means that I have to go back and…do more work and convince 
them because I know what I’m doing and doing more work is really helping me because I’m 
learning more about what I’m doing in the process, so I felt like all of these challenges really 
made me stronger , made me more confident and have really increased my work ethic cause 
now I pay attention to detail, a lot more attention to detail, I know what, I’m always confident 
in what I’m presenting cause I know I probably looked at every single thing of, and if you point 
out something, like okay you missed this, I won’t feel like oh, you picking on me anymore, it’s 
more like oh okay, I know I can do that, I’ll go do it and come back.” 
Despite the subtle challenges that these women have faced, the majority of the participants 
acknowledged that their experience as a female engineer has been positive and has helped them 
to develop confidence and resilience as an individual. Furthermore, Emily asserts that due to 
her positive experiences as a female engineer, her confidence and resilience has allowed her to 
overcome challenges that she is currently experiencing. However, she asserts that a graduate 
engineer may experience these challenges in a more negative light and may not be able to 
90 
 
overcome them with the same attitude that she has. This can be likened to Gill et al.’s (2008) 
study, as she asserts that young female graduates are more likely to consider moving firms and 
locations, therefore, the early experiences that female engineers have can affect their 
persistence in the engineering field. However, the effects of the challenges for Emily is still 
evident, as the hardships have affected her negatively. Despite the recent challenges, Emily 
notes that her experience as a female engineer has been positive.  
In addition, many of the participants asserted that they had not experienced discrimination as 
an engineer and were treated as an equal. Many of the participants would acknowledge the 
prestigious status of being an engineer and how this had affected their self-esteem, as Emily 
notes, an ‘ego-boost.’ The field of engineering is also considered a ‘thankless job,’ which 
provides inner satisfaction. Furthermore, it is also rewarding overcoming work-related 
challenges as an engineer, as it increases one’s confidence, which is beneficial in the future.  
Ayre et al. (2013) notes in their Australian study that their participants also found the 
engineering environment to be strongly masculinized and therefore experienced isolation, 
being overlooked and unheard. However, they continued to persist as engineers, as well as 
enjoyed the engineering environment. Therefore, as illustrated in the narratives, a few of the 
participants acknowledged impediments, however, continued to persist, as well as adopted a 
positive stance to challenges. This was illustrated in the literature, as many of their participants 
would become more determined when tested, as illustrated in Valerie’s narrative (Ambrose, et 
al., 1998; Bastalich et al., 2007). Buse (2011) noted that women who persisted demonstrated 
traits of self-efficacy and confidence. This was demonstrated in the narratives, as those that 
had experienced challenges would become more determined and confident.  
Furthermore, Cech et al. (2011), states that those that possess professional role confidence are 
more likely to persist in their careers. However, the authors assert that there may be a gender 
91 
 
variation in professional role confidence, as they state that women are less likely to form 
professional role confidence in professions that are male dominated due to the cultural biases 
that men are better at the profession, due to their natural fit are less likely to form professional 
confidence in occupations that have masculine cultures, as their professional role is developed 
through socialisation. Cech et al. (2011) notes that professional role confidence may be more 
prominent in males than females, justifying their persistence in the field of engineering. 
However, based on the participants’ narratives, many of the participants noted that they felt 
confident in the field of engineering and when accomplishing tasks that are challenging, a sense 
of achievement is formed. Most of the participants did not indicate that they had intended to 
leave the field of engineering, indicating their persistence in the field of engineering. This 
corresponds with Ayre et al.’s study (2013), as in her study she notes the confidence that her 
participants portrayed, consequently asserting that they do belong in the field of engineering. 
Moreover, the majority of the participants were not married, nor were mothers and this may 
have impacted their persistence in the engineering sector, as Buse et al., (2013) and Jagacinski 
(1987) assert that persistent female engineers are less likely to be married with children.  
4.3. Mediating the Two Extremes 
The majority of the participants narrated what seemed to be a contradiction between being 
treated as an equal, as well as standing out as a female. Therefore, the two extremes are formed, 
as women would narrate incidents in the engineering environment that would not occur for the 
men, consequently, forming a divide between the men and women. However, women narrated 
that they are also treated as ‘one of the boys’ and an equal. The contradiction of narratives will 
be uncovered based on the experiences that women have had.  
92 
 
4.3.1. ‘Standing Out as a Female’ 
Eight of the nine participants reported that they had experienced some form of sexual 
harassment as a female engineer. The sexual harassment incidents ranged from sexual 
commentary, staring, whistling to wanting to form romantic relationships with the female 
engineers. There was only one report of minor physical sexual harassment. Interestingly, these 
incidents were largely conducted by other males, who were not engineers such as the contract 
workers, cleaners, the security guards and males from other companies, therefore, these 
individuals would not interact with the female engineers on a daily basis. The incidents that 
occurred to the women resulted in the women feeling uneasy and uncomfortable, as Emily 
reports: 
“…if you walk along they all stare at you, other women have commented about it as well, like 
you’re in overalls, they not pretty and you feel naked how they look at you.” 
Many of the women would resolve these incidents themselves and establish boundaries in order 
for these incidents not to occur in the future. As a result, the women needed to demonstrate 
assertiveness to resolve these issues. It was prevalent in the narratives that the sexual incidents 
that occurred only took place because they were female, hence, would not be a typical 
encounter for a male. These incidents also were not a common occurrence, however, had 
occurred at least once or twice for the eight participants.  
Elizabeth: “…so I think if I was a male I wouldn’t have got that problem.” 
Sexual harassment has been noted as a work-environment barrier that impacts the professional 
progress of the women, as well as their psychological well-being (Catalyst Report, 1992). In 
addition, sexist comments and jokes undermine the female engineers. However, in this study, 
93 
 
the women did not acknowledge the effects of the sexual harassment incidents on their well-
being, especially as the majority of the women would confront the situation immediately.  
Faulkner (2009) notes how female engineers have experienced some form of unwanted 
flirtatiousness or sexual harassment, which is a consequence of being a female in a male 
dominated field. As Elizabeth notes, she doesn’t believe that it would have occurred if she were 
a male. The experiences of sexual harassment were also confirmed in Bastalich et al.’s (2007) 
study. These occurrences are prevalent in the engineering industry, as a result of the salience 
of the female presence, therefore, women are subjugated to sexual incidents. In addition, it has 
been noted in the literature that women that occupy non-traditional occupations are more likely 
to experience sexual harassment, confirming why female engineers experience these 
harassments (Bastain, Lancaster, & Reyst, 1996; DeSouza & Solberg, 2003 & Illies et al., 
2003).  
Five of the participants narrated the protectiveness and helpfulness culture in the engineering 
environment, which was primarily due to them being a female. The participants narrated the 
willingness men had to help them, as well as afford the women extra attention. The participants 
would acknowledge the eagerness men portrayed to do physical work for the female engineers: 
Isabella: “…they are more helpful towards women, but especially if you need to climb up 
things, take samples, they will offer to do it for you.” 
Coupled with the helpfulness culture that has infiltrated the engineering environment, a 
protectiveness and nurturing relationship is formed, in which the males tend to protect and 
nurture the female engineers. Hence, women are awarded extra attention based on their gender. 
Although this was not perceived as an issue for the women, differential expectations are formed 
for the male and female engineers, perpetuating gender inequality, as the male engineers would 
94 
 
not have received the same attention. Zening-Arslan (2002) asserts that due to the feminine 
imagery of females, they are naturally seen as weak and therefore require protection and 
assistance from men, therefore, are sheltered and are required to perform the socially 
constructed responsibilities of females, i.e. housework. This was illustrated in the narratives, 
as women were often assisted by the males, indicating their incompetence and inabilities to 
perform.  
Similarly, a few of the female engineers would acknowledge the differential treatment when 
attending site visits. Women would often be discriminated against when attending sites, 
generally as a result of them being female. Two of the participants acknowledged the exclusion 
from site work based on their gender, as the site “is not really for girls”. The other participant 
noted that a certain criterion is used when deciding on which engineer would be attending the 
site visit. If the women do not meet the criteria, they are excluded, negating their opinion in the 
decision-making process. The male engineers would decide for the female engineers whether 
they would be able to manage the site or not, and if not, a male engineer is allocated instead: 
Arianna: “…if they think it’s going to be a hectic site, where there’s going to be lots of work 
and lots of like, I don’t know how they, they’ve got criteria they use, but its uh, they sometimes, 
sometimes there’s cases that I know of where, not the companies I worked for but like other 
companies some of the girls say no, there like a really nice project and they wanted to go on 
site and work on this project and they were  like no, I don’t think you’ll manage on that site, 
lets send this guy.” 
The criterion that is used for the engineers, may coincide with the helpfulness and protective 
nature that the men tend to have towards the female engineers, as the men are protecting the 
women from attending dangerous sites. However, by doing so, a barrier is formed between the 
95 
 
men and women in terms of their physical abilities and their suitability for the site. As well as 
undermining their competency as an engineer. Additionally, the women are not consulted 
regarding their opinion about the site, but decisions are rather made on their behalf. This was 
worsened for the one participant, as assumptions were made about her racial group, and was 
therefore excluded from attending the site.  
It has been noted in the literature, that women often receive different treatment to their male 
counterparts, as they receive extra attention and ‘protection’ from the shop floor. Additionally, 
women receive a lack of practical opportunities, based on being a female, as illustrated by the 
participants in which they are discriminated against attending site visits (Horgan, 1989; Kanter, 
1977, Morrison & Von Glinow, 1990). It has been noted that the male engineers are protective 
in the manufacturing environment and therefore, discourage females from working on the 
plant, subsequently, denying them practical experience. Holth (2014) asserts that women are 
often denied practical experience and therefore, treated as observers. This can be likened to the 
participants’ experience, as the males have a criterion in which needs to be met in order to 
decide which engineer will be attending the site. However, by doing so, the male engineers are 
perpetuating gender inequality, as they are stating that the female’s do not have the adequate 
capabilities to perform all tasks as an engineer. Furthermore, it has been noted that men have a 
tendency to nurture women, as noted by Powell et al.’s (2011) study on engineering students 
in the United Kingdom. The authors note that female students receive additional help from 
staff, as they believe they are supporting them. However, the extra attention and nurturing 
relationship that is formed may be an example of a paternalistic relationship that is created 
between the males and the females. This is confirmed by Olivia, as she states that her manager 
and herself have a father-daughter relationship. However, by affording extra attention to the 
female engineers, not only are the males performing differential treatment between the male 
and female engineers, but a possible consequence may be that women are perceived as less 
96 
 
competent, especially in terms of practical tasks. Based on the differential treatment between 
the male and female engineers, women are not afforded the same practical experience as the 
male engineers. This has serious implications for the female engineers, especially those that 
intend to register as a Professional Engineer, yet are not afforded the opportunities to attend 
certain site visits, as a result of not being able to attend the sites. In the process, the women are 
unable to meet the criteria for a Professional Engineer (Powell et al., 2011).  
Furthermore, it has been reported by a couple of participants that site work is a bit more 
challenging for females, based on biological differences, as there is frequently a lack of toilets 
on site, which becomes challenging for females. However, it has been noted that there are some 
sites that do have portable toilets now, but these are still not ideal for women. Despite the 
accommodations that have been made for women on site, these factors do create a divide 
between the men and women, however, the companies have tried to accommodate women to 
do the best of their abilities. Ayre et al. (2013) notes as a result of women being in the numerical 
minority as female engineers, their sensitivities are often overlooked, as illustrated in the 
narratives. In addition, it has been mentioned by the two of participants that men are naturally 
more physical and are therefore able to endure on sites without becoming as tired as the women. 
However, this does not make site work impossible, but rather more challenging. One of the 
other participants also noted that being an engineer is physically intense, especially during shut 
down, therefore this may be easier for the males than for the females. Hence, a physical barrier 
is created between the men and women, as the women have noted that there are certain tasks 
that may be more natural for the men. Based on these narratives, a contradiction is formed, as 
most of the participants state that they are treated as equals and have not been discriminated 
against, however, have also reported that they are not equal to the men and therefore award 
men the ‘superiority status’ and acknowledge that men are compatible with the physical 
requirements of an engineer. Furthermore, the workplace attire is not accommodating for the 
97 
 
female engineers. It is a requirement for some of the engineers to wear personal protective 
equipment (PPE), however, it was asserted by one of the participants that this attire is generally 
designed and made for men. Hence, the equipment does not fit the women correctly, 
subsequently resulting in challenges for the female engineers. 
Another factor that was asserted by one of the participants, which created a divide between the 
men and women, is that the leader of the project would often not be awarded to the female 
engineer, as they would initially be used as assistance, therefore, it is automatically assumed 
that the male engineer would lead the project: 
Arianna: “…they always just assumed that someone else is just going to be leading the project 
and I’ll just be assisting on site…” 
Arianna: “…Whereas for a guy, it’s almost like they don’t question, they take it for granted 
that oh no, he can manage it, he’s good enough to handle it.” 
Based on these incidents, Arianna would have to demonstrate characteristics of assertiveness, 
as her efforts would not be acknowledged otherwise. A barrier is created, as Arianna states that 
the females work is taken for granted which requires the female to put in more effort than her 
male counterparts. It was further illustrated by one of the other participants that she would also 
be assigned the menial jobs. In addition, it was reported that the men would receive credit for 
work that she had conducted, however, for the work that the men had conducted, Emily did not 
receive credit. This was also confirmed by another participant, who stated that the male 
engineers would receive credit for work that she had conducted, while she was not 
acknowledged. Furthermore, three of the participants made reference to the clients and 
contractors referring to the male as the project manager and the leader of the project, and if 
98 
 
there are queries regarding the project, the clients would refer to the male in the room. 
Additionally, the male contractors or clients would instruct the female engineer to “go back 
and check”, therefore, would not direct questions at her, implying that she needs to do double 
check her work. However, if a male was leading the project, the questions would be directed 
at him.  
This can be likened with Robinson’s (1991) statement of being an engineer, which means to 
talk, look and act like an engineer, which is synonymous with the male figure. Therefore, 
clients and contractors would automatically assume the engineer to be a male. This is also 
applicable to the women being assumed as the helper or the men receiving credit for the 
female’s work, as being an engineer is likened with the male figure. Faulkner (2009b) coined 
the term ‘gender in/authenticity,’ which notes the normative pressures of expecting the norm. 
Therefore, in the field of engineering, the ‘norm’ is considered to be a male engineer, thus, by 
becoming a female engineer, the women deviate the norm of a male engineer, subsequently 
resulting in others noticing the visibility of the female engineer, yet, the invisibility of an 
engineer. Therefore, the notion of a female engineer is incongruent with gender and 
engineering identities. In addition, Brumley (2004) asserts that the notion of success is often 
associated with male characteristics and therefore, due to women not possessing such 
characteristics, a lack of progression is experienced. Therefore, as postulated by the narratives, 
women would have to adopt such characteristics in order to be acknowledged and recognised 
as a competent.  
Arianna: “…kind of hint at you know, if they not happy with something, they won’t address it 
with you, they’ll tell you but they’ll say, go and speak to your uh…manager and come back or, 
you know like someone, it’s just like a hint but it hasn’t been anything like major, outright 
major so I haven’t had really like…” 
99 
 
It also been noted by one of the participants that the contractors are more likely to ‘push their 
luck’ with a female engineer than a male engineer. This means that the contractors would try 
extending their time limits with a female engineer, as opposed to a male engineer. Additionally, 
it was prevalent in the narratives that women would be spoken over as a female. One participant 
noted that the men tended to switch off when she spoke, as if she was their wife. As a result, 
the women would need to demonstrate assertiveness and forcefulness in order to be heard and 
understood.   
As the engineering field is male dominated, the discourses that the men engage in are primarily 
around typical male activities, therefore, the women are excluded from the topic of 
conversations, due to the lack of interest.  A few of the participants have noted the detrimental 
effects of not engaging in such discourses, as the conversation would usually navigate towards 
work. Therefore, as the men have engaged in these conversations they are provided with extra 
information in terms of their projects and work in which the women are excluded from. These 
conversations are also based on the male’s personal lives, which also forms a bond between 
them, which the women are generally excluded from:  
Arianna: “….for example if they’d be talking about soccer or whatever it is, so I’m not 
interested in that so I’m busy doing my own thing  and their conversation would end up going 
towards work, so they would end up discussing work and I’m not there discussing  with them, 
so it’s probably not intentional  on their side but it happened, um so it would be like they’d ask 
um, questions or whatever and they already know everything they need to know about the 
project, so the project, when it’s time to start the project they…um, they ahead  of me basically, 
so it seems like they know more than me and they better than me, but its only because they have 
been given that extra but of information.” 
100 
 
Phipps (2002) notes that the old boys’ network places females at a disadvantage based on their 
sexual identity. It is also noted by her participants that this exclusion was not intentional, yet 
remains discriminatory, which was also illustrated in the female engineer’s narratives. The 
discourses that take place in the organisation are an important part in forming relationships and 
mentorship with the senior engineers, however, women are excluded from these topics of 
discussion, based on the lack of interest and commonalities. Shantz and Wright (2011) as well 
as Gill et al. (2008) note that women are often excluded in these professional networks. In 
addition, Faulkner (2009) notes in her study how these stereotypical male conversations are 
formed and the implications thereof.  
Lastly, two of the participants have noted that there tends to be salary inequalities between the 
males and the females, as the men generally earn more than the women, regardless of the 
women’s experience. Due to the confidentiality of salaries in organisations, this cannot be 
confirmed, however, it has been mentioned amongst employees. This also tends to be a trend 
in the industry, as one of the participants noted that she had experienced this throughout her 
experience as a female engineer. The gender pay gap has been noted by other researchers as a 
concern for females in male dominated industries, as the pay inequalities emphasises the 
differential treatment for male and female engineers. It undermines the female engineer’s 
abilities, as it enforces the discrimination between males and females, as well as inhibits the 
females career progression (Ashraf, 2007; Feyerherm & Vick, 2005; Martin & Barnard, 2013). 
Despite the field of engineering being noted as a highly-paid profession, this is not always 
applicable to graduates and females (Mamaril & Royal, 2008). Women are also expected to 
exit the profession due to the low salaries.  
Two of the participants noted that the issues that have been discussed above are generally soft, 
subtle issues, which therefore, results in the females persisting as an engineer. Furthermore, 
101 
 
many of the participants would narrate these incidents, however, would not perceive them as 
real challenges. Despite the women’s perception of these challenges, it has been noted that 
these incidents form a barrier between the men and women. Despite the ‘subtle issues’ that 
were experienced by many of the women, the women acknowledged the positive experience 
they had as a female engineer and were subsequently treated as an equal. This was confirmed 
by Bastalich et al.’s (2007) study, as the female engineers in their study narrated the similar 
challenges to the current study, however, this did not impede on their career satisfaction, as 
noted by the female engineers in this study.  
4.3.2. ‘One of the Boys’ 
Seven of the nine participants narrated the positive experience they had as a female engineer, 
despite the ‘subtle’ issues that arose throughout their career, as well as being in the minority, 
many of the participants enjoyed being an engineer and continued to persist. One of the 
participants asserted that the challenges that she has encountered has prepared her for her long-
term career, as well as allowed her to develop as an individual. Additionally, two of the 
participants asserted that the divide between men and women was not intentional. The reason 
that the divide was created may be due to the lack of female presence. Therefore, males are 
unsure of how to interact with females, as the field has been mainly dominated by men over 
the years. This is especially true in the civil and mechanical engineering fields. In this way, the 
female engineers would justify the male’s behaviour in the engineering sector. This can be 
likened to Morandi and Subich’s (2002) study, as the authors state that women adopting 
traditional gender roles may internalise the blame for the discriminatory behaviour and are 
therefore, inferior. As the women justify the male behaviour, they are internalising the 
behaviour and accepting the status quo.  
102 
 
Furthermore, five of the participants asserted that they had not been treated differently as a 
female engineer. Hence, they believed they were treated as an equal. However, two of the 
participants asserted that the men in the engineering environment, would not behave differently 
due to the female’s presence. Therefore, the men would talk about other women whilst there 
was a female in the room (Olivia); they would address the meetings stating, ‘Mr’ and ‘gents’, 
thus, treating the female engineer as though she were ‘one of the boys’ (Olivia), as well as 
using foul language in front of the women (Emily).  
Olivia: “…usually for me it’s not deliberate on their part, it’s a conditioning in their minds, 
and thinking of you as one of the boys until they do something inappropriate and you speak up 
and say hang on…” 
Another interesting factor that arose in the narratives, is that discriminatory comments were 
not always made by men, but also by women. Three of the participants noted that they had 
been discriminated by a female engineer.  
Vanessa: “…well, being the person that I am, I would never have to do it myself, someone will 
always do it for me, you know, sort of this, sort of implying that you pretty and you friendly, 
you know, don’t worry you’ll never have to do it yourself, someone will always do it for you…” 
The participants narratives were confirmed in Bastalich et al,’s (2007) study, as in their study, 
the majority of the female engineers narrated minimal gender discrimination, as well as being 
able to get along with the males. Thus, many of the authors participants did not experience 
gender inequality in the engineering environment. However, Eisenhart and Finkel (1998) noted 
that women reinforce gender inequality by supressing any form of discrimination. The women 
in this study as well as Bastalich et al.’s (2007) study note the challenges of working in a male 
103 
 
dominated industry, however, perceive them as ‘subtle issues’ and have therefore experienced 
minimal inequalities. Only one of the female engineers was highly affected by the male 
dominated industry, however, the majority of the other participants narrated their positive 
experiences and reported that they were treated as an equal. Anika’s experience can be 
associated with the lack of inclusiveness in the culture of the engineering environment, as the 
inclusiveness of the organisational culture affects the women’s persistence in the engineering 
industry. Therefore, as Anika experienced a lack of acceptance and career progression, her 
persistence has been negatively affected (Faulkner, 2009b).  
Furthermore, Faulkner (2009a) asserts the notion of ‘he’ to refer to engineering, which is 
emphasised in Olivia’s narrative, as the common greeting would be addressed to ‘Gents’ and 
‘Mr’, negating the female presence. Although Olivia addresses this as a ‘soft’ issue, there are 
implications of such addresses for future female engineers, as the discourse of male engineers 
remains prominent, sending a powerful message to engineers, stating that engineering is a male 
dominated profession and accepting the status quo. Furthermore, as Olivia notes this as a soft 
issue and therefore, she does not have ‘sleepless nights’ about this, by doing so she accepts the 
status quo. In addition, Olivia was the only participant that asserted that the boardroom had 
been addressed as ‘Mr’ and ‘Gents,’ this may be due to Olivia being a mechanical engineer, 
which is highly male-dominated. Olivia also notes that mechanical engineering is often 
synonymous with a labourer, as noted in the literature by Phipps (2002). However, due to the 
false imagery of mechanical engineering, females are often discouraged from entering such a 
profession, impacting the retainment of engineers.  
Furthermore, the notion of equality in the engineering workplace can be likened with 
Jorgenson’s (2002) study, as in her study she notes that her participants do not note gender 
issues in their experiences. Many of her participants also noted engineering to be a ‘gender-
104 
 
neutral’ territory, which perpetuates equality for males and females, as with the current study. 
Eisenhart and Finkel (1998) note how this undermines women’s collective action to address 
their unique concerns as female engineers. These issues are perceived as subtle issues, 
nevertheless they are still existent in the women’s experience. As women do not consider the 
‘subtle issues’ as real challenges in a male dominated environment, the women are unable to 
challenge the issues that are evident in the engineering environment and therefore, unable to 
transform the engineering environment to be more accommodating for women. Instead women 
are having to assimilate to the engineering environment. This statement is amplified in 
Arianna’s narrative as she states: 
“…the environment is supposed to accommodate everybody and you want females to come in 
they give, they uh, they throw in a different perspective… 
The two extremes have created an interesting dynamic for female engineers, as the majority of 
the female engineers have acknowledged that their experience as a female engineer has been 
positive and they have been treated as an equal. However, barriers are also formed in the 
engineering environment forming a divide between the males and the females. Despite the 
division that is formed, many of the participants did not acknowledge these incidents and 
challenges as serious issues and most of the time were not deliberate on their part, as a few 
participants have noted that the males are not accustomed to having females in the engineering 
environment and therefore, these subtle issues that arise may not be intentional, but rather, a 
lack of understanding. Many of the participants also did not perceive these issues as 
‘challenges’ but are rather inclusive of their experiences as a female engineer, as women negate 
the implications of such issues, as well as internalise these ‘subtle issues.’ In addition, Saavedra 
et al., (2014) assert that women entering into a male dominated industry are subjected to 
105 
 
marginalisation, discrimination and subjection, illustrating the ‘subtle’ issues that women 
would experience in a male-dominated industry. 
Many of the women emphasised the different statuses that men and women are awarded in 
society, as by doing so, are perpetuating gender inequality and the women’s inferiority status 
in the field of engineering. Women internalise these differences between the men and women, 
as many of the participants would narrate them as part of their experiences and not challenges 
per se. Therefore, gender is perceived as, “a hierarchical structure of opportunity and 
oppression as well as an affective structure of identity and cohesion” (Ferree, 1995, p. 125). 
Consequently, men are afforded a higher status in society, due to their ‘natural’ abilities to 
succeeding the engineering environment, as many of the participants narrated that the men 
would not experience the same ‘subtle issues,’ enforcing the differential treatment between 
men and women. Therefore, by narrating the differential treatment between the men and 
women, this can be perceived as a form of oppression and power status between men and 
women. The oppressive forces form a net-like structure, in which men and women maintain 
the discourses of ‘truth,’ which the ‘truth’ advantages the dominant positions in society 
(Foucault, 1980).   
Furthermore, it has been noted by a few participants that the company’s policies and procedures 
create an impact in the organisation, as it lessens the amount of discrimination that is tolerated. 
Two of the participants have acknowledged that the reason for their positive experiences as a 
female engineer may be a result of the company’s stringent policies preventing harassment and 
discrimination. It should be noted, however, that many of the participants were in the 
engineering design industry, which as Faulkner (2009) notes in her study that she observed that 
the building design services was more gentle and respectful than the oilfield industry.  
106 
 
4.4. Proving Yourself 
Diverse narratives were reported by the female engineers, as a few participants would assert 
that they needed to prove themselves as a ‘female engineer’ whilst the others narrated the 
importance of proving oneself as an engineer. This was especially true as a junior engineer.  
4.4.1. Proving Yourself as a Female 
Four of the participants narrated that they felt the need to prove themselves as a female 
engineer. The participants felt that extra effort was required for them in order to be recognised. 
Two of the participants noted that they felt the need to prove themselves as a female, however, 
asserted that this may be a preconceived idea that they had, as there was no direct 
discrimination towards them. Nonetheless, although there was no direct commentary, the 
discrimination was often felt. Additionally, the female engineers narrated that as a result of 
women being a novelty in the engineering industry, the men are unsure of how to act in the 
females’ presence and therefore, intimidated.  
Arianna asserts that extra hours and more research is necessary in order for her capabilities and 
competence to be recognised. She also asserts that this would not occur if she were a male, as 
the men are automatically assumed that they are capable to handle the project and will therefore 
be leading the project, with Arianna as assistance, until she asserted herself as an engineer. 
This was also the case for a few contractors and clients.  
Arianna: “…as a project manager, I, uh, initially they sometimes, you can see that they feel 
that you don’t know your stuff or whatever it is but, once you start talking and they can see 
okay, this person knows what they doing and…what’s happening on this project, and especially 
107 
 
if you coming up with suggestions and solutions to the problem, then they start respecting you 
a bit more…” 
Arianna’s experience was verified in Ayre et al.’s (2013) study, as several of the authors 
participants also experienced having to prove themselves in order to be acknowledged and 
recognised by the males (colleagues and clients). Therefore, the participants relied on their 
professional competence to be affirmed by the males, as with Arianna.  
Isabella, however, states that her experience has improved, as she has gained more experience, 
however, initially she felt the need to prove herself. This was especially applicable to the older 
generation and the artisan workers, as they seemed to more resistant to female engineers. 
Ambiguity is formed in Isabella’s narrative, as she states that she felt the need to prove herself 
initially, however, she notes that her experience has improved as she gained more experience.  
In addition, Isabella asserts that women may have preconceived ideas of having to ‘prove 
themselves’ in the engineering environment.  
Two other participants recognised the role of their race in proving their competency as a female 
engineer. Therefore, two of the participants have noted the fluid and dynamic intersections of 
their identities, as well as that their identities are not unified. The participants (Black African 
and Indian female) stated that they would constantly have to prove themselves and extend the 
extra mile to demonstrate their competency. This would require lots of hours at work, as well 
as extra research, which they noted was not necessary for the male engineers. Anika asserts 
that there is a constant need to prove yourself, and once she has proved herself, she needs to 
do it again, as “there is always someone waiting in line.” This becomes more challenging, as 
she believes that her own racial group provides the largest obstacles, therefore, there is a 
constant need to prove herself as an Indian female engineer. By stating this in her narrative, 
108 
 
Anika notes the dynamics that are formed as one possesses various identities, which are not 
viewed as unified and singular, but are rather fluid and dynamic (Crenshaw, 1989). This is 
further amplified in Gibson and Espino’s (2016) study of Black engineering students, as the 
students would assert the importance of having to prove oneself in the engineering 
environment, by working harder. The students had noted their double minorities and how this 
had affected their experiences. Furthermore, the double standards notion was also mentioned 
in this study. This had become frustrating for the female engineers as the same privileges were 
not offered to them as their white male counterparts.  
Valerie asserts in her narrative the complexities that manifest from being an African Black 
female:  
 “…and if you are a girl and you decide, or a female rather and you decide to voice maybe, 
maybe correct them, they tend to think you have no idea what you talking about, you have to 
prove yourself , prove your theory ten times over, like no, whereas they have to say it once, oh 
this is what I think  and if you have to correct them, you really have to go there and have an 
entire PowerPoint presentation to prove your point, oh no, this is why I’m saying what I’m 
saying but it’s hard for them to take you at your word, whereas if you speaking with another 
female, I think they give you time , sort of explain yourself, they don’t immediately dismiss you, 
like oh no, you have no idea what you talking about.”  
Valerie: “…having to go that extra mile in terms of everything that you do, you really have to 
do it 10 times better than the next guy.” 
Valerie notes that males are more dismissive than females when the female engineer is trying 
to make a point. Thus, as a female engineer, she needs to strategize before presenting to the 
109 
 
male’s, hence, a plan of action needs to be done beforehand, which was not the case for the 
male’s. Although Emily does not mention that she is required to prove herself as a female 
engineer, she does mention the constant need to strategize and to gain the male’s perspective, 
confirming Valerie’s point of having to be prepared beforehand. Furthermore, Emily notes that 
this requires a large amount of people management.  
The notion of proving yourself as an engineer can be likened with Faulkner’s (2009b) statement 
of ‘highly visible as a woman, yet invisible as an engineer’. Therefore, it has been noted that it 
is a lot more challenging for a female to be taken seriously, which has been noted in the 
literature, as female engineering students and professionals felt the need to prove themselves 
to their male counterparts, based on their gender (Harris et al., 2004; Pardo et al., 2016; Powell 
et al., 2011).  
As women are highly visible based on their gender, they are often pressurised into performing 
better than the men (Kanter, 1977). Bastalich et al. (2007) notes in their study that many of 
their participants needed to conform to the engineering style, as they will not be heard 
otherwise. This implies reproducing masculine characteristics in order to prove yourself as a 
female. Furthermore, those that challenge the hegemonic workplace are seen as more as a threat 
than those that conform to the style, therefore, confirming Anika’s narrative, as Anika resists 
the cultural and racial expectations that are prescribed to her, therefore, may be perceived as a 
threat.  
Similarly, with Faulkner’s (2009) study, this does not have a long-term effect for the female 
engineers, but most have rather taken a positive stance on their own career path and the benefits 
of having to work harder.  
110 
 
4.4.2. Proving Yourself as an Engineer 
Four of the participants made reference to proving themselves as an engineer and not as a 
female engineer, as noted in the above discussion. Two of the participants made specific 
reference to proving yourself as a junior engineer, and not a female junior engineer. Therefore, 
they would work harder to prove themselves as junior engineers, as Olivia states that engineers 
are valued by the number of years’ experience that they have, therefore she felt the need to 
prove to the male engineers that she is a capable junior engineer. Hence, her gender and race 
did not play a role. Furthermore, the women asserted that their work would be assessed in 
isolation from their gender, therefore, they would put in extra effort to ensure their work was 
of standard, however, this was not dependent on their gender.   
Vanessa: “…you know I was also an eager engineer and showed an interest in everything, so 
I think from that point of view people were more accepting, the fact that you’re an engineer 
and you want to learn and that you want to do work and you want to, so I don’t think it was 
necessarily proving myself as a female but more proving myself as an engineer.” 
Elizabeth: “…Never…no, no. the companies I’ve worked for have always been very good, 
they’ve always assessed me on my work, not cause I’m a woman.” 
As noted in the above discussion, Isabella asserts that the male’s perceptions have changed as 
the junior engineers receive more experience in the field, confirming that many women may 
enter the industry with preconceived ideas of proving themselves as a female engineer. 
Isabella’s statement may be congruent with proving yourself as a junior engineer and not a 
female engineer, however, her preconceived ideas and biases may enable her to perceive the 
engineering environment to be evaluating her competency as a female, however, this may be 
based on evaluating her as an engineer as she has not received any direct commentary. Hall, 
111 
 
Shmader and Croft (2015) asserted in their study that social identity threat may be experienced 
by professionals when engaging with their male colleagues, resulting in a depreciation of 
confidence and a lack of acceptance. Social identity threat is defined by Steele, Spencer and 
Aronson (2002), as the concern that individuals experience in situations which their social 
group is deemed inferior or unrepresented. Taking this into consideration, the female engineers 
may be experiencing stereotype threat as a result of their minority status in the engineering 
environment. 
Faulkner (2009) notes that young male engineers also need to establish their professional 
credentials as a junior engineer. Therefore, a few of the participants narrated that they had to 
prove themselves more than their counterparts as an engineer, however, many of the 
participants narrated that they did not need to prove their competency as an engineer, but rather 
a junior engineer. Bastalich et al. (2007) noted in their study of female engineers that many of 
the younger women reported incidents of the ‘aggressive’ and ‘competitive’ behaviour of the 
male engineers and reported incidents of being ignored, offended and not listened to. Therefore, 
it may be that junior engineers experience such incidents based on their ‘years of work’ and 
not their gender.  
A few of the participants that had experienced challenges or the ‘subtle issues’ as noted in the 
previous discussion, noting that this was not done intentionally, as males were ‘good people’ 
on a personal level. However, there are various professional issues that do arise, in which a few 
of the participants note that this may be due to the males also adapting to female’s presence in 
the engineering environment.  
112 
 
4.5 Conclusion 
The nature of the identities in which the participants narrate can be seen as an act of intersection 
of the various identities, in which the participants acknowledged in their narratives. The various 
identities are viewed as manifestations that form from the social interactions in which the 
participants immerse themselves. During the study, an interesting theme emerged as many of 
the participants would acknowledge the ‘subtle issues’ that emerge during their experience, 
however, stated that these did not cause major implications for themselves or affect their career 
satisfaction. Furthermore, it has been noted that as a female engineer, many of the women need 
to adopt characteristics and behaviours which are masculinised, in order to create a sense of 
belonging with the culture of the organisation. This is due to the culture of the organisation 
being shaped by the dominant group, which consists of the male gender, therefore, it is required 
of the minority group (the females), to succumb to the behaviours that has been appropriated 
by the males. Participants that engage with the role expectations that have been prescribed by 
the males, is an example of how women internalise the appropriated behaviour, therefore, 
women adapt to the culture of the organisation, or challenge the status quo (Hooks, 1989). As 
women adopt masculinised behaviour and characteristics, this can be viewed as, women ‘doing 
gender’ as noted by West and Zimmerman (1987). Furthermore, many of the participants noted 
their experiences as a female engineer to be positive, as well as negated the role of their race 
in the experiences. However, a few of the participants narrated the tensions that are formed 
based on the intersection between their race and gender, as well as the implications of the 
tensions on their experiences as a female engineer.  Lastly, as women have entered into a male 
dominated profession which is largely associated with male characteristics and behaviours, this 
can be viewed as women resisting the socially defined roles, which may be perceived as a form 
of agency that women adopt to challenge the defined roles which society has prescribed for 
men and women (Caldwell, 2007).

Chapter Five 
Conclusion, Recommendations and Limitations 
This chapter provides a summary of the findings from the study, as well as offers 
recommendations for further research and interventions that could be utilised in the field of 
engineering. Lastly, the chapter converses the limitations of the study.  
5.1 Summary of the findings 
The objective of this study was to provide female engineers’ narratives of the experiences in 
the field of engineering, pertaining to the intersection of the female engineers’ race and gender. 
Drawing from the theoretical frameworks of Social Constructionism and Intersectionality, the 
study aimed to investigate four broad research questions: 1) how female engineers narrate their 
experiences of the engineering field; 2) the challenges that women experienced in a workplace 
that is male dominated; 3) how does gender and race shape the experiences of female engineers 
and lastly, 4) the implications of these experiences on the women’s well-being and personal, 
relational, cultural and social identities. Due to the overlapping theoretical frameworks, a 
thematic analysis was the appropriate method to use to analyse the data, due to the flexibility 
to analyse qualitative data.  
The central concepts of race and gender, which are embedded in Social Constructionism and 
Intersectionality were investigated in the study. Through Intersectionality, the study 
investigated how the female engineers narrated their experiences as female engineer of a 
specific racial group, as these identities intertwine. In addition, Social Constructionism was 
utilised to examine how the women narrated their experiences, using their own perceptions and 
a relativist perspective.  
114 
 
From a holistic outlook, the narratives of the participants formed various tensions, as their 
intersecting roles and identities were investigated. These identities were not viewed in 
isolation, but rather as fluid and dynamic, which inform each other to shape their experiences. 
Furthermore, many of the participants, (although they did not acknowledge the intersection), 
narrated the interceptions of the identities outside of their occupational identity, which shaped 
and informed their experiences a female engineer. Thus, the study investigates the various 
elements of the women’s identities and the interceptions thereof.  
Three fundamental themes emerged from the study, which included: 1) Negotiating the 
intersection of multiple identities; 2) Mediating the Two Extremes and 3) Proving Yourself. 
Within the themes, tensions emerged as the women negated the differential treatment between 
the men and women, however, noted aspects that formed differences between the men and 
women.  
The subsequent discussion summarises the findings that were investigated in the study, 
including the themes and the subthemes thereof.  
5.2. Negotiating the intersection of multiple identities 
The identities that the females possess are varied, however, operate simultaneously. As the 
female engineers are professionals, this informs their professional identity. However, women 
also possess a personal identity outside of the engineering workplace, which commonly 
constitute feminine characteristics (Jorgenson, 2002). Women also engage in social and 
relational identities apart from their professional identity, these include the social relationships 
that the women engage in.  
115 
 
5.2.1 Personal and Professional Identity 
Participants acknowledged the role of their professional identity informing their personal 
identity in the engineering environment, as many of participants noted the characteristics and 
behaviours in which they need to adopt in order to conform the culture of the organisation. 
Faulkner (2009) asserts that the largest group in the organisation will inform the culture of the 
organisation, therefore, the minority group (females) will need to adapt to the environment in 
order to be included. Many of the participants noted having to adopt characteristics which is 
strongly associated with ‘masculine’ characteristics, therefore, the women needed to restrain 
their feminine characteristics, such as being emotional in order to ‘fit in’ with the culture. 
Furthermore, these behaviours are appropriated in the engineering environment and are 
therefore perceived as ‘normative.’ As these behaviours are appropriated in the workplace, 
these traits and behaviours inform their personal identity. Therefore, it can be noted that the 
women’s professional identity shaped the women’s personal identity. However, this is context 
dependent, as appropriated behaviour in the engineering workplace may not be appropriate for 
females outside of the workplace and vice versa (Bastalich et al., 2007). However, it has been 
asserted in the literature that if women do not conform to the masculine norms of engineering, 
they are considered an, ‘outsider’ and ‘foreign,’ explaining why the women adopt these 
characteristics, in order to prevent subjugation (Ibid, 2007).  
5.2.2. Social, Relational and Professional Identity 
Many of the participants negated the influence of their professional identity on their social 
identity. Therefore, the stereotype pertaining to the social life of engineers was not perceived 
to be accurate in the participants’ narratives. The impact of one’s professional identity as an 
engineer did not create as much of an impact as expected. However, this may be dependent on 
the engineering industry, as the maintenance and manufacturing environment was narrated to 
116 
 
be more demanding. Thus, as many of the participants were involved in the design industry, 
the impact was annulled in the women’s social identity, as many narrated that the organisation 
was understanding to the various roles in which women engaged in. In addition, many of the 
women reported the role of their social identity in their professional identity, as the 
relationships that were formed outside of the workplace informed their professional identity.  
Furthermore, the women narrated the role of their professional identity impacting their 
relational identity, as the ‘intimidation factor’ was formed between the women and the men 
pertaining to their dating life. The intimidation factor is prevalent in Palermo’s (2004) study, 
as she asserts that men may become intimidated of powerful women. Therefore, as women are 
professional engineers and demonstrate independence, this may be illustrated as women 
challenging the notion of ‘hegemonic masculinity’ (Connell, 2005). Lastly, many of the 
participants noted that being a professional engineer allows for the women to perform the role 
of a role model. Additionally, the females narrated the importance of a role model in the 
engineering industry, especially being a female, as the women are able to share similarities 
with the younger female engineers. Consequently, they were able to form mentoring networks, 
consequently enhancing the persistence in the field of engineering. Gibson and Espino (2016) 
assert the importance of role models for Black engineering students, which was prevalent in 
the current study, as many of the Black African, Indian and Coloured participants would state 
that they are represented as a role model.  
5.2.3 Deconstructing Race and Gender in the Field of Engineering 
Ambivalence was narrated in the female engineers’ narratives pertaining to the female’s gender 
and race, as many of the women negated the role of their race in the experiences as a female 
engineer. However, a few women acknowledged the role of their race as a female engineer and 
117 
 
therefore, noted the intersection between one’s race and gender, forming complexities in one’s 
experience (Crenshaw, 1989). The women that narrated such complexities generally 
experienced the ‘glass ceiling’ due to the lack of commonalities between the women and the 
males, which was further amplified due to the racial and language barrier that was formed 
between the two (Baxter & Wright, 2000). However, once the barrier had been removed, the 
women noted the ease of forming relationships with their seniors. In addition, many of the 
women reported the role of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act in the 
advancement of their careers as an engineer.  
5.2.4. The Role of Motherhood 
Only one of the participants performed the dual role of being a mother and a professional, 
however, the dual role was perceived as challenging, as one would have to balance the 
demanding engineering field, as well as the demands of motherhood. The participant notes that 
any working mother experiences such challenges, however, may be more challenging due to 
the demanding industry. Furthermore, an incongruence was formed between being a mother 
and an employee, as ambivalent emotions were experienced pertaining to the needs of one’s 
children. However, the participant notes the role of the company in the accommodation of 
balancing the role of motherhood and an employee, as well as the importance of a support 
system. Furthermore, in contradiction to the literature (Ayre et al., 2013; Faulkner, 2009; 
Jorgenson, 2002; Watts, 2009), the participant has not felt discrimination when attempting to 
balance the role of motherhood and an engineer. However, two of the other participants who 
had not entered motherhood proclaimed the complexities and challenges that women face when 
balancing both roles, as noted in the literature (Ayre et al., 2013; Watts, 2009).  
118 
 
5.2.5. Implications of the Field of Engineering  
Many of the participants have narrated positive experiences as the female engineers and had 
not experienced much discrimination in the field of engineering. However, the women that did 
experience challenges formed a positive stance thereof in which enabled them to perform at a 
higher standard as an engineer. This was prevalent in Bastalich et al’s (2007) study, as when 
tested, the females would become more determined. However, a few women did narrate the 
hardships of the challenges in the engineering industry on their emotional well-being. In 
addition, many of the women narrated their persistence in the field of engineering, with the 
exception of a few who narrated the negative effect of the challenges on their persistence. Ayre 
et al’s (2013) study affirms the positive experiences that the authors participants had, (despite 
the ‘subtle issues’) which was congruent with the current study. Therefore, increasing their 
persistence in field of engineering.  
5.3 Mediating the Two Extremes 
An incongruence was formed in the subthemes of ‘standing out as a female’ and ‘one of the 
boys,’ as the participants narrate a divide between the men and women in the engineering 
industry, however, denote the relevance of the divide on their experiences as a female engineer. 
The women noted the differential treatment which occurs between the men and women, 
however, this was not perceived as challenges to the researcher and the participants, but rather 
‘subtle issues.’ However, by narrating such differential treatment a divide is formed, 
emphasising the discrimination. In addition, the divide was not perceived as discriminatory to 
the majority of the female engineers. These issues were prevalent in the engineering 
environment, however, did not impede on the women’s career satisfaction or their persistence, 
which was noted in the literature (Ayre et al., 2013; Bastalich et al., 2007).  
119 
 
Furthermore, many of the women were treated as ‘equals’ and ‘one of the boys’ to the extent 
that the males would perform masculinised behaviour in the presence of the females. This was 
justified by the participants, as they would assert that the behaviour is not intentional, but rather 
due to the lack of female presence in the industry. Consequently, as the women do not 
acknowledge the differential treatment, changes cannot be made in the industry to rectify such 
differential treatment, regardless of the behaviour being ‘subtle.’ Contradictory to this, is that 
many of the participants assert that the company’s policies prevent discrimination and a divide 
relating to race and gender, however, women still note issues that form such a divide.    
5.4. Proving Yourself  
Contradictory narratives were reflected in relation to proving oneself as a female engineer or 
proving oneself as an engineer. The narratives noted that a few women felt the need to prove 
themselves as a female engineer, whilst the other few noted the need to prove themselves as an 
engineer. A few of the women that needed to prove themselves as a female engineer noted the 
interception of their race and gender in their experiences as a female engineer, which was 
illustrated in Gibson and Espino’s (2016) study, in which the authors acknowledge the 
intersection of race and gender in the experiences of female engineering student, consequently 
resulting in the women experiencing additional complexities. Other participants noted the 
effect of age and experience relating to the competency of an engineer. Furthermore, these 
women noted that the non-existent role of their gender when being judged as a competent 
engineer. Faulkner (2009) acknowledges the importance of establishing one’s credentials as an 
engineer, regardless of gender, which was evident in the narratives. Therefore, conflicting 
narratives are formed between the participants. Moreover, the acknowledgement of experience 
as an engineer was reflected in many of the participants narratives. Interestingly, the 
participants also noted the preconceived barrier that is formed for female engineers, as women 
120 
 
enter into the industry with preconceived biases and judgements, which may affect their 
experiences as needing to prove themselves as a female engineer, however, may not be existent. 
5.5. Recommendations: 
Due to the masculine culture that is inherent in the field of engineering, business processes and 
practices have been adapted in order to accommodate such culture. As a result, there is an 
absence of values that are likened with femininity, preventing women from thriving in such 
industries. Therefore, it is recommended for engineering organisations to take an objective 
stance on the organisation and to develop and implement processes which include feminine 
and masculine characteristics. Hence, engineering organisations need to develop strategies that 
will accommodate and retain females in such an environment. This can only be implemented 
if organisations view their processes and procedures objectively and understand the adverse 
impact such an environment can have on the retention of females. However, the major concern 
as highlighted in the current research is that female engineers are not acknowledging the toxic 
environment and labelling such as ‘subtle issues.’ Therefore, organisations need to be made 
aware of these issues, despite the subtleness of the concern. If female engineers do not raise 
these concerns, organisations will not be able to advance, as females are attempting to adapt to 
the environment, as noted in the current study.  
A few of the participants acknowledged the importance of a support system in the organisation, 
which will allow for the females to reflect on issues in the organisation and provide support to 
such issues. This will also allow for concerns to be raised in the organisation, therefore, 
improvements can be made to encourage females to enter the engineering environment, as well 
as retain female engineers. Additionally, a mentoring network will be advantageous in a male 
dominated environment, as this will allow for women to express their opinions, especially for 
121 
 
graduate engineers, as this encourage graduate engineers to remain in the industry, due to the 
mentee-mentor relationship. The mentor-mentee relationship will allow for senior engineers to 
become a role model for the junior engineers, which will encourage junior engineers to express 
their concerns and provide solutions to such concerns.  
5.6. Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research 
As the study incorporated a small sample size and relied on snowball sampling, the study 
cannot be generalised to all female engineers. However, significant results did manifest from 
the narratives which women provided, which can be taken into account. As there is a lack of 
South African studies on women in the field of engineering, future studies can be conducted to 
confirm or contradict the research the findings of the study. Furthermore, future studies can 
provide a comprehensive understanding of female engineers. Additionally, follow-up 
interviews were not conducted, due to time constraints. Reliability of the researcher’s 
interpretation of the narrative may have been enhanced, had the women verified the data 
analysis for accuracy. Furthermore, a further limitation is that the researcher was a novice to 
the interview process. In addition, as the study aimed to uncover race and gender, as the 
researcher is a 23-year old white female, this may have implications on the women narrated 
their experiences pertaining to a sensitive issue in South Africa. The researcher was 
substantially younger than the majority of the participants, which may have affected the 
narrations of the engineers, as well as the researcher having minimal understanding on the field 
of engineering. 
It is recommended that future studies investigate men and women in the study, in order to 
obtain a holistic perspective of the field of engineering pertaining to gender and subsequently, 
the power dynamics which are formed due to the ‘masculine’ behaviours that are appropriated 
122 
 
in the field of engineering. A cross-sectional analysis will allow for information to be obtained 
from more participants which will inform holistic interventions.  
5.7. Researchers Reflection 
As the research emerged, I became more and more enmeshed in the participants narratives, 
especially as contradictions arose from the existing literature. Initially, I was perplexed by the 
narratives that I was provided with, however, more and more of the participants had similar 
stories to tell, with the exception of one or two twists, which allowed me to engage even further 
in the narratives. These narratives puzzled me the most in terms of race and gender and how 
the participants would explain their understanding of the intersection of race and gender in their 
reality. Hence, the dynamics pertaining to race and gender was very interesting in relation to 
the current study. When analysing the existing literature, diverse information emerged which 
was not always evident in the narratives of the participants – which was interesting, as 
contradictions emerged between the existing literature and the participants narratives. The 
research has played a role on my experience as an aspiring Industrial Psychologist, as race 
remains a sensitive topic in South Africa, yet the results that emerged from the narratives 
demonstrated some form of positive development. However, this was not generalised across 
all racial groups, therefore, there are still factors that need to be critiqued in the workplace, for 
further development especially in male dominated industries, such as Engineering. It was 
interesting to note how South Africa has developed in terms of racial dynamics for some of the 
participants. However, double marginalisation is still pertinent in contemporary organisations 
as shown in the existing literature, as well as is evident in daily realities, therefore, these can 
be acknowledged as a developmental area for organisations in order to provide an equal work 
environment for both men and women. If organisations develop on such an area, this will allow 
123 
 
for the retention of females in not only male-dominated industries, but all industries, as a safe 
working space will be provided free of discrimination.  
5.8. Conclusion 
In summary, the data that emerged from the participants narratives was diverse and rich and 
when contrasted to the existing literature. The overarching themes that emerged from the data 
include 1) Negotiating the intersection of multiple identities, 2) Mediating the Two Extremes 
and, 3) Proving Yourself. Interesting results yielded from the study when compared to the 
existing literature, these were discussed in relation to the literature, providing a critical analysis 
of the data compared to the existing literature. Recommendations for organisations have also 
been provided based on the data that emerged from the participants narratives. Limitations and 
recommendations for future research have also been provided. Lastly, a researcher’s reflection 
is provided based on the experience that the researcher had throughout the research process.

You are being invited to consider participating in a study that involves research on 
the experiences of female engineers; more specifically how race and gender 
intersect to shape the experiences of female engineers and the aim of the study is to understand 
and uncover the impact thereof. The study is expected to enroll 11 participants (3 white 
females; 3 black females; 3 Indian females and 2 coloured females), 4 engineering sites, as 
well as variety of engineering disciplines, these include mechanical, civil, chemical 
and industrial engineers in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal.  
The duration of your participation if you choose to enrol and remain in the study is expected to

University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban.The purpose of the current study is to examine the complexities that female engineers experience in a male dominated industry. These complexities are compounded further when the element of race is intertwined with their gender. A review of the current literature notes the influence that gendered constructions have on society and therefore, perpetuates into the choices that men and women have based on their gender, especially in terms of appropriate career choices. The research focuses on social constructionism and intersectionality as a theoretical framework. As the study aims to understand the experiences of the female engineers and how their race intersects with their gender, a qualitative analysis was conducted, as it was the most appropriate for the study. Hence, semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine employed female engineers from various companies and engineering sectors. The semi-structured interviews took place from May 2017 to June 2017. A thematic analysis was conducted on the interviews, which formed three focal themes, viz. Negotiating Multiple Identities; The Two Extremes and Proving Yourself.
The nature of the identities in which the participants narrate can be seen as an act of intersection of the various identities, which the participants acknowledged in their narratives. The various identities are viewed as manifestations that form from the social interactions in which the participants immerse themselves in. In addition, the women would note ‘subtle issues’ that would arise in the engineering workplace, which differentiated the women from the men, however, would not acknowledge the severity of the inequality that perpetuated from the differentiation. However, many of the women would acknowledge the positive experiences they have had as a female engineer and were therefore treated as an engineer and not a female engineer","['Thesis', 'Social constructionism.', 'Intersectionality.', 'Female engineers.', 'Sex discrimination in engineering.', 'Industrial psychology.']",disabled

ABSTRACT
Social Engineering has become a significant threat to the security of business, 
government, and academic institutions. As vulnerabilities to social engineering attacks 
increase, organizations must incorporate risk mitigation strategies to their portfolios of 
Information Systems Security Countermeasures (ISSC). The goal is to implement 
mitigation strategies that balance the cost of implementation, the privacy of employees, 
and the resulting expected costs of social engineering attacks. In this paper we develop an 
analytical model that calculates the total cost of protection, including the trade-off 
between the cost of implementing protection strategies and the resulting expected cost of 
social engineering attacks. We use the model to examine the sensitivity of total costs to 
various model parameters, including costs of training, knowledge retention and 
depreciation rate, and number of employees. 
This model builds on prior work from the Ponemon Institute examining the 
economic costs of social engineering attacks and the methods implemented to reduce the 
risk and mitigate the costs of such attacks. In particular, we leverage the empirical 
analysis presented in Ponemon Institute(2015) to develop a model that examines the 
economic impacts of various mitigation strategies and the resulting economic trade-offs. 
This works illustrates that knowledge and awareness among users is an effective method 
for controlling social engineering threats. The scenarios highlighted in this work 
illustrated how costs play a role in protection using knowledge as a countermeasure and 
found the most cost-effective solutions using the same model used by Ponemon(2015). 
v 
 
This analysis may help companies develop efficient ways to protect themselves from 
social engineering attacks while efficiently managing resources in the social engineering 
realm.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL ENIGNEERING
Overview of Social Engineering in Cyber Space 
Information Technology (IT) Security is of growing importance to businesses, 
governments, and academics. Rapid advancements in technology have been a double-
edged sword – on the one hand providing attackers more opportunities to breach security 
while on the other hand providing defenders tools to prevent, detect, and address security 
breaches. When an organization quantifies its level of IT security, they often attempt to 
measure the success rate of detection or prevention of security threats created by a 
particular technology. While this may depict the security of a system from a network 
perspective, it does not accurately reflect the effectiveness of the security system in the 
presence of social engineering. Social Engineering is the use of relationships with people 
to attain a goal - in this case, obtaining access to or knowledge of a protected system. 
Social engineering essentially bypasses technological protections (e.g., firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems) altogether. Technologies implemented to provide security, 
automated or not, will at some point require human-computer interaction (HCI). These 
interactions provide an opportunity for social engineers to gain important information 
that gives them access a system and its data. Therefore, social engineering can be 
specifically defined as the methods of influencing users to divulge sensitive information 
or performing a task that may present an unforeseen threat to the security of a system. 
This threat vector is one of the few in which the threat is not necessarily an insider threat, 
 2   
 
but could be linked to honest users with limited understanding of the consequences of 
their actions. Common examples of social engineering include spearfishing attacks, 
pretexting, baiting, and quid pro quo attacks. These attacks involve a social engineer 
preying on the trust of a user to provide information that will enable the social engineer to 
infiltrate a secured system. The user may not even be aware of the attack since these 
attacks are typically embedded in personal interactions with a seemingly non-threatening 
individual (such as a customer). Social engineering presents a substantial, often ignored, 
threat to the security of IT systems and thus must be considered when organizations build 
their portfolio of Information Systems Security Countermeasures (ISSC).  
The vulnerability to the risk of social engineering is based on the human 
component and can be linked to the lack of knowledge of best practices for technology 
use and protection by the growing base of technology users. According to Natalie Ebner 
[11] older adults are more susceptible to these kinds of attacks due to declines in 
cognitive functions and deception sensitivity. The human component of protection is 
vested in the knowledge of the person using the system.  
 
Human Interaction 
The user is one of the most important factors affecting the security of a system. In the 
2017 Data Breach Investigations Report (2017 DBIR) produced by Verizon, there has 
been substantial growth in the use of social attacks to breach security since 2010; in fact, 
43% of all security attacks in 2017 involved social engineering. Most individuals that 
work around security related information must obtain clearance prior to obtaining access 
to systems. Social engineering seeks to take advantage of the human-computer interaction 
 3   
 
by encouraging users to deliver information that may help the social engineer infiltrate a 
network. The human aspect of an ISSC cannot be overlooked due to the severity of the 
consequences. One uninformed user that falls prey to social engineering may generate 
substantial financial harm for a company and its stakeholders (e.g., customers, suppliers, 
distributors). According to the 2017 DBIR, only 20% of users falling prey to a phishing 
attack reported the suspicious activity as required by company policy. The 2016 Cost of 
Cyber Crime Study & the Risk of Business Innovation reports in their study that 70% of 
the companies surveyed experienced phishing and social engineering attacks on a 
worldwide scale. Phishing and social engineering accounted for 15% of the cyber-crime 
costs in the U.S. or approximately $2.6 million per company.  
While users are often entrusted to avoid compromising a secured system or 
improperly disseminating protected information, these same users often do not 
understand the importance or their role in information security (Hong, 2012).  For 
example, many users are susceptible to attackers who impersonate another employee 
(e.g., upper management) to generate an action or obtain some information from the 
victim. One popular example was the attack on Ubiquiti Networks in 2015. In this case, 
an email spoofing attack successfully convinced employees to transfer up to $46.7 
million dollars to a third party overseas account – all without the employees taking 
additional steps to confirm the identity of the requester. Threats like these have leveraged 
the growing reliance of companies on technology – targeting users with links, on social 
media and in emails, that seemingly from the user the attacker is impersonating. While 
advances in technological security on some devices has helped to automate the detection 
of some of these attacks, defenses always lag behind attacks, leaving the user as the first 
 4   
 
line of detection. Regardless of the situation, the problem either begins or ends with the 
user.  
As highlighted in Trim (2013) the human operator is susceptible to not only phishing 
attacks (as described above) but also other security attacks such as shoulder surfing, 
dumpster diving, reverse social engineering, and baiting: 
 Phishing - duping an e-mail user to reveal personal or confidential information 
which the scammer can use illicitly. 
 Shoulder Surfing – looking over someone’s shoulder to capture information. 
 Dumpster Diving – obtaining sensitive information, by sifting through discarded 
materials, that can be used to compromise a system. 
 Reverse Social Engineering – setting up a scenario in which the victim would rely 
on the attacker to aid them in solving a problem; in this case the attacker 
impersonates someone who could help - e.g., an IT Help Desk representative. 
 Baiting – leaving a malware infected device in a location where a targeted victim 
can find it. 
 
Potential victims of a social engineering attacks must be aware of the type of attacks 
(see above), the sources/methods of each attack, and the consequences of attack.  As 
shown in Figure 1.1, there are many different sources of a social engineering attack.  
According to Junger, “An important advice is that users need more knowledge about how 
attackers operate, hence user education is necessary. In developing user education, it is 
important to determine priorities, teaching everything may amount to learning nothing 
much.”  Such education is likely an important element of an ISSC portfolio that may 
 5   
 
reduce the likelihood that a user inadvertently becomes a victim of social engineering. 
 
Figure 1.1 Attack Vectors (from Trim & Upton 2013) [10] 
 
But in whom do we invest education? Simply, everyone. Every person ranging 
from the CEO of the company to the janitor that never touches a computer must 
understand how their behaviors affect an organization’s vulnerability to cybersecurity 
attack. Every individual in a company presents some form of social engineering threat to 
the company. For instance, an individual without access to any system may 
unintentionally deliver a bad USB to a target because someone asked them to do so. 
“The Cost of Phishing and Value of Employee Training” report presented by the 
Ponemon Institute revealed that the majority of the costs associated with a successful 
phishing attack performed is related to losses in employee productivity. According to the 
report, for an organization of approximately 9,552 users, at the expected average annual 
 6   
 
cost of phishing in 2015 was $3.77 million; productivity loss was expected to account for 
48% of the loss. The report further implies implementing an annual training program that 
yields a 47.75% net improvement will lead to a 50% reduction in total costs or 
approximately $188.40 per employee/user. The rate of return is great based on their 
parameters, but this is not a universal rate of return nor is it representative of all learning 
styles. 
 
The Social Engineering Cycle  
The design and execution of a social engineering attack tends to follow a general 
framework. The social engineer begins by formulating an attack with a goal. The 
information gathering cycle follows and the attacker begins identifying information about 
its target until the information is actionable. The preparation then begins for the attack 
vector (Trim, 2013) and victim. The attacker then develops a relationship with its victim 
and tries to use that relationship to exploit the victim to attain the desired goal. Based on 
prior events, the end users should be educated to help them recognize the signs of social 
engineering. 
 
Rating an ISSC 
An Information Systems Security Countermeasure (ISSC) portfolio (Kumar, 
2008) protects a system from threats, reduces downtime, and enables system restoration. 
Factors that affect the optimal ISSC portfolio include the cost and effectiveness of the 
 7   
 
countermeasure, the economic impact of a successful attack, and the probability of a 
threat (Kumar,2008). Kumar (2008) calculates the optimal countermeasure portfolio 
based on a specific objective – for example, minimizing worst-case costs versus 
minimizing expected costs. For an ISSC portfolio to remain effective, it must adapt with 
the changing methods of attacks.  
Assessing the Social Engineering Threats 
Analyzing the risk of a successful social engineering attack comes down to threat 
recognition. Can the user recognize the threat as it is occurring? For socially engineered 
attacks, can knowledge be used to combat these threats? Using knowledge as a 
countermeasure requires the user to draw on their knowledge of what a threat is and how 
to respond to them should they occur. Knowledge without application does not benefit 
the ISSC. In order for this awareness to be recognized and utilized regularly, users need 
to be trained. This training, when bestowed upon users, will serve to empower the users 
to leverage their newfound knowledge in practice. The training provided to the users 
should be recurring to improve their ability to recognize the threats as recognized in 
Knowledge and Practice in Business and Organizations[14]. This will provide users a 
chance to continually build upon their knowledge or at a minimum keep up with changes 
in the social engineering attacks the user may experience.  
The goal is to build individual knowledge and awareness on the subject in order to 
understand what the users of a system know about threats and quantify/identify 
weaknesses in their knowledge. 
 8   
 
 
Figure 1.2: The triangular relationship between power, knowledge, and practice [14] 
The concept of an observed score for each user can then be developed to represent more 
accurately what a user has learned while taking into account items such as overestimating 
or undervaluing the points assigned to a problem. The observed score can then be used as 
a basic baseline of the user’s understanding of social engineering. Further evaluation can 
then be used to identify what the user base may see as a more significant risk to the 
system using a scoring scale. The scoring scale would consider user responses to 
questions to understand their level of understanding about certain subjects. Once the 
administrator is able to identify a pattern, she can then use the emails or reminders to fill 
the knowledge gaps identified by the graded approaches. This is extremely important to a 
network of systems where user A may have access to several systems whereas user B 
may have access to only one of the systems to which user A has access. 
 9   
 
 
Training in Cyber Security 
Training is an important aspect of many jobs to ensure that employees learn and 
maintain up-to-date knowledge related to their roles and jobs at their company. With the 
growth in technology integration across multiple industries, training in cyber security or 
best security practices in general has become equally as important to companies 
regardless of industry (2017 DBIR). Training helps individuals better prepare themselves 
for responding to cyber disasters or identify potential threats prior to the realization of 
any damage. The learning from training can take many forms based on the National 
Training Laboratories, Learning Pyramid (Strauss, 2013): 
1. Lecture – Lectures commonly involve an education talk to a group of 
listeners. The knowledge retention rate is averaged to be 5%. 
Figure 1.3 Example of Social Engineering Scheme 
 10   
 
2. Reading – Reading comes in many forms such as email, newsletters, 
reports, etc. Reading information averages a 10% knowledge retention. 
3. Audio/Visual – Videos and other forms of multimedia fills this niche and 
provide an average knowledge retention rate of 20%. 
4. Demonstration – A demonstrator/instructor is demonstrating an 
experiment or process to the viewer. The average knowledge retention rate 
is 30%. 
5. Discussion Group – This involves the students gathering and discussing 
the subject at large while providing an average retention rate of 50%. 
6. Practice by Doing – The student performs the desired actions to get the 
desired outcome. The average knowledge retention rate of practice is 75%. 
7. Teach Others/Immediate Use – Making the student the instructor can yield 
an average 90% knowledge retention rate for the student teaching.  
Based on the Learning Pyramid, we see the many modes of teaching and their “expected” 
retention rates. Using these expected retention rates, we can deduce the associated 
improvement rate and potential costs and time commitment of each.  
The Associated Costs of Training 
When considering the economic implications of training users, we must consider 
the cost of a successful attack, the costs to train each user, and the rate of return that one 
will receive. The underlying variable that directly impacts all costs is time lost to low or 
no productivity for each user. The time needed to prepare, disseminate, and evaluate 
social engineering training is an important resource that organizations need to manage to 
 11   
 
maximize the rate of return. There is a need for balance between the cost of training the 
users and total cost of the attacks mitigated and with that balance an organization can 
defend itself without exceeding an optimal rate of return. Another important factor when 
considering the cost of training is the knowledge depreciation of users or the organization 
over time. The knowledge depreciation can be caused by numerous factors such as user 
turnover or natural depreciation among the users. If the knowledge depreciation rate is 
high, then more time/money needs to be invested in ensuring the knowledge retention 
rate can support the depreciation.  
The Economic Cost Model 
 The total rate of return for training investment is a function of the cost of the 
attacks being mitigated in the year divided by the total cost of providing training. The 
cost of attacks, as calculated by Ponemon(2015), involved calculating the cost to contain 
malware, the cost of malware not contained, productivity lost due to phishing, the cost to 
contain credential compromises, and the costs of credential compromises not contained. 
The cost of attacks mitigated can be calculated by finding the product of the net 
improvement in knowledge and the initial annual costs of attacks (Ponemon 2015). Net 
improvement is calculated by the total improvement provided by the training multiplied 
by the knowledge depreciation rate. The cost of training is equal to the time invested into 
creating and disseminating the training and the cost of training materials/ knowledge 
retention. Time, in this model, will include the time lost in productivity and the time lost 
in implementation. These parameters can be manipulated year to year to model the 
changes in an organization; the rate of return from year to year can shift depending upon 
 12   
 
the cost of social engineering attacks, the knowledge depreciation rate, and the cost of 
training. The models discussed within look to provide further insight into how these 
parameters affect the effectiveness and the associated cost of using training to deter social 
engineering. 
The Modeling Problem 
 Understanding the how to maximize the value of training for users is necessary 
for managers to make a determination in how to approach training (2015 Ponemon 
Institute). As seen in the previous section, there are several parameters that can play a 
role in determining the effectiveness of various training methods. This evaluation must be 
conducted periodically due to changes in attack methods and changes in costs. The cases 
examined further in the next chapter of this paper will explore how each of these 
parameters can impact the rate of return for organizations.

CHAPTER 2 
MODELING KNOWLEDGE AS A COUNTERMEASURE 
 
We model how knowledge and costs play a role in the selection of training 
methods to prevent and mitigate social engineering attacks. The model will take the 
aforementioned variables and demonstrate their relationships in practical application. The 
model will have one hundred users that require training. Case 1 will examine the 
correlation between cost of training parameters, time and knowledge retention, versus the 
cost effectiveness as the cost of training increases. Case 1 also looks at the expected net 
improvement as the knowledge depreciation rate among users increases. This case takes 
Table 2.1 and 2.2 to demonstrate the tradeoffs between the amount of money one can 
invest into training and the average knowledge depreciation rate of the users. Case 2 will 
examine the expected average rate of return and the cost effectiveness when given the 
different learning retention rates as presented by the Learning Pyramid (Strauss, 2013) 
and with assigned costs to each learning method. Case 2 seeks to find the practical cost 
effectiveness and rate of return of the learning methods to identify the most optimal 
method to utilize in a real world application by applying the same methods used by the 
Ponemon Institute (2015) to evaluate the utility in training users against social 
engineering attacks.  
 
 15   
 
Assumptions 
When working with people there are a lot of variables that can deviate at random 
and drastically such as memory loss, illness, or personality that cannot be accounted for 
by simulation. However, in this model we assumei each individual user is healthy, 
rational, and able to use solid judgement with proper knowledge. None of the users have 
malicious intent or seek to compromise the components. The users are adequetely trained 
to perform their job role on the component(s) they are allowed to access. 
The next assumption is that each of the learning/ training methods are going to 
take roughly an hour to participate in for the user. This eliminates the ambiguity of how 
much time will be lost in productivity from user to user or the organization as a whole. 
This also means that we are assuming that the time to learn something for each user keeps 
each user within the allotted average from the Learning Pyramid. The users will receive 
the same benefits from the training.  
The final assumption is the Learning Pyramid’s accuracy and legitimacy in 
organizational learning. The learning pyramid has been challenged in its accurate 
approximation of the knowledge retention of users and their wide use of the methods. In 
this model, the methods are aligned with the way that learning method would be closely 
approached by an organization. 
Case 1: Globally Evaluating the Model 
 Given the average knowledge retention rates based on the learning pyramid, linear 
trends are expected as shown in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. For Table 2.2, we illustrate the cost 
of attack as the 3.8 million annual average found in the 2015 Ponemon Institue Report. 
 16   
 
From the trends, it is evident that ,in all cases, the higher knowledge retention rates, 
primarily the practice by doing and discussion group methods, will prove the most 
rewarding. Since knowledge depreciation is treated as a global variable among users, the 
knowledge retention rates can be the driver for maximizing net improvement. The issue 
with accepting these results is the real world practicality. In the application of these 
results, it is important to acknowledge the different learning methods will not all cost the 
same at any given time e.g. to implement the reading method may be as cheap and simple 
as sending an email while practice by doing may require an outside firm to train the 
employees which could cost significantly more; reading cost effectiveness is greater at 
$500 than practice by doing cost effectiveness at $10,000. 
Case 2: Applying Knowledge Retention Costs 
 Acknowledging the real world issue, the models used in this case analysis will be 
approximations based on sources. The demonstration and the teaching others methods 
have been left out of the model due to either inconclusive approximations of costs or due 
to the productivity time lost would be too great to a fairly approximate. Utilizing the costs 
of training, Table 2.4 and 2.5 show how cost effectiveness can tell a different story when 
given the parameters of costs of training. The cost effectiveness of reading is far superioir 
than all other methods due to the ease of electronic publication and/or electronic 
messaging. The cost effectiveness of reading could have been lower in some other forms 
e.g. providing physical communications to each user. Although reading is the most cost 
effective method, it still yields the second lowest rate of return. The other drawbacks of 
the reading method is guaranteeing the users will read/receive the electronic 
 17   
 
communication. The secondmost cost effective method is the practice by doing method 
which provides the highest rate of return through knowledge depreciation.

CHAPTER 3 
CONCLUSION OF RESULTS 
Conclusion 
The use of user knowledge as a countermeasure is an important part of every 
ISSC that needs to be approached carefully to maximize the deterrence of social 
engineering attacks. Using the models provided, an organization can decide how to 
approach user training in a practical real-world application. The models demonstrate that 
based on the knowledge retention rates provided there is a linear relationship between the 
cost of training and the expected improvement regardless of the knowledge depreciation 
rate of the users, yet the knowledge depreciation rate directly affects the cost 
effectiveness of the training provided.  
For future research, there are several aspects of the application of the models that 
can be expanded on. The first thing to expand on is the learning methods and their 
accuracy; determining the exact methods that are encompassed in the methods or if the 
learning retentions can be further expanded upon for newer learning methods. The second 
thing to consider is the impacts of the communication channels utilized for providing the 
knowledge e.g. physical/in-person delivery versus electronic or remote training. The third 
item to further investigate is how year to year rate of returns may shift due to knowledge 
retention, a potential knowledge cap in the users, or a higher turnover rate of users. 
Finally, maximizing the rate of return by mixing the training methods based on the 
likelihood of a user being targeted for a specific attack. It is important to gauge an 
 24   
 
individual’s “need to know” basis for training to limit unnecessary training costs; role 
based training may produce better cost effectiveness overall.

As vulnerabilities to social engineering attacks increase, organizations must incorporate risk mitigation strategies to their portfolios of Information Systems Security Countermeasures (ISSC). The goal is to implement mitigation strategies that balance the cost of implementation, the privacy of employees, and the resulting expected costs of social engineering attacks. In this paper we develop an analytical model that calculates the total cost of protection, including the trade-off between the cost of implementing protection strategies and the resulting expected cost of social engineering attacks. We use the model to examine the sensitivity of total costs to various model parameters, including costs of training, knowledge retention and depreciation rate, and number of employees.
This model builds on prior work from the Ponemon Institute examining the economic costs of social engineering attacks and the methods implemented to reduce the risk and mitigate the costs of such attacks. In particular, we leverage the empirical analysis presented in Ponemon Institute(2015) to develop a model that examines the economic impacts of various mitigation strategies and the resulting economic trade-offs. This works illustrates that knowledge and awareness among users is an effective method for controlling social engineering threats. The scenarios highlighted in this work illustrated how costs play a role in protection using knowledge as a countermeasure and found the most cost-effective solutions using the same model used by Ponemon(2015). This analysis may help companies develop efficient ways to protect themselves from social engineering attacks while efficiently managing resources in the social engineering realm","['text', 'Social Engineering', 'Knowledge Measured', 'Security', 'Countermeasure', 'Business, Engineering, Management', 'Engineering', 'Management Information Systems']",disabled

Abstract 
A career in science or engineering is not among the top choices of Canadian students. Although 
there is no current imbalance in demand and supply of engineers and scientists in Canada, it is 
also true that the global need for these skills is currently at its peak with substantial future growth 
opportunities. With competition from emerging economies like India and China, it is essential 
for government, schools and universities, and other agencies in the Canadian education system to 
understand the factors influencing Canadian students’ participation in post-secondary degree in 
engineering. Review of the literature shows that there has been limited investigation of this 
phenomenon. Using a cross-sectional survey design, this study, set in the Newfoundland 
Labrador context, examines certain demographic, family, high school, societal, economic, and 
personal factors that play a role in students’ academic decisions to pursue an undergraduate 
engineering degree. The findings show that participation in undergraduate engineering programs 
at Memorial University is associated with student’s family background and gender. Students 
from lower socio-economic backgrounds and women are underrepresented in undergraduate 
engineering education in Newfoundland and Labrador. The results also reveal that engineering 
student represent their decisions to pursue engineering as influenced primarily by personal 
factors and only marginally by school-level factors. The study points to a number of implications 
for policy and practice. Among the policy actions that could increase the number of engineering 
students from underrepresented groups is reexamining and, where necessary substantially 
improving support programs for underrepresented populations – both at the secondary and post-
secondary levels.  At the school level, this might involve greater attention to engaging students in 
STEM-based experiential activities and programs, explicitly exposing students to information on 
careers in engineering and the applied sciences, and professional development for teachers and

counselors. At the post-secondary level, financial support to students from underrepresented 
groups and continued research in the area of engineering education may increase participation in 
engineering and help create equitable educational opportunities in the field of engineering for 
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

Chapter One- Introduction of the Study 
1.1 Background 
 “How many of Canada’s young people do we need to embrace science? 
 All of them.” (AMGEN-Let’s talk science, 2012, p.8) 
This quote captures the sense of urgency expressed by some organizations about the need 
to refocus learning in ways that can help Canada prosper in a technology-driven world economy. 
It is a general understanding that our skilled society makes a critical contribution to Canada’s 
prosperity, however, there remains uncertainty about precisely which skills are needed to thrive 
in tomorrow’s economy. In a complex and uncertain global economy, human capacity in STEM 
(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) related fields is generally considered to be 
one of the major contributors to Canada’s economic competitiveness and productivity (Dodge et 
al., 2015). 
The AMGEN/ Let’s Talk Science study states that there appears to be a severe 
detachment between Canadians’ belief in the value of science to society and adolescents’ desire 
to pursue a career in STEM (AMGEN-Let’s talk science, 2014). According to Orpwood, 
Schmidt, and Hu (2012), although Canadian students do understand the significance of science 
and technology to Canada’s future, the majority of them are not inclined to make career in those 
areas. The 2010 Angus Reid survey of Canadian students between 16 and 18 years of age, 
concluded that only a third of the participants were drawn towards taking a single science related 
course at the university level (AMGEN-Let’s talk science, 2014). Canadian youths believe that, 
“people who work in science aren’t cool” (QMI Agency, 2010).

Canada’s capacity to fulfill labour market demand in STEM related fields and to promote 
innovation has been a matter of particular concern for governments, policy-makers, educators 
and businesses. In spite of the fact that Canada spends a higher percentage of its Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) on education than the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development) average, many other OECD countries are doing better in terms of motivating 
students to study STEM degrees (Statistics Canada, 2014; The Conference Board of Canada, 
2014). The Conference board of Canada report suggests that, despite low numbers of science 
graduates, there is no shortage at the labour market level in Canada. However, a major concern 
for Canada as well as U.S., is the inability to keep up with emerging powers such as India and 
China, which are producing STEM graduates at an ever-increasing rate; this may have 
implications for innovation in the future. China and India give significant importance to STEM 
education, which helps them to develop the workforce, sufficient to fulfill domestic as well as 
global demands for these skills. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(2015) suggested that these countries could contribute more than 60% of the G20 workforce with 
STEM credentials by 2030.  
In context of the U.S., multiple studies which explored the achievement disparities 
between the U.S. and higher-performing countries found that American students are 
disadvantaged on various aspects that affect mathematics and science achievement (Xie, Fang, & 
Shauman, 2015). These aspects include national cultural traditions related to math and science 
(Cogan & Schmidt, 2002; Fang, Grant, Xu, Stronge, & Ward, 2013; Stevenson & Stigler, 1992), 
family and school support to emphasizing math and science education (Fuchs & Wößmann, 
2007; Sousa, Park, & Armor, 2012; Tsui, 2005), the educational system structure and national 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
3 
labour market conditions (Langen & Dekkers 2005), and cross-country disparities in curriculum 
and style of instruction (NCES, 2000, 2006; Schmidt, 2012).  
Thus, it is important to explain and explore the factors that enable students to choose 
science and engineering as a career in Canada and the United States.  
Even a quarter century ago there were calls for the education system in Canada to 
produce more scientists and engineers. Slemon, in his 1993 report addressed the future 
importance of engineering and science education in Canada: 
Canada's future prosperity and quality of life will depend in large measure on the 
incorporation of superior skill, intelligence and added value into its products and services 
while establishing a sound basis for a sustainable global environment. Professional 
engineers can play important roles in creating high-quality employment, establishing new 
enterprises, restructuring existing processes and developing new products and services. 
The basis for excellence in the engineering profession is excellence in the system of 
engineering education at undergraduate, graduate and career levels. It is imperative that 
this education system evolve effectively to meet these changing needs of Canadian 
society. (p. i) 
Since 1993, the world has come a long way in terms of scientific discoveries and 
innovations. However, the need of engineering and applied science still exists more than ever. 
The Council of Canadian Academics (2014, p. xiii) articulates very well how science and 
technological innovation have helped transform the society in the last two decades: 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING

Science is a fundamental part of Canadian culture and society, affecting nearly every 
aspect of individual and social life. It is a driving force in the economy, catalyzing 
innovation and creating new goods, services, and industries. It has led to improvements in 
Canadians’ physical health and well-being. It has made possible new forms of 
communication and learning, and changed how Canadians interact and relate to one 
another. It also provides opportunities for leisure and entertainment as Canadians visit 
science centres, pursue science-related hobbies, or tune in to such television programs as 
“The Nature of Things” or “Découverte”. Science is also a systematic means of discovery 
and exploration that enriches our individual and collective understanding of the world and 
universe around us.  
Some researchers argue that there is no evidence of a current imbalance between the 
demand and supply of engineers and physical scientists in the national labour market level in 
Canada (Dodge et. al., 2015); however, it is also true that immigrants hold more than half of all 
STEM-related credentials in Canada (Ferguson & Zhao, 2013). It is therefore important for 
Canadian educators and policymakers to understand how young Canadians choose to pursue an 
engineering degree and what influences them to do so.  
There are numerous studies on how students make decisions to pursue higher education 
and the factors influencing them (Eidimtas & Juceviciene, 2014; Hanson & Litten, 1982; Hossler 
& Gallaghar, 1987; Jackson, 1982; Kotler & Keller, 2009; Schiffman & Kanuk, 2007). These 
focus towards understanding students’ buying behavior in higher education and how their 
decision to choose a specific college is influenced as a consumer. There still remains a gap in 
literature about investigating factors that influence students to pursue a degree in engineering and 
applied sciences. Xie et al. (2015), suggested that, “STEM education is distinctive because it is 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING

required for science or engineering employment. While it is possible, indeed common, for 
someone with STEM education to pursue a career outside of science and engineering, it is very 
difficult for someone without STEM education to pursue a career in STEM (p. 4).” There are 
valid reasons to consider that the societal determinants of the attraction to STEM education and 
to science and engineering careers may be different from those of education in general (Xie & 
Killewald, 2012; Xie & Shauman, 2003; Xie, 1989). Hence, there is a need for research to 
identify factors that promote student engagement and achievement in STEM areas (Xie et al., 
2015).  In the Canadian (Newfoundland and Labrador) context, my interests are to strengthen our 
knowledge base in this research area, those a study of the personal, social and economic factors 
that influence/motivate students to study engineering and applied science,  
1.2 Purpose of the Study 
The purpose of this thesis is to investigate specific factors that influence the decision-
making process of undergraduate engineering students in Newfoundland and Labrador. In this 
study participants are undergraduate engineering students, and have already gone through the 
process of decision-making. They have made a choice to pursue a degree in engineering and 
applied sciences which means that they have already gone through the process described by 
Eidimtas and Juceviciene (2014) as ‘study choice’ and made a post-secondary program decision. 
Through descriptive survey-based research my intention is to determine students’ perceptions of 
the role of certain family, high-school, social, personal, economic factors (see Table 1 and Figure 
2) on their decision to pursue a degree in engineering or applied science.

1.4 Significance of the Study 
Although there have been multiple studies about the decision-making process among 
students and what factors influence the process, very few directly investigated the decision to 
pursue a degree in engineering and applied sciences in Canada. Even though this study will only 
focus on one university in Newfoundland and Labrador, it will provide useful context-specific 
information on the factors that students believe play a role in their decision to pursue a degree in 
engineering and applied sciences.  
Some of the people and organizations that may benefit from the outcomes of this study 
are: Faculty of Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland; educators at secondary 
and post-secondary levels, researchers working in STEM education; educational policy-makers; 
school administrators and teachers; non-school education organizations; organizations promoting 
STEM literacy; and parents and family members. 
1.5 Organization of the Study 
This research study is organized into six successive chapters, a reference section, and 
appendix as follows:  
Chapter One: Introduction of the Study: The aim of this chapter is to develop a 
background understanding of the topic and what I am trying to achieve by carrying out this 
study. This chapter also inform the readers about the research questions and significance of this

area of post-secondary academic decision-making process and factors influencing the process. It 
also identifies specific gaps in the literature, one of which this study seeks to fill. 
Chapter Three: Methodology and Data Collection: This chapter presents the research 
methodology used in this study. I discuss the reasons behind my choice of a specific research 
method, what instrument was used to collect data, what kind of data were collected, who were 
the participants, and data handling procedures.

Chapter Two- Literature Review 
There is limited literature directly addressing the factors influencing students’ choice to 
pursue a degree in engineering and applied science, but the overall decision-making in higher 
education has been studied for decades by many researchers in social sciences (Eidimtas & 
Juceviciene, 2014; Hanson & Litten, 1982; Hossler & Gallaghar, 1987; Jackson, 1982; Kotler & 
Keller, 2009; Schiffman & Kanuk, 2007). My journey of writing this literature review was 
dynamic, which included multiple stages and going back and forth throughout my thesis 
timeline. My major sources of information were Memorial University of Newfoundland’s 
physical and online library database, Google scholar, and grey literature such as Engineers 
Canada, Let’s Talk Science, and Statistics Canada reports. I started with an internet search using 
the search phrases, ‘decision-making and higher education’, and ‘academic decision-making 
process’. I read abstracts of peer reviewed research papers that came up on the search and 
downloaded the ones that were relevant for my study. Review of literature papers and references 
section of relevant peer reviewed papers provided an important list of further readings that 
helped me to develop my understanding about the previous research work done in the area of 
academic decision-making. Further, keyword searches like ‘factors influencing decision-making 
in higher education’, ‘parental factors and academic choice’, ‘school factors influencing 
academic choice’, ‘factors affecting post-secondary academic choice’, yielded results about the 
influencing factors and I examined relevant studies that came up. Grey literature in form of 
reports by Statistics Canada, Engineers Canada, Let’s Talk Science, even though were 
contextually limited, provided empirical data to develop an objective picture of the literature in 
Canadian and provincial context. Also because of the lack of studies in Canada, studied from 
United States were also reviewed. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING

On the basis on the literature collected, I divided this literature review into six sections. 
First, I introduce the status of higher education in Newfoundland and Labrador. Then, I examine 
key elements in the post-secondary decision-making process and review the general literature 
around factors and influences associated with a school leaver’s decision to pursue higher 
education. Next, I examine literature around determinants of decision-making in higher 
education.  In the fourth section I highlight the results of two recent studies by Engineers Canada 
that provided empirical data around postsecondary decision making in context of engineering 
and applied science. In the fifth section, I situate the research in overall context, and then finally 
conclude the literature review with a brief summary. 
2.1. Higher-Education in Newfoundland and Labrador and the Status of STEM Education 
Across Canada 
Although post-secondary education is highly desired amongst schoolchildren, with 50 to 
60 percent aspiring to one or more university degrees, only about 30 per cent actually apply to 
universities in Canada (Junor & Usher, 2004). The government of Newfoundland and Labrador 
(NL) in its labor market outlook for next ten years predicted a decline in the number of graduates 
(Department of Human Resources, Labour and Employment, 2011). In Newfoundland and 
Labrador, undergraduate enrollments have been declining for more than a decade. As of October 
2016, there were 12,227 students enrolled in undergraduate studies in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, an 8.24% decline from 1st October 2006 (13,325). Undergraduate enrollments in other 
Atlantic universities have fallen since 2012 with declines of 2.1%, 13.26%, and 3.5%, for Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island respectively (Association of Atlantic 
Universities, 2016). Of those students opting to pursue university programs a very small 
percentage of degrees are awarded in engineering and applied sciences (The Conference Board 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
12 
of Canada, 2014). In Newfoundland and Labrador, the undergraduate enrollment in engineering 
has declined by 5.5% since 2013 (Atlantic Common University Data Set, 2013; T. Coley, 
Student Engagement and Retention Project Coordinator-Faculty of Engineering, Memorial 
University of Newfoundland, personal communication, January 17, 2017). In the final report of 
the panel on status of public education in Newfoundland and Labrador, the dean in the Faculty of 
Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland predicted a shortage of engineers in 
Canada by 2020 (Sheppard & Anderson, 2016). 
Some organizations have taken the position that a lack of interest in engineering and 
applied sciences at university level can be traced to perceptions of STEM subjects among 
intermediate-secondary students. In a recent survey among 818 Canadian students between the 
age of 13 and 17, results show that more than two third think that science is fun and STEM is 
important for adult life. Similarly, 78% think that STEM offers many career options, however, 
when it comes to pursuing science as a career, only one in five students express major interest in 
pursuing science in post-secondary level and only one in ten was extremely interested in working 
in science related areas (AMGEN-Let’s Talk Science, 2014). A 2014 report by The Conference 
Board of Canada states that there is a relationship between the number of STEM graduates and 
future Canadian economic prosperity. Despite a decade of innovation agendas and prosperity 
reports, Canada was graded an overall D in the percentage of engineering graduates and six 
provinces were graded D-. Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador were the top two 
performing provinces with C grades (The Conference Board of Canada, 2014). 
2.2. Decision-Making in Higher Education  
There are a multitude of variables affecting a student’s decision to pursue postsecondary 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
13 
education and to choose a specific field of study after completing high school which include the 
interaction of values and attitudes that are shaped by individual’s environment, family and peers 
(Cheung, 2007). There is a wealth of literature centered on student decision making as it relates 
to higher education. Many of these studies frame career decision making as a complex and multi-
phase process (Băcilă, Dorel, & Alexandra-Maria, 2009; Brennan, 2001; Hossler, Schmit, & 
Vesper, 1999; Kusumawati, Yanamandram, & Perera, 2010; Shankle, 2009). Students’ decisions 
are seen to be based on their past experiences, how they have constructed their belief systems 
and worldviews about the value of higher education generally, and their chosen field of study, 
specifically. 
To understand the stages of decision-making that students go through, Hossler and 
Gallagher’s framework of college choice is a useful starting point. Hossler and Gallagher (1987) 
developed a model of the process of college choice that theorized the college-choice process as 
taking place in three stages: predisposition, search, and choice. This model does not exclusively 
focus upon the attributes of students. It also considers the nature of post-secondary education 
choices and some organizational elements at the pre-college and college levels. Within this 
model, predisposition is defined as the stage after graduating high school when students create a 
plan for higher education attainment. Within this developmental stage, the emphasis is upon the 
decision to do something, that is, to go to college. The search stage deals with looking for and 
evaluating colleges/universities in which a student potentially might enroll. Within this stage 
students formulate a list of colleges and universities that they may find suitable.  
Some scholars distinguish between two types of career information search processes 
undertaken by youth decision makers, namely internal and external searches (Barber, Dodd, & 
Kolyesnikova, 2009; Yamamoto, 2006). They define internal search as a process that is based 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
14 
upon students’ personal experiences and involve no interference from any other individual or 
institution. If internal search doesn’t offer a clear understanding during the decision-making 
process, student seeks information from external sources that may involve: personal sources- like 
friends, family, extended family, career planning counselors, reference groups and public 
opinion leaders; and independent sources – such as user groups, governmental institutions and 
the mass media (Al‐Yousef, 2009; Perna, 2006; Strauss, 1998). Finally, in the choice stage 
students make a choice of college. 
These stages are important to get a general sense of decision making process among 
students. It is important to note, however, that this study does not seek to analyze how students 
decide whether to attend college, but what factors they believe influenced their decision to 
pursue an engineering degree. Eidimtas and Juceviciene (2014) reviewed the literature around 
various college choice frameworks and concluded that school leaver’s choice of studies is a 
result of four successive stages which are: need identification, information search, evaluation of 
alternatives, and choice (Hossler & Gallagher, 1987; Kotler, 2000; Moogan & Baron, 2003). At 
each of these stages, school-leavers are influenced by multiple factors. These factors were 
divided into four major categories: educational factors, information factors, economic factors and 
other factors. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING

Figure 2: Study choice model. Adapted from Eidimtas and Juceviciene (2014) 
Within this process of study choice model (Figure 2), the need identification is the state 
where the school leaver realises that secondary school is not sufficient and he/she develops a 
thought about the need to pursue higher education. During the information search stage, school-
leavers start considering various possibilities of post-secondary education institutions. This may 
include creating a list of colleges and accumulating relevant information. The information

gathered in this stage is used in the next step. During the evaluation of alternatives stage, 
depending on personal abilities, the student determines whether each alternative conforms to 
purposes and consequences of the decision (Hossler et al., 1999). Finally, in the choice stage, the 
student decides to make a selection of the program and the institution. 
The process of student choice is biased by certain factor that construct student’s 
perspectives. According to Eidimtas and Juceviciene (2014, p. 3986), 
Educational factors manifest in course of education that takes place in the family or 
school (formation of values, education, discussion and conversations, after-school 
activities, particular subjects); information factors reach the school-leaver from internal 
and external sources. Search and processing of specific information requires acquired 
skills; economic factors encompass actual subsistence of a future student, directly affect 
low income families; other factors that influence the school-leaver’s decision depend on 
his/her peers, professions of parents, social class etc.  
2.3 Determinants of Decision Making in Choice of Higher Education   
2.3.1 Family Determinants  
Parental influence has a substantial overall effect on postsecondary education aspirations 
(desire to go to university), participation (enrolling into a university program) and persistence 
(finishing the university program) and this influence has been affirmed consistently across 
several studies. Bers and Galowich (2002) observed that parental discussions in families 
encourages children to pursue higher levels of education and its impact gets stronger in senior 
years. According to Cheung (2007, p.24), “inherited intellectual capital influences individuals’ 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
17 
abilities to access and succeed in post‐secondary education, while their parents’ occupation 
experience (in addition to their education), also influences their children’s educational 
achievements.”  Galotti et al. (2006) suggested that adolescents with greater levels of educational 
encouragement by parents have greater faith in the information provided by parents whereas 
children with lesser educational encouragement by the parents primarily trust in-school resources 
like their schoolteachers and guidance counselors.  
Horn and Chen (1998) showed that the educational role of parents has a stronger positive 
effect on the postsecondary educational prospects of students than the socio-economic status of 
the family or the personal skills and attributes of the individual. Similarly, Paulsen (1990) and 
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (2004) found that parental encouragement is 
a more significant factor than socioeconomic status or academic aptitude. Davies and Kandel 
(1981) suggested that adolescent’s perceptions of the parental aspirations of their attending 
university are more influential than peer or teacher aspirations. 
 To understand how career decisions are made and what elements inspire the 
process of decision-making is vital for policymakers. To address this issue the Canadian 
longitudinal Youth in Transition Survey (YITS) survey, included the question, “What kind of job 
or occupation you will be interested in having when you are about 30 years old?” (Statistics 
Canada, 2015). The data were collected every two years from the same participants starting at 
the age of 15 and later at 17, 21, 23, and 25. In terms of parental influence, the YITS revealed 
that the post-secondary participation of students depends upon two factors: parental value of 
post-secondary studies and socio-economic status. 
Data from Cycles 1 through 6 (2000-2006) revealed a relationship between consistency in 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
18 
career decision-making and the value that parents placed on their youngsters acquiring higher 
education (Statistics Canada, 2015). Other results of this survey showed that: 
Youth were more likely to demonstrate consistency in their career expectations when 
their parents placed a high value on postsecondary education. Early demonstration of 
consistency in career expectations was also associated with higher levels of educational 
attainment at age 25. Conversely, late demonstration of consistency in career 
expectations, and particularly career indecision at age 25, were associated with lower 
educational attainment at age 25. (Statistics Canada, 2015, p. 6-10) 
Beyond parental encouragement and level of education, Statistics Canada’s data also 
reveals that earlier stability in career expectation is linked with higher socio-economic status of 
parents. Consistency was associated with the probability of enrolling into a post-secondary 
program within 15 months of graduating secondary school. Canadian students with at least one 
university educated parent are approximately three times more likely to pursue university 
education as compared to youth with parents without high school qualifications (De Broucker & 
Lavallée, 1998; Finnie, Lascelles, & Laporte, 2004). In all Canadian provinces, students whose 
parents had a university education are more likely to introduce the prospect of postsecondary 
education option for their children in comparison to those students whose parents lack a 
university education (Cheung, 2007). Moreover, students with at least one university educated 
parent are considerably more likely to be provided with a wide range of postsecondary education 
options while in high school, and to attend university. Parents who have post-secondary 
credentials tend to foster greater levels of parental involvement, increased expectations, attitudes 
and values for academic success and increased familiarity with the post-secondary process and 
experience (Cheung, 2007). 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
19 
The parental role in impacting their children’s academic achievement was also 
investigated through the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) questionnaire. 
This questionnaire probed accessibility of learning resources such as: dictionaries; study room; 
educationally appropriate cultural possessions at home like classic literature, poetry books, 
works of art; and frequency of discussions or activities that may enhance cultural knowledge 
(cultural communication), or an expression of parental interest in their children’s lives (social 
communication). The results showed a positive association between achievement and the 
quantity of household cultural possessions and the educational ambitions of parents, more so for 
boys than girls. Children belonging to families with higher socio-economic status were more 
likely to have open post-secondary choices than those from lower socio-economic background 
(Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, 2004). 
Higher parental income in Canada is also positively associated with higher educational 
achievement among youth, although parental income is less robust as a predictor of a child’s 
educational accomplishments than parental education (Drolet, 2005; Finnie et al., 2004). Youth 
who live in  high-income households are much more likely to attend postsecondary institutions 
that those from families with lower incomes, the income gap being much more prominent among 
university attendees (Drolet, 2005).  
Children raised in single-parent families typically have lower average levels of mental 
well-being and socio-economic success than those raised by two biological parents (Amato, 
2005; Coleman, 1988; Massey, 2008). Astone and McLanahan (1991) and Heard (2007), 
suggested that children living in single-parent families are less likely to attend college. In the 
Canadian context, Finnie and Laporte (2003) found that children who come from two-parent 
families were more likely to participate in some form of post-secondary education than from 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
20 
those who came from other types of family. Similarly, Lambert, Zeman, Allen, and Bussière 
(2004), based upon Statistics Canada’s data suggested that students who live with two parents 
while in high school are more likely to pursue post-secondary education and less likely to leave 
their postsecondary education as compared to youth who lived with one parent or in alternate 
living arrangements. However, trends seems to have changed with time. Cheung (2007) and 
Seabrook (2013), found that family structure (two parents versus single parent families) exerts 
little effect on educational aspirations and status attainment. Based upon a Statistics Canada 
census of 2011, McMullen (2011) suggested that underrepresented minority youth from single-
parent or other non-two parent family types were 10.8 percent points less likely, on average, to 
attend university than those coming from two-parent families. In terms of family size, Bishop 
(1977) found that the likelihood of college attendance is inversely associated to the number of 
siblings a potential student has.  
2.3.2 High-School Determinants  
School is the only institution other than family where students spend the majority of their 
time. In a recent national survey by Engineers Canada, two out of three students reported that 
they made their decision to pursue engineering in or before high school (2016). Negative 
experiences in high school are associated with decreased desire to pursue higher education in 
Canada (Human Resource and Skills Development Canada, 2004). This report also concluded 
that participation in extracurricular activities, attachment to school, academic self-confidence, 
and bending or breaking rules in the home or the school, have less effect on youth plans to 
pursue post-secondary education. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
21 
Hossler et al. (1999) and Moogan and Baron (2003) suggested that a school leaver’s need 
for further education is formed by school culture and climate, as well as by what they call 
internal sources (parents and siblings). Greene, Miller, Crowson, Duke, and Akey (2004) suggest 
that it is easier for teachers to make students understand that their future success depends upon 
present learning. Similarly, students are inclined towards pursuing educational paths that 
Canadian teachers and counselors assert to be desirable (Human Resources and Skills 
Development Canada, 2004). 
High school career counselors are expected to play a role is shaping an individual’s 
interest in a specific area of study. Boyer (1987) was highly critical of the negligible impact of 
high school guidance counselors in preparing high school students to make the transition from 
secondary to postsecondary education. Hossler et al. (1999) claims that there is no significant 
relationship between students’ educational aspirations and their interaction with teachers or 
counselors. In two related studies McDonough (1994, 1997) reported that teachers and 
counselors at private high schools do have a strong influence on decisions about post-secondary 
institutions because of low student-to-counselor or student-to-teacher ratios. Some scholars have 
suggested that a stronger understanding of the college decision-making process and better 
information about college options in high school might help high school guidance counselors 
provide more effective service to students and their families (Hossler, et al., 1999; Orfield & 
Paul, 1994). Hossler et al. (1999, Kindle Book-Conclusion Chapter, Implications and 
Recommendations Section, Para 7) in their longitudinal study articulated the role of teachers and 
counselors in post-secondary career decisions by saying: 
Teachers and counselors help form students’ consideration sets. We submit that it is 
advantageous for students to consider a wide range of schools, but teachers and 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
22 
counselors are limited by their own experience in helping students enlarge these sets. 
Further, many high school guidance counselors have had little training in college 
counseling and need professional development opportunities to learn more about college 
counseling. We lack empirical data, but it is our impression that teachers and counselors 
often cannot help students understand the differences among various types of college. 
Students with extensive sources of external information, including teachers and 
counselors, are more likely to actualize their college plans.  
According to Cheung (2007), participation in extracurricular activities is viewed as way 
in which individuals can increase their social capital, networking capacity and, relationships with 
other people. Participation in extracurricular activities is also positively associated with post-
secondary attainment. Similarly, high education aspirations are positively associated with 
participation in extra-curricular activities. Other research confirms that students who are 
involved in more activities during high school are more likely to have higher educational 
aspirations (Hossler & Stage, 1992; Stage & Hossler, 1989). 
Munro and Elsom (2000) conducted a mixed method research in Cambridge, England 
and found that science teachers appeared to have a major influence on students’ motivation 
toward science subjects and careers in science. They also concluded that students have to make 
crucial subject choices at the time of their lives when they are losing interest in science subjects. 
This lack of motivation reduces the likelihood of seeking objective information for themselves.  
It is thought that schools can help students by good teaching, improving science classroom 
experiences, school-based extracurricular activities, and career education and guidance. Other 
outside influences -parents and family, perceptions of science subjects, perceptions of careers in 
science and engineering, labour market history gender, and the media – were all considered to be 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
23 
motivating factors. 
High-school determinants have a significant effect on students’ career decision making 
however as suggested before, the broad decision-making is an outcome of multiple factors. The 
report of the National Research Council (2003, p. 120) in the United States mention that: 
In some respects, it makes little sense to discuss what schools can do to engage students 
in learning without considering the settings in which both schools and students live. 
Ideally, schools would build on the knowledge and interests youth develop at home and 
in the community and create opportunities for students to extend and apply school learned 
skills in contexts outside of school. They would take advantage of resources and supports 
for learning in the community and be a positive force in the community for developing an 
environment that supports positive youth development. 
2.3.3 Societal and Economic Determinants  
Schools alone cannot achieve the high levels of engagement and standards, and students 
need many sources of support and consistency in messages from significant people in their lives 
(National Research Council, 2003). Graham (1995, p.22) suggests: 
The battleship, the school, cannot do this alone. The rest of the educational flotilla must 
assist: families, communities, government, higher education, and the business 
community. Only then will all of our children be able to achieve that which by birthright 
should be theirs: enthusiasm for and accomplishment in learning. 
Humans have social dispositions and hence their interactions in their social environment 
influence their behaviours. Schools are not the only educating institution; According to Cremin 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
24 
(1976) there are multiple institutions in the communities such as religious institutions, 
workplaces, youth organizations, radio and television, and many such organizations or groups 
influence career decisions. 
In the context of STEM education, Xie et al. (2015) provide a social perspective of 
STEM education. Xie (1989) and Xie and Killewald (2012) view STEM education as a medium 
for individual social mobility that allows socially underprivileged people to be successful 
through objectively measured criteria that are acknowledged by STEM educators and scientists. 
Some sociological theorists consider education as an mechanism through which families transmit 
social advantages or disadvantages to following generations (Blau & Duncan, 1967; Bourdieu, 
1986; Raftery & Hout, 1993; Sewell, Haller, & Portes, 1969), and contemplate how the built-in 
cultural customs in social class background influence educational experiences and attainment 
(Boudon 1974; Bowles & Gintis, 1976; Brand & Xie, 2010; Xie et al., 2015).  
Some literature in the field of economics discusses education as a system of human 
capital that produces significant economic returns (Mincer, 1974) and the highly educated 
section of society especially takes advantage of this opportunity (Autor, Katz & Kearney, 2008). 
Science is a high-status occupation that rewards its incumbents with comparatively high 
individual income and social reputation (Rothwell, 2013; Xie & Killewald, 2012). Although, 
remuneration for people working as basic scientists in the United States have stagnated in recent 
decades (Xie & Killewald, 2012), education in the area of STEM in particular carries a premium 
in the overall labour market (Rothwell, 2013). Hossler (1982) suggested that students choose to 
go to university if the perceived economic benefit of attending college or university are greater. 
In the Canadian context as well, perceptions of job relevance to education has positive 
association with higher educational aspirations. Educational aspirations and attainments still 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
25 
remain a function of demography and are higher for youths living in urban rather than rural areas 
(Cheung, 2007). 
Gibson and Hutton (2017) carried out a national study on public perceptions of engineers 
and engineering. The results of this study showed relatively low familiarity among respondents 
with only about two in five being familiar with engineers and the engineering profession. 
However, in the majority of instances, the levels of overall impression, trust, and respect for 
engineers and the engineering profession increased with increased familiarity – 82% held 
favorable impressions of the engineering profession, 83% trusted the engineering profession, and 
85% respected the engineering profession across Canada.  
Technology constitutes a greater part of the lives of people in twenty first century. 
Students make use of internet search and social media for networking and communicating. Latest 
news, podcasts, Ted Talks, and other audio-visual material about technological discoveries and 
advancements is frequently viewed by students. Such things may indirectly advertise specific 
fields of study and influence one’s interest in it. Frequent use of information technology for the 
purpose of education have been related to higher educational aspirations (Human Resource and 
Skills Development Canada, 2004).  
Friends can sway the decision (Franklin, 1995; Fuller, Manski, & Wise, 1982; Riggs & 
Lewis, 1980). Friends and acquaintances are an important influence on students’ academic 
achievement. Past research indicates that friendship is positively associated with academic 
outcomes, while students without friends had lower academic outcomes (Wentzel, Barry & 
Caldwell, 2004; Wentzel & Caldwell, 1997). Coleman (1966); Falsey & Heyns (1984); Russell 
(1980); and Tillery (1973) reported that students are positively influenced by social interaction 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
26 
with other students with college plans. The more students get to interact with other students who 
have college plans, the more likely they are to consider attending college. Similarly, negative 
peer influences have negative associated with post-secondary educational aspirations (Cheung, 
2007).  
2.3.4 Personal Determinants  
Even though there are individuals and factors that develop a positive perception of higher 
education among school-leavers, the final decision that students make is based upon their own 
perceived advantages of higher education (Eidimtas & Juceviciene, 2014). Cheung (2007), after 
her analysis of Statistics Canada data suggests that the most important factor which determines 
educational aspiration is academic performance and accounts for 29.9% variation and explain 
80% of the gender difference in Canada. Academic self‐confidence and beliefs about the 
relevance of education to one’s jobs and careers has strong influences on educational aspirations 
(Cheung, 2007). Bishop (1977); Hossler et al. (1999); Jackson (1978); Sharp, Johnson, 
Kurotsuchi, and Waltman (1996); Tuttle, (1981) suggest that student achievement is one of the 
best predictors of higher education aspirations. Hossler et al. (1999); McDonough (1997); and 
Weis (1990) suggest that, high performing students are encouraged more, to pursue higher 
education by their parents, teachers, friends, and extended family members. Academic 
performance, and program of study have noticeable effects on youth plans, as does academic 
effort (Human Resource and Skills Development Canada, 2004).

2.4 Post-Secondary Decision Making in Context of Engineering and Applied Science 
Education in Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador 
There is limited research available around the factors that influence students’ choice of 
engineering degree in Canada. ‘Engineers Canada’ acknowledged the need, and recently started 
collecting data about ‘undergraduate program motivations and experiences’ in which final year 
undergraduate engineering students report factors that influenced them to pursue a degree in 
engineering. The results from the two latest studies (2015 and 2016) were similar and provide a 
national picture of certain factors that influenced students to pursue engineering. 
Guiry and Howell (2015) conducted the national survey for Engineers Canada in 2014 
with a sample of just over 2000 final year undergraduate engineering students across Canada. 
The results from the most recent study which was conducted using a similar survey with a 
sample of 2,222 final year undergraduate engineering students across Canada gives a macro 
understanding of certain factors that influenced their decision to study engineering (Engineers 
Canada, 2016). Among the respondents, majority (78%) were male and remaining were females. 
In terms of age, 90% were under 26, and remaining were 27 or over. The results of this study 
indicated that, two-third of students reported that choosing to pursue and engineering degree was 
a result of their own interest (65%) or reported application of science and math (62%) as a reason 
to pursue engineering. A little less than two-third reported practical, applied nature of 
engineering discipline (60%) as the influence. Less than half reported financial security (44%), 
job security (43%) or, reported challenge (44%) of engineering profession as the main influence 
to pursue an engineering degree. A third reported a feeling of positively influencing the 
world/community (36%) as the reason to pursue engineering. Only a quarter reported family 
(26%) as the influencing factor to pursue engineering degree, or reported taking related courses 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
28 
(26%) and liking them as a reason to pursue engineering. Only a few reported a role model 
(14%), reported reaching another goal with the help of engineering degree (9%) or other (3%) as 
the influence. 
There were 70 (4%) participants in 2015 and 62 (3%) participants in 2016 in these 
surveys from Newfoundland and Labrador. It would have been interesting to have data from 
Newfoundland and Labrador perspective however the responses about the factors influencing 
decision to pursue engineering were not tabulated by provinces. 
In the final report of the panel on status of public education in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, the dean in the Faculty of Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland, 
proposed that schools should improve students’ awareness of the work of engineers and how 
they contribute towards the society and refocus, “on depth of math, science, and computer 
literacy in senior years to address the lack of preparation for technical fields like engineering” 
(Sheppard & Anderson, 2016, p. 42). 
2.5 Situating the Research 
According to De Broucker and Lavallée (1998), educational accomplishment can be 
largely attributed to inherited intellectual capital, defined as “the experience and knowledge 
acquired by an individual or a group of individuals (such as the family) during the course of their 
lives that can be applied in the pursuit of economic and social goals” (p. 129). Educational 
accomplishment can be conceptualized as an outcome of sequence of ‘decisions’ that a student 
makes during and immediately after finishing high school. Although there is significant research 
available around academic decision making in higher education and choice of college/university, 
there is limited work on student perceptions of social and economic factors that play a role in 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
29 
their choice to study engineering and applied science in Newfoundland and Labrador or in 
Canada as a whole. This study seeks to contribute to this gap by examining student perceptions 
of the influences that impact their decision making in context of post-secondary education in 
engineering and applied science.  
2.6 Summary of Chapter Two 
In this chapter I develop a historical and academic understanding of the topics under 
study. I began by reviewing the literature on decision-making in higher education and followed 
this with a review of various elements that influence this process in the light of decision to 
pursue engineering education.  
In the next chapter, I will discuss the research methodology used in this study. This 
chapter will also discuss the data collection, data analysis, instrument, limitations and 
delimitations, and ethical considerations in this study.

Chapter Three- Methodology and Data Collection 
This chapter outlines the research methodology and data collection procedures adopted in 
this study and is divided into 10 sections. It starts with my positioning as a researcher followed 
by commentary on quantitative research methodology. The survey instrument, pilot test, validity 
and reliability, participants, recruitment, data analysis, limitations and delimitations, and ethical 
considerations construct the remaining body of this chapter. 
3.1 Positioning as a Researcher 
Justification of our methodology and methods is something that reaches into the 
assumptions about reality that we bring to our work (Crotty, 1998). I approached this study with 
a belief in syllogism-which is based upon the assumption that, through a sequence of formal 
steps of logic, from general to the particular, a valid conclusion can be deduced from valid 
premise (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2007). Quantitative researchers in general carry an 
objectivist stance, which is an epistemological viewpoint that, “things exist as meaningful 
entities independently of consciousness and experience, that they have truth and meaning 
residing in them as objects (‘objective’ truth and meaning), and that careful (scientific) research 
can attain the objective truth and meaning” (Crotty, 1998, p. 5-6). I am positioned as a survey 
researcher in the epistemological spirit of post-positivism; a paradigm where researchers seek to 
generate knowledge (such as the identification of factors that influence students’ decision to 
pursue a degree in engineering) by accumulating and analysing numerical data using scientific 
methods.  
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
31 
3.2 Quantitative Research Methodology 
The goal of undertaking this research is to develop a statistical profile and measure 
influence of factors that influence students’ choice to pursue a degree in engineering or applied 
science. Therefore, a quantitative research method was used. According to Creswell (2012), the 
rationale of using quantitative data is to provide a general picture of the research problem. Since 
there is not enough literature available around the choice of engineering degree and social and 
economic factors influencing this decision, the objective of this study is to create a general 
understanding of what influences students to choose engineering program in post-secondary 
education. According to Cohen, Manion, and Morrison (2007), the purpose of a survey is to 
gather large scale data in order to make generalizations by measuring the responses from the 
participants. “Survey researchers often correlate variables, but their focus is directed more 
towards learning about the population and less on relating variables or predicting outcomes” 
(Creswell, 2012, p. 376).  
Kruger, Shirey, Morrel-Samuels, Skorcz, and Brady (2009), expressed the significance of 
survey data as being to satisfy the needs of policy actors, and proposed that modification of a 
survey to target specific areas and demographics can result in better quality of data. Greener 
(2011) critiques the use of surveys and suggests that ambiguous wording, low/poor response rate, 
and response bias, may hinder the survey from measuring what it is intended to. However, 
surveys remain the most effective tool for quick and comprehensive assessments of behaviours, 
values, and attitudes. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
32 
Since this research aims at collecting data and providing information in a short amount of 
time, a cross-sectional survey design was best suited for the study. A cross-sectional survey 
design has the advantage of measuring attitudes or practices efficiently (Creswell, 2012). 
3.3 Survey Instrument 
Data were gathered using a self-developed survey instrument (Appendix 1). Fowler 
(1988) suggests that a prerequisite to designing a good instrument is deciding what is to be 
measured. A structured questionnaire was designed for the survey. Based upon a review of 
literature, the following four sections were developed to constitute the body of the instrument: 
Section one contained the informed consent form for the participants.  
Section two consisted of a set of demographic questions that included, residency status, 
gender, age, language spoken, current program of study, family type, parental household income, 
main source of funding for their education, highest level of education, parental education, and 
family size.  
Section three asked students to rate their level of agreement on a five point Likert scale 
(1-Strongly Disagree to 5-Strongly Agree) about the role of a series of potential determinants: 
(1) Parental Determinants (parental advice/encouragement, parental pressure, 
tradition of science and engineering occupations in their family, parental 
pressure to be academically competitive, high value of science/engineering 
education among family members, and advice/pressure from extended family 
member);  
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
33 
(2) High School Determinants (advice/encouragement to study 
science/engineering by a teacher or other staff member in high school, high 
school level pressure to study science/engineering, career counselling advice 
received in high school, academic focus on STEM in high school, teacher or 
other staff member’s pressure to be academically competitive, co-curricular 
school activities in science and engineering, and high value of 
science/engineering among teachers and other staff members);  
(3) Social Determinants (general social pressure to study science/engineering, 
general information and/or counselling from other sources, career seminar and 
career fairs etc., friends and acquaintances, societal pressure to be 
academically competitive, and social value/status of career in 
science/engineering);  
(4) Personal Determinants (personal motivation, aptitude for science/engineering 
subject matter, academic success in previous STEM related subject matter, 
and personal desire to work as a scientist or engineer), and;  
(5) Economic Determinants (earning potential of a career in science/engineering) 
on their choice of engineering degree program. Participants had to respond to 
a statement that said, ‘My decision to study an engineering degree was 
influenced by…’, by rating each variable on the Likert scale.  
The Likert scale is a psychometric response scale primarily used in questionnaires to 
obtain participant’s preferences or degree of agreement with a statement or set of statements.  In 
the Likert scale, respondents are asked to indicate for each topic whether they strongly agree, 
agree, are undecided, disagree, or strongly disagree (Ary, Jacob, & Razavieh, 2002).  I have used 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
34 
a five point Likert scale as opposed to three or seven points because some studies suggest that it 
increases response rate as well as reduces the frustration level of respondents (Babakus & 
Mangold, 1992; Sachdev & Verma, 2004).  
Originally my ethics proposal included a plan to conduct focus group interviews and 
participants who wished to be part of further study had the option to provide identifying 
information for future communication in section four. As the study evolved and increased in 
scope the qualitative component was not conducted and the data collected in section 4 were not 
used. The participants who submitted their contact details were notified that the further study 
would not take place but they might be contacted in future. Any further intervention will follow 
ICEHR (Interdisciplinary Committee on Ethics in Human Research) guidelines. 
The survey instrument was developed on Google Forms on the google mail platform.  
3.4 Pilot Test 
Since the survey instrument was self-developed it was tested prior to implementation. As 
Fowler (1988) suggests, “the closer the final instrument is to perfection, the better the research 
process” (p. 103). Pilot testing is a procedure to find out if the survey instrument will work in the 
real world. The purpose of pilot testing was to ensure that all participants not only understand the 
questions, but understand them in the same way. Testing can also discover any questions that 
respondents feel uncomfortable with. Finally, it can also gauge the approximate time frame 
required to complete the survey. I carried out the pilot test with 15 engineering graduates who 
were not part of Memorial University of Newfoundland. They were sent a link by e-mail to a 
duplicate copy of the survey to complete. After they had completed the survey, they were asked 
for their feedback. Based on this feedback there were some minor changes made to the survey 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
35 
instrument (Appendix 2). The approximate time reported to complete the survey was 10-15 
minutes. To test the reliability of the pilot instrument, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated and was 
found to be 0.910. The revised instrument was sent to ICEHR for approval and was approved 
without any issue. The design introduced in this study is the final version of the instrument.  
3.5 Validity and Reliability 
According to Kerlinger (1973), validity refers to a question that, are we measuring what 
we think we are measuring? I validated the survey questionnaire by consulting with the experts 
(my supervisor and some PhD students), doing an extensive literature review and carrying out 
pilot testing. I requested my supervisor to review my questionnaire for readability, clarity, and 
comprehensiveness, which helped me to validate the content.  
Reliability: To test the reliability of the final instrument Cronbach’s Alpha was calculated 
and was found to be 0.837. This level of reliability is considered to be good. 
3.6 Participants and Sample Size 
The participant group for the study was the current undergraduate student population of 
engineering students at university level in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Memorial University of Newfoundland is the only university in Newfoundland and Labrador and 
hence the current undergraduate students enrolled in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied 
Science constituted this population. 
Based on data received from the faculty, there were 1032 undergraduate students enrolled 
in the the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at Memorial University of Newfoundland 
in the winter semester of 2016. Of these, 535 were on a work term and the remaining 497 were 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
36 
on campus. There was access only to students on campus in the study. Out of the 497 students, 
136 were female and 361 were male. In addition, data were collected from 83 students from the 
Faculty of Science; these students had indicated a desire to switch to engineering and were 
taking required courses. Finally, there were total 151 students who responded to the survey. 
The number of responses were more than the desired sample size. Desired sample size 
(145) was calculated using Z-value (for 95% confidence interval) of 1.96, proportion ratio of .5. 
10% margin of error and 50% response rate (calculated using the pilot test). The following 
formulae was used to calculate the desired sample size: 
n= Z-value2 [p(1-p)]/d2  OR  n= 1.962 [.5(1-.5)]/.12  n=96.4 
Desired sample size= n + 50*n/100 OR Desired sample size= 96.4 + .5*96.4= 144.6 (145) 
3.7 Recruitment  
The survey instrument was made available in electronic as well as paper form. The 
electronic survey instrument was developed in Google Forms. A web link to the electronic copy 
of the survey gave participants the option to complete it at their convenience. In addition, I 
provided the option to complete the surveys on paper copies to potentially increase response 
rates (Cook, Heath & Thompson, 2000; Hohwu, et al., 2013; Nulty, 2008). However, all students 
chose to complete it online. 
There were three strategies used to recruit participants: 
1. Post-Class Recruitment: I contacted faculty members in the Faculty of 
Engineering and Applied Science who agreed to permit me to distribute survey 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
37 
instruments to undergraduate engineering students at the end of regularly scheduled 
classes. After the approval from ICEHR, a formal request was made to the Faculty of 
Engineering and Applied Science to allow the data collection process. I was provided 
post-class access to three classes (EN1010, EN1020, and EN8152) with three different 
faculty members; this gave access to all the students in the faculty at the time of data 
collection.  
2. Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science Listserv: I also coordinated 
with the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science to distribute the research 
advertisement and electronic survey instrument among their members through their 
listserv. A formal email with the link to complete the survey was sent to all the students 
by the faculty administration office. This email was sent every week for two months in an 
effort to generate a high response rate. 
3. Sharing the Advertisement on Social Media: The advertisement and the 
link to the survey was made available on Memorial University’s Learning Management 
System (D2L) by the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science. This gave access to all 
the registered undergraduate students in the faculty of engineering. 
3.8 Data Analysis 
The majority of descriptive analysis was automatically available on Google Forms. To 
study the responses on the five point Likert scale, “strongly disagree” and “disagree” were 
combined together, “neither disagree nor agree” was left as it was, and “agree’ and “strongly 
agree” were again combined together. Thus, the five-point scale was simplified to three 
“disagree”, “neutral”, and “agree”.

3.9 Limitations and Delimitations 
Limitations- A problem with survey research is that participants might misinterpret questions 
and respond based upon their understanding rather than the what the researcher wants to know. 
To control this, pilot testing was conducted and appropriate changes were made on the survey 
instrument. Moreover, I provided my contact details for them to clarify any issues with 
understanding or concerns about the survey instrument. Sometimes, the responses may be biased 
by socially desirable responses. It was assumed that all the participants would be honest in their 
responses. 
Delimitations- There were multiple recruitment strategies used to increase the responses. 
At the conclusion of data collection 151 responses were received. Low response rates can result 
in response bias and as Creswell (2012) suggests, “the responses do not accurately reflect the 
views of the sample and the population” (p. 403). There can be a number of reasons for this that 
may include: 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
39 
1. Time of data collection: Data collection was scheduled only during the 
winter semester of 2016-2017 based upon availability of resources. 
2. Reduced sample size due to work terms: Of 1032 total students, 535 were 
on their work term and it is likely that they were not attending to their university email. 
Even if they received the email, their work schedule would have hindered them from 
completing the survey. There was no opportunity to promote the research in-class to 
these students. 
3. Unregistered email accounts: The email communication was sent through 
listserv, however, students who didn’t register their email accounts would have not 
received the email. 
4. No Incentive: Due to lack of financial resources I was not able to offer 
incentives for completing the study. This may have contributed to the low response rate. 
Usually incentives increase the response rate as there is monetary or non-monetary 
reward available in return for the time of respondents. 
5. Absenteeism: During the post-class recruitment, students who were absent 
that specific day did not get a chance to know more about the study. 
The sample size and low response rate may limit the generalizability. The participation 
from Newfoundland and Labrador (N=151) in this study is twice that of the sample studied by 
Engineers Canada in 2015 (N=70) and 2016 (N=62). This may mean that the results of this study 
might be more generalizable than those from previous studies.

3.10 Ethical Considerations 
This research project received an ethical review from Memorial University of 
Newfoundland’s Interdisciplinary Committee on Ethics in Human Research (ICEHR) prior to 
start. The approval is attached in Appendix 3. 
3.11 Summary of Chapter Three 
 This chapter addresses the methods adopted in this study. It started with an introduction 
about the chapter followed by defining the methodology and introducing the instrument used to 
collect data necessary to respond to the research questions. It also defines the population and 
sample used in this study and the ways in which data collection was carried out. Limitations and 
delimitations of this study were presented followed by steps that were taken to make sure that 
this research study progresses within the ethical boundaries.  
The next chapter will be highlighting the results obtained from the collected data in 
tabular and textual form.

Chapter Four- Results 
This chapter presents the results obtained from the data collected. The results are 
presented in the same order as the items appeared on the survey instrument. This chapter is 
organised in six sections which include, demographic profile of participants, followed by family 
determinants, high-school determinants, societal determinants, personal determinants, and 
economic determinants in context of students’ decision to pursue a degree in engineering. 
4.1 Demographic Profile of the Participants 
This section describes the responses recorded in demographic section of the survey 
instrument. There are total of 151 participants in this study. The majority of participants (91.3%) 
came from English speaking families, with a few (5.4%) who were bilingual (English and 
French). The remaining spoke another language at home. The participants were from different 
departments within the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science.  
Only a very few participants intentionally or unintentionally skipped a few questions in 
the survey. The total number of responses for each variable (n) are presented in respective tables 
under the frequency tab. The results for each variable are presented in table format. 
4.1.1 Residency Status  
Table three presents the residency status of the participants. More two third of 
participants identified themselves as Canadian citizens who are also residents of Newfoundland 
and Labrador. Half of the remaining participants were Canadian citizens from other provinces 
and the rest were non-Canadians.

4.1.2 Gender  
Consistent with the national trends in engineering education and representation of 
women, females were under represented in undergraduate engineering education at Memorial 
University with only a third of respondents identifying themselves as females (see Table four). 
That said, Newfoundland and Labrador ranks first in comparison with other Canadian provinces 
with 26% females in engineering programs, (Wlotzki, 2015). The remaining two-third of the 
participants were males. Only one participant was identified as non-binary.

4.1.3 Age 
Table five presents the participants by age. The majority of respondents were under the 
age of 20. A third were between 20 and 25, and remaining were older than 25 years of age. This 
reflects that the majority of students in Newfoundland and Labrador choose to study engineering 
right after finishing high-school. These results were consistent with Guiry & Howell (2015) and 
Engineers Canada (2016) in which almost 90% respondents were 26 years of age or younger.

4.1.4 Family Type  
Table six presents the type of family the respondents came from. The vast majority of 
participants reported coming from a two-parent family where, mother and father lived in the 
same household. Within the remaining participants, more than half reported having a single 
parent (mother), which was more than double the number of participants who reported coming 
from a single parent (father) family type. There were very few participants who reported other as 
their family type.

4.1.5 Parental Household Income 
Table seven presents the reported parental household income of the participants. There 
was wide variation in annual family income levels with almost half of the participants (47.7%), 
reporting parental household income to be greater than $100,000. A third of participants reported 
income to be between $50,001 and $100,000. Just over 10% of participants reported parental 
household income of less that $50,000, which shows that there is a very small representation of 
students from lower income families in engineering and applied science programs at Memorial 
University. About 13% of participants reported not knowing their parental household income.

4.1.6 Main Source of Funding for Student’s Education 
Almost two-third of the participants stated that their education was funded either by their 
parents/relatives or through scholarships and funding. Only a third of the participants self-funded 
their education either through employment or bank loans. Table eight illustrates the response 
summary within this variable.

4.1.7 Parental Education 
Table nine presents the parental education of the participants as reported in the survey. 
More than 80% of the participants’ mother had earned at least a post-secondary certificate or 
diploma, and more than half were university graduates. A quarter of the participants reported that 
their mothers had a graduate university degree. The pattern was similar for fathers of 
undergraduate engineering students in Newfoundland and Labrador.

4.1.8 Family Size 
  Table 10 presents the number of siblings reported by the participants. Majority of the 
participants had one (53%) or two (27.8%) siblings which also mean that they came from a 
family consisting of less than five members. This aligns with Bishop (1977) who suggested that 
small family size is related to a greater chance of college/university attendance.

4.1.9 Profile of Undergraduate Engineering Students 
A typical undergraduate engineering student in Newfoundland and Labrador is male 
under 26 years of age, has parents with at least a post-secondary degree or diploma, and comes 
from a traditional family (mother and father living together) with less than five members. One 
interesting finding is that the vast majority of respondents reported living in a traditional two 
parent household. This is a very interesting fact because none of the previous studies reviewed in 
the literature reported any relationship between family type and higher education aspirations in 
the area of engineering and the applied sciences. 
4.2 Family Determinants and the Decision to Pursue a Degree in Engineering 
Participants were asked to state their level of agreement on a five-point Likert scale 
(trichotomized for the purpose of analysis) with a series of statements intended to examine 
family determinants on program decisions. There were six variables studied within the family 
determinants construct which include: parental advice/encouragement, parental pressure to study 
science or engineering, tradition of science and engineering occupations in family, parental 
pressure to be academically competitive, high value of science and engineering education within 
family members and advise/pressure from extended family member.

More than half of the participants agreed that their decision to pursue a degree in 
engineering was influenced by parental advice/encouragement (55.6%) and parental pressure to 
be academically competitive (59.6%). Results also indicate that a tradition of science and 
engineering occupations in the family or advice/pressure from extended family member both had 
minimal influence on participants’ decisions to pursue engineering, and almost two-third of the 
participants reported negatively in response to this option. Almost half of the participants 
reported that value of science and engineering education among family members influenced their 
decision to pursue engineering however, about a third also disagreed that it was an influence. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
49 
Overall, parental advice/encouragement, parental pressure to be academically 
competitive, and high value of science and engineering education among family members seem 
to be enabling influences for almost half of the respondents in the study. 
4.3 High-School Determinants and the Decision to Pursue a Degree in Engineering 
The participants were also asked questions about advice, encouragement, pressure, and 
value in the context of in-school factors and their decision to pursue an engineering degree. 
There were seven variables studies under the high school determinants construct which were: 
advice/encouragement by teacher or other staff member, high-school level pressure, career 
counselling advice, academic focus on science/engineering, teacher or other staff member’s 
pressure to be academically competitive, high value of science/engineering among teachers and 
other staff members, and science/engineering related co-curricular activities. The results are 
shown in Table 12.

Results show that participants were not particularly influenced by teachers or counselors; 
only one third agreed that encouragement or advice from a teacher or other staff member played 
a role in formulating their decision to pursue engineering. More than half (59%) of participants 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
51 
stated that their decision to pursue engineering wasn’t influenced by career counselling advice 
received in high school. More than half of the respondents (52.7%) stated that school level 
academic focus around science/engineering was an influence in pursuing a degree in 
engineering, while a similar number (51.3%) indicated that co-curricular activities in 
science/engineering didn’t had an influence. The findings also suggest that decisions about post-
secondary studies in the field of engineering are relatively independent of the advice and 
encouragement provided by teachers and/or counselors. 
4.4 Societal Determinants and the Decision to Pursue a Degree in Engineering 
 The societal determinants construct consisted of six variables which were used to gauge 
the influence they had on participants’ decision to pursue a degree in engineering. The variables 
studied were: general social pressure to study science/engineering, general 
information/counselling, career seminars/career fairs, friends and acquaintances, social pressure 
to be academically competitive, and social value of science/engineering career. The results are 
shown in Table 13.

Results indicate that the social value of a career in science/engineering, is an important 
determinant of students’ decision to pursue a degree in engineering, with agreement from two-
thirds (66.2%) of respondents. Fewer than half of the participants agreed that general social 
pressure to study science/engineering or general career information and/or career seminars/fairs 
were influential in helping them choosing a career in engineering. Social pressure to be 
academically competitive was a stronger determinant of students’ decision to pursue a degree in 
engineering than social pressure to study engineering/science. Interestingly, almost half (46.3%) 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
53 
of the participants agreed that peer influence played a role in formulating their decision to pursue 
a degree in engineering.  
Among all the variables studied under societal determinants, social value of career in 
engineering/sciences is the strongest determinant of students’ decision to pursue a degree in 
engineering in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
4.5 Personal Determinants and Decision to Pursue a Degree in Engineering 
Under personal determinants there were four variables which were: personal motivation, 
aptitude in science/math subject matter, academic success in previous STEM related subject 
matter, and personal desire to work as a scientist or engineer. The results from responses to items 
related to this construct are shown in Table 14.

The data suggest that all four of the variables within this section are strong influences on 
the decision about whether to pursue a degree in engineering. Academic success in STEM based 
subjects in high-school appears to be positively related to choosing an engineering degree, but 
personal motivation, aptitude for science and engineering subject matter and personal desire to 
work as an engineer or scientist were the most noteworthy factors under the personal 
determinants construct.  
4.6 Economic Determinants and the Decision to Pursue a Degree in Engineering 
The economic determinants construct consisted of only two variables which were: 
earning potential of a career in engineering/science and main source of funding for students’ 
education. Results of both these variables are presented in Table 15

engineering degree.

4.7 Summary of Chapter Four 
This chapter presented the results derived from the survey data. Parental socio-economic 
status and similarities emerge as important factors that characterizes the traits of an 
undergraduate engineering student. The typical engineering student is a male Canadian citizen, 
under 26 years of age, from a financially sound, highly educated two-parent family with the 
means to support him/her financially during her/his academic program. His/her decision to 
pursue a degree in engineering is for the most part influenced by: 
- Personal motivation and desire to work as an engineer 
- Aptitude and academic success in previous STEM subjects 
- Financial benefits of the engineering profession 
- Social value of a career in science/engineering 
- Parental advice/encouragement and, 
- To some extent parental, social, and high-school pressure to be academically competitive 
Results also indicate underrepresentation from women, students who come from single-
parent family and have lower levels of education and income. The influence of high school 
factors is perceived to have limiting effect on student outcome (choice to pursue an engineering 
degree).  
In the next chapter I will synthesise the findings in broader context while discussing the 
results in context of arguments from literature.

Chapter Five- Discussions, Conclusions, Implications and Recommendations 
 
The purpose of this thesis is to investigate specific influences that contribute to the 
education decision-making process of undergraduate engineering students in Newfoundland and 
Labrador. The three research questions posited in this study are: 
1. What are the perceptions of undergraduate engineering students about the influence of 
certain family, high-school, societal, personal, and economic factors on their decision to pursue a 
degree in engineering? 
2. What influences do undergraduate engineering students perceive to be enabling factors 
for pursuing a degree in engineering? 
3. What influences do undergraduate engineering students perceive to be limiting factors 
for pursuing a degree in engineering? 
The data directly address the first research question and indirectly address the second and 
third research questions. In this chapter I discuss the findings, specifically how they are situated 
in the context of the existing literature, interpret the findings and present section-specific and 
overall recommendations for the policymakers and practitioners. Finally, in the implications 
section I will examine its implications for various stakeholders. This chapter will follow the 
same sequence (demographic, parental, high-school, societal, personal and economic variables 
in) that has been previously followed in the study. 
 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
57 
5.1 Demographic Factors That Enable or Limit the Students to Pursue a Degree in 
Engineering and Applied Science 
The findings from this study reveal that demographic factors matter. Students coming 
from certain segments of the society have an advantage over others when it comes to pursuing an 
undergraduate engineering degree in Newfoundland and Labrador. These advantages or 
disadvantages can be categorized by gender, family type (two-parent versus single-parent 
family), socio-economic status of parents, parental income, parental level of education, parental 
financial support during post-secondary education, and family size. 
5.1.1 Gender 
The findings from this study show that gender is associated with the decision to pursue an 
undergraduate engineering program. Two third of respondents identified themselves as males, 
the remaining identified themselves as females with the exception of one, who identified as non-
binary. Historically girls’ academic performance has been better than boys around the world 
(Voyer & Voyer, 2014). Canadian data suggest that women do better than boys both in the K-12 
school system and during post-secondary studies (Turcotte, 2011); however, their representation 
in engineering is significantly lower than that of men (Hango, 2013). Various studies have 
previously discussed the underrepresentation of women in the field of engineering (Chubin, May, 
& Babco, 2005; Engineers Canada, 2017; Hango, 2013; Sadker & Sadker, 1995). In 
Newfoundland and Labrador, the female to male ratio in engineering is greater than other 
Canadian provinces (Engineers Canada, 2015), however there is still plenty of scope to increase 
the representation of females in engineering education. It will be worthwhile to invest knowledge 
and effort in understanding the determinants specific to female students that influence them or 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
58 
act as barriers to becoming an engineer. Since girls do better than boys in the K-12 school system 
in Newfoundland and Labrador, greater efforts to create opportunities for and awareness of 
engineering as a valuable career choice for girls would seem warranted. Some options could 
include (1) identifying girls with an aptitude for math and physics and providing them with 
opportunities to develop these skills. (2) deliberate efforts by science teachers and counselors to 
encourage girls to pursue engineering related careers (3) providing opportunities for women in 
science and engineering to talk about career options in these fields, and (4) creating opportunities 
for schools and school districts to liaise with organizations such as Engineers Canada, which are 
involved in promoting engineering education. At the government level, girls can be attracted 
towards engineering degrees by providing more scholarships and bursary opportunities. 
Financial incentive programs for girls with high academic achievement who choose to pursue 
engineering degree may be another monetary motivation. These programs may include, for 
example, tuition fee remission and/or financial help for books and resources for women choosing 
to pursue undergraduate engineering degrees. 
Various initiatives that encourage women to participate in undergraduate engineering 
degree may reduce the gender disparity in engineering fields. A joint effort by the government, 
schools, and communities seem warranted to motivate girls to study science and math in high 
school, and study engineering at university. 
5.1.2 Family Composition 
Overall, family type, specifically coming from two-parent family is strongly associated 
with post-secondary participation in the field of undergraduate engineering education. Almost 
83% of participants reported coming from a two-parent family. These results were consistent 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
59 
with several other studies reviewed in the literature. Astone and McLanahan (1991) and Heard 
(2007), emphasized that children coming from single parent families are less likely to pursue 
post-secondary studies. Similar arguments were made by Finnie & Laporte (2003), and Lambert 
et al. (2004), who argued that children coming from two-parent families are more likely to attend 
post-secondary education in Canada. It should be noted, however, that the arguments made by 
these researchers were in the context of higher education and not specific to engineering 
education. The findings from this study are also inconsistent with the arguments made by 
Cheung (2007) and Seabrook (2013) who have suggested that family structure exerts little effect 
on higher educational aspirations generally; I was unable to find literature specific to engineering 
education. 
Possible reasons for these findings are not evident in literature specific to post-secondary 
education in engineering, nor does this analysis tell us why students from two-parent families 
engage in post-secondary education in engineering. However, it is possible that this finding is 
more reflective of income level than family type. The data show that the majority of engineering 
students in this study funded their education through resources provided by their parents.  
In Canada, children living in single-parent households are three times more likely to live 
in low-income circumstances as compared to those living in two-parent families (Statistics 
Canada, 2017). Furthermore, children living with a single mother had a greater low-income rate 
than those living with single father (Statistics Canada, 2017). Overall, we may say that 
traditional (two-parent) families act as an enabling factor towards choosing a career in 
engineering and applied science.  Given that two-parent families are likely to be better positioned 
financially to support their children’s attendance at university, family type may simply be a 
proxy for income level. However, based upon the results we can also say that children from 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
60 
single-parent families are underrepresented in undergraduate engineering education. This 
relationship between type of family and choice of pursuing a degree in engineering should be 
further explored. 
5.1.3 Family Size 
The results show that more than half of students had no more than one sibling. This 
indicates that in addition to other demographic factors, family size seems to be be associated 
with an individual’s decision to pursue a degree in engineering. Again, however, family size may 
be related to financial means; generally, it would be expected that smaller families would have 
proportionally more disposable income from which to financially support their children. 
Conversely, from a financial perspective, it might be expected that children from larger families 
are disadvantaged from becoming an engineer. Statistics Canada (2017) has shown that the 
likelihood of a child in low income families increase as the number of minor children in the 
household increases. 
5.1.4 Parental Income 
Almost half of the participants in this study reported annual family income of more than 
$100,000. This was consistent with Drolet (2005) and Finnie et al. (2004) who suggested that 
higher parental income was positively correlated with their children’s decision to pursue post-
secondary education. In addition, results of the Youth in Transition Survey (YITS), showed that 
students with parents from higher-socio-economic backgrounds reported consistent career choice 
throughout this longitudinal study. Their response to the question: What kind of job or 
occupation you would be interested in having when you are 30 years old? was same at 17, 21, 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
61 
23, and 25 years of age (Statistics Canada, 2015). Only 10.6% of participants reported household 
income less than $50,000, which shows that very few students from lower income families are 
represented within the ranks of those pursuing engineering and applied science degrees. Hence 
lower parental income seems to be limiting factor that acts as a barrier to students entering the 
engineering and applied science fields.  
This analysis does not explain the reasoning for this disparity but it is reasonable to 
assume that parents with greater financial means are better able to support their children to study 
university programs such as engineering. Conversely, children from lower income families are 
likely to encounter financial barriers to the pursuit of engineering and applied science programs. 
One suggested explanation for higher post-secondary participation among students belonging to 
families of higher financial means may be that their parents are able to afford the rising cost of 
education (Finnie & Laporte, 2003).  
Based on the findings from this study, we may say that low parental income is limiting 
factor to post-secondary participation in the field of engineering. Although this topic needs to be 
further studied to explore ways to increase participation from students coming from lower socio-
economic backgrounds, certain immediate efforts could lessen this barrier. Some possible actions 
at the school district/school level might include (1) inviting engineering professionals to deliver 
talks about the career in engineering. (2) liaising with organizations like Engineers Canada and 
the faculties of Engineering/applied sciences, which are involved in promoting engineering 
education among students and, (3) investment in professional development opportunities for 
teachers and counselors to keep them up to date with future market demands and growth 
opportunities. Teachers and counselors may further use this knowledge and educate students and 
their parents about what fields of studies may lead to a successful career. Knowledge sharing and 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
62 
partnership among these organizations may foster evidence based practices and policies to foster 
greater interest in the benefits of engineering occupations.  
Other actions could involve targeting students with an aptitude for math and physics from 
underrepresented groups (low income families) for opportunities to develop on these skills, such 
as participation in STEM based experiential learning. Career counselors might consider ways to 
encourage students from low-income families to pursue engineering as a career such as 
undertaking sessions on the practical and financial benefits of engineering careers. Since money 
is a prime barrier for such students, government might consider introducing means-tested 
scholarships and funding opportunities for children from low-income households who choose to 
pursue an engineering degree. Financial incentive programs like tuition waivers for high 
achieving students (from low-income households) may be another monetary motivation. 
Financial support to buy study material (books, laptops etc.) may help engineering students from 
low income families while they are in undergraduate engineering programs. Engineering firms 
could be encouraged to sponsor university engineering education for students from low income 
households as part of their corporate social responsibility.  
At the community level, more not-for-profit organizations that promote and fund 
engineering education for children from low-income families could be examined. Print and 
digital media coverage of the topic of career in engineering and writing articles about its role in 
social mobility may help families and children know and understand the long-term payoff of a 
career in engineering.  
5.1.5 Parental Education Level 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
63 
A majority of the students who participated came from families where their parents had 
at least a post-secondary degree, diploma, or certificate. More than 80% of participants reported 
that both their parents had at least some post-secondary education and more than 50% reported 
that their parents had a minimum of an undergraduate degree.  These results align with those of 
Cheung (2007) who suggests that parents with post-secondary educational credentials (1) seem 
to foster higher levels of involvement in post-secondary academic decision-making, (2) tend to 
have higher educational expectations for their children and (3) transmit attitudes and values for 
academic success. The work of Cheung (2007), De Broucker and Lavallee (1998) and Finnie et 
al. (2004) supports the claim that parental education increases their children’s likelihood of 
pursuing higher education. The findings from this research is consistent with this earlier work. 
From the perspective of choice to study engineering and applied science, students whose parents 
have earned post-secondary credentials have an advantage over those whose parents are less 
educated. 
Social reproduction theorists have long recognized the positive impact of higher parental 
education on children’s educational attainment levels (e.g., Bourdieu, 1986). Multiple studies 
have analysed the direct and indirect associations among parental education, income, and child 
development and found that parents’ parenting behaviours and academic expectations from their 
children are a function of their personal educational experiences and awareness (Davis-Kean, 
2005; Eccles, 2005). Similarly, Dubow, Boxer, and Huesmann (2009) studied the long-term 
effects of parental education and children’s occupational success and found a positive 
association between the two variables. They also found that parental education influences the 
child’s perception of his/her own educational aspirations. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
64 
It is a very complex phenomenon how parents knowingly or unknowingly transmit 
certain social advantages to their children. Some theorists see education as a means through 
which families transmit social advantages or disadvantages to the next generation (Blau & 
Duncan, 1967; Raftery & Hout, 1993; Sewell et al. 1969). We may say that this cycle continues 
as children mature and become parents transmit similar advantages or disadvantages to the next 
generations. 
Finnie and Laporte (2003) suggested that parental education may explain the disparity in 
post-secondary participation between students coming from high and low-income families. 
Students whose parents have limited education may need more support to understand and pursue 
post-secondary programs that have the potential to increase social and economic prospects and 
interrupt patterns of social reproduction. This is a substantial social problem that is situated at the 
centre of what many educators, reconstruction theorists, and policy decision-makers see as 
fundamental to poverty reduction strategies. Opportunities to convey the value of higher 
education and the provision of special financial support to pursue a degree may benefit children 
whose parents are less educated. Since engineering degrees have substantial economic benefits, 
initiatives to foster math and physics in high school, creating awareness about engineering 
degrees and financial support to pursue one, may not only help increase number of engineers but 
also act as poverty reduction strategy that is based upon the principle of equity. 
The role of media cannot be neglected because it can play an important role in 
disseminating information to the general public. A recent survey of people’s perceptions about 
careers in engineering highlighted the lack of knowledge about engineering and the engineering 
profession. Only two out of five respondents in this survey reported being familiar with 
engineering and the engineering profession (Gibson & Hutton, 2017). Steps can be taken to 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
65 
make families aware about importance of a career in engineering and the engineering profession. 
This may be done through programs at school level, by organizations involved in promoting 
engineering education, during community events and through the mainstream media. 
This issue can be addressed at strategic level by implementing public financial support 
programs for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Programs that provide financial 
assistance, in various forms, for potential engineering students from low-income households 
would seem to be central to increasing the number of engineering students from disadvantaged 
groups.  This in turn would give the underrepresented population an opportunity to choose a 
career in engineering and become a part of the workforce that foster economic productivity of 
the province and country. 
5.1.6 Financial Support 
Almost two-third of participants in this study stated that their education was funded either 
by their parents/relatives or through scholarships and awards. Results in the previous section 
showed that parental annual income for almost half of the participants was more than $100,000. 
As Davis-Kean (2005) suggests, parenting behavior is a function of a parent’s own academic 
experience. Financial support to children may also be a result of parents’ own experiences of 
dealing with education loans and the difficulties associated with them. External financial support 
for post-secondary studies mainly from parents and relatives clearly emerges as an important 
mean through which engineering students fund their education. The majority of respondents in 
this study were raised by educated parents in smaller, two-parent families with good incomes. 
Collectively they constitute the ideal conditions to establish strong ‘means of support’. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
66 
Students belonging to larger families and those whose parents have lower levels of 
education and income are underrepresented among the engineering students who participated in 
this study. Students who overcome these barriers and manage enter the engineering program, are 
likely to be at higher risk of attrition because of financial reasons. They may have to work 
extended hours to pay for their living cost and education. Although this is speculative, this may 
also influence educational outcomes in terms of performance and career prospects. This is an 
avenue for further study.  
Overall, financial support can be seen as a predictor of participation in undergraduate 
engineering education. However, a further analysis of this variable and a comparison with other 
fields of study will help determine if financial support from parents is more evident in 
engineering education than in other sectors. 
5.2 Role of Family Determinants of Decision-Making in Post-Secondary Choice of 
Undergraduate Engineering Degree in Newfoundland and Labrador 
The findings from this study show that parental advice/encouragement, parental pressure 
to be academically competitive, and high value of science and engineering education among 
family members are perceived as enabling influences by almost half of the respondents in the 
study. This is consistent with the previous research by Bers and Galowich, 2002; Cheung, 2007; 
Galotti, 2006; Paulsen, 1990, and a study published by Human Resources and Skills 
Development Canada, 2004. These studies underscore a substantial role for parents in 
encouraging their children to pursue higher education. The data from the present research shows 
that the educational role of parents in academic press, encouragement, advice and value for 
science and engineering education were contributing factors, in addition to the other supports 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
67 
they received from their parents. Bers and Galowich (2002), suggested that discussions within 
families can influence students to pursue higher education. These discussions may also 
strengthen the value of post-secondary education among children. Galotti et al. (2006), found 
that children with higher levels of educational encouragement from their parents tend to believe 
the information provided by them. Since a majority of participants’ parents were university 
educated, participants may have perceived the advice they received as valid. As a follow-up to 
this study, it would be useful to investigate, through qualitative inquiry, the particular types of 
discussions that foster student’s aspiration to engage specifically in undergraduate engineering 
education and the ways in which students respond to such conversations. 
Previous literature is consistent with the results from this study in demonstrating that 
socio-economic status and parental education are positive influences on a child’s post-secondary 
educational choices. However, the educational role of parents (e.g., example, encouragement and 
value for education) tends to be a stronger determinant of post-secondary education prospects 
than socio-economic status and parental education (Horn & Chen, 1998; Human Resources and 
Skills Development Canada, 2004; Paulsen, 1990). The majority of engineering students in the 
study indicated that parent’s value for education, academic press, parental advice and 
encouragement were all determinants in the decision to pursue an engineering degree. 
The most disadvantaged are the families belonging to lower socio-economic sections of 
the society and hence for most part, programs should be focused on them. Interventions at the 
government and school level may be able to change people’s perceptions about education. For 
the most part, teachers are seen as valuable source of knowledge for both children and parents. 
Schools may be able to identify children who may have the ability and aptitude to study 
engineering, but, for economic or other reasons are unlikely to advance to engineering programs 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
68 
at university and focus on educating their parents on the importance of education and how this 
may impact their children’s future well-being. Programming can be introduced in specific 
schools located in low income zones within the province.  A more robust level of communication 
with parents may not only strengthen the relationship between school and parents, but also help 
educate the disadvantaged parents about importance of education (more specifically engineering) 
and available financial assistance. At the government level, the Department of Children, Seniors, 
and Social Development and Eastern Health in Newfoundland and Labrador works with the 
families at various level. Early childhood development and parenting are part of programming at 
these government organizations. Information sharing around importance of education among 
families seeking services from these organizations may be considered as an additional option.  
Family determinants in decision about post-secondary program choices should be 
explored further to understand current perceptions among parents about careers in STEM fields. 
Knowledge about the impact of family determinants can help policy communities plan ways to 
engage parents in supporting their children to choose a career in engineering. Saying that, higher 
parental education, income, and type of family still remain the strongest determinants of choice 
of an engineering degree. 
5.3 Role of the High School in Post-Secondary Choice of Undergraduate Engineering 
Degree in Newfoundland and Labrador 
The findings from this study raise questions about the impact of high schools on student 
choice to pursue an engineering degree. While generally schools motivate students to pursue 
higher education through various means, from classroom instruction and experiential learning to 
counselling, school based determinants were not strongly associated with the decision of 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
69 
participants to study engineering. The findings from this research support the argument made by 
Hossler et al. (1999) that there is no substantial relationship between students’ educational 
aspirations and their interaction with their teachers or guidance counselors. Moreover 
counselling/career information, and career seminars and fairs were not widely reported as being 
influential in career decision-making. It is possible that teachers and counselors are not providing 
sufficient advice/encouragement with respect to STEM as a career, or high schools may lack 
sufficient capacity to provide appropriate career advice. Hossler et al. (1999) advocate for more 
related professional development opportunities for teachers and counselors while arguing that 
teachers and counselors have limited knowledge around college decision-making process, which 
hinders them from offering valuable advice to students and their parents. 
The results from this research raise questions about the effectiveness of career 
counselling and career seminars/fairs programs and/or events in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Cheung (2007) states that a positive correlation exists between participation in extra-curricular 
activities and post-secondary educational aspirations. She claims that participation in extra-
curricular activities is positively correlated with post-secondary educational aspirations. 
Similarly, Hossler and Stage (1992) and Stage and Hossler (1989) claim that students who are 
involved in extra-curricular activities during high school are more likely to have higher 
educational aspirations. However, with respect to undergraduate engineering education in 
Newfoundland and Labrador, the results are not consistent with these claims, as only about a 
quarter of the participants report that co-curricular activities influenced their decision to pursue a 
degree in engineering. So, in terms of extra-curricular activities in school, either they are 
inconsequential in terms of availability or, they are not very influential in piquing student interest 
in engineering or applied science careers. The data suggest that students don’t see ‘co-curricular 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
70 
activities in science/engineering’ as a characteristic of ‘academic focus in science/engineering’ 
or building blocks towards careers in engineering. 
This study highlights a need to strengthen capacity among teachers (particularly science 
teachers) and career counselors in high-schools. Better school based experiences to attract 
students and more relevant information may increase students’ interest in STEM subjects. 
Further research in this area might assist schools to provide adequate guidance and 
encouragement to students in context of higher education in engineering or other STEM areas. 
With respect to extra-curricular activities, further research may be able to discuss the forms of 
extra-curricular activities that may be effective in stimulating interest in STEM fields. We know 
that students from lower socio-economic background are underrepresented in engineering 
education, and they may not have access to high-quality career advice at home. Teachers and 
counselors have a pivotal role to play and can inspire such children to attain higher-education. 
5.4 Role of Society in Post-Secondary Choice of Undergraduate Engineering Degree in 
Newfoundland and Labrador 
Results indicate that the social value of a career in science/engineering is a determinant of 
students’ decision to pursue a degree in engineering. These results support the findings of Gibson 
and Hutton (2017), who suggest that even though the familiarity about engineers and engineering 
profession was relatively lower in Canada than in some other professions, the overall impression, 
trust, and respect for engineers and engineering profession increased with increased familiarity. 
The findings from this study validate findings from studies in other jurisdictions that illustrate 
the social value of the engineering and science professions. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
71 
Only about a third of participants cited general social pressure to choose engineering as 
an influencing factor in their program decision. Social pressure to be academically competitive 
was shown to be a stronger determinant of students’ decision to pursue a degree in engineering 
than social pressure to study engineering/science. Interestingly, less than half (46.3%) of the 
participants indicated that peer influence played a role in formulating their decision to pursue a 
degree in engineering. 
Other than social value for a career in engineering, none of the other factors under social 
determinants (i.e. general social pressure to study engineering, availability of 
information/counselling in society, career fair and seminars, peer pressure and social pressure to 
be academically competitive) seems to influence students to pursue a career in engineering. 
Students disagreed that general information about engineering careers or counselling or career 
seminars, was an influence. Again, this may be question of quality or quantity of such events. 
Additional research on societal determinants might help address the question about lack of 
quality or mode of information sessions, counselling, and career seminars. 
5.5 Role of Personal Factors in Post-Secondary Choice of Undergraduate Engineering 
Degree in Newfoundland and Labrador 
The results show that personal factors were perceived as playing the strongest role in 
decision to pursue an engineering degree. The variables under personal determinants registered 
the highest level of agreement in terms of their impact on the decision to pursue an 
undergraduate degree in engineering. Results about aptitude for science/engineering and 
academic success in previous STEM coursework aligned with the literature that student 
achievement is one of the best predictors of higher education aspirations (Bishop, 1977; Hossler 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
72 
et al., 1999; Jackson, 1978; Sharp et al., 1996; Tuttle, 1981). In Canada, academic self-
confidence and beliefs about the relevance of education to job and career has also been shown to 
have a strong influence on educational aspirations (Cheung, 2007).  
The participants in this study seem to be motivated mainly by personal desire, previous 
academic performance, aptitude, and perceived economic benefit of higher education in the area 
of engineering. Around 90% of the respondents indicated personal motivation and 85% indicated 
personal desire to work as an engineer the reason to pursue an engineering degree. Both desire 
and motivation to work as an engineer are a function of awareness about the engineering 
profession.  Students belonging to highly educated parents earning high incomes are likely to be 
subjected to conditions that foster the awareness of various professional fields earlier in their 
lives. Around 90% of participants attributed their aptitude for engineering subject matter as a 
factor in their choice to pursue a degree in engineering and more than 75% indicated academic 
success in previous STEM subjects to be a factor.  
Even though personal factors were perceived as the strongest determinant, it is fair to say 
that the ‘person’ in personal factors is a product of cumulative advantages that student received 
during the progression of life while being part of a family in a higher socio-economic group. 
Parental education, income, stable family environment, and financial support, all contributed in 
developing this ‘person’. Similarly, this ‘person’ can also be called a product of a school’s 
culture and climate, educational resources and quality of instruction. This individualistic 
orientation has been studied by Hofstede (1986) who considers Canada as a ‘loosely-knit 
society’ where self-image is defined in terms of ‘I’ rather than ‘we’. He further states that people 
in individualistic societies consider education as a medium through which one can improve 
his/her social and economic worth. Further study could be directed towards questions about what 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
73 
students perceive as the building blocks for their academic success and aptitude in STEM 
subjects. 
5.6 Role of Economic Factors in Post-Secondary Choice of Undergraduate Engineering 
Degree in Newfoundland and Labrador 
The majority (84.1%) of the participants perceive future economic benefit/earning 
potential of a career in engineering as a principal determinant of their decision to pursue an 
engineering degree. This is consistent with the general understanding that engineers earn 
impressive salaries and this is borne out in the literature. STEM career areas, in particular, carry 
a premium in overall job market (Rothwell, 2013). Since the majority of participants belong to 
higher socio-economic backgrounds they are likely to have been exposed to such knowledge and 
the expectation that they will become high earners, either through their immediate family 
members or by people they interact with in daily life. This also mean that students understand the 
importance of and implications associated with financial security. This may be a driving force 
behind choosing to pursue a degree in engineering. From an economic standpoint, being exposed 
to the life choices of their own parents (who generally belong to higher socio-economic stratum) 
may also be a factor that influences the desire to become an engineer. Educated parents with 
high-income may transmit the importance of economic benefits of degrees such as engineering 
that tend to prepare students for high-earning jobs.   
On the other hand, the barriers outlined earlier in Chapter 5 may hinder an individual’s 
aspiration to pursue a degree in engineering. Students who come from low-income families may 
not be exposed to such information. Their decision to pursue or not to pursue and engineering 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
74 
degree may be based upon different family experiences and expectations, patterns of non-
attendance or other circumstances, such as financial limitations. 
Bourdieu (1986) argues that social advantages or disadvantages (social capital) are 
passed on from one generation to another. Many of the so-called enabling factors discussed in 
previous sections may act in concert to develop a student’s understanding of the economic and 
social value of higher education, in this instance, an engineering degree. This can be thought of 
as a cycle, where an individual’s level of education determines the kind of job he/she is qualified 
for, his/her income level, and subsequent social and professional network. A person’s social and 
professional network will then expose the individual to other people with similar characteristics, 
that is, people with higher education will, for most part, network with people who have similar 
values, levels of education and stations in life. This builds and perpetuates forms of social capital 
within certain families that may transmit these same social values and dispositions to their 
children, which builds their children’s social capital. Their children, during their school years, 
may develop more comprehensive understanding of the importance of education and its 
relevance to their future. Such families also have the means to provide financial support for 
higher education for their children. Higher education will help get them earn the credentials to 
enter the workforce in a high-paying job and the cycle repeats. 
5.7 Conclusions 
Increasing the number of engineering and applied science students is an important 
strategic priority for the Canadian labour market, but there has been very limited research that 
investigates the social and economic processes that influence Canadian youngsters to pursue 
careers in engineering. We still don’t fully understand why so few Canadian students choose to 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
75 
pursue a STEM related career. Xie et al. (2015) blames national cultural traditions and 
‘disadvantages’ that students face across various facets of life and recommends for more 
research in this area. Recent U.S. studies suggest a need to identify factors that casually promote 
student engagement and achievement in STEM areas (Xie et al., 2015; Xie & Killewald, 2012). 
In the Canadian context, the present study is one step forward in that direction. Using 
quantitative inquiry that includes a cross-sectional survey, this research focused on profiling and 
describing the enabling and limiting factors that influence students to pursue undergraduate 
engineering education. The findings present a snapshot of the demographic characteristics 
(which includes gender, family type, parental education, parental income, family size etc.) that 
are associated with a students’ decision to pursue a degree in engineering in Newfoundland and 
Labrador. The findings also reveal the extent to which certain, school based, social, economic, 
and personal influences are associated with the decision to pursue a degree in engineering and 
applied science. Perception of higher economic value of studying engineering and personal 
factors like aptitude for STEM subject matter and previous success in them, play a major role in 
the decision to pursue engineering degree. 
One of the important findings of this research is the demonstration of an apparent 
imbalance in the socio-economic profile of engineering students, where students from lower 
income families are underrepresented. Previous research suggests that students belonging to 
lower income families are underrepresented not only in engineering but in any form of higher-
education. Efforts to increase opportunities for underrepresented groups (including girls) to  
make engineering studies and preparation for other STEM-based occupations more accessible 
will improve the number of Canadian engineers and applied scientists   At the policy level, 
efforts should be focused on   funding opportunities to access higher education. 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
76 
Schools can play a significant role in framing an individual’s future. Teachers and 
counselors need to be well equipped with knowledge around the future economic global 
demands through professional development opportunities made available to them. STEM 
educators specifically should be trained in such was way that they view a degree in sciences as a 
means for social mobility. Since STEM related extra-curricular activities are not perceived as a 
major influence in an individual’s decision to study engineering, further study could help 
determine how such activities could be better designed and implemented. 
5.8 Implications for Practice 
This study will help policy makers and practitioners develop a better understanding of 
post-secondary decision-making in Newfoundland and Labrador, specifically in the context of 
engineering studies at Memorial University. The findings presented here will be useful to 
institutions, agencies and government departments in developing programs and other strategies 
towards developing students’ interest in and ability to pursue engineering as a field of study. 
Specifically, government departments such as the Provincial Department of Education 
and Early Childhood Development and the Department of Advanced Studies may wish to use 
this research towards building capacity among teachers and counselors in liaison with Faculty of 
Engineering and Applied Sciences to develop or improve science related extra-curricular and 
experiential learning activities to benefit students. Educational agencies should especially look to 
develop targeted financial assistance programs that will strengthen the supports for low-income 
students. With a combined effort from universities, schools, and government, our capacity in 
engineering and STEM-related occupations will increase and contribute to Canada’s prosperity, 
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
77 
and economic competitiveness. Further research, including longitudinal research to study how 
such programs may benefit targeted population would also be beneficial. 
Some other countries, notably India and China, have developed their societies in a such a 
way that they promote STEM education through many social processes. For example, from my 
own experience growing up in India, the students who do well are well recognized in national 
and local media, which motivates others to do well. Student success stories and their narratives 
are profiled on news channels and newspapers.  The role of family in student success is 
recognized and it is an integral part of prime-time news on major national TV channels. 
Individuals and organizations working in education promotion may use this study to develop 
programs for children. This research points to an opportunity to establish social enterprises in 
field of engineering education, similar to the educational enterprises in India and China that 
inspire and empower middle and lower middle class students to climb the economic ladder. An 
international comparative study with these two Asian countries that fulfill global skills demand 
can give rise to new knowledge in the field of STEM education. Since India and China are 
producing STEM graduates at a very higher rate, data from these two countries can be a point of 
reference to make comparisons and identify what (as a society) is motivating a large number of 
students to pursue careers in engineering there. 
5.9 Recommendations 
 There are two major findings of this study, (1) students from certain sections of the 
society and demographic characteristics are disadvantaged in the journey to become engineers, 
and; (2) the decision to pursue an engineering degree is largely motivated by personal factors; 
there is no apparent relationship between students’ educational aspirations and their formal 
career advice or supports ate the school level.  
FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICE OF DEGREE IN ENGINEERING 
 
78 
The key to overcome these barriers is financial support at two levels. First, in the Newfoundland 
and Labrador context, there is an apparent need, for funding and program development at the 
intermediate and high school levels focused on the development and delivery of training 
programs for STEM subject teachers and guidance counselors. These programs might be 
concentrated on promoting engineering education and encouraging female students and those 
from low-income households to pursue careers in engineering fields. Second, individual financial 
support should be targeted towards students (scholarships, awards, incentives etc.) from low-
income families and female students.  
The training programs will provide professional development opportunities for 
teachers/counselors to offer extended support and knowledge (for example, knowledge about 
engineering field, social benefits of earning an engineering degree, basic requirements for 
enrollment in university to study engineering, economic value of engineering degree, financial 
supports available etc.) to students and families underrepresented in engineering fields. This 
support will create an awareness and desire of pursuing post-secondary engineering degree 
among students and those with aptitude in math and physics may participate in university 
engineering programs with the help of level two financial support programs. 
5.10 Summary of Chapter Five 
In this chapter I highlight the enabling or limiting factors students perceive to influence 
their decision to pursue a degree in engineering.  I also discuss the key findings, conclusions and 
implications from the study, and suggest recommendations for policy decision-makers.

Although there is no current imbalance in demand and supply of engineers and scientists in Canada, it is also true that the global need for these skills is currently at its peak with substantial future growth opportunities. With competition from emerging economies like India and China, it is essential for government, schools and universities, and other agencies in the Canadian education system to understand the factors influencing Canadian students’ participation in post-secondary degree in engineering. Review of the literature shows that there has been limited investigation of this phenomenon. Using a cross-sectional survey design, this study, set in the Newfoundland Labrador context, examines certain demographic, family, high school, societal, economic, and personal factors that play a role in students’ academic decisions to pursue an undergraduate engineering degree. The findings show that participation in undergraduate engineering programs at Memorial University is associated with student’s family background and gender. Students from lower socio-economic backgrounds and women are underrepresented in undergraduate engineering education in Newfoundland and Labrador. The results also reveal that engineering student represent their decisions to pursue engineering as influenced primarily by personal factors and only marginally by school-level factors. The study points to a number of implications for policy and practice. Among the policy actions that could increase the number of engineering students from underrepresented groups is reexamining and, where necessary substantially improving support programs for underrepresented populations – both at the secondary and post-secondary levels. At the school level, this might involve greater attention to engaging students in STEM-based experiential activities and programs, explicitly exposing students to information on careers in engineering and the applied sciences, and professional development for teachers and counselors. At the post-secondary level, financial support to students from underrepresented groups and continued research in the area of engineering education may increase participation in engineering and help create equitable educational opportunities in the field of engineering for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds","['Thesis', 'NonPeerReviewed']",disabled

Creating Social Value within the Delivery of Construction 
Projects  
Abstract 
Purpose –The purpose of this paper is to present the current knowledge 
surrounding social value and show how lean approach supports social value 
realisation in the delivery of construction projects. 
Design/methodology/approach – A critical literature review was adopted, to 
gather the current knowledge surrounding social value from mainstream 
management sciences, construction management and lean literature. A total of 
70 studies were critically reviewed. 
Findings –The study establishes that the current level of awareness on social 
value is still low and there is a dearth of scholarly publications on social value 
especially in construction management literature. The investigation reveals the 
potentials of lean approach in supporting the delivery of social value on 
construction projects. 
Social implication –This study conceptualises the community and the physical 
environment around where the construction project is executed as customers 
using lean production approach. It shows that the Transformation, Flow & Value 
view supports smooth workflow which enhances the achievement of social value 
objectives. This creates a new insight into how social value can be realised in 
construction project delivery. 
Originality and Value –This study extends the on-going debate around the 
need for social value in construction project delivery and contributes to 
construction management and lean construction literature on social value. 
Future studies could build on this to obtain empirical data and develop an 
approach/method that would support the evidencing of social value delivery on 
construction projects. 
 
  
Introduction 
The crux of most human endeavours is to create or add value to a system or a 
process. Value has been understood as the satisfaction or quality derived by the 
customer from a product or service received (Zeithaml, 1988). Sweeney and 
Soutar (2001) classified value into three major dimensions. These are (1) 
Emotional (2) Social (3) Functional. Emotional value is the feeling or pleasure 
driven by using a product or service (Sweeney and Soutar, 2001). While there is 
evidence that supports the construction industry's attention to the creation of 
functional value from its operations (Kelly et al., 2014), there is less evidence to 
support its consideration for emotional and social value (Arroyo and Gonzalez, 
2016; Pavez and Alarcon, 2007). However, in recent times, there have been 
calls to different sectors including the construction industry to deliver social 
value (SV) from their operations (Arroyo and Gonzalez, 2016; Choi et al., 2014; 
Fernandes et al., 2011). This could be due to the impact of the construction 
industry's activities on social as well as the economic and environmental well-
being of people and communities.

Social value is the benefit a community and its inhabitants obtain in terms 
of social, economic and environmental wellbeing from companies or 
organisations conducting business around the community. According to Hunter, 
(2014) social value is what a community receives from an organisation from the 
execution of its business. This arises from the impact of such operations, 
whether it has improved or worsened the life of the people in the community. 
But sadly, this is less practised in the delivery of construction projects. Pavez 
and Alarcon (2007) observed that most construction management methods 
focus more on the contract and project with little or no concern on the social 
elements that relate to the people and the community. 
Globally, there are now laws and regulations encouraging the built 
environment sector to move towards social value creation. For instance, in the 
USA, we have the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independent and 
Security Act of 2007; in the UK, the Inequality and Diversity Act of 2010 and the 
Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012; within the EU, there is the Sustainable 
Procurement directive 2014 among others. Even with these, the current 
understanding and conceptualisation of social value, especially in the context of 
delivering a construction project, still remains unclear. For instance, the term 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Shared Value are sometimes used to 
mean social value. Although Georgeson, (2012) criticised such narrow 
perception on social value, it shows the concept is not yet well understood in the 
construction industry sector.  
It has been reported in the UK, Australia and the USA that construction is 
the sector showing the least commitment to social value creation (Villeneuve-
Simth and Chung, 2013; Kernot and McNeill 2011; Barraket et al., 2010; Clark 
and Ucak, 2006). However, Loosemore (2015) argues that the construction 
industry is well positioned for delivering social value objectives from its 
operations. For example, the construction industry is the world’s largest 
employer; largest employer of youths and it has the capacity to create local jobs 
in the communities of operation (Loosemore, 2016a). Despite these 
opportunities, the concept of social value is yet to receive attention from 
construction management researchers (Loosemore, 2015a). According to 
Dreveland and Lohne (2015), lack of clear understanding of value (and its 
associated concepts such as social value) could make detailed discussion on it 
difficult, and invariably, its application and practice would be limited.  
In recent times, the lean construction approach has shown to be a viable 
means of creating value and minimising waste on construction projects 
(Bertelsen, 2004; Koskela, 1992). Previous studies have also explored and 
shown links between lean construction and sustainable practices (Johnsen and 
Dreveland, 2016; Fuenzalida et al., 2016; Maris and Parrish, 2016; Wu and 
Wang, 2016; Huovila and Koskela 1998). However, very limited studies have 
explored the role of lean construction approach as a means to creating ‘social 
value’ in the built environment. Also, there is generally less discussion on social 
value in construction management literature (Loosemore, 2015), and recent 
reports indicate that social value awareness is still low (Burke and King; 2015; 
Social Value Act, review, 2015).  
This study was therefore undertaken to unravel the current knowledge 
surrounding social value through a critical literature review. The study presents

findings from a review of the literature on the current knowledge surrounding 
‘social value' and its drivers. It discusses the relationship between social value, 
CSR and Shared Value. Additionally, this study aims to show how the lean 
production concept of ""customer"" could be used to support social value 
realisation in the delivery of construction projects. The key research questions 
addressed are:  
(1) What is the current understanding surrounding social value delivery?  
(2) How can lean approach support the realisation of social value delivery 
on construction projects?  
This paper extends the on-going debate around social value from construction 
management and lean construction perspectives and contributes to the literature 
on social value in construction management. More importantly, it creates a new 
insight into how social value can be realised in construction project delivery 
using lean production philosophy. The paper is structured thus; the first section 
discusses the current knowledge surrounding social value. The section examines 
the concept of social value, the need for social value, its current drivers and the 
relationship between social value, Shared Value and CSR. The second section 
examines the role of lean approaches in delivering social value on construction 
projects. 
Research Method 
The use of literature review in understanding current knowledge and creating 
new insight for future research agenda is growing in medical sciences, 
management sciences and more importantly in construction management 
research (Naoum and Egbu, 2016; Tranfield et al., 2003; Gant and Booth, 
2009). In order to explore the current knowledge around social value and 
provide an insight into the on-going debate from construction management and 
lean construction perspectives, a critical literature review approach was adopted. 
Grant and Booth, (2009) confirmed that critical literature review allows for the 
synthesis of materials from different sources, allows for a degree of analysis and 
conceptual innovations, provides a conceptual contribution to existing body of 
knowledge and serves as a launch pad for new research. These attributes of 
critical review align with the focus of the current study.  
However, critical review approach has been viewed to be unsystematic 
(Grant and Booth, 2009). To overcome this in the current study, a review 
strategy was developed. Purposive and snowballing sampling approach was 
adopted in selecting studies included in the review (Bryman, 2015; Sanders, 
2011). Purposive sampling approach enables the researcher to select the 
population (articles or studies) that are relevant in answering the research 
questions. The goal here is not in the quantitative or statistical analysis of the 
studies, rather it is in the interpretative analysis of the study included. This 
means the focus of the literature search would not be rigid as in systematic 
reviews (Tranfield et al., 2003). This approach allows a search of as many 
sources as possible and to identify relevant materials that answer the research 
question. Grant and Booths, (2009) argued that the essence of a critical review 
is not in quality assessment of the studies, but to interpretively analyse the 
studies included and provide a conceptual contribution. The focus of the current 
study is to make a conceptual contribution to the current knowledge around

social value from construction management and lean construction perspectives 
through interpretive analysis of the studies included in the review in order to 
answer the research questions. Additionally, Sanders et al., (2012) show that 
the snowballing approach is used when it is difficult to identify the members of 
the proposed population for the study from the onset. In this study, snowballing 
approach was used to identify other relevant articles and materials through a 
close examination of the reference lists and bibliographies of already identified 
relevant studies.  
The population for the study was literature that focuses on social value and 
lean in mainstream management science, construction management and lean 
construction. In achieving this, a robust literature search protocol that selects 
publications based on source and its relationship to the study research question 
was developed. This includes combining key terms from the study and 
subsequently searching on databases, perusing of the identified paper abstract 
and snowballing of relevant study reference lists and bibliographies. Through this 
process, relevant materials that align with the research question were identified 
and critically reviewed.   
A search of the literature was done using online databases; Emerald, 
Elsevier, Scopus, Google scholar, Willey online, Taylor and Francis online. In 
addition, peer review articles from The International Group for Lean Group for 
Lean Construction (IGLC) publications and relevant materials that answer the 
research questions were identified. The search was conducted between January 
and December 2017. A number of terms and combination of terms that align 
with the topics were used in the search. These include, but not limited to; ‘social 
value', ‘social value in construction project', 'lean project delivery', ‘lean thinking' 
‘value in lean construction', ‘value in construction', ‘customer in lean production' 
‘lean production', ‘shared value', ‘Corporate Social Responsibility', ‘lean 
construction and social value', ‘sustainable construction', ‘drivers for social 
value', and ‘social value theory'. The articles reviewed were those published in 
English language and that align with the topic.  
However, it emerged from the search that not much had been documented 
on the social value on some of these databases and journals especially in 
relation to construction project delivery. For instance, a purposive search on the 
term ""social value"" in the Journal of Construction Management and Economics 
revealed only 14 papers. Again, this confirms that the concept of social value is 
still at an infant stage in construction management literature (Loosemore, 
2015a; 2015). As a consequence, the search was extended to include 
government reports, technical reports and website materials on social value. 
This was done to gain an in-depth understanding of the current debate around 
social value and to ensure no available relevant materials were omitted. A total 
of 70 studies were critically reviewed.   
Current Knowledge Surrounding Social Value 
The Concept of Social Value 
There is a lack of absoluteness in the definition of ‘social value’. According to 
Choi et al., (2014) social value is complex to define due to its intricate and 
subjective nature. Nevertheless, various reports and research publications have

attempted to offer definitions and explanations on the concept of “social value” 
as presented in Table 1. The table presents the definitions of social value and 
the emerging themes found from the several definitions. The publications in 
Table 1 are categorised into two; government publications (non-research 
publications) and research publications. Analysis of the definitions and emerging 
themes from both government and research publications show that in order to 
create social value, every business should consider how its operation would 
improve the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the communities 
where they execute their business. Applying this to construction, Loosemore and 
Hoggin, (2015) reiterate that the goal of construction firms, therefore, should 
not only be to make profits and improve productivity for its stakeholders, but it 
should include engaging and improving the communities where they build. 
Notwithstanding, Table 1 confirms the previous assertions that there is no 
absolute definition of social value (Loosemore, 2015; Choi et al, 2014). For 
instance, from the government publications, it can be seen that Social Enterprise 
UK (SEUK) views social value as ‘thinking' on how scarce resource should be 
used, which is too broad. On the other hand, the social value definition provided 
by HMRC was definite on three elements (social, economic and the environment) 
as the focus of creating social value. It is worth remarking that the need for SV 
measurement was highlighted in most of the research publications' definitions. 
But this was not clearly mentioned in government publications' definitions of 
social value. This could be due to the empirical nature of the research 
publication studies and the increasing understanding of the need for measuring 
the social impact of an organisation's operations. In addition to social value 
measurement, some authors argued in their definitions that social value is 
beyond compliance with CSR by organisations (Loosemore, 2016; 2015a). The 
emphasis on the need for measuring social value from the research publications 
shows that it is not sufficient to just include the social value in a contract; 
strategies for measuring it should also be put in place. 
 
Insert Table 1 here. 
 
Furthermore, Table 1 reveals that, despite the current understanding on 
social value, there is still no clear or single criterion for measuring social value 
(Retolaza et al; 2015; Loosemore and Hoggin, 2015; Choi et al, 2014). This 
means the criteria to be used in measuring or identifying social value and the 
additional benefits to be created as stated in some of the definitions of social 
value in Table 1 could differ for different context and audience. It is no surprise 
Choi et al., (2014) assert that social value is very elusive compared to economic 
value as there is lack of objective approach to measuring its outcomes. 
According to Burke and King, (2015), subjectivity in social outcome could limit 
objective measurement in social value, as situations and events could change in 
the process. 
This implies that there should be no prescriptive approach in defining the 
supposed additional benefits mentioned in the definition of social value above, 
rather, the nature of the stakeholders in the community, context, and situations 
should define the additional benefits expected from the process. The implication 
of this for construction organisations in the delivery of its project is that; the

social values to be created on a project should not be pre-determined outside 
the project environment, rather they should be identified through direct 
engagement with the stakeholders in the community. However, this is less 
practised by construction organisations. Georgeson, (2012) observed that 
traditionally, organisations use a top-down approach to decide what to provide 
for a community as part of their CSR. However, this is contrary to the bottom-up 
approach advocated in social value practice. 
The need for Delivering Social Value 
The need for delivering products and services with regard to the impact on the 
economy, the environment and social well-being of the community is increasing 
in every sector (Choi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2011). According to Ghazali, 
(2007) organisations that do not care for the environment or contribute to the 
wellbeing of the community could have their services and products boycotted 
and image degraded. This suggests that companies can engage in the creation 
of social value to increase or improve their social image in the eyes of 
stakeholders. However, it has been observed that the commercial sector is 
reluctant to practice social value, as it is usually seen as a separate entity from 
an economic value (Choi et al., 2014). This view is also supported by the 
separation theory (Friedma , 1962), where companies are seen only as a 
contributing engine to the economic function with less attention to their social 
roles.  
However, charities, social enterprises, NGOs and the public service are 
calling for the consideration and inclusion of social value practice in businesses 
(Choi et al., 2014; Croydon Council, 2013). These demands for creating social 
value alongside economic value are increasing. It has been observed that social 
value is now a growing organisational issue with five different groups identified 
by the G8 to be interested in social value (The Social Impact Investment 
Taskforce, 2014). The groups include government, foundations, social sector 
organisations, impact-driven businesses, and impact investors. Tomlins (2015) 
further described the impact-driven businesses and impact investor groups to be 
customers and users. In construction project delivery, ""the impact-driven 
business group"" can be those the construction operations directly or indirectly 
affect. These groups would expect commitment and contribution to the delivery 
of social value to the community and the environment from construction 
companies operating in their vicinity. According to Ofori et al., (2000) 
consideration for the environment by construction organisations would certainly 
change the way construction projects are executed. However, studies have 
shown that the construction industry is reluctant about this and more concerned 
about the short-term cost benefit from projects (Choi et al., 2014; Ofori et al., 
2002).  
Current drivers for Delivering Social Value 
From the comprehensive literature review, five core drivers for delivering social 
value were identified as presented in Figure 1 and discussed subsequently 
(Tomlins, 2015). These include; 
• The business imperatives for an organisation  
• Business sense of social value

Business Imperative for Social Value  
There is growing understanding of the measurement of the impact of businesses 
in rece t times with attention being given to business delivery and accounting 
for social value (Tomlins, 2015; Scot, 2012). The ""triple bottom line accounting"" 
that considers social, environmental and financial impacts have been used since 
the 1990's to measure business influence (Tomlins, 2015). This approach is also 
known as the 3Ps: that is profit, planet, and people. Traditionally, construction 
project management operation seems to focus more on profit rather than on the 
planet and people (Pavez and Alarcon, 2007). However, Burke and King, (2015) 
observe that commitment to social value objectives make organisations 
competitive. This shows that investment in social value creation by construction 
organisations is not a waste, but rather positions an organisation to perform 
better in its businesses.   
Global interest in Social Value impact 
The need to deliver social value has been echoed by world leaders. At the G8 
meeting held in the UK in 2013, David Cameron, the then UK Prime Minister 
stated that:  
“I want to use our G8 presidency to push this agenda forward. We will work 
with other G8 nations to grow the social investment market and increase 
investment, allowing the best social innovations to spread and help tackle 
our shared social and economic challenges”. David Cameron Prime Minister, 
UK World Economic Forum (The Social Impact Investment Taskforce, 2014, 
p.2). 
The above statement shows the global interest in social value. However, the 
commitment was beyond the statement above as structures were put in place to 
support the achievement of the proposal at the end of the G8 meeting in 2013. 
The three main structures put in place as indicated in the report (The Social 
Impact Investment Taskforce 2014, 2015) are; (1) The Social Impact 
Investment Taskforce to drive the process (2) The Working Group on Impact 
Measurement and (3) The Global Learning Exchange. The commitment of the G8 
to this shows their view on social investment as having a potential to support 
growth, innovation, and to address social problems in the society (Tomlins, 
2015). Also, the EU is committed to supporting social investment. Since 2014, 
85 million Euros has been given out to social enterprises that are able to 
demonstrate measurable social impact (Brussels, 2014).  
Opportunities in Social Investment Market  
Tomlins, (2015) observed that in the UK, the social investment market 
comprises of the private, the public and voluntary sectors. This means 
construction organisations could benefit from the opportunities presented by the 
social investment market. Furthermore, it implies no sector is exempted from

participating in the social investment market and there are numerous 
opportunities in the social investment market. For example, a current report 
indicates that the desire for social investment market in the UK was about £1 
billion in 2014 (UK National Advisory Board, 2014). The very few construction 
organisations that focus on delivering social value are benefiting from these 
opportunities. For instance, in Australia, Boys Town Enterprises deliver social 
value to the community by engaging disadvantaged youths in residential 
construction (Loosemore, 2015). This has empowered over 2,000 disadvantaged 
youths. Also, in the USA, KaBOOM! is another company that focuses on 
delivering social value and it has raised over $200 million dollars and built more 
than 2000 playgrounds (Hammond, 2012). In the UK, Blue Skye Company is 
committed to delivering social value with a focus on offenders (Loosemore, 
2015; 2015a). 
Business sense of Social Value for the Private and Public Sector  
There is evidence that the private sector now sees the business sense of 
committing to social value in the UK. For example, the Chairman of Carillion Plc 
(A top construction company formerly operating in the UK), Philip Green stated 
that: ""Pressure is increasing from the government, the public, the media, 
regulators, and customers for business to behave responsibly … Consumer 
scrutiny of business behaviour is growing. Ignoring these pressures is 
commercially destructive."" (Trading for good report, 2013, p.3). It has also been 
reported that the Chartered Association of Building Engineers has made creating 
social value a core point in their service delivery (Raiden et al., 2016). The 
above statement shows that businesses within the private sector are realising 
the likely impact of lack of commitment to social value in the delivery of their 
operations.  
Legislation and Regulation Driving Social Value Delivery  
In addition to the business imperatives, evidence from literature reveals that 
various legislation and regulations are now in place from across the world to 
drive the consideration for social value in businesses (Tomlins, 2015; 
Loosemore, 2015a; Social Value Act, 2012). For instance, in the USA, there is 
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independent and Security Act of 
2007; in the UK the Inequality and Diversity Act of 2010 and the Public Services 
(Social Value) Act 2012; and within the EU, there is the Sustainable Procurement 
directives 2014 among others.  
Understanding Social Value using Firm Theory 
It is believed that the goal of every organisation should be to create value, and 
this should include the creation of social and economic value for the society. 
According to Porter and Kramer, (2011) social performance is of great 
importance to every society. However, in practice, less attention is paid to the 
creation of social value by companies (Fernandes et al., 2011). To understand 
the concept of social value in firms or organisations, Retolaza et al., (2015) 
suggest the use of firm theories. One of such theories is the theory of 
separation. It tends to present an organisation with two core but independent 
functions which are: ethics and financial performance (Friedman 1962). Ethics,

as shown in Figure 2, is described as the social function of the enterprise, 
otherwise known as social value.  
 
Insert Figure 2 here. 
 
While this assertion is true, it is flawed because there is lack of integration 
between the functions as shown in Figure 2. According to Retolaza, et al., (2015) 
there is lack of clear integration between the economic and social views in the 
separation theory. This view has made companies/organisations believe that the 
foundation of the company’s operation only lies in the economic gain rather than 
in value creation (Retolaza et al., 2015). It could be argued that less 
commitment to the creation of social value could have been influenced by this 
so-called ""separation theory"". However, this narrow view on the function of firms 
has been heavily criticised. Freeman, (1984) called for a shift in the previous 
practice and advocated the need for complete integration of economic and social 
values in the operations of an organisation.   
This implies companies should not view the creation of social value as a 
separate operation from the economic value it hopes to deliver to its 
shareholders, rather, both should be incorporated and delivered as a system 
with a goal of influencing the society at large. Man-Fong Ho (2011), argues that 
business organisations cannot function in a social vacuum, but must definitely 
interact with the communities and the environment where they operate. 
According to Freeman, (1984) a company's sustainability in business and 
creation of value is not only for the company's shareholders but also to the 
society and the environment. This position has great implication for construction 
clients, main contracting companies and supply chain companies in their 
operations. Clearly, it requires a defined strategy by these companies and their 
supply chains to specify how each of their operations would fulfil the economic, 
social, and environmental needs in the delivery of their activities right from the 
economic value proposition stage. This means the economic value proposition 
should not be separated from the social value in the business case. However, 
companies are mainly seen as economic generating blocks (Groth et al., 1998). 
Notwithstanding, Man-Fong Ho, (2011) reiterates that for construction 
organisations to survive in the present day reality, they must pay attention to 
ethical issues (social value) in the delivery of projects. 
This could be demonstrated in new build, maintenance, infrastructure 
projects, and other operations in construction project delivery. In practice, the 
theory requires that generation of economic value should be clearly linked with 
the social elements. It means that social value should not be viewed as an 
extension of economic value as advocated in the separation theory (Friedman, 
1962). Furthermore, what the new theory (theory of integration Freeman, 1984) 
means for main contractors and construction clients is that the assessments of 
supply chains' performance should not be limited to the four project key 
performance indicators (time, cost, quality and safety) alone. It should also 
include their commitment to integrating economic and social value for the 
benefit of the society at large. In doing this, Man-Fong Ho, (2011) suggested 
that the management should develop ethical decision-making guidelines to 
support employees.

The Relationship between Social Value, Corporate Social 
Responsibility and Shared Value 
While these three concepts show a strong relationship with each other, they are 
not exactly the same. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBSCSD) defines corporate social responsibility as ""a continuing commitment 
by business to contribute to economic development while improving the quality 
of life of the workforce and their families as well as the community and the 
society at large"" (WBSCSD 1999, p.3). Shared Value is defined as ""Policies and 
operati g practice that enhances the competitiveness of a company while 
simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities 
in which it operates"" (Porter and Kramer, 2011). Both definitions show the 
intention to contribute to the economic and social conditions of the communities 
of their operations.   
However, in CSR practice, contributing to the economic and social condition 
may not occur simultaneously as expected in Shared Value practice. Shared 
Value has been viewed as an extension of CSR (Georgeson, 2012). Social value, 
on the other hand, has been referred to ""as a wider non-financial impact of 
programmes, organisations, and interventions including the wellbeing of 
individuals and communities, social capital and the environment"" (Wood and 
Leighton 2010). The key difference between the two earlier definitions and social 
value is that social value is not directly tied to the financial gain that would 
accrue from the process. 
This implies that even when there is no obvious financial benefit, a social 
value could still be delivered, although this does not mean that social value does 
not result into financial benefits (Pasquire and Salvatierra-Garrido, 2011). For 
instance, an organisation or corporation could reduce or abandon their 
commitment to CSR and shared value practice if it is observed that the final 
outcome does not align with the company’s business model. Also, CSR and 
Shared Value have been criticised as a top-bottom approach to delivering 
community good (Georgeson, 2012). This implies that the community has little 
say in the decision process. However, delivering social value is a bottom-up 
approach. That is, the community has a major say in determining or identifying 
the social value to be created. All this suggests that social value is beyond CSR 
and Shared Value practices. The key difference therefore between social value, 
CSR and Shared Value is that, while CSR and shared value use a top-bottom 
approach in delivering the community good, social value uses the bottom-up 
approach.  
Social Value in the Context of Construction Project    
There has been increased pressure on the construction industry to deliver social 
value through its processes (Social Value Act, 2012). This is no surprise because 
of the obvious impact of construction activities on the local economy, community 
and the environment where it operates. Despite this call, the industry seems not 
to focus on these issues (local economy, community and the environment) in the 
delivery of construction projects. Salvatierra-Garrido and Pasquire (2011) assert 
that the focus of value delivery on a construction project is that of meeting the 
client's requirement and making a profit for the organisation without due 
consideration for delivering value (social value) for the larger society. 
Furthermore, Kagioglou et al, (1999) observe that the construction industry is

keener about the final product than the processes involved in delivering it. This 
traditional view, when adopted, would not support the delivery of SV on 
construction projects. This is because the creation of high impact SV emerges 
from the processes rather than the final product. It is with this understanding 
that authors such as Farag et al., (2016); Salvatierra-Garrido and Pasquire, 
(2011) emphasised the need to consider the impact of construction activity on 
the wider society and to integrate social value delivery into the delivery process 
of a construction project. However, Porter and Kramer (2011) found that SV is 
considered to be a philanthropic activity rather than an activity that must be 
engaged with for successful delivery of a construction project. This means there 
may still be some reluctance by construction project organisations in considering 
SV delivery as part of their core function in the project execution process.  
Howeve , this does not mean SV is not being implemented on construction 
projects as some studies have reported some form of its implementation on 
construction projects in different parts of the world; In the UK (Bridgeman et al., 
2016; Bridgeman et al., 2015; Burke and King, 2015; Loosemore and Barraket, 
2017), in Sweden;(Petersen and Kadefors, 2016), and in Australia; (Denny-
Smith and Loosemore, 2017; Reid and Loosemore, 2017) among others. This 
shows the need to consider SV in the delivery of construction project is gaining 
attention. According to Salvatierra-Garrido and Pasquire (2011), the construction 
industry needs to show more commitment to improving the wider society where 
they operate because of the impact of their activities on the society.  
Social Value in Construction Procurement 
The importance of incorporating social value in the procurement process in the 
construction industry cannot be overemphasised. Recent studies have shown 
social procurement has the approach used in creating social value in construction 
project delivery (Denny-Smith and Loosemore, 2017; Pertersen and Kadofors, 
2016; Reid and Loosemore, 2016). The use of social procurement in the delivery 
of construction project has been reported in different parts of the world; in 
Sweden (Petersen and Kadefors, 2016); in Australia (Reid and Loosemore, 2017) 
and in the UK (Loosemore and Barraket, 2017; Bridgeman et al., 2016, 2015; 
Croydon Council, 2013). This could be so since the procurement process drives 
how the project is delivered. In the UK, Croydon Council reported some case 
studies on how SV was incorporated into evaluation criteria, tender stage and 
tender documentation in the delivery of its construction projects.  
However, this must be viewed with caution, as Reid and Loosemore, 
(2017) found from their Australian study that the social procurement is done 
mostly by organisations to comply with the regulation. The danger with this is 
that, if organisations view it as a tick box exercise rather than improving the 
local economy, the local community and environment where they operate, the 
goal of the entire process would be defeated. This means in addition to the 
inclusion of contractual clauses that support SV delivery, a personal relationship 
built on trust should also be developed. Reid and Loosemore, (2017) affirmed 
that a mixture of contractual and interpersonal approach is the sure panacea to 
secure social procurement in the delivery of construction projects. Nevertheless, 
the use of contractual clauses is essential in incorporating SV into the delivery 
process of the project due to the barriers that respective procurement methods 
(such as Traditional procurement system, design and build, management

contracting and construction management) used on the project may present. The 
implication of this for organisations is that they should structure their contracts 
and add clauses to enable them to deliver social value irrespective of the 
procurement method used (Cook et al 2014). 
Social Value and Construction Project    
It is important that every construction project is designed to contribute and 
improve the economy, the local community and the environment where it 
operates. A review of the extant literature reveals construction project related 
social value tailored initiatives as shown in Table 2. 
 
Insert Table 2 here: 
 
 
The importance of committing to these construction project social value tailored 
initiatives cannot be overstated. In practice, it entails encouraging the use of 
local content in the procurement of materials, labour and services. For example, 
case studies have shown that providing training opportunities has led to the 
gainful employment of young people and for those Not in employment, 
education or training (NEET), thus contributing to a circular economy (Alen and 
Alen, 2015; Croydon Council,2013). Circular economy goes beyond waste 
prevention and minimisation; it also includes social innovation through 
engagement with the value chains (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). 
Bridgeman et al., (2016) found from their study that providing training and 
placement opportunities for students influences their future career choice and 
demonstrates social return investment. However, the practice of these in 
construction project delivery is still fragmented and unsystematic with supply 
chain focusing on low value and low-risk activities (Reid and Loosemore, 2017; 
Burke and King, 2015). 
Furthermore, consideration for the environment is also essential in 
delivering SV on construction projects. The United Nation Conference on Climatic 
Change held in France in December 2015 is one among many calls to protect the 
environment (United Nation, 2015). More importantly, construction industry 
activities have been identified to impact the environment negatively (Green 
Building, 1999). For instance, 50% of natural resources are consumed in the 
construction of buildings (Green Building, 1999). To contribute and maintain the 
social well-being of the stakeholders in the community where construction 
activities are undertaken, organisations should carefully consider how their 
operations could impact on the existing natural environment. Research has 
shown that the implementation of social value by caring for the environment 
improves the health and mental well-being of the stakeholders living in the 
community (Georgeson, 2012).

Examining the Role of Lean Approach in Social 
Value Delivery on Construction Projects. 
Search in Lean Production Approach 
 
Various authors have described extensively the evolution of lean production and 
the TPS in the manufacturing industry (Shah and Ward, 2007; Womack and 
Jones, 1999). The goal of lean production is to add value and eliminate waste 
from the product right from design through to the manufacturing or production 
stage. However, Shah and Ward, (2007) cautioned that lean production should 
not be viewed as waste elimination alone, but, rather as an integrated process 
that considers both the product and the processes involved in developing the 
product. This implies that the focus of lean production is not just on the final 
product, but also on the processes that culminate in the development of the final 
product. Sadly, this view is less upheld in the delivery of construction projects. 
According to Kagioglou et al, (1999) construction project delivery focuses more 
on the final product than on the processes involved in delivering it. The social 
value, on the other hand, emphasises the need for every construction project to 
critically consider the processes involved in the delivery of its final product with 
the goal of creating a positive influence on stakeholders in the community, the 
local economy and on the physical environment. In the Toyota Production 
System (TPS), this entails recognising the problem that would impede flow in the 
production and incorporate it as a task in the production process (Spear, 2002). 
This implies understanding the impact of a construction project on the local 
community, the local economy and the environment, and integrating them into 
the project execution process would support better value delivery from the 
construction project. 
From the foregoing, it could be argued that the lean production approach or 
view has more potential to support the achievement of social value delivery on 
construction project compared to the current traditional view that dominates 
construction project delivery. This is because the latter focuses more on the 
product than the process involved in delivering it (Farag et al, 2016; Ballard and 
Howell; 2004; Kagioglou et al, 1999). However, the view of likening the 
manufacturing industry (lean production) to the construction industry projects is 
not accepted by all. For example, Gann, (1996) opined that construction 
products are usually large and immobile; this implies that construction products 
are created at the point of consumption, unlike manufacturing where materials 
are fully produced in the factory before sending it to the market. Although, 
Salem et al., (2006), agreed that there are clear differences between the 
manufacturing and the construction industry; they conceded that both 
operations involve ‘production' and ‘services' with the aim of meeting customer 
demands and requirements. Tommelein et al., (1999) also argued that both the 
manufacturing and the construction industries can be seen as production 
systems that use processing points and hand over partially completed work to 
the next customer. This means in both manufacturing and construction projects, 
the goal is to satisfy the next customer. However, the current understanding of a 
“customer” in construction project delivery focuses more on the paying client

and this view is too narrow. But in lean production, the customer also includes 
people who are on the production line. 
With this understanding, the concept of a customer in construction project 
delivery could be widened to include the local communities, the local economy 
and the physical environment where the project is undertaken. For instance, 
Salvatierra-Garrido and Pasquire, (2011) challenged the construction industry to 
move away from the project based context to a more global context that 
adequately considers the impact of construction operations on the wider 
customer or community. Furthermore, Spear and Bowen, (1999) from their 
study that explores the DNA of the TPS show the importance of identifying the 
customers on the production line so as to design the production system to suit 
them. This helps in the maintenance of a smooth flow in the production system 
and also shows the essence of considering the wider customer a construction 
project could impact. This view is also supported by an earlier call by Ofori 
(1992) that the construction industry should include consideration for the 
environment as the fourth objective of measuring project performance in 
addition to cost, quali y, and time. This entails embedding the culture of caring 
for the environment and people living in the environment. Similarly, Close and 
Loosemore, (2014) called on the construction industry to view the communities 
where they operate as an asset rather than a liability. This means, in delivering 
social value from a lean production perspective, the community and physical 
environment should be viewed as customers. Despite this call, the construction 
industry has not really changed its approach to project performance 
measurement indicators. It could be argued that the non-consideration of social 
value as an activity that contributes to the achievement of project goals, could 
have contributed to lack of SV delivery on construction projects (Porter and 
Kramer, 2011).  
However, Arroyo and Gonzalez, (2016); Johnsen and Dreveland, (2016) 
argued that to deliver viable value in the built environment, effort should be 
extended to improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of the 
inhabitants during the design and delivery process. The importance of paying 
attention to the above-mentioned factors in construction project delivery cannot 
be over-emphasised as its absence usually leads to what Awakul and Ogunlana, 
(2002) call interface conflicts. Interface conflict is a conflict that occurs between 
the internal project group and those outside the project such as the 
communities, and NGOs situated around the project. Kishor and Ogunlana 
(2011) identified the consequence of such conflicts to include delays, cost and 
time overruns and even suspension of the project. Again, this shows the 
importance of viewing the communities and environment as customers as 
advocated in lean production. 
Bae and Kim, (2008) observe that lean production approaches have a 
positive impact on community wellbeing, the loyalty of stakeholders, resource 
saving, and reduces resource depletion among others. However, to achieve this 
in practice requires having conversations and consideration for each customer in 
the production process. For the purpose of delivering social value, this must 
include the community. From a construction project perspective, community 
refers to people, places or things that could be directly or indirectly affected by 
the construction project (Close and Loosemore, 2014; Thomson et al., 1990). 
The conversations and considerations (for the community) should include

elements such as people, plants and animals, settlements, and local economies 
among others. This places the onus on construction organisations to consider the 
local communities and physical environment as ""customers' in the delivery of 
their services so as to create value. But this is less practised in the traditional 
approach of construction project management (Paz and Alarcon, 2007; Ballard 
and Howell, 2004), which in no doubt limits social value creation. 
Search in Lean Construction: The TFV Model 
Koskela (2000), argued that traditionally, most construction operations focus on 
Transformation activities (input and output), with little or no attention on Flow 
and Value generating activities. Following these observations, Koskela, (2000) 
introduced the Transformation, Flow and Value view (TFV) model in lean 
construction. While the Flow (F) view focuses on material flow, the Value (V) 
view focuses on the customer (Koskela and Howell, 2002). The TFV model 
provides a unique approach to support social value delivery on construction 
projects. The flow (F) in the TFV model means consideration for the flow in the 
production or construction process. Koskela, (2000) identified seven process 
flows; information, task, resources, space, people, material, and external 
conditions. According to Koskela and Ballard, (2006) proper management of the 
relationships between these “process flows” is essential for the smooth running 
of the production system on site. In the delivery of social value on a construction 
project, various activities are interlinked and the relationships between these 
activities must be identified and managed for smooth flow. For instance, external 
condition and people are among “the process flow” conditions identified in the 
“Flow view” for smooth workflow on construction projects. Using the “Flow view” 
lens for SV delivery, the “external condition” and “the people” could mean the 
physical environment and the people living in the community where the project 
is undertaken.  
Studies have shown that construction activities have an impact on the 
external environment and people and as such, they should be adequately 
considered for successful project delivery (Salvatierra-Garrido and Pasquire, 
2011; Ofori et al., 2000). This means to support the smooth flow of activities on 
the project, engagement and consideration for (this process flow conditions- 
external conditions and people) are essentials. This could entail identification 
with the stakeholders in the community to better understand where the project 
would best contribute to their social, economic and environmental needs. There 
is evidence that early engagement of the project team with the communities 
around the project to identify with their social, economic and environmental 
needs prevents disputes and conflicts from the communities around the project 
(Daniel and Pasquire, 2017; Ofori et al., 1992). Awakul and Ogunlana, (2002) 
also observed that lack of engagement with the local communities around the 
project contributes to the interference of construction project.  
Furthermore, in the construction phase, maintaining a smooth flow in the 
delivery of materials and execution of tasks would prevent “push” and support 
“pull” approach as observed in Koskela et al., (2007). The push approach 
supports the delivery of materials and commencement task as shown on the 
master programme, even when the space for work and the work is not ready. 
The lack of consideration for “the process flow conditions” lead to “push” on 
construction projects which contributes to the non-achievement of tasks as

planned on construction projects (Ballard and Howell, 1994). In practice the 
“push” approach could lead to site congestion, accident and pollution of the 
environment, thus reducing the achievement of social value delivery on the 
project. However, the “pull” approach which is the focus of “the process flows”, 
allows delivery of materials and commencement of tasks based on the real-time 
situation on site. This supports Just-in-Time delivery, thus reducing congestion 
on site. This means the ""pull"" approach has the potential to support SV delivery 
on a construction project as it helps in reducing congestions on site and 
environmental pollutions. 
The focus of the (V) “value generation view” in the TFV model is to create 
value from the customer’s perspective (Koskela, 2004). It must be noted that 
the term customer as used here is not limited to the paying client alone who is 
seen as the internal customer, rather, it includes both the internal customers 
(client) and external customers (local community and the environment). 
Although, the concept of value generation from the customer perspective has 
been in production for many decades (Shewhart, 1931); the construction 
industry is yet to embrace this concept in its practices. One of the key principles 
in the “value generation view” is to ensure customer requirements are satisfied 
(Koskela, 2000). According to Koskela and Howell, (2002), the decision-making 
process that supports value generation view should be decentralised and all the 
stakeholders in the development process should be given a clear say. This 
means, in adopting the “value generation view” to support social value delivery 
on construction projects, the management of the construction process should 
include consideration both for the internal and external customers by engaging 
them in some of the decision making process. Georgson, (2012) asserted that 
social value is built on ""bottom-top"" approach so as to allow the customers make 
an input in the decision process. This clearly aligns with the “value generation 
view” in the TFV model. This means the value generation view in the TFV model 
could empower the local communities where construction projects are 
undertaken to make an input by identifying activities that would improve the life 
of the people around the project. In reality “the bottom top approach” requires 
construction organisations to consult with the community (customer) in the 
design and delivery of its operations so as to create high impact social value. 
However, Koskela and Vrijhoef, (2000) found that the ""bottom-top"" approach is 
absent in construction project management and this hinders innovation in 
construction project delivery. 
Also, the “value generation view” empowers those doing the work to 
contribute to the production process on site as advocated in the Last Planner 
System (LPS) (Ballard, 2000). In the LPS, each trade in the construction process 
is viewed as a customer and allowed to make an input to the production process 
on site (Ballard and Tommelein, 2016). According to Ballard, (2000); Ballard and 
Tommelein, (2016) the LPS process contributes to the development of a reliable 
and predictable plan. However, its implementation is still fragmented and recent 
studies tend to report that its crucial elements are not fully implemented on 
construction projects (Daniel et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the use of the LPS in 
managing project production on construction projects is on the increase due to 
its capacity to manage complex relationships and develop a predictable plan 
through collaborative planning (LCI, 2017; Daniel et al., 2017; Ballard and 
Tommelein, 2016). Fernandez-Solis et al, (2012) found that the LPS has been

implemented on over 200 projects with on-time delivery of construction projects. 
It could be argued that the on-time delivery of construction projects through the 
use of LPS will not only benefit the client and main contractor, but also the local 
community around the project, the environment, and the local and national 
economy. For example, the environmental pollution, noise pollution, road 
congestion etc. that could arise from such construction activities would be 
eliminated quickly. This shows that the application of LPS; a lean construction 
approach, would support the achievement of SV delivery on a construction 
project. 
Search in Lean Principles 
Womack and Jones, (1996) found that in delivering products and services based 
on lean principles, identification of value from the customer perspective should 
be among the core principles to be observed. The lean production approaches for 
delivering value identified in Womack and Jones, (1996) include: (1) Identify 
customers and specify the value (2) Identify and map the value stream (3) 
Create flow by eliminating waste (4) Respond to customer pull (5) Pursue 
perfection. From the lean principles above, to identify customers in the context 
of construction project delivery could mean to identify the elements that make 
up the communities with a view to specifying the value from their perspective. 
Delivering value from lean project production perspective supports the reduction 
of non-value adding activities; improves transparency and collaboration 
(Johnsen and Dreveland, 2016; Fuenzalida et al., 2016; Maris and Parrish, 2016; 
Wu and Wang, 2016; Huovila and Koskela 1998).  
Additionally, responding to customer “pull” as advocated in lean production 
could mean the customer/communities receive what they require at the right 
time, in the right quality and quantity. This would certainly curtail the 
emergence of interface conflict on projects (Awakul and Ogunlana, 2002); thus, 
supporting the social value delivery of projects. 
The pull principle that supports continuous improvements, offers opportunities 
for construction organisations to reflect on the feedback received from the 
communities on the social value delivered. Through such feedbacks, the social 
value created can be improved upon in the future. Table 3 further shows the link 
between lean principles and social delivery in a construction project. 
 
Insert Table 3 here: 
 
 One of the key goals of lean is to satisfy the stakeholder or customer 
requirement (Shah and Ward, 2007; Koskela, 2000). It is worth noting that 
stakeholders, as used here, refer to both internal and external stakeholders 
(Awakul and Ogunlana, 2002).  However, the best approach to achieving the 
stakeholder requirement as advocated in lean is by consulting with the 
stakeholder. Khodeir and Othman, (2016) observed that this lean principle of 
meeting the stakeholder's requirement support social value delivery because it 
encourages consultation with the local people community (external stakeholder) 
and it helps in the identification of the social value to be delivered from the 
community perspective. This approach would support the delivery of high impact 
SV to the local community because of their direct involvement. Piercy and Rich,

(2015); Lee and Shin,2010, argued that a good lean organisation would focus on 
improving the quality of life in the local communities where they operate and 
those of its employees. However, this is often overlooked (Womack and Jones, 
2005). Additionally, Khodeir and Othman, (2016) pointed out that providing 
equal job opportunities and future job prospects for the employees (internal 
stakeholders) would enhance the achievement of social value with regard to the 
meeting the requirements of the internal stakeholders.  
   
The use of standardised processes and lean techniques supports the 
achievement of social value delivery (Govindan et al, 2014; Faulkner and 
Badurdeen, 2014; Piercy and Rich, 2015; Tezel et al, 2016). Piercy and Rich, 
(2015) showed that the use of visual management (VSM) a lean technique 
support the better working condition which contributes to the achievement of 
high health and safety performance.  Similarly, Tezel et al, (2016) found that 
VSM and 5S enhance communication on construction site and improve health 
and safety practice in projects. This implies that a carefully planned production 
process and the application of lean construction techniques would contribute to 
the health and wellbeing of both internal and external stakeholders (Govindan et 
al, 2014; Faulkner and Badurdeen, 2014; Piercy and Rich, 2015). In practice, 
the VSM could be used to communicate with the local community about future 
work notices that may cause some disturbance, road diversions, and planned 
road closures among others. This would reduce the impact of such activities on 
the social and wellbeing of the people in the community, thus contributing to 
social value delivery. Also, the 5S would improve working condition of the 
workers on site through better ergonomics which could reduce stress. Leon and 
Amodio, (2017) observed that lean principle improves working environment 
which in turn reduces stress. According to Govindan et al, (2014) and Nahmens 
and Ikuma, (2012) standardised process not only reduces non-value adding 
activities, but it also supports social improvement on the workers.  
 
As shown in Table 3 the lean principle of reducing cycle time and variability in 
the production process contribute to the achievement of SV delivery in 
construction projects (Khodeir and Othman, 2016). In order to reduce cycle time 
in material delivery and in sourcing for labour, these could be sourced locally 
from the local community. However, in reality, this practice not only reduces 
cycle time but it also; create job opportunity for the locals and contributes 
directly to the local economy; reduces pollution on the environment, as a result 
of the reduction in transportation of people and materials. All of these are 
evidence of SV generated as a result of the application of lean principles of 
reducing cycle time. 
Finally, using the lean principle of reducing variability in the production process 
would support the use an integrated supply chain which would, in turn, minimise 
variability issues in the workforce and in the product and services delivered. In 
practice, it entails have a long-term relationship with the employees and the 
supply chain.  Piercy and Rich, (2015) observed that such practice support the 
development of strong cohesion among the workers and supply chain.

The aim of this paper is to explore the existing knowledge around social 
value and to evaluate how lean production philosophy could support the 
realisation of social value in construction project delivery. The study found that: 
 Social value emphasises the need to critically consider and create a 
positive influence on the individual stakeholders in the community and on 
the physical environment. It connotes a shift from the traditional goal of 
getting the lowest cost or price to the goal of delivering satisfactory 
service/product to both the individual in the community and the physical 
environment in the community-especially in executing construction 
projects. 
 Freeman’s (1984) integration theory shows that creation of social value 
should not be a separate operation from the economic value, rather, both 
should be incorporated and delivered as a system with the goal of 
influencing the society at large. 
 The low commitment to the creation of social value by construction firms 
could have been influenced by the so-called ""separation theory"" 
postulated by Friedman 1962. 
 The case for delivering social value is not with the legislation and 
regulation alone, rather, it includes other elements such as the business 
sense of it, global interest, and social value market opportunities among 
others that could support both private and public sectors (construction 
organisations) in delivering businesses in a more efficient way. 
 The key difference between social value, CSR and shared value is that, 
while CSR and Shared Value use a top-bottom approach in delivering 
community good, social value uses a bottom-up approach. 
 Lean production philosophy supports the achievement of social value 
objectives in construction project delivery, as it helps construction 
organisations to conceptualise the communities and physical environment 
where they operate as their customers, rather than mere people and 
place. 
  The ""flow"" and ""value"" in the TFV support smooth workflow in the 
construction process and development of reliable construction programme 
through the application of the LPS principles- a lean construction 
approach.   
Conclusions 
The purpose of this study was to determine the current knowledge surrounding 
social value and to evaluate the role of lean production philosophy in achieving 
social value objectives in construction project delivery. The study establishes 
that the current level of awareness on social value is still low and there is a 
dearth of scholarly publications on social value, especially in construction 
management literature. The study found that there is still no clear or single 
criterion for measuring social value delivered. This means the criteria to be used 
in measuring or identifying social value could differ for different contexts and 
audiences. 
The study found that lean production approach and the TFV model have the 
potential to support the delivery of social value objectives on construction

projects. The lean production approach enables construction organisations to 
conceptualise the community and the physical environment where they operate 
as their customers, rather than mere people, places and things. This further 
encourages their commitment to the delivery of social value to the local 
community and physical environment around their construction projects. 
Additionally, the “flow” and “value” views in the TFV model support smooth 
workflow in the construction process and in the development of reliable 
construction programme. This contributes to the on-time delivery of construction 
projects through the application of the LPS principles, thus, enhancing the 
positive contribution of a project to the society, the environment and economy. 
The tudy reveals that the separation theory propagated by Friedman, 
(1962), tends to separate social value from economic value, thus making 
organisations care less about delivering social value. However, this view was 
challenged by Freeman, (1970) in his integrated theory. This implies that 
construction organisations should not view the creation of social value as a 
separate operation from the economic value, rather, both should be incorporated 
and delivered as a system with a goal of influencing the society at large. The 
results of this investigation show that the current driver for social value delivery 
is not only the legislation but also, its business imperative, the global interest in 
social value, the opportunities for social investment and the business sense in 
delivering social value. This implies the commitment to the delivery of social 
value on construction projects or organisations should not be seen as a tick box 
exercise that is compliance driven since there are other benefits such as the 
business sense of doing it.  
The investigation confirms that there is a relationship between CSR, Shared 
Value and social value. However, CSR and Shared Value are not the same as 
social value. The study found that while CSR and Shared Value use a top-down 
approach in making decisions on the nature of support to be provided for the 
community, social value decisions are made based on the customers' perspective 
(the communities) through an all-inclusive conversation and engagement with 
stakeholders. The study concludes that conceptualising the community and 
physical environment around the construction project using the lean concept of 
customer and TFV model would support social value realisations in the delivery 
of construction projects. This study is based on literature review evidence and 
the findings serve as a foundation on which future studies can be built upon. 
Obtaining empirical evidence on social value practice with the aim of developing 
an approach for evidencing social value in construction project delivery will form 
the next stage of the research by the authors.

A critical literature review was adopted, to gather the current knowledge surrounding social value from mainstream management sciences, construction management and lean literature. A total of 70 studies were critically reviewed.

The study reveals that the separation theory propagated by Friedman, (1962), tends to separate social value from economic value, thus making organisations care less about delivering social value. The study found that there is still no clear or single criterion for measuring social value delivered and there is a dearth of scholarly publications on social value especially in construction management literature. The investigation shows that lean production approach has the potentials to enable construction organisations to conceptualise the community and the physical environment where they operate as customers, which contributes to the delivery of social value objectives in construction projects.

This study conceptualises the community and the physical environment around where the construction project is executed as customers using lean production approach and shows that the Transformation, Flow & Value view support smooth workflow which enhances the achievement of social value objectives. This creates a new insight into how social value can be realised in construction project delivery.

This study extends the on-going debate around the need for social value in construction project delivery and contributes to construction management and lean construction literature on social value. Future studies could build on this to obtain empirical data and develop an approach/method that would support the evidencing of social value delivery in construction projects","['Article', 'PeerReviewed', 'Construction']",disabled

Abstract   
Despite its commitment to global sustainability pacts, Nigeria does not currently have 
a framework for sustainability in engineering education. This study aims to formulate 
a sustainability education intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Using 
the mixed-method approach, the study assessed the level of sustainability knowledge 
of the Nigerian engineering community, examined the sustainability content of the 
Nigerian engineering curriculum, and proposed a context-relevant sustainability 
education intervention. Data for the study were sourced variously from publications of 
regulatory bodies, engineering handbooks, surveys and workshops with stakeholders. 
The Nigerian engineering community was discovered to have low sustainability literacy 
based on a sustainability literacy test, level of stakeholder awareness of the United 
Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, and self-assessment of 
sustainability knowledge. Both content analysis and stakeholder survey converged on 
the low sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum.  
With insights gained from the findings, a bipartite intervention consisting of a guideline 
and an introductory sustainable engineering course is proposed. Whilst the guideline 
specifies roles for government, regulators, university leaders and faculty, the designed 
course features 15-weekly topics for adoption in the engineering handbooks. Aspects 
of the proposed course trialled in a sustainable engineering workshop indicated 
favourable prospects for the introduction of the course. Workshop participants were 
unanimous in declaring the usefulness and expediency of sustainability education in 
the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Although the research findings are particularly 
relevant to the Nigerian engineering curriculum, the study confirms the slow uptake of 
sustainability education in the developing world. By closely examining the feasibility of 
sustainability education intervention in engineering curriculum in a different cultural 
and social setting, the research contributes to the global efforts towards the 
reorientation of engineering education to sustainability.

Acknowledgements 
Trailing the attainment of every piece of knowledge is an ineffable emotion – the 
experience of moving from a state of ignorance to a state of knowing. However, such 
intellectual journey is almost always impossible without the support and guidance of 
several great people – evocative of Newton’s “standing on the shoulders of giants” 
remark. My knowledge journey through this research has benefited from the guidance 
and support of many great minds. Prof Sarah Bell and Prof John Mitchell critiqued and 
provided valuable suggestions that enriched the research outcomes. Thank you for 
being an amiable professorial duo and for your excellent supervision of the thesis! 
Additionally, I am obliged to Prof Folagbade Oriola, Dr Yahaya Muhammad and Mr 
Julius Adamu for facilitating the conduct of surveys in the various institutions involved 
in the study. Without your personal sacrifices, the research process would have been 
much more difficult.  
I wish to acknowledge the stakeholders who partook in pretesting the research tools. 
Your inputs greatly informed the refinement of the research instruments. Similarly, 
gratitude is due to the members of the Nigerian engineering community who took the 
time to respond to both the paper-based and web-based surveys, and also participate 
in the workshop. I am indebted to the Petroleum Technology Development Fund of the 
Federal Republic of Nigeria for providing the funds with which I was able to study in 
the United Kingdom. I am equally grateful to my employer, the Nigerian Air Force, for 
granting me a three-year study leave. I hope that the outcome of the research will be 
useful to the Service as well as to higher education in Nigeria.  
This acknowledgement will be incomplete without expressing appreciation to my 
parents and siblings for the unceasing love and well-wishing. Thank you for being a 
doting family! If I were endowed with total recall, I would mention all the people with 
whom I have interacted and exchanged ideas in the course of my educational sojourn, 
for such interchange must have undoubtedly contributed in one way or another to 
building me intellectually. This not being the case, however, I will mention one person 
and then go no further – my darling wife, Halima. She deserves commendation for her 
patience, forbearance, unconditional love and emotional support. Thank you Halima 
for creating a serene and pleasant home during the period of my study, especially on 
the days of despondency and nights of gloom!

Preface 
As an engineering student in Nigeria in early 2000s, I could not rationalise some of the 
courses I was being taught at the university. It made little sense to me why, as a civil 
engineering student, for example, I needed to undertake courses such as economics 
management science and engineering geology. Although I was unable to discern how 
these courses, even remotely, related to civil engineering, I made sure that I passed 
them satisfactorily. It however registered on my mind that something was amiss about 
the engineering education in my higher education institution (HEI), or at the least, with 
its civil engineering syllabus. Operating within a non-democratic pedagogical setting, 
my HEI did not provide much opportunity for questioning the rationale of a course. 
Compounding the situation were a packed curriculum and lack of alternative sources 
of information (such as Internet); it was a typical teacher-centred learning environment. 
A few years after graduation, I met graduates of several engineering disciplines from 
other Nigerian HEIs at an engineering conference. It was an opportune moment to 
share knowledge and experiences including thoughts on the Nigerian engineering 
education system. It emerged from the discussions that my experience with the civil 
engineering syllabus was in no way unique. Many of the engineering graduates 
claimed to have also inadequately understood the philosophy of various courses in the 
engineering curriculum. I felt, all at once, a sense of relief and disenchantment. I was 
relieved that my incomprehension of the philosophies of those civil engineering 
courses did not result from an intellectual deficit (as it seemed shared across 
disciplines and HEIs). However, I was worried about the implication of this deficiency 
on the Nigerian engineering community. Questions such as “why is there a cosmic 
disconnect between a taught engineering course and a student’s appreciation of its 
relevance?” formed on my mind.   
In the meantime, I gained employment with the Logistics Branch of Nigerian Air Force 
(NAF). My occupation ranged from supervision of civil engineering works and 
infrastructure maintenance to instruction on civil engineering courses at the Nigerian 
Air Force Institute of Technology (NAFIT). My involvement in civil engineering projects 
exposed me to the dilemma of Nigerian engineering graduates whose lack of adequate 
practical experience is repeatedly invoked to deny them employment. Through 
interaction with engineering educators and practising engineers over the years, I 
18 
 
became convinced that the shortcomings I had observed both as an undergraduate 
student and as an employee of the NAF were symptomatic of a larger issue. Since its 
development based on the 1960s UK model, the Nigerian engineering education 
system has had an inchoate and incomprehensive review and/or modification. This is 
even apart from the commonly discussed problems of funding and inexpert teaching.  
In 2009, I had an opportunity to travel to the UK for a master’s degree programme 
here at UCL. I realised that whilst Nigeria was stuck with an inchoately modified 1960s 
UK model of engineering curriculum, the UK engineering education framework in 2009 
had markedly advanced. I was impressed by the obvious efforts of lecturers to employ 
various student-centred approaches including case-study and problem-based learning 
methods to facilitate knowledge. Each time I observed an unfamiliar and seemingly 
valuable pedagogical technique, I imagined how it could be replicated in Nigeria. In 
retrospect, this was a truly naïve view of educational change as social and cultural 
contexts are now consensually accepted to be key in any transformational move. In 
any event, it was of particular interest to me that I fully grasped the relevance of all the 
courses I undertook during the master’s degree programme. Somehow the connection 
between the courses had been established by an intricate interaction within the 
engineering education system. 
Having completed my master’s degree in 2010, I returned to my job with the NAF in 
Nigeria. However, my desire to investigate and find ways of improving the Nigerian 
engineering education had been reinforced. When the opportunity for me to undertake 
a doctoral research arose in 2015, I felt obliged to utilise it towards this effort. 
Educational change within the framework of sustainability proved quite a compelling 
research area for the changes I had envisioned. The more I read about sustainability 
education the greater I was persuaded by its prospect to facilitate holistic educational 
reforms. It can help address the challenges of the Nigerian engineering education 
whose cues I had observed in the incompact engineering syllabus and in the so-called 
unemployable graduates. This research is thus driven by an enduring urge to bring 
about a positive change in an educational system through which I passed. If it 
succeeds in as little as showcasing how the principles of flexibility and eclecticism in 
sustainable engineering education facilitate protean engineering graduates, the study 
will have been fulfilling and worthwhile.

Chapter One 
 
1  Introduction 
Background  
In recent memory, the impacts of manipulating nature for human benefit have been 
subjected to political, ethical, moral and intellectual interrogations. An important 
outcome of these reflections is the concept of sustainable development, which seeks 
the attainment of economic growth, environmental protection and social responsibility. 
Some of the crises that triggered sustainability advocacy included biodiversity loss, 
climate change, heightened water demand, poverty, carbon emissions and hyper-
consumerism. Engineering, being the principal facilitator of socioeconomic progress, 
is implicated in these unprecedented global challenges. To stem these problems, the 
dominant engineering model must be reconsidered – hence the emergence of 
sustainable engineering. Sustainable engineering offers a conceptual departure from 
conventional engineering by broadening the problem and solution domains of 
engineering across the sustainability pillars of economy, society and environment. 
Sustainable engineering seeks to conduct engineering activities within a sustainability 
worldview, which is poised to induce in individuals the cognitive orientation necessary 
to make sense of an increasingly complex and unpredictable world (Allenby, 2007). 
The global challenges facing the world in the 21st century have been attributed to the 
arrival of an epoch: the Anthropocene (Age of the Human). Anthropocene describes a 
geologic period of heavily human-impacted Earth in which the complex 
interconnectedness of humans with the natural and built systems is pervasive (Ellis 
and Trachtenberg, 2014). Sustainability worldview acknowledges this complexity and 
defines solutions in terms of a balance among economic growth, social responsibility 
and environmental integrity. Human activities must occur within such framework in 
order to attain the prized goals of sustainable development (Ehrenfeld and Hoffman, 
2013). 
20 
 
Sustainability education emerged in a contiguity of international declarations and 
conferences to mainstream sustainability values into the educational system. Worried 
by the slow uptake of sustainability ideals and practices globally, the international 
community responded with a succession of various sustainability-related conferences. 
Education was unanimously declared to be critical to the realisation of sustainable 
development. In 2004, the United Nations proclaimed the period 2005-2014 as the 
Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (UNDESD). This period witnessed 
heightened global calls and efforts at mainstreaming sustainability education into 
various institutions and countries. Further meetings, deliberations and research 
pointed to the significance of higher education institutions (HEIs) in the implementation 
of sustainability education. As a result, sustainability education initiatives were 
introduced in many universities. The Barcelona Declaration (EESD, 2004) signified the 
response of the engineering education community to sustainability education. Since 
its issuance in 2004, the Declaration has guided the discourse of engineering 
education for sustainability. An observatory was established in Catalonia to monitor 
the progress of sustainable engineering education worldwide. 
Designed chiefly in a developed world context, the theory and practice of sustainable 
engineering education has failed to gain much traction in the developing world. In spite 
of their expeditious signing of several sustainability education declarations, developing 
nations are somewhat hesitant about sustainability education initiatives. This has 
raised concerns about the encumbrances of sustainability education in those regions. 
Prominent amongst these constraints, particularly in Africa, are human development 
priorities. Over 90% of the low human development countries are located in Africa 
(UNDP, 2016b). The continent faces unique socioeconomic challenges that severely 
limit the trade-off between societal needs and environmental consumption. Grappling 
with issues of multidimensional poverty, most African countries tend to relegate the 
so-called green initiatives. The constant refrain is that such policies slow down the 
much-needed economic growth. There is an underlying sentiment that the developed 
countries have attained high human development without due regard to environmental 
concerns (Iqbal and Pierson, 2016). Thus, it is only fair that the developing countries 
have the same opportunity. This is a classic North-South debate on the implications 
of sustainable development, which also extends to sustainability education.  
21 
 
Notwithstanding the allure and cogency of the fairness argument, the prevailing 
circumstances in the developing world and the world at large are not propitious for the 
past developmental model of the West. Estimates show that almost 90% of population 
increase will occur in the developing world (Iqbal and Pierson, 2016). There are also 
issues of climate change and its attendant consequences. Evidence shows that the 
carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has increased from pre-industrial 
levels of 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to around 387 ppmv in 2008 (Bell, 
2011). These changed environmental conditions call for a sustainable development 
model. However, whilst research into sustainable engineering education has generally 
increased, few of these studies have focused on the developing world. Even fewer 
studies have been conducted in the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, 
sustainability challenge demands the involvement of the entire global community. 
Additionally, it is futile that one part of the world takes sustainability concerns seriously 
whilst another part remains apathetic to the global challenges. Partly to address these 
apprehensions, the United Nations created alongside the UNDESD the Mainstreaming 
Environment and Sustainability in African Universities Partnership (MESA). The MESA 
baseline study in 2004 indicated that sustainability education in African HEIs was 
merely an emerging interest (UNEP-MESA, 2009).  
Nigeria is one of the African countries referenced in the MESA study. As an active 
member of the global community, Nigeria has consistently responded to international 
calls for sustainability and environmental protection. Although it had signed a number 
of international pacts since gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria began to take 
seriously sustainability-related matters in the 1980s. Precisely, 1987 was a watershed 
in Nigeria’s environmental and sustainability history. In the wet season of that year, it 
emerged that large amounts of toxic wastes from Italy had been dumped in Nigerian 
waters. An increased number of environmental policies and institutional frameworks 
to protect national resources trailed this environmental disaster. With the emergence 
of numerous protection measures arose the need for expertise in environmental 
knowledge. In response to this necessity, environmental education developed and 
gradually permeated several Nigerian HEIs. Presently, environmental programmes in 
Nigeria converge in either environmental management or environmental engineering 
degrees. These formed part of the baseline data obtained by the 2004 MESA study, 
which pointed to a slow progress of sustainability education in Nigeria.  
22 
 
The Nigerian engineering education system responded to sustainability education with 
an environmental focus. Environmental engineering became the dominant area within 
which sustainability was taught and learned. This implied a narrowing of sustainability 
to only the environmental component of sustainability at the expense of the social and 
economic dimensions. Nigeria’s ratification of the Abuja Declaration which sought the 
implementation of ESD in African HEIs in 2009 was greeted with high expectations. 
However, the pact generally failed to yield any concrete initiatives. There is no 
reference to sustainability education in Nigerian educational policies and no mention 
of a sustainable engineering degree in the higher education programmes listed in the 
most recent brochure of the Nigerian Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board 
(JAMB, 2017). This could be construed as a complete absence of sustainability 
education in the Nigerian HEIs in so far as sustainability education is understood 
strictly within the framework of education for sustainable development (ESD), i.e. 
reorienting policy, investment and practice of education on a sustainability path (ESD, 
2014). Although it can be held that no Nigerian HEI currently offers a sustainable 
engineering degree, however the prospect of introducing such courses and aligning 
extant ones with sustainability ideals is propitious.  
In a recent study of sustainability education in Africa, Manteaw (2012) described how 
African governments readily accepted the ESD agenda only to later withdraw into 
inaction and non-commitment. Manteaw raised issues of capacity, lack of political 
commitment and absence of institutional support as contributory to the poor status of 
ESD in most African countries. Other constraints highlighted in similar studies included 
cultural barriers and poor grasp of sustainability concepts, which have largely led to 
failure by African societies to connect sustainability education agenda with their 
regional experiences (Shallcross and Robinson, 2007). Although this view has been 
copiously supported in the literature (Thakran 2004; Leal Filho et al. 2007; Jenneth & 
Ros 2008; Manteaw 2012; UNESCO 2013), a country-specific investigation will reveal 
more details and suggest suitable sustainability education interventions. Along these 
lines, AI Phuong (2013) and Sivapalan (2015) conducted sustainable engineering 
education studies in Vietnam and Malaysia respectively. Their findings did not only 
add to existing knowledge on regional sustainability education status but also lent 
credence to the effectiveness of planning sustainable engineering education based on 
local relevance and cultural appropriateness. 
23 
 
This study contextualises sustainable engineering education in Nigeria. The purpose 
of the research is to explore the prospect of a sustainability intervention in the Nigerian 
engineering education. The study seeks an evidence-based implementation strategy 
for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. It queries the level of sustainability knowledge 
of the Nigerian engineering community, examines the sustainability content of the 
Nigerian engineering curriculum, and seeks an appropriate sustainability education 
intervention for effective and meaningful impact in the Nigerian engineering education. 
The research involves an analysis of sustainability education literature, publications of 
professional and regulatory bodies in Nigeria, surveys and workshops administered to 
stakeholders in the Nigerian engineering community. The study intends to show that 
a sustainable engineering education for Nigeria is feasible with insights gained from 
stakeholder participation and global best practice. Situating the research in a sub-
Saharan African setting has the benefit of consolidating the criticality of context in not 
only sustainable engineering education, but also engineering curricular development. 
Also, the focus of the study on a previously unexplored context1 will be a modest 
addition to global sustainability education efforts.                 
Aim 
The aim of the research is to formulate an appropriate sustainability education 
intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum.  
Research Questions 
1. What is the current level of sustainability knowledge of the Nigerian engineering 
community? 
2. What is the sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum? 
3. What sustainability education interventions are appropriate for the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum? 
                                            
1 Based on an extensive literature review, personal experience both as a student and lecturer, and 
recent communication with Nigerian academics, sustainability education in the context of Nigerian 
engineering curriculum has, to-date, not been researched into.

Thesis Outline 
Chapter One provides a background to the study stating the scope, aim and questions 
to which the research seeks answers. It makes the case for a sustainability education 
intervention in the Nigerian engineering curriculum based on the following facts. 
Firstly, that the increased global efforts to reorient engineering education towards 
sustainability have largely been confined to the developed nations. Secondly, that 
Nigeria does not currently have a sustainability education framework within which 
sustainable engineering can be taught. Thirdly, that the global nature of sustainability 
challenge demands the involvement of the entire global community. Finally, that the 
prospect of an intervention in the Nigerian engineering curriculum is research-worthy.  
Chapter Two is a selective review of the literature on sustainability and sustainability 
education in engineering. This chapter offers a concept clarification of sustainability 
and highlights the continuing efforts at teaching and learning about sustainability. 
Through the lens of three educational aims, namely salvation, the state, and progress, 
the chapter reviews sustainability education declarations and sustainability education 
construct. Thereafter, it critiques the construct which provides the impetus for the 
appraisal of sustainability education in engineering. The conception and origins of 
sustainable engineering as a conceptual departure from conventional engineering 
practice alongside the principles, tools, and frameworks of the field are discussed. The 
chapter also highlights the application of sustainable engineering and the pedagogical 
approaches in sustainability education. The chapter ends with an overview of research 
in sustainable engineering education stressing the need for more investigations in the 
developing world context. 
Chapter Three focuses on the research context of the present study – Nigeria. It 
presents the prevailing status of sustainability education in Nigeria as it relates to the 
engineering curriculum. The chapter highlights the practice of engineering in Nigeria, 
the role of Nigerian educational system, and how Nigerian engineers are typically 
educated. Sustainability issues including the dumping of hazardous wastes in Nigerian 
waters by an Italian company and the resulting environmental policies are addressed. 
The chapter also underlines a gap in the body of knowledge presented as the dearth 
of sustainability education research in the Nigerian engineering education.  
25 
 
Chapter Four sets out the overall methodological framework for the present research. 
It recaps the research questions and discusses various sustainability assessment 
approaches vis-à-vis sustainability content, sustainability literacy and sustainability 
learning process. The chapter then highlights the research approach, research 
paradigm and research design adopted in the study. Thereafter, the methods of data 
collection and data analysis are discussed before considering the validity, reliability, 
and ethical issues of the study. 
Chapter Five gauges the level of sustainability knowledge of the Nigerian engineering 
community. It responds to the question around the general sustainability awareness 
of the Nigerian engineering community. The chapter introduces three criteria against 
which the sustainability literacy level of the community is measured including the level 
of UNDESD awareness, score on a sustainability literacy test, and self-assessment of 
sustainability knowledge. The chapter proceeds by describing the students’ results 
followed by those of the educators and practitioners. The results are synthesised to 
approximate the sustainability literacy level of the entire engineering community. The 
chapter concludes with a discussion of the results and limitations of the study. 
Chapter Six addresses the question of the sustainability content of the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum. It analyses three engineering documents obtained variously 
from engineering regulatory bodies and higher education institutions in Nigeria.  The 
chapter also examines the perspectives of engineering stakeholders to complement 
the documentary analysis. The documents and stakeholder views are tested against 
a priori codes obtained from a set of expert-derived sustainability themes. UCL 
engineering curriculum is also assessed and compared with the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum. The chapter begins by presenting the results of the documentary analyses 
followed by those of the stakeholder views. Both results are subsequently synthesised 
to estimate the sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum.  
Chapter Seven responds to the question regarding the appropriate sustainability 
education interventions for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Answers to the 
question are informed by the insights gained from the study as well as stakeholder 
responses to a survey. The chapter proceeds by stating some useful intervention cues 
before analysing the stakeholders’ views on the numerous sustainability education 
intervention approaches. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the findings and 
limitations of the study. 
26 
 
Chapter Eight formulates an intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. A 
bipartite intervention featuring guidelines and an introductory course on sustainable 
engineering is presented. The intervention is proposed based on the insights from the 
chapters. The chapter begins with a delineation of the intervention requirements 
arising from the analysed data. Thereafter, the details of the intervention are provided. 
The chapter then trials a sustainable engineering course by means of a sustainability 
workshop assessing the prospect of running a sustainable engineering course in a 
Nigeria. It presents an overview of the workshop, layout, preliminary assessments and 
a presentation on sustainable engineering. The chapter concludes with a discussion 
of the findings and limitations of the study. 
Chapter Nine concludes the thesis and highlights the contribution and further work 
emanating from the study. It underscores the usefulness and expediency of the 
proposed sustainability education intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum.

Introduction 
The emergence of sustainability as the ultimate 21st century global challenge did not 
occur in a vacuum. Preceded by a formidable campaign which reached a crescendo 
in the 1990s, sustainability acknowledges the central role of education (Agenda 21 Rio 
Declaration, 1992). Efforts to introduce sustainability into higher education have been 
witnessed around the world (Allenby et al., 2009). This chapter is a selective review of 
the literature on sustainability and sustainability education in engineering. It offers a 
concept clarification of sustainability and highlights the continuing efforts at teaching 
and learning about sustainability. Through the lens of three educational aims, namely 
salvation, the state, and progress (Aldrich, 2008), the chapter reviews sustainability 
education declarations and sustainability education construct. Thereafter, it critiques 
the derived construct providing an impetus for the appraisal of sustainability education 
in engineering. Sustainable engineering as a conceptual departure from conventional 
engineering practice alongside the principles, tools, and frameworks of the field are 
discussed. The chapter also highlights the application of sustainable engineering and 
the pedagogical approaches of sustainability education in engineering. The chapter 
ends with an overview of research in sustainable engineering education, stressing the 
need for more investigations in the developing world context.

Sustainability 
Sustainability and sustainable development are used interchangeably in the present 
research. However, in some scholarly works sustainability is presented as the target 
of sustainable development. Consensus on this view is not yet attained. Since the 
landmark Brundtland Report in 1987 the word ‘sustainable’ has been taken up by 
academics, professional disciplines, non-governmental organisations, activists, policy 
makers and business organisations. The currency of sustainability in many fields of 
study reflects a deep concern for addressing the challenges of sustainable 
development. There is a subtle understanding that the challenge of sustainable 
development is the responsibility of all – an idea hinted in the main title of the 
Brundtland Report, Our Common Future. Contemporary sustainability discourse can 
be traced to centuries-long environmental concerns with the impacts of human 
civilisations.  
Concern for the environment has manifested throughout history in a variety of ways, 
such as the seventh century legislation for protection of birds in Farne Islands in 
England and the mining law in Italy in 1556 (Stables and Keirl, 2015). Other historical 
manifestations of environmental concerns include Urban Sanitary Act of 1388 and 
Alkali Act of 1874 in England (Forbes, 1995). The Convention Relative to the 
Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State adopted in the 1930s by some 
African and European nations is another example of early environmental interests 
(Nash, 2005). Such moves to protect and conserve natural resources continued to 
emerge across time and place until the modern environmental movement emerged in 
the 1960s and 1970s (Lee, 1999). 
The rise of environmentalism as a social, ethical and political movement is well-
documented. Environmentalism is debatably the culmination of reactions to the 
alarmingly irresponsible exploitation of earth’s natural resources since the Industrial 
Revolution. Use of pesticides in agriculture was noticed to be gradually killing insects 
causing starvation of birds, but also posing health risks to humans (Carson, 1962).This 
concern, which was highlighted by the scientist Rachel Carson (1907-1964) in her 
1962 book Silent Spring, is agreed to be a watershed in the history of modern 
environmentalism. Events and discourses following the publication of Silent Spring 
continued to raise public awareness of the global threat posed by unmitigated use of 
29 
 
natural resources. Environmental pressure groups emerged across the world forcing 
national and regional governments to take environmental concerns seriously.  
The environmental movement gained great momentum with the inputs of such ‘neo-
Malthusians’ as Paul Ehrlich and Garett Hardin (Bell, 2011). These scholars rekindled 
the controversial but famed Malthusian theory of population growth first developed by 
Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834) in eighteenth-century England. Malthus had 
predicted the imminence of famine and other social crises as a consequence of 
unchecked population growth, which he thought would surpass agricultural production 
(Robertson, 2012). Although Malthus’s prediction failed to materialise due to the 
mitigating impacts of agricultural technology such as mineral fertilisers that increased 
food production (Bell, 2011), the implications of overpopulation had been identified. 
Writing separately in 1968, Ehrlich and Hardin published The Population Bomb and 
The Tragedy of the Commons respectively. Central to these scholarly works is the 
interrelationship of human population, resource exploitation and the environment 
(Creech, 2012). These neo-Malthusians argued that negative environmental impact 
would continue unless population growth and resource exploitation were addressed. 
In the 1970s, the environmental advocacy continued with the themes of overpopulation 
and resource consumption. The UN Conference on the Human Environment held in 
Stockholm in 1972 to further debate these issues. In the same year, the Club of Rome 
published The Limits to Growth which predicted serious consequences for untempered 
population and economic growth. The report proved controversial as the developing 
nations were enraged by the idea of halting economic growth, whilst the developed 
world was critical of the exclusion of technological solutions (Mills and Emmi, 2006). 
An important theme in the report was the critique of unlimited economic growth which 
formed the basis of the dominant development model. Physical and ecological limits 
to economic growth were acknowledged as inevitable (Bell, 2011). The report 
suggested a state of equilibrium or an economic system that attains “steady state 
before breaching these limits” (Bell, 2011, p.17) as a way out. This notion of a steady-
state society or economy became part of the environmental discourse.  
As environmental problems such as biodiversity loss, pollution, water shortages, and 
soil depletion became frequent, the debate on environmental protection continued to 
rage throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Human activities such as deforestation, land 
degradation, and direct exploitation were identified as likely responsible for species 
30 
 
extinction and loss of biodiversity. In response to this problem, the United States 
enacted the Endangered Species Act in 1973, whilst the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) came into effect in 1975 
(Creech, 2012). Environmental pollution incidents such as the Amoco Cadiz oil spill 
(1978) and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident (1979) exemplified some of the 
consequences of resource exploitation. In 1984, a drought in Ethiopia left between 
250,000 and one million people dead as a result of starvation (Kidane, 1989). These 
occurrences further bolstered the environmentalist position and served as rather 
tangible proofs of the impacts of unmitigated economic activities.   
Amidst these activisms emerged evidence of climate change or global warming from 
rising temperatures (between 0.3 ºC - 0.6ºC) caused by human activities (IPCC, 1990). 
Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were discovered to have been building 
up in the atmosphere. The build-up was attributed to the burning of fossil fuels and 
deforestation. Studies have shown that the atmospheric concentration of carbon 
dioxide increased from pre-industrial levels of 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv) 
to around 387 ppmv in 2008 (Bell, 2011). Climate change will have such direct impacts 
as extreme weather events (hurricanes, earthquakes, heat waves) and indirect effects 
(migration, reduced food and water security). A consequence of climate change that 
raises moral question is the likelihood that the people contributing least to the climate 
crisis will suffer most from its impacts (Costello, 2009). Thus, the threat of climate 
change reignited the debate on the incompatibility of environmental protection and 
economic growth, but also raised issues of social justice and equity. 
In 1983, the UN convened the World Commission on Environment and Development 
(UNWCED) chaired by Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister. 
The Commission attempted to reconcile the seemingly opposing discourses of 
environmental protection and economic development. The outcome of UNWCED was 
not only the concept of sustainable development but also the term ‘sustainability’. The 
Commission echoed accumulated concerns of environmentalists over the years but 
also highlighted an intricacy: economic and social developments are inseparable from 
environmental issues (Brundtland, 1987). Consequently, the challenge facing the 
world was how to achieve a balance amongst environmental protection, social 
responsibility and economic viability. Sustainable development was presented as the 
only reasonable path towards the attainment of this complex trio.  
31 
 
The following definition of sustainable development was provided in the Brundtland 
Report: “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland, 1987). This 
connotation has received wide acclaim as well as criticisms. Enthusiasts observe that 
the Brundtland definition was instrumental to creating a holistic view of the global 
sustainability challenge (Mebratu, 1998). Critics, on the other hand, argue that the 
definition is so vague that almost anything could be couched in sustainability terms. 
Regardless of these observations, the Brundtland definition has been the foundational 
groundwork for all discussions of sustainability and sustainable development. Three 
pillars of sustainability, namely economy, society and environment deduced from the 
definition are usually depicted by the diagram in Figure 2.1. The Venn diagram is the 
most common depiction of sustainable development, which features sustainability as 
the intersection of the three circles. Each of the three overlapping circles signifies a 
dimension of sustainability. The circles are perfect and of the same size to depict the 
equal importance of the three sustainability pillars. A situation in which only two circles 
overlap does not yield sustainability. Hence, the intersection of social and economic 
dimensions produces an equitable society, whilst that of economic and environmental 
components yields viability. Sustainability is achieved primarily by balancing the three 
pillars of economy, society and environment.  
In furtherance of sustainability ideas, the UN instituted the Commission on Sustainable 
Development (UNCSD) following an Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The Rio 
de Janeiro conference was not only acclaimed as the largest gathering of world 
leaders but as representing a turning point in the global efforts to address sustainability 
challenges. Some important UN conventions relating to biodiversity, climate change 
and desertification ensued from the summit (Bell, 2011). A crucial milestone following 
the summit was Agenda 21 which detailed pathways of sustainability implementation 
globally. Nations were expected to use the framework of Agenda 21 to come up with 
locally-relevant implementation strategies. The 1995 execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, an 
environmental activist in the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria drew the attention of the 
international community to the intricate link amongst environmental justice, security, 
human rights and economic growth (Creech, 2012). Subsequent global sustainability 
conventions have repeatedly featured these issues. The interplay of environmental 
protection with social and economic issues as well as universal human rights has 
32 
 
featured in the 2000 UN Millennium Development Goals, the 2002 World Summit on 
Sustainable Development and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Sustainable development has important implications for the developing world. Given 
the exigencies of the socioeconomic needs in several developing countries, balancing 
the three dimensions of sustainability is quite challenging. Generally characterised by 
low human development, the countries in the developing world prioritise the fulfilment 
of societal needs. This, however, is not a recent phenomenon. Since the emergence 
of sustainability as a global agenda, the developing and the developed countries have 
held opposing views on the way forward (Giljum and Eisenmenger, 2004). The 
developing world has repeatedly invoked the idea of historical responsibility to argue 
that the developed world owes the rest of the world an ecological debt. Hence, the 
advanced countries should be more responsible for achieving sustainability than the 
developing countries, which are still struggling with multidimensional poverty, etc. 
These debates are not only continuing at international forums, but also reflected in 
government budgets. In Nigeria, for example, only a fraction of public resources (N6 
billion) is allocated to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the 2018 budget 
(FRN, 2018). By contrast, a large proportion of the budget (N682 billion) is set aside 
for infrastructural and social development projects.

Educational Aims in Society 
Human civilisation is historically replete with not only several scholastic achievements 
but also with the role of education in preserving humanity. Scholastic aspirations 
characterised Babylonian hieroglyphs2, Athenian grammata3, Spartan agoge4, East 
Asia’s Five Classics of Confucianism5, and medieval Arabia’s Bayt al Hikmah6. These 
wide-ranging didactic approaches devised by educators of diverse civilisational 
experiences have generally been aimed at salvation, statecraft, or material progress 
(Aldrich, 2008). Such multiformity of learning philosophies constitutes the milieu within 
which academic endeavours have continued. Sustainability education arose within this 
complex educational setting. Aldrich (2008) succinctly asserts that education as a 
significant branch of human history has been pursued for salvation, for the state, and 
for progress.  
Education for Salvation 
Education for salvation directs learning activity for the purpose of eschatological bliss. 
The longing for salvation is rooted in religion. An important message of religion in its 
various forms is the afterlife, which suggests another existence where ultimate justice 
will be dispensed. This teaching is central to the Abrahamic faiths of Christianity and 
Islam which further explain that salvation is for the righteous, whilst damnation awaits 
the malevolent. In the competing religions of Hinduism and Buddhism, salvation is 
presented as an escape from the endless cycle of rebirth to which the reprobate is 
bound. Similar salvation message is found in Zoroastrianism where drujo demana 
(house of lies) and garo demana (house of song) are reserved for the souls of evil and 
good people respectively (Contractor et al., 2016). Education for salvation guides 
                                            
2 Hieroglyph: stylised picture of an object denoting a word, syllable, or sound in ancient Egyptian writing 
system. 
3 Grammata: Athenian school course comprising reading, writing and arithmetic exclusively taught to 
boys. 
4 Agoge: an education program aimed at acquisition of military skills and acumen including stealth, 
endurance and comradeship by Spartan males. 
5 Confucianism’s Five Classics: a collection of five books, namely Book of Documents, Book of Odes, 
Book of Rites, Book of Changes, and Spring & Autumn Annals considered as main educational texts in 
imperial China.

which scholars of all backgrounds and nationalities converged for purely academic purposes.

individuals towards deeds that will lead to peace and happiness in the afterlife. It is 
more or less a moralising educational framework with eternal bliss as the main aim. 
Education for salvation is still relevant today as it continues to filter school curricula 
against ‘atheistic’ content in several countries. Steven Weinberg, the American 
physicist, in a BBC interview in 2003 recalled how science subjects were opposed in 
the Gulf States on the pretext that science was corrosive to religious beliefs (BBC, 
2003). This could be an oversimplified representation of religious influence on 
education especially with the scientific progress made in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and 
Iran. Nonetheless, the influence of education for salvation in many societies is 
undeniable. Therefore, the undiminished relevance of religious education must be 
acknowledged in sustainability education discourse. The qualities of education for 
salvation responsible for its unabated traction can be useful to a sustainability 
education framework. An appeal to religious values such as compassion, humility and 
self-discipline, which correspond to the social dimension of sustainability, could 
enhance the acceptability of sustainability education, especially in a deeply religious 
or communal society. 
Education for the State 
Education for the state guides learning towards citizenship and social cohesion. An 
arguably enduring scholastic aim, education for the state has continued to shape 
human intellectual affairs and lifestyles since the emergence of social organisations 
and the nation-states. The Spartan education model hallmarked by agoge is frequently 
referred to in the literature to illustrate an archetypal state-sponsored enculturation in 
ancient times (Knottnerus and Berry 2002). Education in Sparta was intended to imbue 
young men with valour and loyal patriotism in line with the Spartan triune ideal of 
uniformity, conformity and priority of collective interests (Hodkinson, 2002). An 
important reason adduced for the development of the Spartan education model was 
national survival. War, which the Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz (1780-1831) 
wittily describes as “continuation of politics by other means”, is a catalyst to education 
for the state goal (Howard and Paret, 1976). States whose territorial integrity, social 
stability or national interests are threatened have usually resorted to a state-centric 
education framework.  
35 
 
Patriotic orientation and influence in education have endured to-date. The modification 
of engineering education curricula during the Cold War to prioritise space engineering 
science is instructive. The rationale behind education for the state seems prima facie 
noble, however a deeper reflection on its actualisation exposes several downsides. 
The means of achieving education for the state involve selective reading of history and 
propaganda which are deleterious to the libertarian ideals of critical thinking and 
capacity for independent reasoning. Education for the state promotes a self-serving 
attitude albeit on a national scale akin to the motivation of the characters in the famed 
Tragedy of the Commons7 scenario (Hardin, 2006). Such state-centric disposition has 
been blamed for the failed negotiations at various international conferences on climate 
change and other global matters. Consequently, education for the state could be 
inimical to global concerns including sustainability. Thus, the extent to which a society 
is guided by education for patriotism will inevitably determine its approach to a 
sustainability education.  
Education for Progress 
Education for progress stems from the ascendancy of reason as the determinant of 
human advancement both morally and materially. In contrast to the other two 
educational aims, education for progress seeks to develop a protean individual 
capable of critical thinking and independent reasoning. The Sophists circa 400BCE 
espoused an incipient form of such educational aim stimulating in young Greeks the 
desire for questioning and intellectual disputation (Sacks and Murray, 1995). Material 
advancement is an outcome of education for progress (Aldrich, 2008). Advancement 
made globally in healthcare, transportation, and communication amongst others is 
arguably due to a progress-focused education. Global citizenship which opposes 
uncritical allegiance to national, chauvinistic, religious, ethnic, or sectarian ideals is 
linked to education for progress (Golmohamad, 2009). Knowledge is understood as 
“justified true belief” which undermines narrow-mindedness and promotes an open-
minded intellectual engagement.  
                                            
7 Tragedy of the Commons is a scenario-based explanation of the inescapable fate that awaits an 
egocentric and self-serving utilisation of the common good. Credited to the Englishman, William 
Forster Lloyd in 1832, the theory explains that individuals, driven by self-interest, will continually 
exploit a common resource until its usefulness is exceeded, resulting in a tragic end!  
36 
 
Education for progress has implications for sustainability knowledge. The valued goals 
of rational criticism and discerning autonomy can be underutilised resulting in morbid 
paranoia and conspiracy theories. Sustainability has, for instance, been criticised as 
a UN ploy to subjugate the world and micromanage the planet (Seabrook, 2002). A 
society with a critical mass of its population subscribing to such conspiratorial 
worldview could be impervious to sustainability education. Nonetheless, such strength 
of education for progress as critique of creed loyalty and dogmatism may well be the 
antidote to irrationality and paranoia. Additionally, the idea of global citizenship 
emphasised by education for progress could be tapped into to reinforce a sustainability 
education framework.  
Implication for Nigeria 
There are unmistakable traces of education for salvation, education for the state and 
education for progress in the Nigerian educational system including the engineering 
curriculum. Being an ethnically and religiously heterogeneous society, Nigeria 
enshrines secularism in its constitution (CFN, 1999). However, religion has remained 
a prominent feature of the Nigerian society. Given that Islam and Christianity are the 
dominant religions in Nigeria, Islamic Religious Knowledge and Christian Religious 
Knowledge are constant subjects in the syllabi of all Nigerian schools. Both subjects 
pervade the educational system from primary to tertiary levels. Also, most school-
going children in Nigeria attend religious schools alongside the Western-style schools. 
The influence of these religious schools is quite significant. Characteristic of education 
for salvation, the religious instructions subordinate the learning activities of individuals, 
becoming a guiding framework for educational pursuits. The choice of whether to study 
engineering or medicine, for example, would be guided by a religious outlook. In some 
instances, the upshot has been antagonism of Western education as witnessed with 
the emergence of the terrorist group, Boko Haram, which literally means “Western 
education is a sin”. Hence, even though it is not an official educational aim in Nigeria, 
education for salvation is manifestly consequential. 
With respect to education for the state and education for progress, there seems to be 
an official position in favour of both approaches. Nigeria’s National Policy on Education 
is premised on the concept of education as an instrument for national development 
(FME, 2013). The ideals of progress and patriotism are encapsulated in the Nigerian 
37 
 
educational philosophy. One of the objectives of education enumerated in the national 
policy is the development of a morally sound and patriotic citizen. There is also the 
goal of promoting education for skill acquisition, poverty reduction, and information 
technology capability at all levels (FME, 2013, 2016). The extent to which the populace 
is aware of these underlying philosophies is indeterminable. Nevertheless, being the 
undergirding principles of the Nigerian educational system, the philosophies inevitably 
guide individuals’ educational pursuits. The National Policy on Education informs the 
standard, structure, strategy, and management of education in Nigeria. With features 
of education for the state and education for progress officially recognised within it, the 
educational system in Nigeria has important implications for sustainability education. 
Whilst education for salvation is not acknowledged as an explicit government policy, 
education for the state and education for progress are featured in official documents. 
Nonetheless, the potential influence of the three educational aims could be equally 
significant. Therefore, the presence of these educational approaches in Nigeria implies 
that sustainability education interventions could utilise their various strengths to attain 
success. For instance, an intervention could proceed by determining the most relevant 
of the three educational aims to a region. The justification for the intervention could 
then be aligned with the identified educational approach. 
Evolution of Sustainability Education 
The role of education as an essential instrument for inculcating sustainability ideals in 
the global citizenry was identified during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. 
The report of the Summit, Agenda 21, declared education as “critical for promoting 
sustainable development and improving the capacity of people to address 
environment and development issues” (UN-Rio Declaration, 1992). This declaration 
simply echoed the long-established understanding of education as a vehicle for social 
reform and change. In the history of human civilisation, education has been 
responsible for not only numerous accomplishments, but arguably for the survival of 
the human race. Calls for sustainability education were based on the need to enable 
global change for the prosperity of present and future generations.   
An important cue from the three educational goals highlighted above is the way a 
presumed philosophical worldview guides the evolution, direction and deployment of 
38 
 
an educational system. Indeed, a society’s anthropological8, teleological9, 
axiological10, cosmological11, and metaphysical12 stance greatly influences the type of 
education it countenances. The sustainability debates peaked in the 1990s with the 
declaration of education as absolutely and evidently consequential for sustainable 
development. With the benefit of hindsight from human civilisational experiences, 
education in its metanarrative form was suggested as an undisputed enabler of 
sustainability. Since sustainability crises were anthropogenically induced, it was 
reasoned that humans’ teleological, axiological and anthropological outlooks needed 
to change globally.  
Additionally, the need to reconsider the increasingly consumerist, materialistic and 
unsustainable lifestyles of modern societies was exigent. Paradigms inherent in the 
three educational aims may have encouraged individuals into the unsustainable 
lifestyles aggravating contemporary sustainability challenges. Evidence of this 
connection subsists partly in the global population educated over the years within the 
three educational contexts vis-à-vis the heightened challenges. The question of an 
educational system’s focus and its relationship with sustainability then becomes 
relevant; hence the need to reorient education for sustainability. These thoughts 
formed part of the discourse of education for sustainable development which had by 
the late 1990s become a fixed agenda item for several international meetings and 
conferences.   
Sustainability Education Declarations 
Starting in 1990 with Talloires Declaration, the international community successively 
issued such other declarations on sustainability education as Halifax Declaration in 
1991, Agenda 21 in 1992, and Kyoto and Swansea Declarations in 1993 (Phuong, 
2013). Luneburg Declaration in 2001, Ubuntu Declaration and UNDESD (2005-2014) 
in 2002 further reinforced international efforts towards an education for sustainability. 
Within the declared UNDESD several declarations also ensued, such as Graz 
Declaration in 2005, Sapporo Sustainability Declaration in 2008, World Conference on 
                                            
8 Anthropology: beliefs about the nature and purpose of humans in general and, oneself in particular. 
9 Teleology: beliefs about the meaning and purpose of the universe and the interrelations of its 
inhabitants. 
10 Axiology: beliefs about the nature of value; good and bad; and right and wrong. 
11 Cosmology: beliefs about the nature of the origins of the universe and life. 
12 Metaphysics: beliefs about the ultimate nature of reality. 
39 
 
Higher Education for Sustainability as well as Turin and Abuja Declarations in 2009. 
The People’s Treaty on Sustainability for Higher Education (Rio+20) in 2012 was 
trailed by the recent UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A common theme 
intrinsic to all the proclamations is the dominant role of education, especially higher 
education, to the realisation of sustainability objectives.   
Talloires Declaration 
Concerned about aggravating sustainability challenges, some university leaders 
converged in the French commune of Talloires in the autumn of 1990 to promote 
sustainability in higher education. The Talloires Declaration resulted from this 
international conference (Shriberg and Tallent, 1990). Talloires Declaration is a 10-
point strategy informed by the fact that universities ‘educate most of the people who 
manage society’s institutions’, and therefore have a responsibility to produce 
environmentally literate and sustainability conscious citizens (Hill et al., 2001). Issues 
of unsustainable production and consumption patterns, inadequate expertise in 
environment-related discipline as well as incredulity of professionals about their field’s 
imprint on the environment were deliberated at the conference. In strategising to 
address these challenges, the Declaration stressed the need for multidisciplinary 
structures and environment-related programmes. Thirty-one representatives from 15 
nations cutting across both developing and developed countries signed the Talloires 
Declaration. The Association of University Leaders for a Sustainable Future (ULSF) 
was formed from the conference to serve as the secretariat of these signatories. 
ULSF’s recent record indicates that some 430 universities in over 40 countries across 
the world have endorsed the Talloires Declaration (ULSF, 2016).  
Halifax Declaration 
The Halifax Declaration was issued in December of 1991 following a meeting of 33 
university representatives from 10 countries across 5 continents (Wright, 2007). The 
conference which held at Halifax, Canada was jointly sponsored by the International 
Association of Universities (IAU), United Nations University (UNU), Association of 
Universities and Colleges Canada, and the Canadian Dalhousie University (IAU, 
2004). Inspired by the Talloires Declaration and the anticipated United Nations 
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), the Halifax meeting 
40 
 
intended to gauge universities’ role and contribution towards sustainable development 
(Wright, 2007). The Halifax meeting justified its convening on increased anthropogenic 
activity and on the need to tackle poverty. The meeting acknowledged intellectual 
resources and mutual vulnerability of both developing and developed nations as vital 
for sustainability discourse. Contending that universities exist for improving the social 
and economic conditions of people, the Halifax conference stressed the role of 
education in public awareness, teaching and practising sustainability ideals. Halifax 
Declaration differed from Talloires Declaration in not requiring any formal ratification 
by participating countries. Nonetheless, its 6-point action plan invited the dedication of 
all universities to rise to the occasion of fostering a sustainable future.  
Agenda 21  
Agenda 21 is an outcome of UNCED held in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro in 
1992. The Rio Earth Summit, as the conference is alternatively called, assembled 
around 178 UN Member States to devise a comprehensive strategy for promoting 
sustainable development worldwide. UNCED issued a 350-page document dubbed 
Agenda 21 or “Agenda for 21st Century”, which is a 40-chaptered text detailing 
programme of action in various environmental and developmental sectors. Reiterating 
concerns about limited resources and primacy of poverty eradication, Agenda 21 
highlighted actions that should be taken in several sectors of the society. Chapter 36 
of Agenda 21 captioned ‘Promoting Education, Public Awareness and Training’ 
specifically called for the reorientation of education towards sustainable development 
(Agenda 21, 1992).  The metanarrative of education featuring formal, informal and 
non-formal means was promoted. Attitudinal change and capacity to participate in 
addressing sustainability concerns were inextricably tied to the education of people. 
Also significant in the recommendations of Agenda 21 was for educational authorities 
to undertake an exhaustive review of curricula to reflect the multidisciplinarity of 
tackling sustainability challenges. Ironically, Agenda 21 is a favourite subject of 
conspiracy theorists who claim that the treaty promotes “world government” and deep 
socialism.

Kyoto Declaration 
The Kyoto Declaration of 1993 resulted from the 9th IAU Round Table which held in 
Kyoto, Japan and was adopted by 90 international university leaders. Seven key 
reasons for its espousal included the international dimension of sustainable 
development and ethical duty of present generation. Others were the need for a 
deepened grasp of sustainable development, prevalent global socio-economic 
disparities, and intellectual capacity of universities to facilitate change. Further 
rationalising its uptake on the necessity of cooperation amongst all stakeholders and 
on IAU to take the lead, the Kyoto Declaration recommended a 10-point action plan 
for universities. Central to this plan is for individual HEIs to promote the principle and 
practice of sustainable development amongst both staff and students irrespective of 
field of study. The Kyoto Declaration specifically recommended universities to employ 
their intellectual resources in developing interdisciplinary and collaborative research 
programmes for sustainable development. An important caveat highlighted by the 
Kyoto Declaration, however, was that the interpretation of sustainable development 
must not proceed in such a way as to cause ‘sustained undevelopment for certain 
systems’ (IAU, 1993). Accordingly, the need to engender requisite international 
consciousness, worldwide sense of responsibility and purposefulness was reiterated. 
In August of 2000 in South Africa, Kyoto Declaration was officially ratified by over 650 
institutions who were IAU members (Blackburn, 2007).  
Swansea Declaration 
Events at Talloires and Halifax inspired the Swansea Declaration issued by the 
Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) in 1993. Impelled by the need to 
counter the poor representation of universities at the 1992 UNCED, ACU decided, at 
its 15th Quinquennial Conference in Swansea, to reinforce worldwide calls to action on 
sustainable development. The Swansea Declaration justified its issuance on such 
concerns as expressed by previous declarations including widespread environmental 
degradation and endemic poverty. The Declaration underscored the import of equality 
amongst nations in achieving sustainable development through a 7-point action plan. 
Swansea Declaration reemphasised HEIs’ roles of disseminating better understanding 
of sustainable development, providing moral and ethical lessons, and guiding 
environmental literacy. Universities were called on to contribute more effectively to the 
42 
 
attitudinal and policy changes required for a sustainable future. An important emphasis 
of the Swansea Declaration was the need for universities in more developed countries 
to support sustainable development education initiatives in less fortunate universities. 
The Swansea Declaration was affirmed by representatives from over 400 universities 
in 47 countries around the world (Blackburn, 2008).   
Luneburg Declaration 
The Global Higher Education for Sustainability Partnership (GHESP) formed by 
COPERNICUS13, IAU, ULSF and UNESCO issued the Luneburg Declaration in 2001 
at the end of a conference themed “Higher Education for Sustainability: Towards the 
World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002” (Barth, 2015). The Declaration 
emerged in order to present a common position on higher education for sustainability 
at the forthcoming 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. 
Luneburg Declaration was aimed at ensuring that the import of higher education was 
aptly captured in the international framework that would follow the Rio+10 Summit. 
The Declaration reflected commitments to Chapter 36 of Agenda 21, and the Talloires 
and Kyoto declarations amongst other international pacts. HEIs were specifically 
called to perform 9 actions including continual pedagogical review and updating vis-à-
vis sustainability research, prioritising sustainability education, promotion and 
implementation of sustainability projects, and focus on closer stakeholder interaction 
for sustainability issues. Luneburg Declaration is unique in its call for the production of 
a “tool-kit” to facilitate concrete actions by universities in recognition of the 
implementation challenges encountered by previous declarations (Wright, 2007). The 
Luneburg Declaration did not require new signatories as previous declarations were 
endorsed.          
Ubuntu Declaration 
The Ubuntu Declaration is a product of the joint session between GHESP partners 
and representatives of some international scientific associations at the Johannesburg 
World Summit in 2002. Convinced that time was ripe for the mainstreaming of 
sustainability knowledge into educational systems globally, participants at this meeting 
                                            
13 CO-operation Programme in Europe for Research on Nature and Industry through Coordinated 
University Studies. 
43 
 
deliberated on a variety of modalities. The problem of sustainable development was 
carefully couched as contingent on the effective application of science and technology. 
Furthermore, concern was expressed about the failure of the international community 
to maximise the potential of education as a vehicle for achieving sustainable 
development. The Ubuntu Declaration on Education and Science and Technology for 
Sustainable Development, as the unabridged title of the declaration reads, endorsed 
and reaffirmed Earth Charter principles, Chapter 36 of Agenda 21 and the Luneburg 
Declaration. The hallmark of the Ubuntu Declaration is its emphasis on 3 significant 
points: need for greater global focus on education, essential role of education in the 
application of science and technology for sustainability, and the importance of 
partnerships (WSSD, 2002). The Ubuntu Declaration concluded with an explicit 
recommendation for sustainability knowledge to permeate all educational levels – 
primary to tertiary – and to integrate various means of education – formal, non-formal 
and informal. 
UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 
The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in December 2002 adopted Resolution 
57/254 approving the period 2005-2014 as the Decade of Education for Sustainable 
Development (UNDESD). UNESCO was designated as the lead agency to coordinate 
international efforts towards promoting and implementing the Decade. The launch of 
UNDESD was conceived at the WSSD Preparatory Committee IV (UNESCO, 2006). 
It was thought that a UN declaration on ESD would galvanise Member States to not 
only implement extant sustainability pacts but also conceive new ESD initiatives. The 
idea was for education to induce behavioural changes that will guarantee 
environmental integrity, economic viability and a just society. Educational resources 
around the world would be mobilised to equip global citizenry with the requisite skills 
and knowledge to live sustainably. UNGA stated UNDESD’s goal as “encouraging 
Governments to consider the inclusion…of measures to implement the Decade in their 
respective education system” (UNGA, 2002). Four UNDESD focus areas were 
promoting and improving quality education, reorienting educational programme, 
building public understanding, and providing practical training (UNESCO 2005). In 
“Shaping the Future We Want”, UNDESD Final Report, the establishment of ESD 
policies around the world, education curricula reorientation, and deployment of new 
approaches to ESD were presented as achievements. However, leadership, 
44 
 
conducive organisational climate and evidence grounding of educational reorientation 
requirement had been marginally successful (UNESCO, 2014).   
Graz Declaration  
Coincident with the inauguration of UNDESD, the Graz Declaration was issued in 2005 
in the Austrian city of Graz (UNESCO, 2005a). The Declaration followed a joint 
meeting of COPERNICUS, the Karl-Franzens-University Graz, the Technical 
University Graz, Oikos International and UNESCO. It was another global effort 
committing universities to sustainable development and emphasising sustainability 
opportunities for European Higher Education in particular and other regional 
universities in general. Drawing on insights from past conferences on sustainability, 
the Graz conference discussed the role of HEIs in societal transition towards 
sustainable development. The Conference concluded that UNDESD presented a 
formidable challenge to HEIs worldwide. EU ministers of education were encouraged 
to model the social dimension of European higher education on a sustainable 
development framework. The moral obligation of HEIs in producing responsible 
professionals and future leaders in society and economy was emphasised (Filho et 
al., 2007). To meet sustainability education objectives, the Graz Declaration called on 
firstly, universities to place sustainability at the core of their activities and plans. 
Secondly, EU education ministers were requested to pursue the integration of 
sustainable development issues into the Bologna Process. Finally, UNESCO was 
entreated to support the Graz Declaration and promote international cooperation 
amongst universities globally (Grindsted, 2011).    
Sapporo Sustainability Declaration 
Sapporo Sustainability Declaration resulted from a 2008 meeting of 27 delegates of 
educational and research institutions in G8 member nations with representatives from 
UNU and 7 major universities in non-G8 member states (UNESCO, 2014). Emerging 
from the 3-day University Summit, the presidents of the attending universities 
endorsed the Sapporo Declaration calling on HEIs globally to follow suit. The 
Declaration refreshed global attention on the indispensable role of universities in 
sustainability and detailed specific actions to be undertaken. In a section captioned 
“Joint Affirmations and Actions for Sustainability”, the Declaration listed 8 principles 
45 
 
underpinning the sustainability role of universities (SSD, 2008). These included the 
importance of sustainability in the 21st century, political expediency of sustainability 
concerns, and neutrality and objectivity of universities necessary to inform social and 
political change. Others were the need to restructure scientific knowledge, exigency 
of a network of networks, need for knowledge innovation, and the function of the 
university campus as an experimental model. Affirming these principles, participants 
declared to strive towards the fulfilment of global sustainability through diverse action 
programmes. Priority was given to cooperation and joint research efforts aimed at 
providing support to educational institutions in both developed and developing nations 
(Beaudreau, 2001).  
Turin Declaration  
Turin Declaration ensued from a 2009 G8 University Summit preceding the ‘L’Aquila 
2009 G8 Summit’ (G8Summit, 2009). The Declaration consolidated on the success of 
Sapporo Declaration. Participants at the G8 University Summit represented a diversity 
of culture which enriched deliberations and resulted in a robust declaration. The 
understanding of sustainable development as an important challenge of the 21st 
century evident in the complex interdependence of economics, ethics, energy policy 
and ecology (so-called 4E’s) was affirmed. Several agreements were reached at the 
Summit including the implementation of new social and economic development 
models congruent with sustainability ideals (Sylvestre et al., 2013). A significant 
decision in the Turin Declaration was for HEIs to facilitate access to high quality 
sustainability education for the benefit of policy makers. Also agreed were the 
implementation of sustainable development education programmes, sustainable and 
responsible research prioritisation, and engaging students in policy and decision 
making. Furthermore, attendees at the Turin Conference undertook to advance 
sustainable development through partnerships with both private and non-profit actors. 
One of the strengths of the Turin Declaration was its call for a holistic thinking and an 
integrated approach to addressing the issue of sustainability in higher education.  
2009 World Conference on Higher Education 
The 2009 World Conference on Higher Education (WCHE) was held between 5 and 8 
July 2009 at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris (UNESCO, 2010). It was an 
46 
 
international gathering driven by the desire to assess emerging developments in 
higher education since the late 1990s. With a record figure of 1400 participants from 
over 150 countries in attendance, the 2009 WCHE embodied a diversity of opinions 
and vested interests (UNESCO, 2010) . The Conference discussed an array of global 
challenges stressing the role of higher education in addressing them. Guided by 
internationalisation and globalisation theories amongst others, participants 
emphasised the need for all stakeholders to identify innovative ideas that would 
facilitate quality higher education globally. A holistic perspective of educational system 
defined by nonlinearity and interconnectedness was recognised as invaluable to the 
provision of quality education. In a series of plenary sessions, the Conference covered 
such focus areas as increased demand, social responsibility, governmental role, 
integration and harmonisation, as well as excellence in African higher education. An 
important recommendation of the 2009 WCHE was the call to replace the conventional 
one-way knowledge “transfer” model (usually from developed to developing nations) 
with a cross-boundary sharing framework featuring endogenous knowledge. The 
prime issue of sustainable development permeated the entire deliberations of the 
Conference with sustainability acknowledged as some kind of paradigm for change. 
Abuja Declaration 
In the Nigerian capital of Abuja in 2009, the Association of African Universities (AAU) 
convened its 12th General Conference from which emerged the Abuja Declaration 
(AAU, 2009). The Declaration focused on the role of higher education in sustainable 
development in Africa. Beginning with a series of acknowledgements including an 
applicable sustainable development definition, globalisation impact, Africa’s 
sustainability peculiarities and higher education’s potential, the Declaration called for 
action from such stakeholders as HEIs, national governments, regional organisations, 
and development partners. Similar to a number of previous declarations, the Abuja 
Declaration singled out higher education for special charge in scholarly and scientific 
research necessary for a sustainable future. The conservative tendency of African 
HEIs to engage in research devoid of local developmental content and needs was 
highlighted. HEIs were called to reengineer education systems for sustainability, which 
would ensure transdisciplinary teaching and synergy among regional institutions. 
National governments were requested to guide educational curricula towards 
sustainability with emphasis on spirituality, ethics and morality (Shallcross and 
47 
 
Robinson, 2007). The Abuja Declaration was a significant proclamation on 
sustainability which provided the much needed African context to the discourse of 
sustainability in higher education.  
The People’s Sustainability Treaty on Higher Education 
The People’s Sustainability Treaty on Higher Education also called Rio+20 Treaty was 
developed in May 2012 in a bid to further international efforts at rethinking HEIs’ role 
in the transition towards a sustainable society (COPERNICUS, 2013). Over 30 
stakeholders including government agencies and student associations were involved 
in drafting the Treaty. The Rio+20 Treaty proved unique as it proceeded on the 
premise of education sector transformation. An argument is made in the Treaty about 
the need for higher education to transform itself before it can meaningfully contribute 
to sustainable development. Blame is laid on HEIs for the unsustainable lifestyles that 
result from its dominant education paradigm. HEIs are said to require change in 
knowledge structure, promotion of intercultural understanding, effective leadership 
and use of ICT. Based on a number of principles including efforts alignment, 
partnership, sustainability as a learning process, and access to the underprivileged, 
the Rio+20 Treaty declared to effect change at 5 levels. These involve ‘cultural change’ 
underpinned by institutional and HEIs stakeholders and ‘campus management’ for 
sustainability to showcase biodiversity conservation, environmental management 
systems and low carbon footprint. The next proposed level of change is curricular, 
which seeks to reorient education towards sustainable development. Another level of 
change is ‘community engagement’ aimed at revitalising the communal responsibility 
of HEIs (UN, 2012).   
UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted by UNGA at the 70th 
anniversary of the UN in New York in 2015 (UNGA, 2015). It is a global call to pursue 
some 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. Informed by 
decades of worldwide sustainability polemics with variously proposed sustainability-
oriented strategies, the UN 2030 Agenda is an ambitious framework for global 
transformation. The Agenda is poised to successfully stimulate action across the world 
in “areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet” (UNGA, 2015). Various 
48 
 
goals including poverty eradication, gender equality, sustainable consumption and 
production patterns, and revitalised Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 
feature in the Agenda. The preamble of the UN Resolution which details the 2030 
Agenda hinges SDGs on the complex interrelationship of the so-called 5 P’s: people, 
planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. The UN 2030 Agenda highlights current 
unsustainable state-of-affairs stressing imminent risk to people and planet. The 
Agenda’s congruency with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Millennium 
Declaration and the Declaration on the Right to Development is underscored. SDG 4 
stresses the need for inclusive and equitable quality education as well as lifelong 
learning opportunities for all. This fourth objective covers ESD over the next 15 years.

Critique of Sustainability Education Declarations 
Several points of interest occur in all attempts at a comparative review of the various 
sustainability education declarations. The declarations lend themselves to a range of 
discursive approaches including thematic consideration, temporal trend study, and 
discourse and content analyses. Following the issuance of over 10 sustainability 
education declarations by the late 1990s, studies on their thematic content emerged. 
A thematic analysis of the declarations appeared in Wright (2002) which identified 
eight themes from a scrutiny of seven sustainability education declarations. Themes 
such as moral obligation, sustainability models, sustainable research and public 
outreach were observed. Others were interuniversity cooperation, partnership with 
governments/industry/NGOs, interdisciplinary curriculum development and ecological 
literacy (Wright, 2002). These themes became embedded in subsequent sustainability 
education declarations at varying degrees of importance. However, the more recent 
declarations were enriched with more principles as sustainability education debates 
improved over the years. Table 2.1 summarises the education declarations highlighted 
in the preceding sections and features Wright’s (2002) identified themes as well as 
emerging motifs from succeeding declarations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
The shifting emphases in the sustainability education declarations are indicative of the 
evolutionary character of sustainability both as a concept and as an educational 
movement. The incipient declarations, for example, emphasised environmental or 
ecological literacy, whilst the later declarations stressed sustainability knowledge. This 
is a non-trivial point as sustainability education differs from environmental education. 
The Brundtland Report had in 1987 expressed sustainability as a balance among 
economy, environment, and society (Brundtland, 1987). Environmental education is, 
therefore, a subset of sustainability literacy. Nonetheless, environmental education 
continued to be somehow equated to sustainability literacy post Brundtland 
Commission as the early declarations show. The drawback of such conflation is the 
inadvertent disregard of the other two important sustainability dimensions. The change 
in emphasis from environmental knowledge to sustainability literacy in the Kyoto 
Declaration in 1993 is a recognition of the need to rectify this inaccuracy. However, it 
could also represent a watering down of the ecological elements of sustainability in 
favour of the less challenging emphasis on economics and social development. 
52 
 
Notwithstanding this possibility, it is apposite to infer that sustainability education 
declarations are evolutionary and adaptive.       
Another interesting observation from the sustainability education declarations is the 
use of concepts such as holism, top-down approach and technocentrism. Holism is a 
principle espoused in systems thinking to manage complexity. Although sustainability 
has always been understood as a complex problem, proposal of systemic solutions in 
ESD is not accelerated. The adoption of systems thinking principles in sustainability 
education declarations initiated by the Turin Declaration paralleled an ascendancy of 
systems science ideals in the intellectual community. Similarly, the suggestion of top-
down approach in some of the declarations to emphasise the critical role of national 
governments and policy-makers in sustainability education is not acausal. 
Declarations that preceded the 2009 WCHE, which stressed the top-down approach, 
were noticed to have been minimally implemented globally due to a lack of political 
will. The emphasis of a top-down approach in sustainability education is, therefore, to 
stimulate governmental action worldwide. In the same vein, the consideration of 
technocentrism which promotes the centrality of science and technology in addressing 
contemporary challenges indicates technophiles joining the sustainability education 
debate. Hence, sustainability worldview, which guides the sustainability education 
declarations, could be inferred as basically open and eclectic.  
Conspiracy of silence is another point of interest in the declarations. There seems to 
be no reference in the declarations to the role played by universities and HEIs in the 
current unsustainable lifestyle characterised by inordinate consumerism. The 
declarations readily construct the university as an enabler and possessor of the 
remedy to sustainability challenges. However, there is no gainsaying that the seeds of 
sustainability crisis flourished within the HEIs from which several global leaders 
graduated. The contribution of the intellectual community in what Sterling (2001) aptly 
describes as ‘sustaining unsustainability’ is undeniable (Sterling, 2001). An endless 
list of unsustainable outcomes could be drawn from the activities of HEIs including the 
atomic bomb, fossil fuels and so on. Nevertheless, university education is undoubtedly 
key to social reform and transformation as already discussed. However, HEIs as 
currently structured may be handicapped for a meaningful ESD. The prevailing 
educational paradigms with their contextual shapers need to be re-examined and 
failure of the declarations to acknowledge this fact is worrying. Reflexivity is an 
53 
 
important step towards bringing about positive change like the one being suggested 
by the sustainability education declarations. Consequently, arguing for an ESD without 
acknowledging the emancipatory and instrumentalist functions of education as implied 
in the overarching educational aims leads to a potentially problematic construct.  
Sustainability Education Construct  
From the declarations a sustainability education construct is apparent. Sustainability 
education is variously referred to as education for sustainable development (ESD), 
sustainable education (SE), education for sustainability (EfS) and recently sustainable 
higher education (SHE). These terms are used interchangeably on the premise of 
education as a solution to sustainability challenges. Sustainability education is about 
reorienting education towards sustainable development, which emphasises ‘values of 
justice, equity, tolerance, sufficiency and responsibility’ (UNESCO, 2009). In the 
sustainability education construct education about and for sustainability will be taught 
to students in HEIs, although lifelong learning seeks to stretch this beyond formal 
education. Sustainability education is context-dependent espousing the principle of 
common but differentiated responsibility. This means individual HEIs can use the 
construct as a model to develop a sustainability education framework consistent with 
local circumstances. Additionally, sustainability education through the top-down 
approach recognises the role of accreditation bodies and policymakers in incentivising 
relevant management. Furthermore, sustainability education is constructed as an 
essentially multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary endeavour. Therefore, it is fashioned 
into a framework that is imprecise, dynamic, eclectic, open, adaptive and evolutionary.  
The laudable efforts at implementing sustainability education are still ongoing with new 
initiatives developed globally. Nonetheless, the extant education paradigm which has 
been accused of ‘sustaining unsustainability’ has remained somewhat inviolate. The 
question worth asking is how a system with such reputation can be trusted to reorient 
‘itself’ towards sustainability. There is already an inherent misalignment in the 
sustainability education construct which readily presents hiccups at the point of 
implementation. Compromises are often made based on arguments from pragmatism 
and in the process sustainability robustness is lost. This perhaps accounts for the 
minimal successes recorded on the global march towards sustainable development. 
In spite of the upsurge in sustainability education programmes in the last two decades, 
54 
 
NASA data indicate that 2015 was the hottest year on record (NASA, 2016). In Nigeria, 
environmental and socioeconomic problems have increasingly manifested in several 
parts of the country. The south-eastern city of Port-Harcourt has been intermittently 
covered in soot, which government officials have attributed to illegal refining of crude 
oil (Warami, 2017). Improvised oil refining is a widespread practice in the oil-rich Niger-
Delta which does not only pose environmental health hazards, but also economic cost. 
Unsustainable agricultural practices such as excessive livestock farming and felling of 
trees occur frequently in northern Nigeria (Ohunakin et al., 2014).  
The fact that more sustainability education has not yielded positive sustainable 
behaviour in the global citizenry points to a fundamental discordancy in its construct. 
The existing educational paradigm is by default unsustainable and guided conjointly 
by education for salvation, education for the state and education for progress. The 
relentless consumerism of the 21st century might not be unconnected with a potent 
desire for material acquisition promoted by the education for progress paradigm. Also 
it is not inconsequential the increasing number of people who subscribe to conspiracy 
theories about sustainability issues. Referencing academics from reputable HEIs such 
as the MIT Professor of Meteorology, Richard Lindzen14, conspiracy theorists have 
occasionally achieved some success misinforming the public. It is therefore contended 
that sustainability education as currently framed juxtaposes myriad subtleties to take 
on a crisis for which it is ill-equipped. An enhanced structure will be the one in which 
sustainability worldview guides human societies, which in turn direct the development 
and deployment of sustainability education as illustrated in Figure 2.2. 
From the pragmatic perspective, a focus on achieving sustainability worldview globally 
is not only naïve but also futile. Whilst not undermining the pragmatist efforts that have 
produced an assortment of sustainability courses in HEIs, it is noteworthy that a 
sustainability worldview is feasible. In line with Einstein’s clichéd assertion that ‘no 
problem can be solved from the same consciousness that created it,’ priority should 
be given to changing those aspects of our social values that are incompatible with 
sustainability. 
 
                                            
14 Richard Lindzen is an American Professor of Meteorology at MIT who has been critical of IPCC 
claims about climate change stating that the Earth had just emerged from the “Little Ice Age” in the 
19th century which is expectedly followed by warming.  
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Accordingly, the definition and understanding of both successful life and accomplished 
person will have to change. Another downside of the extant sustainability education 
construct is that it leads to cherry-picking of sustainability ideals. In the Western world, 
for example, the environmental dimension of sustainability is so stressed that the 
mention of sustainability instinctively evokes a need for the exclusive protection of the 
Earth (Allenby et al., 2009). The social aspects of sustainability tend to be 
underemphasised especially in the US as they are in direct conflict with the American 
libertarian sense of individualism. Social sustainability also connotes sharing and in 
many Western societies ‘there is no such thing as a free lunch’. Unless a sustainability 
worldview is attained, sustainability education as currently conceived can only go so 
far.

Sustainable Engineering and Education 
Engineering is intricately connected with the complex problems of sustainability, owing 
to its role of satisfying human needs and aspirations. Going forward into the future, 
engineering is generally required to transform into sustainable engineering guided by 
sustainability worldview and values. This section presents an overview of sustainable 
engineering and education. Sustainable engineering as an evolving and maturing 
engineering discipline is reviewed and some historical account of the discipline 
addressing origins and ambitions is provided. Thereafter, the definition and rationale 
of sustainable engineering as well as the philosophical underpinnings, frameworks, 
principles and tools of the discipline are discussed. Sustainable engineering education 
covering issues of pedagogy, curriculum, learning outcomes, learning and teaching 
techniques and sustainability research are addressed. 
Overview of Sustainable Engineering 
Originally joining the debate as ‘engineering for sustainable development’, the 
engineering discipline aimed to internalise the precepts of sustainable development in 
the conduct of engineering activities (Allen and Shonnard, 2012). This venture gave 
rise to industrial ecology, green engineering, earth systems engineering, and 
engineering tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and design for X (DfX) amongst 
several others. Although it is difficult to state precisely when and who coined the term 
‘sustainable engineering’, the phrase is clearly useful for members of the engineering 
community convinced by the criticality of engineers in designing and engineering a 
sustainable future.  
Defining Sustainable Engineering 
The definition of sustainable engineering is currently unsettled given the contested 
nature of sustainability. However, it is worthwhile to attempt a definition of sustainable 
engineering with recourse to sustainable development. The most prominent definition 
of sustainable development remains the Brundtland Commission’s “development that 
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs” (Brundtland, 1987). The UNESCO Engineering Initiative 
(UEI) defines sustainable engineering as “the process of using resources in a way that 
does not compromise the environment or deplete the materials for future generations” 
57 
 
(UEI, 2017). Two other definitions of sustainable engineering worthy of note are given 
by Short (2008) and Gagnon et al (2012).  
Whilst Short defines sustainable engineering “as engineering that targets sustainable 
development” (Short, 2008, p.24). Gagnon et al delineate it “as the integration of 
sustainability issues in the various activities associated with engineering practice” 
(Gagnon et al., 2012, p.50). It is simply stating the obvious that sustainable 
development is the raison d’etre of sustainable engineering. Thus, sustainable 
engineering inevitably inherited the imprecision and complexity of sustainability 
definition. Nonetheless, it is well-recognised that sustainability is not attainable from 
the current conventional engineering methods but from initiatives founded on the 
social, economic and environmental bases (Allenby et al., 2007). Table 2.2 presents 
some differences between conventional engineering and sustainable engineering.

Sustainable engineering generally proposes a conceptual departure from conventional 
engineering and seeks to broaden the problem and solution domains of engineering 
across the three areas of economy, society and environment. Therefore, the discipline 
alternates among transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and meta-disciplinary features as 
it struggles to not only establish itself but achieve the highly prized goal of engineering 
sustainability.  
58 
 
Rationale for Sustainable Engineering 
Sustainable development, as discussed earlier, became necessary following the 
pressing “need to live within constraints and to ensure more fairness in access to 
limited resources” both intra- and inter-generationally. Contrastingly, sustainable 
engineering arose in recognition of the need for engineering activities such as the use 
of material, water resources and energy as well as infrastructure and product 
development to proceed sustainably. Thus, whilst the former in addition to being vital 
for policy, planning and decision-making emphasises change in lifestyle, the latter 
concentrates on engineering activities. Hence, sustainable engineering is a subset of 
sustainable development. The need for sustainable engineering can be discussed 
under various headings. However, for brevity, two factors shall be considered. These 
are the inextricable link between economic development and engineering, and the 
instrumental value of engineering in addressing sustainability challenges.  
Economic Development and Engineering 
Reference has already been made to the central role of engineering and technology 
in characterising economic activities in various geological periods. Indeed, as aptly 
expressed by Cropley in 2015, engineering and technology represent “the economic 
lifeblood of societies” (Cropley, 2015, p.13). Societies that were privileged with 
engineering and technological capabilities prospered as the recent history of world 
economies has shown. The link between economic progress and engineering has 
been widely acknowledged in literature and public discourse. In an address to 
members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1895, 
William Kent illustrated the causal relationship between engineering and economic 
growth (Kent, 1895). Kent explained how engineering the Erie Canal brought 
prosperity to New York City. This canal-prosperity story has been replicated in the 
Suez Canal, Grand Canal and Panama Canal in Egypt, Venice and Panama 
respectively. The industrial development and maturing of the engineering profession 
in England in the 17-1800s is also a relevant example (Christopher, 2007). The same 
success story is related about railways, roads, air transport, internet, and about so 
many other engineering and technological products and services. Consequently, 
economic growth is evidently driven and enhanced by engineering and technology. 
Economic development, however, represents a cardinal requirement of sustainable 
59 
 
development, and therefore expertise in the form of sustainable engineering is needed 
to deliver this goal. 
Instrumental Value of Engineering and Technology 
Another reason for sustainable engineering is the instrumental value of engineering in 
addressing real-world problems. Over the centuries, engineering and technological 
creativity has intervened to resolve societal issues and challenges including military 
constraints. In fact, the latter was so associated with engineering that when non-
military problems were increasingly requiring intervention the field of civil engineering 
emerged to differentiate such interventions from military engineering activities. Staying 
with military challenges, in the 1860s in Paris there arose a need to rapidly deploy 
troops throughout the city in the event of any revolutionary uprising. This was sequel 
to events of 1848 in which Parisian revolutionaries, having gained the tactical 
advantage of cramped neighbourhood streets, effortlessly blockaded the passages 
and unleashed mayhem on hapless residents and government officials. The 
engineering solutions devised by Baron Haussmann are the novel, spacious 
boulevards for which the city of Paris is celebrated (Allenby, 2012). Examples of similar 
engineering interventions are so numerous that they may require a lengthy discussion. 
Nonetheless, in the modern era, which, as mentioned earlier, has been called the 
Anthropocene, the main challenge is delivering sustainable development. Engineering 
is again expected to address this problem, which is exclusively distinctive of the Age 
of the Human. However, this time it would be engineering reconceptualised as 
sustainable engineering and equipped with myriad tools to cater for environmental, 
economic and social needs.       
Sustainable Engineering Frameworks 
Sustainable engineering frameworks have been copiously proposed in the literature. 
Most of the frameworks are expectedly predicated on the concept of sustainable 
development. Furthermore, the frameworks are generally embodied by principles and 
tools related to several disciplines in both the social sciences and engineering. The 
integration of these components is usually presented as a sustainable engineering 
framework. 
60 
 
Sustainable Engineering Principles 
Whilst developing a taxonomy of sustainable engineering principles under the various 
categories of ‘international’, ‘national’, and ‘researchers’, Gagnon et al enumerated 12 
examples of sustainable engineering frameworks (Gagnon et al., 2009) These 
proposals are a list of guidelines featuring averagely between 5 – 17 principles aimed 
at providing guidance for sustainable engineering practice. The Institution of 
Professional Engineers of New Zealand details 17 guidelines while the Royal 
Academy of Engineering UK maintains a list of 12 guidelines. Other proposals of 
sustainable engineering principles include the Sandestin Green Engineering 
Principles, the Hannover Principles, and Coalition for Environmentally Responsible 
Economies (CERES) Principles. The Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry, the 
Augsburg Materials Declaration, Ahwanhee Principles, and Earth Charter Principles 
are also variously suggested as useful principles for sustainable engineering (Allen 
and Shonnard, 2012)  
Engineering professional associations have equally included sustainability in codes of 
ethics which serve as guiding principles for the conduct of engineering activities. 
Indeed, sustainability is a requirement under the code of conduct of the Institution of 
Civil Engineers. The Engineering Council in the UK lists six principles of sustainable 
engineering including the need to “contribute to building a sustainable society, present 
and future”, “apply professional and responsible judgement” as well as “do more than 
just comply with legislation and codes”(Engineering Council, 2013). The remaining 
principles guide engineers to “use resources efficiently and effectively”, “seek multiple 
views to solve sustainability challenges”, and “manage risk to minimise adverse impact 
to people or the environment”. It is instructive that sustainable engineering principles 
were developed eclectically from environmental sciences, green chemistry, industrial 
ecology, and systems engineering among other disciplines. The fact that sustainable 
engineering harnesses these ideas in pursuit of engineering sustainability indicates its 
multidisciplinary posture. 
 
 
61 
 
Sustainable Engineering Tools 
Similar to the extant principles which sustainable engineering is gradually adopting, a 
number of tools useful to the discipline subsist. Some of these mechanisms, which 
have already appeared in sustainable engineering literature, are Eco-Industrial Parks 
(EIPs), Pollution Prevention (P2), Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA), Design for X (DfX), 
and Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) (Cushman-Roisin, 2006).  
EIPs replicate or mimic the ecosystem by converging all industrial activities and 
associated enterprise in the same location. The idea is to promote interaction, synergy 
as well as close-loop practices especially amongst closely-related industries. P2 is an 
environmental science tool based on the fairly sensible notion of ‘prevention is better 
than cure’. The focus of P2 is to avoid pollution ab-initio through various strategies 
ranging from waste elimination, reduction, recycling to waste impact minimisation. LCA 
is quite a popular tool that considers the entire lifespan of a product, project or system 
from conception to retirement or interment (or as it is said, from ‘cradle to grave’). The 
process involves a holistic assessment of a project’s potential impact at each 
developmental stage from procurement of raw materials to use/consumption and 
eventual disposal.  
DfX is a very useful process of product design which considers various desirable 
attributes represented as X, where X can be ‘assembly’ giving rise to design for 
assembly (DFA) or ‘environment’ resulting in design for environment (DfE) and so on. 
LEED Green Building Rating SystemTM is a programme developed by the US-based 
Green Building Council (USGBC) to assist in the certification of a building’s 
sustainability status. The programme has received wide acceptance and is currently 
the standard benchmark for erecting sustainability-compliant buildings (USGBC, n.d.). 
Figure 2.2 is an example of sustainable engineering framework found in the literature.  
62

The above framework provides guidance on how to conceive and execute projects 
sustainably. Note that there are principles placed directly on each pillar of sustainability 
with some guidelines positioned between pillars. This is intended to guide engineering 
activities by ensuring that all possible issues and impacts, which may arise from any 
project, are duly considered. Hence, the framework severally features principles for 
the attainment of economic growth, societal progress and environmental protection, 
and also for the fulfilment of the nexus between society and environment, environment 
and economy, and economy and society.  
 
 
63 
 
Sustainable Engineering Education  
Sustainable engineering education or simply engineering education for sustainable 
development (EESD) dawned as a corollary of ESD. The self-evident role of 
engineering in the existing crises of biodiversity loss, climate change, hyper-
consumerism, and heightened water demand is linked to the rise of EESD. In response 
to these challenges, the engineering community devised EESD as an ethical and 
intellectual strategy. Since its rise, sustainable engineering education has stimulated 
an assortment of reactions. Advocates stress its potential to produce sustainability 
literate engineers, whilst critics emphasise the oxymoronic combination of the extant 
functionalist educational frameworks with sustainability engineering education. This 
difference of opinion has bolstered the sustainable engineering education discourse. 
An increased interest in teaching sustainable engineering has been reported in the 
literature (Sanjay, 2004; Fenner et al., 2005; Kamp, 2006; Allenby, 2007; Huntzinger 
and Hutchins, 2007a; Byrne et al., 2010a; von Blottnitz, Case and Fraser, 2015).  
Temporally, the last two decades were critical to the rise of global sustainability 
concerns, which led to an unprecedented number of international declarations on 
sustainability education. Talloires Declaration in 1990 was the first global education 
declaration to bring into focus the responsibility of universities to produce sustainability 
literate citizens. University leaders from both developing and developed nations 
endorsed the Declaration laying the foundation for sustainability education imperative. 
The contagion of positives resulting from Talloires Declaration was so remarkable that 
by 2011 some 31 sustainability education declarations had been issued globally 
(Grinstead, 2011). The significance of these education declarations is the emergence 
of a sustainability education concept based on the recognition of education as an 
indispensable tool in addressing sustainability challenges. 
The immediate popularity of the concept elicited interests from academic disciplines 
and professional associations seeking to implement sustainability education within 
their educational framework. Attempt by the engineering profession to take up ideas 
of sustainability education led to the creation of the World Engineering Partnership for 
Sustainable Development (WEPSD) in 1992 (Caroll, 1993). This partnership was 
formed by the World Federation of Engineering Organisations (WFEO), Union of 
International Technical Associations (UATI), International Federation of Independent 
Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) and the Consortium for International Earth Science 
64 
 
Information Networks (CIESIN). WESPD was partly motivated by the need to present 
a common engineering position at the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED) which held at Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The participation of 
WESPD at the 1992 UNCED resulted in a unanimous call for international engineering 
organisations to act as the catalyst for the implementation of sustainability. The 
Partnership specifically stated that it would seek to ‘redirect engineering ethics and 
education for sustainability’ (Caroll, 1993).  
In 2002, almost 10 years after WEPSD members attended UNCED 1992, the UN 
declared the period 2005 – 2014 as the Decade of Education for Sustainable 
Development (UNDESD). Following this declaration were several sustainability 
education efforts across the world. An exclusive declaration on engineering education 
for sustainable development was issued in 2004 in Barcelona. The Barcelona 
Declaration, as it came to be known, was prefaced by a sustainability narrative about 
increasing complexity and inadequacies of the extant socioeconomic development 
model. A new kind of engineer was recommended to possess a number of skills 
including an understanding of engineering’s interface with society and environment. 
Application of systemic and holistic approach, ability to work in multidisciplinary teams 
and capacity to utilise professional knowledge according to deontological principles 
and universal ethics were equally recommended. Engineering education must, 
according to the Barcelona Declaration, be reoriented towards achieving these 
competences.  
To consolidate on this success and monitor progress of the Barcelona Declaration, 
three European technological universities banded together to form the Engineering 
Education for Sustainable Development Observatory (EESD-Observatory). The 
Observatory was intended to check the progressive implementation of the Barcelona 
Declaration globally and present an episodic state-of-the-art review on international 
EESD strategies (EESD-Observatory, 2006). From 2002 onwards, EESD conferences 
as shown in Table 2.3 held around the world to assess and improve on sustainable 
engineering education efforts. Within this period, EESD made inroads into educational 
policies of numerous national governments as accreditation bodies, professional 
associations and university commissions introduced sustainability criterion as part of 
their certification requirements.

Table 2.3. Summary of EESD conferences 
 
Sweden, for example, modified the Swedish Higher Education Act (1992:1434) in 2006 
to mandate universities to “…promote sustainable development through their 
educational activities…”(Motrel et al., 2006) Similarly, the UK Standard for 
Professional Engineering Practice (UK-SPEC) detailing standards for Engineering 
Technician (EngTech), Incorporated Engineer (IEng) and Chartered Engineer (CEng) 
captured the issue of sustainability under its competence and commitment standards. 
Globally, such efforts have continued to be replicated with countries in Europe and 
North America in the vanguard. Sustainable engineering education initiatives in the 
developing world are progressing very slowly but the prospect of an acceleration is not 
farfetched. Already, African HEIs through the Association of African Universities (AAU) 
have acknowledged the indispensability of sustainability education in the 21st century. 
In 2009, the Abuja Declaration on ESD was issued in which African universities

Sustainable Engineering Pedagogy 
Interest in sustainable engineering naturally involves questions of pedagogy. How can 
sustainable engineering be taught and learned? What approach, strategy, or method 
is best suitable for integrating, incorporating or embedding sustainable engineering 
courses in engineering curricula? A number of pedagogical frameworks featuring 
novel ideas and strategies have been proposed. However, these proposals are as 
diverse and contested as are conceptions of pedagogy and curriculum. Clarification of 
these two important educational notions is hence germane. 
Pedagogy and Curriculum 
Pedagogy and curriculum have remained topics of impassioned discussion in the 
educational community. In the 19th century, Gabriel Compayre’s (1843-1913) The 
History of Pedagogy published in 1889 furthered an ongoing debate by sketching the 
trajectory of pedagogy from classical antiquity. John Dewey (1859 -1952) followed with 
a series of unbridled critique on prevailing pedagogy in the American educational 
system. Another seminal contribution to the topic came from the Russian theoretician 
Lev Vygotsky (1896 -1934), who researched extensively into the psychology of 
education. Added to these intellectual endeavours in the 20th century was Paulo 
Freire’s (1921-1997) Pedagogy of the Oppressed, which relaunched the pedagogical 
polemics. Currently, scholarly works on the subject of pedagogy and curriculum have 
continued to emerge (Kotecki 2002; Alexander 2004; Murphy 2008; Yeats 2013). The 
interest pedagogy has generated over the centuries is indicative of its centrality in 
educational discourse.  
Pedagogy has been defined in the Cambridge Dictionary as the “study of the methods 
and activities of teaching”. The Encyclopaedia Britannica describes pedagogy in terms 
of teaching methods, educational goals and ways to achieve these aims. Pedagogy is 
a word of Greek root derived from paidagogos, a compound of “paidos” (child) and 
“agogos” (leader) (NWE Contributors, 2015). This etymology leads to the delineation 
of pedagogy as simply the art and science of teaching children. Authors such as 
Knowles (1995) even argue for the exclusive use of pedagogy in reference to 
67 
 
children’s education. Andragogy, coined by Alexander Kapp (1799-1869) from the 
Greek andr (man), is suggested for adult education. Initially gaining some currency, 
andragogy has now fallen into disuse. Pedagogy is presently the preferred term for 
the art and science of teaching generally. Trailing this definitional contention is the 
interesting question about the purview of pedagogy. The query of what constitutes 
pedagogy does not yield a harmonious response. Educational discourse in some 
quarters subordinates pedagogy to curriculum, while others express the opposing 
viewpoint that pedagogy involves teaching and learning with all the necessary 
concomitants including curriculum (Alexander, 2004).  
Curriculum is of Latin provenance – currere meaning “to run the course”. There is an 
understanding of curriculum as the documentation of “why”, “what”, “when”, “where”, 
“how” and “with-whom-to-learn” of an educational programme (Kotecki, 2002). 
Conceived this way, curriculum is no more than a document containing information 
and guidelines. However, curriculum is also assumed to be a process involving the 
participation of various stakeholders. Two most common methods of curriculum 
development are “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches. In the top-down approach, 
political and educational authorities initiate the process setting national parameters 
and standards for implementation by learning institutions. The “bottom-up” method 
describes a process that begins from the educational institutions with societal inputs 
and ends with an endorsement of a national government. A third approach termed 
“hybrid method” is emerging in which the “top-down” and “bottom-up” processes are 
combined for better results.  
The sustainable engineering education community appreciates these complexities 
and upholds the generic and terminological conceptions of pedagogy. Furthermore, 
the notion of curriculum both as a document and a process is adopted. The third 
approach to curriculum development is also frequently suggested in sustainable 
engineering pedagogy. In addition to these conceptual underpinnings, sustainable 
engineering pedagogical frameworks are influenced by variously proposed learning 
outcomes. Using an assortment of didactic resources, suggestions concerning the end 
result of a sustainability education in engineering have been made. Therefore, the 
following sections shall discuss some of the learning outcomes of a sustainable 
engineering education.   
68 
 
Learning Outcomes for Sustainable Engineering 
Learning outcomes are prominent features of modern educational systems. In the 
preamble of most academic subjects, courses, modules and programmes, a section 
on learning outcomes is typically inserted. These are usually statements of the 
expected end result of a learning activity or period. Several learning outcomes have 
been suggested for sustainable engineering education. Some of these propositions 
are contained in the Barcelona Declaration (EESD, 2004) and the publications of 
professional associations and accreditation bodies. 
Barcelona Declaration  
Barcelona Declaration is the outcome of the second EESD Conference in 2004 (see 
Table 3.2). It is arguably the first explicit and exclusive proclamation on sustainable 
engineering education. Premised on the indispensability of HEIs and the need for an 
engineering education response, the Declaration lists 7 proficiencies of a sustainable 
engineer. It states that engineers must be able to: (a) Understand how their work 
interacts with society and the environment, locally and globally, in order to identify 
potential challenges, risks, and impacts (b) Understand the contribution of their work 
in different cultural, social, and political contexts and take those differences into 
account (c) Work in multidisciplinary teams, in order to adapt current technology to the 
demands imposed by sustainable lifestyles, resource efficiency, pollution prevention 
and waste management (d) Apply a holistic and systemic approach to solving 
problems and the ability to move beyond the tradition of breaking reality down into 
disconnected parts (e) Participate actively in the discussion and definition of economic, 
social and technological policies to help redirect society towards more sustainable 
development (f) Apply professional knowledge according to deontological principles 
and universal values and ethics (g) Listen closely to the demands of citizens and other 
stakeholders and let them have a say in the development of new technologies and 
infrastructures. 
In order to deliver these competences, sustainable engineering education must take 
on such qualities as integrated approach to knowledge, attitudes, skills and values in 
teaching. Also, the disciplines of social sciences and humanities must be incorporated 
in engineering education with the promotion of multidisciplinary teamwork. Other 
features required of a sustainable engineering education are critical thinking, creativity, 
69 
 
ability to foster reflection and self-learning as well as systemic thinking. Finally, 
sustainable engineering education must be capable of raising awareness for the 
challenges posed by globalization. The Barcelona Declaration proclaimed that certain 
aspects of educational process should be reviewed including links between different 
levels of the educational systems. There are also issues of course content, teaching 
strategies, teaching and learning techniques, research methods, and staff training. 
Others are evaluation and assessment techniques, external participation in curriculum 
development and evaluation as well as quality control systems (EESD, 2004).  
Professional Associations and Accreditation Bodies 
As already noted, a number of professional associations and accreditation bodies 
developed principles and competences expected of 21st century engineers. The UK 
Engineering Council, for example, states in its third edition of the UK-SPEC that CEng 
should be able to develop solutions to engineering problems using new or existing 
technologies through innovation, creativity, and change. The document further 
requires CEng to demonstrate sustainability competences by being able to contribute 
to building a sustainable society, both present and future. Similarly, they should apply 
professional and responsible judgement and take a leadership role. UK-SPEC further 
requires CEng to do more than just comply with legislation and codes. It is also an 
expectation of CEng to seek multiple views to solve sustainability challenges, manage 
risk to minimise adverse impact to people or the environment, and use resources 
effectively and efficiently. 
In the publication of New Zealand Institution of Professional Engineers, sustainability 
competences for engineers are detailed under the categories of maintaining the 
viability of the planet, providing for equity within and between generations, and solving 
problems holistically. The ideal of holistic problem-solving is expatiated by a couple of 
principles including the need for a systems-based approach, and subordination of 
technology to human needs and ecosystems viability. The American proposition for 
sustainability competency is contained in the criteria document of the Accreditation 
Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET, 2009). Engineering programmes are 
required to demonstrate that students attain an ability to design a system, component, 
or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, 
environmental, social, political, and ethical issues as well as health and safety, 
70 
 
manufacturability, and sustainability. It is also required that students understand 
professional and ethical responsibility and possess the broad education necessary to 
understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, 
and social context.  
Similarly, ICE Task Group mentions such broad requirements as the ability to work 
with complex ill-defined problems, development of teamwork and communications 
skills, and ability to evaluate the merits and demerits of options (ThinkUp, 2011). 
Comparable offers are made by professional bodies in several other nations, such as 
Australia, the Netherlands, etc. (McCormick et al., 2005; Glavič, 2006; Dabipi et al., 
2010; Phuong, 2013). Such involvement of accreditation and professional bodies in 
featuring sustainability competences as learning outcomes incentivises education 
institutions to develop appropriate pedagogies for sustainable engineering.  
Pedagogical Framework for Sustainable Engineering 
HEIs devised various strategies to imbue students with sustainability competences.  
Set to meet the numerous goals of a sustainability education, the strategies ranged 
from whole institutional intervention to curricular modification.  The various sustainable 
engineering education initiatives can be generally described from three dimensions, 
namely model, approach and orientation as summarised in Table 2.4 (Arsat et al., 
2011).  
Model 
In the model dimension are the stand-alone model and the integrated model. Stand-
alone model for an institutional-level change involves the creation of a sustainability 
centre or sustainability institute. Example of this model abounds in many universities 
such as the Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Cambridge, 
Arizona State University’s School of Sustainability and Centre for Sustainable 
Development at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. These centres have been 
established for the purpose of research into sustainability issues. A stand-alone model 
with an objective of curricular modification may be in the form of sustainability module 
or course programme. The course or programme is typically intended to educate about 
sustainability without necessarily integrating into an existing programme. Examples of 
71 
 
a stand-alone model are UCL’s MSc Environment and Sustainable Development15 
domiciled at The Bartlett and MPhil in Engineering for Sustainable Development at 
University of Cambridge16.

The integrated model seeks the embedding or incorporation of sustainability ideals 
into an institution, existing programme or module. Institutionally, a number of 
integrated initiatives subsist. These include amongst others the Integrated University 
Model (see Figure 2.3), Sustainability DNA Model and the Four C Model (see Figure 
2.4) developed in the University of Plymouth, University of Gloucestershire, and 
Technical University of Catalonia (TUC) respectively. While the Four C Model seeks 
the unification of four salient components of a typical HEI in sustainability efforts 
including curriculum, campus, community and culture, the Sustainability DNA Model 
replicates DNA structure to pursue a holistic sustainability competence based on the 
interactions of six elements, namely operations, outreach, student, experience, 
teaching and learning, and research, management and support (Sivapalan, 2015). The 
Integrated University Model is based on a study conducted by some researchers in 
2004 at TUC Barcelona, Spain (Ferrer-Balas et al., 2004). Synergy was sought in the 
areas of research, education, university life, and communication to come up with an 
all-encompassing model.

Figure 2.4. The Four C Model 
(Sivapalan, 2015) 
 
In the integrated model focusing on curricula, sustainability principles are purposefully 
synthesised in courses or programmes. The Applied Sustainability and Public Health 
in Civil Engineering offered at Queens University Canada is an example of such model 
(Arsat et al., 2011). 
Approach 
The ways in which several HEIs have approached sustainability education initiatives 
can be delineated according to the three pillars of sustainability. As presented in Table 
2.5, an approach can be singular, dialectic or consensual based on the dimension of 
sustainability emphasised. These distinctions, however, are most applicable at the 
level of curricular modification. The singular approach describes a situation in which 
one aspect of sustainability is introduced either as a stand-alone course or integrated 
module. An example of a singular approach is the Environmental Systems17 module 
taught to students of UCL’s MSc Environmental Systems Engineering. In this course, 
environmental sustainability is targeted. Environmental Technology18 covered in the 
ABU’s MSc Environmental Management is another example of the singular approach.

Figure 2.3. The Integrated University Model 
(Ferrer-Balas et al 2004) 
73 
 
Interestingly, economic and social dimensions of sustainability are not very popular 
courses in engineering education. Nonetheless, the UCL Institute for Environmental 
Design and Engineering runs a module entitled The Social Dimensions of 
Sustainability19 in the context of environmental design and engineering.  
The dialectic approach results in a programme or module that combines at least two 
sustainability pillars. Courses presented in this format tend to relate either social 
responsibility with economic factors or environmental issues with social impacts within 
an engineering context. This approach is exemplified by MIT’s Economics and 
Environmental Issues in Material Selection20 taught to undergraduate engineering 
students. Similarly, the module Environmental and Resource Economics21 offered by 
MSc Environmental Management and Toxicology students of the Federal University 
of Agriculture in Nigeria exemplifies the dialectic approach. The consensual approach 
seeks development of a course or programme with a full sustainability content. This is 
perhaps the most desirable approach as illustrated by the MIT’s Design for 
Sustainability22; a graduate level course. The course considers sustainability 
implications for engineering practice in relation to the built environment. In terms of the 
practicalities of an intervention approach, Allenby (2012) recommends the use of the 
non-engineering courses. The justification for this suggestion is the fact that a 
sustainable engineering course provides the context of modern engineering practice, 
whereas the traditional management courses are “of little relevance [and] quickly 
forgotten”(Allenby, 2012, p.401).

Orientation 
The orientation dimension characterises intervention based on disciplinary partnership 
with the possible outcomes of interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, cross-disciplinary and 
transdisciplinary orientations. UCL’s MSc Environmental Systems Engineering, which 
combines the disciplines of Environmental Engineering and Systems Engineering, is 
an example of interdisciplinary course. It is noteworthy that sustainable engineering 
inherently demands more than a monodisciplinary focus as already discussed. The 
pillars of sustainability are disciplines in their own right with a rich history of theoretical 
grounding and application. Hence, this orientation category may appear banal. 
However, the categorisation is not utterly misplaced as the tendency of engineering 
disciplines to approach sustainability with the typical silo-based perspective has been 
noticed. An example is given in Gardiner (2010) in which a sustainability module was 
taken by students of Industrial Engineering, and Information and Systems Engineering 
(Arsat et al., 2011). The course proceeded in a monodisciplinary view that failed to 
make connection with wider sustainability concepts such as globalisation, etc. The 
outcome of this orientation was an inadequate sustainability knowledge.   
General Sustainable Higher Education Matrix 
A general matrix to integrate sustainability into HEIs was developed by Rusinko (2010) 
in a review of various options, some of which have already been discussed.

Comprising four options as depicted in Figure 2.5, the matrix classifies the alternatives 
as either discipline-specific or cross-disciplinary. Quadrants I and II are discipline-
specific and tend to have a narrow purview of sustainability principles. On the other 
hand, Quadrants III and IV are cross-disciplinary and cover broader issues. It is 
significant to note that the merit or demerit of options hinges on the extent to which 
the alternatives cover sustainability philosophies and also on their ease of 
implementation. Typically, the discipline-specific quadrants tend to be easily 
implementable but lack broad sustainability scope. In contrast, the cross-disciplinary 
alternatives exhibit robustness and consistency with sustainability ideals but face 
administrative hiccups.  
Summary of Merits and Demerits of the Strategies 
Table 2.6 summarises the merits and demerits of the strategies. Given that flexibility 
is recommended in implementing these strategies, the methods can be sequenced for 
more impactful outcomes.

The Three-Tier Approach 
The three-tier approach is a framework of sustainable engineering education designed 
by the University of Surrey (Azapagic et al., 2005). The approach comprises three 
elements as illustrated in Figure 2.6. The first step towards teaching sustainability to 
engineering students involves lectures and tutorials, which introduce students to the 
basics of sustainable development. Following the lectures are case studies intended 
to expose students to specific and practical sustainability-related issues to enable 
them appreciate engineering for sustainable development. In the third tier of the 
approach, integration of sustainability into the engineering curriculum is undertaken. 
This final tier also covers the overall aspects of engineering education, including 
fundamentals, quantitative methods, tools, and issues of clean technologies as well 
as engineering design. A strength of the three-tier framework is the gradual approach 
to integrating sustainability in the engineering curriculum. Such incremental process 
facilitates engagement with simple techniques before reaching the more complex 
ones.

Sustainable Engineering Learning Process 
Various learning and teaching techniques have been suggested for sustainability 
education. These techniques, which have been informed by the sustainability learning 
outcomes, feature both long-standing and novel methods.  
Lecturing 
Lecturing is a long-standing pedagogical technique that has been around since the 
emergence of universities. It is a mode of knowledge transfer that involves mainly two 
parties: lecturer and students. Lecturing has to do with the oral delivery or presentation 
of an educational material on a particular subject or topic. The definition of lecturing in 
various English dictionaries includes “exposition of a given subject before an 
audience”23 and “a formal talk on a serious subject”24. Derived from the Latin lectura, 
which implies reading, lecturing has evolved to become the most conventional 
instructional method in HEIs. Unfortunately, lecturing technique is gradually losing 
traction as criticisms on the method continue to emerge in the literature (Heywood, 
2005a; Shallcross and Robinson, 2007; Jones, Trier and Richards, 2008). Such 
criticisms usually stress how obsolete, undemocratic and ineffective lecturing has 
become. Additionally, the downsides of lecturing such as long preparatory hours, 
difficulty eliciting and sustaining students’ attention as well as requirements for visual 
and verbal supports are emphasised. Some remedial measures to address the 
deficiencies associated with lecturing have already been initiated. As an example, 
engineering lectures at UCL are interspersed with such activities as seminars, group 
discussions, etc. aimed at engaging students with a view to achieving active and 
student-centred learning. In the context of sustainable engineering education, 
lecturing technique is suitable for introductory sessions on the fundamentals and 
basics of sustainability. Hence, HEIs offering sustainability courses employ lecturing 
technique for such purposes. 
CDIO Initiative 
In October 2000 a worldwide effort dubbed The CDIO Initiative, which is an initialism 
for Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate, was launched. Initially conceived at MIT in 
                                            
23 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lecturing 
24 http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/lecture 
78 
 
the 1990s to reform engineering education, the CDIO project intended to develop and 
codify abilities expected of contemporary engineers. With the aid of a stakeholder 
focus group comprising student, engineering faculty members, and industry 
representatives, the CDIO Syllabus was prepared. The entire CDIO Initiative is guided 
by the understanding that “every graduating engineer should be able to Conceive-
Design-Implement-Operate complex value-added engineering products, processes, 
and systems in a modern, team-based environment” (Crawley et al., 2014, p.12). The 
CDIO Syllabus is divided into four high-level expectations as illustrated in Figure 2.7.  
Figure 2.7. Building blocks for CDIO (CDIO 2010) 
The first level presents the technical knowledge and reasoning expected in modern 
engineering professions. The development of this engineering fundamental prepares 
students to imbibe skills necessary to begin a professional career. This expectation 
however varies widely from one engineering field to another. The next level suggests 
that a mature individual interested in technical endeavours possesses a set of 
personal and professional skills which are central to the practice. In order to work in a 
modern team-based environment, students must have developed the interpersonal 
skills of team work and communication corresponding to the third expectation level. 
Finally, in the fourth level of expectation, a student must understand something of 
conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating systems in the enterprise and 
societal context to be able to actually create products and systems (CDIO, 2010).  
The CDIO approach to educating engineering students is important for sustainability 
education. Coral (2009) mapped sustainability programme outcomes against these 
four levels of CDIO Initiative and came up with a taxonomy of expectations. Featuring 
prominently in this classification are transdisciplinary approaches characterised as 
elements of systems thinking. The personal and professional skills component of the 
CDIO fits with sustainability competences of commitment and understanding of the 
potential impact of new scientific discoveries, and social impact of new technologies 
and innovations. The final level, which is the CDIO, corresponds to the need for 
aesthetics and human factors as well as environmental sustainability in designing. The

and Reasoning

Professional Skills

“operate” subgroup features considerations for end of useful life, disposal options, and 
residual value at life-end. Consequently, employing CDIO technique in the teaching of 
sustainability to engineering students could be very useful.  
Problem-Based Learning 
Problem-based learning (PBL) is one of several pedagogical innovations that arose in 
the 1960s as part of student-centred learning initiatives (Alwi et al., 2012). Educators 
at McMaster University in Canada followed by academics in Maastricht University in 
the Netherlands are credited with the introduction of PBL (Holgaard et al., 2015). The 
approach places problem at the centre of students’ learning and encourages them to 
seek solutions in a self-directed way. Usually working in small groups with teachers 
acting simply as facilitators, students attempt to proffer solutions to a deliberately ill-
defined, ill-structured, and open problem. An essential idea in PBL is that a problem 
is not necessarily expected to be solved but to serve in initiating the learning process 
(Kolmos and De Graaff, 2014). PBL technique is based on the understanding that 
students are not only motivated but attain better comprehension by working on a 
problem that replicates real-life situations. Since its introduction, PBL has been 
implemented in several HEIs across the world. In UCL-run MSc Environmental 
Systems Engineering, PBL is applied in the delivery of modules such as Systems 
Engineering Management, in which students are exposed to problem-solving process.  
PBL as originally conceived at McMaster and Maastricht Universities is guided by the 
following learning principles: (a) Problems form the focus and stimulus of learning (b) 
Problems are the vehicle for development of problem-solving skills (c) New information 
is acquired through self-directed learning (d) Student-centred (e) Small student groups 
(f) Teachers are facilitators/guides. Over the years, these learning principles have 
guided PBL implementations giving students opportunity to work out learning needs 
and to connect learning with the outside world. Increased students’ motivation for 
learning, improved retention rate and higher grades have been reported as benefits of 
PBL technique, although heightened students’ stress tend to occasionally occur 
(Huntzinger and Hutchins, 2007b).  
Somewhat relatedly, Wilkerson and Gijselaers (1996) listed the following three basic 
learning theory principles stressing the constructivist nature of PBL. Firstly, learning is 
a constructive and not a receptive process. Secondly, metacognition affects learning, 
80 
 
and finally, social and contextual factors influence learning. The implication of these 
principles is that cognitive learning alone is inadequate to the development of a PBL 
model. PBL is important in the engineering field as engineers engage in problem-
solving. The interdisciplinary nature of problems means that engineering students 
should be encouraged to use knowledge from different fields for problem analysis and 
problem-solving. Sustainable engineering as already highlighted acknowledges the 
complexity of contemporary engineering challenges; hence, PBL is an invaluable 
technique in sustainable engineering education.  
Project-Based Learning 
Project-based learning (PjBL) is another departure from traditional teaching approach. 
Similar to PBL, PjBL is inspired by the need to engender active learning amongst 
students. Within PjBL framework, knowledge is sought through inquiry usually related 
to students’ experiences of the outside world. Students are assigned projects, and 
mimicking a real work environment, they formulate questions, postulate hypothesis, 
review literature, discuss and critique ideas, and possibly make new discoveries. 
Teachers in the PjBL model usually serve as supervisors. The rationale for such 
approach is rooted in a key learning sciences idea which connects students’ personal 
investment in learning with their engagement in meaningful tasks that replicate real-
world situations (Bell, 2010). A distinction is made between learning that ensues from 
memorisation of discrete facts and the one resulting from meaningful participation in 
context-related tasks. The latter distinction is the hallmark of PjBL.  
Project-based and problem-based learning methods are often conflated not only 
because they share a common “PBL” abbreviation, but also due to the shared feature 
of student-centred approach. The tendency to merge these approaches has led some 
authors to separately abbreviate problem-based learning and project-based learning 
as “pbl” and “PBL” respectively (Krajchick and Blumenfeld, 2006). However, PjBL 
could be adopted as a more convenient abbreviation of project-based learning. 
Notwithstanding the shared aspects between PjBL and PBL, certain dissimilarities 
exist. For instance, PjBL projects culminate in artefacts, realistic products or 
presentations, whilst PBL problems may only serve to initiate the learning process. 
Thomas (2000) lists five criteria for PjBL as follows: (a) Project-based learning projects 
are central, not peripheral to the curriculum (b) Project-based learning projects are 
81 
 
focused on questions or problems that drive students to encounter the central 
concepts and principles of a discipline (c) Projects involve students in a constructive 
investigation (d) Projects are student-driven to some significant degree (e) Projects 
are realistic not school-like.  
Positive feedback has been received from PjBL implementations in various HEIs 
(Gülbahar and Tinmaz, 2006). Students’ communication skills, collaborative abilities, 
and critical as well as creative proficiencies have been observed to improve 
dramatically. Other benefits of the technique include development of positive attitude 
towards learning, problem-solving, confidence, and self-esteem which are essential 
for gaining deeper understanding. However, a drawback of PjBL is that it is a time-
consuming process owing to a series of activities and sessions including selection of 
suitable topics, problem analysis by students, class administration, use of visual aids 
and other cognitive tools (Kolmos and De Graaff, 2014). In spite of these potent 
downsides, PjBL is a popular pedagogical technique as it facilitates the attainment of 
sustainability education learning outcomes and competences. 
Case-Study Method 
Case study is a learning tool employed in both teaching and research. The history of 
case study as a teaching technique extends back to 1870, when a law educator, 
Christopher Langdell, introduced the method at Harvard Law School (Davis and 
Yadav, 2014). Justifying the initiative on the need to prepare law students for real-
world practice, Langdell replicated courtroom scenarios by exposing students to 
original court cases. Through classroom discussions and dialectics students drew their 
own conclusions. This was a complete departure from the hitherto Dwight Method, 
which stressed rote memorisation of legal heuristics, theories, and core principles 
(Breslin and Buchanan, 2008). Following Langdell’s success in case-based teaching, 
Harvard Business School adopted the method in 1920. Over the years, case study as 
a teaching tool made inroads into other disciplines including engineering.  
In engineering, a case is understood as “a written account of an engineering job as it 
was actually encountered”(Davis and Yadav, 2014, p.162). The emphasis of a case-
based pedagogy in engineering is on the real-world context within which engineering 
activities happen. Attention is given to complex factors such as human interaction, 
subtlety of inanimate objects, time constraints and pressure of resources, which may 
82 
 
not be adequately treated in a lecture-based instruction (Davis and Yadav, 2014). The 
objective of case study in engineering education is akin to that of other disciplines, 
which is to expose students to the complexities and ill-structured characteristics of the 
fields that subsist in the gap between theory and practice. The following elements are 
suggested by Merseth (1994) to generally characterise cases: (a) Cases are based on 
real-life events or realistic situations that allow students to experience problems they 
are not likely to encounter first-hand (b) Cases present both contextual and technical 
information that is based on careful research and study (c) Cases may present no 
clear-cut solutions to allow students to develop multiple perspectives.  
In the light of this characterisation, four case study-based teaching approaches have 
been delineated including critical instance case, case problem, state-of-the-art case, 
and case history (Davis and Yadav, 2014). Whilst critical instance case proceeds with 
the provision of background information requiring students to come up with a suitable 
line of action, the case problem presents a problem with a mix of relevant and 
irrelevant data to allow students to practice critical and analytical skills to arrive at a 
justifiable decision. The state-of-the-art case proceeds by acquainting students with 
insights into the edges or frontiers of knowledge or discovery in a field seeking for 
suggestions on advancement. In the case history approach, learners are presented 
with real engineering works detailing project phases, procedures, achievements, 
challenges and mitigating measures (Heywood, 2005b) . Hence, case study is a 
versatile tool suited for a variety of pedagogical purposes. There is already a 
widespread use of this didactic method in sustainable engineering education across 
many HEIs (Dodds and Venables, 2005; Wei et al., 2014).     
UCL Engineering Curriculum 
Engineering has been taught at UCL for almost two centuries. Since UCL founded the 
world’s first laboratory devoted to engineering education in 1827, students have been 
trained in various engineering disciplines (UCL Engineering, no date). Presently, the 
UCL Faculty of Engineering Sciences offers such core engineering programmes as 
biochemical, biomedical, chemical, computer, civil, electronic and electrical, and 
mechanical engineering. Engineering programmes at UCL run for three years, 
culminating in a bachelor’s degree in engineering (BEng). A fourth year is required for 
the award of a master’s degree (MEng). During the three-year period of the BEng 
83 
 
programmes, students undertake engineering courses and training that begin with a 
lesson on the theoretical basis of their chosen disciplines. Also taught in the first year 
are lessons in mathematics and professional skills, which are delivered in shared 
classes with other engineering students as part of the Integrated Engineering 
Programme (IEP). 
The IEP is an innovative integrated pedagogical framework that facilitates the delivery 
of specialist and interdisciplinary engineering education (see Figure 2.8). Within the 
interdisciplinary pedagogy, core engineering disciplines are taught in combination with 
crosscutting subjects, such as design and professional skills, connected systems, 
environmental engineering, and finance and accounting amongst others. An objective 
of the IEP is to produce engineering graduates with a grounding in the fundamentals 
of their chosen disciplines, but also adept at leadership, teamwork, and 
communication skills. As an industry-oriented curriculum, the IEP framework provides 
engineering students with the opportunity to partake in activities that replicate real-
world engineering projects. The IEP is designed such that students register for a core 
discipline, but engage in interdisciplinary exercises alongside the core subjects. 
Students select a set of three IEP minors in the first year that will be taught across the 
second and third years. There are currently 18 IEP minors available to students (see 
Table 2.7). The UCL IEP could be a useful way of delivering sustainability education.

Research in Sustainable Engineering Education 
Research into sustainable engineering education continues to be undertaken within 
diverse contexts and focus. However, the dominant context of such studies has been 
the developed world. There is comparably little research into ESD/EESD in the context 
of a developing world as the reviewed literature shows. Developed countries whose 
sustainability education efforts have been studied include US, UK, Australia, Germany 
and several western European nations. Few studies attempted to bridge this gap by 
focusing on such developing countries as Vietnam and Malaysia. A brief overview of 
these studies is therefore considered. 
Seeking answers to questions about competences, pedagogy and curriculum in 
relation to sustainability education in engineering, Segalas (2009) conducted a 
research involving five European technological universities. The work was a 
Eurocentric effort guided by the provisions of European Higher Education Area 
(EHEA) framework. The European nations covered in the research were Spain, 
Sweden, The Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium, Scotland and England. Sustainability 
competences formulated as a tripartite of knowledge/understanding, skills/abilities, 
and attributes were addressed ab initio as requirements of 21st century engineers. 
Establishing these competences, the research proceeded to analyse how educational 
processes can provide suitable pedagogies to achieve sustainable development 
learning objectives amongst engineering graduates (Coral, 2009).  
The study found that a succinct and unambiguous statement of sustainability 
competences was crucial to sustainable engineering education design. Another vital

finding of the research was that sustainable engineering education needed a multi-
pedagogical active methodology. In this regard, Enquiry Based Learning (EBL) 
strategies such as PjBL, case studies, role play and back-casting were essential. The 
question of curriculum revealed dissonance with the ideal situation in which 
sustainable development is embedded piecemeal and course wise. Lack of 
sustainability comprehension and dearth of top-down and bottom-up collaboration 
contributed to this impasse. The study concluded that this trend must be reversed as 
sustainability education processes are facilitated by an integrated approach involving 
all HEI constituents. Notwithstanding its immense contribution to sustainable 
engineering education and the sustainability education community, Segalas’ research 
is limited by a Eurocentric focus. Consequently, the findings of the investigation may 
not be wholly applicable in a non-Western context.  
In 2013, motivated by the desire to contribute to sustainability education in Vietnamese 
engineering HEIs, AI Phuong (2013) undertook an empirical study with a view to 
achieving this goal. The study intended to build culturally appropriate strategies for 
transforming engineering curriculum in Vietnamese HEIs into a sustainability-focused 
model. Questions formulated by the research focused on Vietnamese response to the 
challenges of sustainable development and the implications for Vietnamese engineers 
as well as the underlying issues of sustainable engineering education transformation 
and development of culturally fitting strategies. The research successfully mapped 
extant sustainability education efforts in Vietnam revealing commendable progress 
manifest in governmental commitment to the erstwhile UNDESD and in a series of 
seminars, conferences and educational policies on sustainability education. An 
important outcome of the research was a framework made up of six components 
including resources, vision, communication, professional support, motivation and 
cooperation (Phuong, 2013).  
Informed by the evidenced-based understanding that “societal cultures, along with 
local economic, political and religious conditions act as mediators and filters to policies 
and practices imported from overseas” (Dimmock and Walker, 2000, p.307), the 
research aligned the framework components with Vietnamese culture. The study also 
found that issues hindering current sustainable engineering education efforts in 
Vietnam were somewhat intertwined with enduring Vietnamese values, attitudes, 
experiences and behavioural preferences. Stakeholders involved in educational 
86 
 
processes including governmental authorities, NGOs, engineering businesses and 
universities variedly contributed to the Vietnamese response and would remain 
invaluable for future progress. The attempt of the research to consider sustainability 
education in a developing world context is quite commendable. However, any effort to 
universalise the findings across all developing nations could be challenged on the 
same grounds of socio-cultural differences. Hence, the research serves as a 
confirmation of the practically consensual position that sustainability education 
intervention is necessarily context-dependent.  
Akin to AI Phuong (2013), Sivapalan’s (2015) research was undertaken within a 
developing world context. The research proceeded by developing thirty sustainable 
development competences from a number sources including publications of Malaysian 
Engineering Accreditation Council and ESD literature. The research employed a case 
study method to explore the views of stakeholders working in a private HEI in Malaysia. 
Areas of specific interest in the research included the extent to which the HEI 
incorporated ESD in its engineering curriculum. Also queried was how to include 
sustainable development programmes and module learning outcomes within the 
undergraduate engineering programmes. The study equally sought to establish the 
need for additional components in a sustainable engineering education framework for 
the undergraduate programmes in the Malaysian HEI (Sivapalan, 2015). 
The findings of the research resulted in the formulation of guidelines for a holistic 
incorporation of sustainable development competences and also in the design of 
whole institution EESD framework. Although the implications of the study’s outcome 
are significant, especially to the Malaysian HEIs, the research’s focus on a single 
university represents an important limitation. It would be difficult to generalise the 
findings of the research without some effort at circumspection. Also, the proposed 
guidelines for the incorporation of sustainable development competences in the 
undergraduate engineering programmes may not be wholly applicable to other 
Malaysian HEIs owing to administrative and other nuances.  
Beringer et al (2008) assessed the status of sustainability efforts in HEIs across 
Atlantic Canada. Their research examined the level of sustainability integration in the 
Canadian HEIs covering curriculum amongst other areas. The assessment used a 
questionnaire to obtain data, which were triangulated with a content analysis. The 
researchers found that the majority of the HEIs had responded positively to 
87 
 
sustainability, with some deficiencies in the aspects of physical operations, staff 
development and student opportunities. The curricular sustainability content ranged 
from minimal to substantial, with three-quarter of the HEIs embedding sustainability 
into traditional disciplines. In a related work, Watson (2013) undertook a content 
analysis of the civil engineering curriculum at Georgia Institute of Technology and 
discovered that the integration of sustainability was biased towards the environmental 
dimension. The findings substantiate the existence of a disproportionate spread of 
sustainability in the curriculum (Byrne et al., 2010; Sinnott and Thomas, 2012; Shields 
et al., 2014). Overall, Watson found a strong evidence of sustainability in the civil 
engineering curriculum.  
In the African context, research into the sustainability content of engineering 
curriculum is scarce (Manteaw, 2012; Akeel et al., 2017). This is not unexpected of a 
region whose HEIs teach sustainability mainly “as a fringe aspect of a limited number 
of disciplines” (UNEP-MESA, 2009, p.20). Manteaw argues that besides the UN-
backed Mainstreaming Environmental Sustainability in African Universities (MESA), 
there is no visible sustainability education programme in West Africa. The studies that 
have considered sustainability learning on the continent have generally reported a low 
sustainability presence in the curriculum (UNEP-MESA, 2009; GUNi et al., 2011; 
UNESCO, 2014; Etse and Ingley, 2016). In Ghana, Etse and Ingley studied a 
polytechnic programme and discovered that sustainability courses were largely absent 
from the curriculum. Social sustainability appeared more than the environmental and 
economic themes. Contrastingly, in a case study of Rhodes University in South Africa, 
Togo (2009) discovered that sustainability had permeated teaching, research, and 
operations of the university. Although it did not feature engineering courses, the study 
found the sustainability content of the programmes to range from nil (accounting) to 
high (environmental sciences).   
A research which sought to answer the question of how much engineering students 
know about sustainable development was undertaken in 2005 by Azapagic et al 
(2005). The study proceeded as a world-wide survey of engineering students inquiring 
about their level of knowledge and understanding of environmental and sustainable 
development issues. Justifying the study on the need to facilitate the integration of 
sustainable development in the engineering curriculum, the authors designed a web-
based, self-completion questionnaire. The appraisal was prefaced and contextualised 
88 
 
as an environmental and sustainable development study. Using a four-point Likert 
scale (not heard of, heard of but could not explain, have some knowledge, know a lot), 
the engineering students were asked to rate their knowledge of a range of topics 
including environmental legislation, standards, policy, technology, tools, approaches 
and sustainable development. The link to the survey was sent out to several 
universities around the world.  
The outcome of the study was that engineering students largely exhibited a low level 
of sustainability knowledge. The research also suggested that much more effort was 
needed to educate engineering students on sustainable development. An interesting 
insight from the study was that, on average, the students were comparatively more 
aware of environmental issues than they were of social and economic sustainability. 
Interestingly, the students indicated strong personal relevance and professional 
importance of sustainability issues. However, the study had some limitations. Although 
it had ambitiously sought the participation of several engineering students across the 
world, the survey was responded to by students mainly from universities in Europe 
and America. Not a single African university was involved in the study as surveys sent 
to HEIs in that region were not returned. Moreover, there was an overrepresentation 
of chemical engineering students, who constituted 75% of the respondents. Thus, 
conclusions from the study, even though invaluable, must be done cautiously.  
In 2014, Zwickle et al (2014) assessed the sustainability literacy of the undergraduate 
students at The Ohio State University. Over 1,000 students participated in the web-
based and campus-wide survey, which featured 16 multiple-choice questions covering 
the three sustainability domains – economy, environment, and society. Being campus-
wide, the test involved students from several academic disciplines including the 
engineering sciences, although this was not explicitly categorised. One of the 
objectives of the test, according to the researchers, was to quantify the students’ 
knowledge of sustainability, both as a broad and an abstract concept. The featured 
questions encompassed the fundamental ideas of sustainability as represented in 
each of the three sustainability pillars. Since the test was administered in the US, some 
of the questions were necessarily US-specific. The test results were reported as mean 
percentages of student responses to the multiple-choice questions. 
The study discovered that an average of 69% of the students answered the questions 
correctly. Across the three sustainability domains, a significant majority (>70%) of the 
89 
 
students answered the environmental and economic questions correctly. Only about 
three-fifths of the students responded correctly to the social questions. An interesting 
question that enquired about the function of the ozone layer returned over 90% correct 
responses. Contrastingly, a question that sought the most commonly used definition 
of economic sustainability was answered correctly by just 46% of the students. Across 
class rank, the results showed that the performance of freshmen on the test was lower 
than that of the sophomores and juniors. A surprising finding reported by Zwickle et al 
was that aeronautical engineering students perfomed better than the rest of the 
students. Although the study represents an important contribution to sustainability 
education, it could have extended the literacy test to the educators. This would have 
provided an insight into how the educators compared with the students.  
Summary 
Sustainability is conceived as a state of affairs in which the needs of the present 
generation are met without undermining the potential of future generations to meet 
their needs. To educate a society for sustainability, the aims for which education has 
been sought are illuminating. Three educational aims in society have been for 
salvation, for the state, and for progress. Whilst education for salvation considers the 
acquisition of knowledge as a preparation for an afterlife, education for the state is 
basically intended for values such as social cohesion, patriotism, nationalism, and 
even, imperialism. Education for progress focuses on materialistic advancement with 
emphasis on personal fulfilment and economic satisfaction. Sustainability education 
evolved through a series of declarations and conventions within a milieu constituted 
by the educational aims. This chapter provided a brief historical account of the concept 
of sustainability. Based on insights from the three educational aims, the chapter 
highlighted the purposes for which sustainability education evolved. Some fifteen 
sustainability education declarations were reviewed and the resultant sustainability 
education construct was critiqued.  
Sustainable engineering education is a moral and intellectual strategy devised by the 
engineering education community to address sustainability. The rise of sustainable 
engineering education was accelerated through various declarations and conferences 
especially UNDESD and Barcelona Declaration. EESD-Observatory was formed to 
relentlessly pursue and monitor implementation of sustainable engineering education 
90 
 
globally. This chapter detailed the various pedagogical frameworks employed in 
teaching and learning about sustainable engineering clarifying the conceptions of 
pedagogy and curriculum. Learning outcomes of sustainable engineering education 
recommended in the Barcelona Declaration and publications of some professional 
associations and bodies were discussed.  
The chapter further highlighted the ways sustainable engineering has been introduced 
in HEIs around the world. In addition, some learning and teaching techniques such as 
lecturing, CDIO initiative, PBL, PjBL, and case-study methods were explained as vital 
constituents of a sustainable engineering pedagogy. The chapter equally reviewed 
some research works in sustainable engineering education and noted how 
sustainability studies have been skewed towards the developed world. Sustainability 
research in the context of the developing world is gradually increasing but 
universalising the research findings across the developing nations is a formidable 
challenge. The next chapter explores the prospect of sustainable engineering 
education research in Nigeria.

Introduction 
 
The purpose of this chapter is to review sustainability initiatives in Nigeria in relation 
to engineering education in the country. It seeks to establish from the literature the 
status of Nigerian sustainable engineering education. An important guide of the review 
is what Nigeria has accomplished so far in the implementation of sustainability 
education. The chapter highlights engineering practice in Nigeria before outlining the 
Nigerian educational system. Thereafter, sustainable development efforts in Nigeria 
including sustainability education initiatives are considered.

Country Overview 
Nigeria (Figure 3.1) is an important African country with a population of over 180 million 
people and a landmass in excess of 900,000 square kilometre (UNdata, 2016). The 
country is ranked 152 out of 188 countries in terms of human development. With a HDI 
value of 0.527, Nigeria is considered a low human development country (UNDP, 
2016b). Table 3.1 presents Nigeria’s HDI trends from 2005 to 2010, showing a 13% 
increase in the HDI value. Furthermore, Nigeria’s life expectancy at birth rose by 4.4 
years, whilst mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling increased by 
0.8 and 1 year respectively. Based on the most recent data (UNDP, 2016a), the 
multidimensional poverty index for Nigeria is 0.279, with more than half  (51%) of the 
population being multidimensionally poor. An additional 18.4% are estimated to live 
near multidimensional poverty (NBS, 2010). However, Nigeria has increasingly shown 
commitment to improving its national circumstances.

An oil-rich country and a former British colony, Nigeria has, over the years, played 
significant roles within the African continent and the global arena. Nigeria is a signatory 
to several sustainability-related treaties including Kyoto Protocol, Basel Convention, 
Stockholm Convention and Abuja Sustainability Declaration amongst several others. 
The performance of Nigeria on the sustainable development dashboard of 2016 varied 
across the indicators ranging from being in the top third category to being amongst the 
bottom third performers (UNDP, 2016). In particular, Nigeria is grouped in the bottom 
third category for renewable energy consumption, external debt stock, population in 
multidimensional poverty and government’s spending on research and development. 
The country is in the top third category in terms of change in forest area, old age 
dependency ratio, and freshwater withdrawals. Nigeria’s performance is categorised 
under the middle third group for carbon dioxide emission per capita and adjusted net 
savings. Largely, Nigeria is ranked 141 out of 149 countries on the SDG Index (Sachs 
et al., 2016). 
As a vibrantly developing economy, Nigeria relentlessly engages in engineering and 
industrial activities. Since the colonial era, Nigeria has witnessed spiralling engineering 
infrastructural developments including the development of the Ajaokuta steel plant, 
establishment of crude oil refineries, construction of roads and railways, and building 
of houses and other civil infrastructures. These activities are generally geared towards 
enhancing the socioeconomic conditions of Nigerians. The country’s HEIs have 
contributed immensely to the engineering efforts by producing engineers annually to 
occupy important engineering posts across the country. However, given the difficulty 
associated with the trade-off between socioeconomic needs and environmental 
consumption, engineering sustainability in Nigeria may be constrained. Therefore, to 
94 
 
what extent is sustainability instruction part of the Nigerian engineering education 
becomes a pertinent question. With its ratification of several sustainability pacts, it is 
imperative to evaluate the consideration of these pledges in the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum.  
Engineering in Nigeria 
Like many of its other tools of modernity, engineering in Nigeria evolved as a 
necessary outcome of colonialism. Engineering activities were undertaken to facilitate 
and advance the goals of colonial government centred around governing Nigerian 
territories to expand commerce and promote progress and civilisation (Falola and 
Heaton, 2008). Accordingly, road and railroad construction, provision of water supply, 
waste management, mining, dredging, housing, electrical and mechanical works 
featured prominently amongst recurrent engineering projects in colonial Nigeria. The 
establishment of Public Works Department (PWD) by the southern Lagos government 
in 1896 institutionalised engineering practice in the colony (Ojiako, 1986). PWD Lagos, 
which comprised three units, namely civil, mechanical and electrical, was tasked with 
addressing engineering problems in the colonial region. Similar PWD outfits were 
established by the other regional governments of Northern and Eastern Nigeria after 
independence in 1960.   
The engineering legacy bequeathed to Nigeria by the British continued without much 
change. Indigenisation efforts progressed very slowly as British and other foreign 
engineers continued to direct various engineering works across the country. Over the 
years, Nigeria began to take full ownership of engineering practice in the country. 
Professional associations emerged including Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), 
Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN), and the Nigerian 
Academy of Engineering (NAE). These bodies severally acted as consultants to 
successive Nigerian governments and to the academia broadening the purview of 
engineering knowledge and ensuring professionalism. Engineering practice in Nigeria 
currently occurs within the structure of governmental regulation and professional 
associations’ guidance. Only registered engineers are permitted by law to practice 
engineering in Nigeria. Presently, there are some 30 engineering fields approved and 
practised in Nigeria (BMAS, 2014). 
95 
 
Education in Nigeria 
Education in Nigeria has had a chequered history. Depending on the chronological 
thinking adopted, Nigeria’s educational history has been traced to as far back as the 
appearance of Nok culture circa 1000BCE. Archaeological finds of the Nok civilisation 
such as Louvre (Figure 3.2) and Rider and Horse (Figure 3.3) are presented as partial 
evidence of Nok people’s informal and familial system of knowledge transfer. Such 
model is said to have endured for millennia amongst the various ethno-nations that 
eventually formed present-day Nigeria. Other historical sources not given to grandiose 
metanarratives begin the story of Nigeria’s education in the early 19th century with the 
arrival of Christian missionaries. This version refers to English classes held at the 
palaces of chiefs or obas with the sole aim of proselytising locals as the roots of 
Nigerian educational system. These classes later expanded into full blown schools 
teaching other Western educational subjects. Aided by colonial government, Christian 
missionary schools were continually established across the southern region until 
Nigeria gained independence in 1960.  
    
Figure 3.3. Nok Rider & Horse 
       
Regardless of the historical lens employed, Nigeria, in the wake of its independence 
from Britain, had an educational system modelled on the English framework. Since the 
1960s, successive Nigerian administrations have made efforts to modify the colonial 
educational legacy for effective and meaningful outcomes. The country went from the 
year-based 7-5-2-3 system25 in 1960 to 6-3-3-4 system26 in 1977. The 9-3-4 system27

HEIs grew from only two technical colleges in 1944 to a total of 160 in 2018, comprising 
40 federal universities, 46 state universities and 74 private universities (NUC, 2018). 
Several engineering programmes are offered in most of these HEIs. Today, Nigeria’s 
Federal Ministry of Education (FME) has the mandate to formulate, coordinate and 
oversee enactment of national educational policies. The current educational system in 
Nigeria consisting of basic primary education, junior secondary education, and senior 
secondary and tertiary education is depicted in Figure 3.4.

Educating Nigerian Engineers 
The pathway to a professional engineering career in Nigeria begins with a university 
degree. Initial move towards educating Nigerians in the technical field was in the form 
of two technical colleges of Yaba Technical Institute (now Yaba College Technology) 
and Technical Institute Kaduna (now Kaduna Polytechnic) established in 1948 and 
1958 respectively. However, engineering education in the modern sense debuted in 
Nigeria in 1961 when College of Engineering, (now Faculty of Engineering) was 
created at the newly established University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) in Enugu. Other 
engineering faculties were subsequently established in 1962 at University College 
Ibadan, now University of Ibadan (UI), and Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria. 
These efforts to educate indigenous engineers who had hitherto been trained 
overseas added complexity to an incipient educational system.  
Educational policies episodically formulated by FME contributed in shaping the route 
to an engineering career. Students desiring to study any engineering field are required 
to take such science subjects as mathematics, physics, and chemistry at senior 
secondary level. A minimum of credit score in these subjects and in two others 
including English Language at the West African Examination Council-conducted 
examinations or the national equivalent is mandatory. Initially modelled on the British 
system that operates a 3-year engineering programme, engineering degree in Nigeria 
is now acquired over a 5-year period. General physical and chemical science subjects 
accompanied by one or two social science subjects including Use of English are taught 
to first- and second-year engineering students. Students are progressively exposed to 
the core of their chosen disciplines over the next three years. 
 A compulsory industrial work experience scheme is sandwiched in the engineering 
programme. In the final year of their programme, engineering students undertake a 
research project either individually or collaboratively under the supervision of an 
academic. A Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Technology in Engineering is 
typically awarded upon a successful completion of the 5-year programme. Engineering 
education in Nigeria has, however, been often criticised for producing unemployable 
graduates. Some of the reasons usually adduced for this undesirable outcome include 
disproportionate theoretical content, lack of funding, poor curriculum development, 
inadequate staff and inexpert teaching.   
98 
 
The theoretical content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum is considered higher 
than its practical element. As a colonial legacy that has not been significantly modified, 
the engineering curriculum in Nigeria retains a disproportionate amount of conceptual 
engineering sciences subjects. The attempt to correct this aberration through the 
mandatory industrial work training has not yielded the desired effect as student 
placement opportunities are scarce. Despite the fact that engineering activities are 
continuously undertaken across the country, Nigeria is largely unindustrialised, which 
limits the industrial training chances of the engineering students. A way around this 
constraint is a governmental policy that compels all engineering contracting firms 
operating in Nigeria to provide internship to the students. Additionally, it would be 
imperative to review the dominant teacher-centred pedagogy by introducing some of 
the various forms of enquiry-based learning.  
An oft-repeated challenge of engineering education in Nigeria is inadequate funding. 
This problem is, however, not unique to the Nigerian engineering education. Generally, 
the funding of education in Nigeria has been poor (Akinsanya, 2013). Although the 
UNESCO recommends the devotion of at least 15-20% of annual public resources to 
education (UNESCO, 2015), the Nigerian government has hardly ever exceeded 12% 
of its yearly expenditure on education (Mathew, 2016). Such budgetary allocation is 
insufficient for the provision of quality education in a country with no less than 160 
universities (NUC, 2018). The delivery of a praxis-oriented engineering education in 
Nigeria requires the provision of standard engineering laboratories as well as servicing 
the opportunity cost of labour, such as salaries and allowances.  
Inadequate staffing also constrains the provision of high quality engineering education 
in Nigeria. The stipulated student-staff ratio for any engineering programme in Nigeria 
is 15:1 (BMAS, 2014). However, studies have shown that the majority of engineering 
education institutions across the country do not fulfil this requirement (Afonja et al., 
2005; Onwuka, 2009; Akintola et al., 2016). There are instances in which a university 
exceeded the stipulated ratio by a factor of four (Saint et al., 2003). Related to staffing 
problem is the issue of inexpert teaching. The challenges of inadequate staff and 
inexpert teaching are a fallout of poor funding. With sufficient financial resources 
available to higher education, more staff can be employed. Furthermore, educator 
training through participation in teacher training courses, doctoral programmes, and 
international conferences can be undertaken more frequently.

Sustainability Issues in Nigeria 
Nigeria’s interest in sustainability-related issues was piqued by an environmental 
disaster in 1987. In the wet season of that year, it became evident that about 4000 
tonnes of toxic waste originated from Italy had been dumped in Koko, Delta State. The 
Koko incident prompted the enactment of Federal Environmental Protection Agency 
(FEPA) Decree and the Harmful Waste Decree in 1988. The Harmful Waste Act 
proscribed dumping and trafficking in toxic wastes across Nigerian territorial 
boundaries including its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The FEPA Decree led to the 
formation of Nigeria’s environmental agency tasked with the overall protection and 
management of the environment. In 1999, the Federal Ministry of Environment 
(FMEnv) was established to coordinate all environmental matters including the 
episodic draft of National Environmental Policy (NEP). FEPA, which metamorphosed 
into National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency 
(NESREA) in 2007, was subsumed by FMEnv. With a vision “to ensure a Nigeria that 
develops in harmony with the environment”, FMEnv has since inception been active 
in a number of sustainable development efforts (FMEnv, 2016). 
Although Nigeria does not yet have an exclusive policy on sustainable development, 
it, nevertheless, encapsulates some sustainability ideals within its NEP. In the 
preamble of the 1999 FMEnv-drafted NEP, the principle of intergenerational equity is 
not only stated as an underlying philosophy but expatiated by a verbatim quotation of 
the Brundtland sustainable development definition (FMEnv, 1999). Similarly, 
sustainability-related promulgations and regulations have steadily been issued to 
cover diverse themes such as Endangered Species Act 2004, EIA Act 2004, and 
Mineral Oil Safety Regulations. Others are Guidelines on Pesticides Management, 
Ozone Layer Protection Regulations, Solid Waste Management Policy and National 
Policy Guidelines on Food Sanitation. Currently, Domestication of the Kyoto Protocol, 
Climate Change Agency, Forestry and Review of the Ozone Depleting Substances 
(ODS) Bills are being processed by the Federal Ministry of Justice (FMEnv, 2016). It 
is instructive to note that these regulations are skewed towards the environmental 
dimension of sustainability.  
Sustainable development concerns in Nigeria have followed the typical sustainability 
ideas’ pattern of percolation into societies in which social and economic dimensions 
100 
 
are preceded by the environmental component. This, perhaps, accounts for the 
emphasis of environmental sustainability in the NEP and other national regulations. 
Nonetheless, following its participation at UNCED 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Nigeria 
attempted to implement the outcome of the summit by drafting Nigeria’s Agenda 21. 
Guided by the proposals of the Earth Summit, Nigeria’s Agenda 21 contextualised 
such sustainable development ideals as provision of sustainable human settlements 
and poverty alleviation which correspond to social and economic sustainability. In 
response to the emergence of MDGs in 2000 which amongst other equally important 
goals set to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger within 15 years, Nigeria created 
the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on MDGs (OSSAP-MDGs). 
The OSSAP-MDGs was charged with liaison, implementation and coordination of the 
global millennium development agenda as well as supervision of MDG-related projects 
across the country (Uneze et al., 2016). 
The expiration of MDGs in 2015 ushered in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development comprising 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nigeria was 
one of the 193 UN member states that endorsed the SDGs. However, concrete 
measures to attain these ambitious developmental goals are yet to be implemented in 
Nigeria. Interestingly, the performance of Nigeria on the superannuated MDGs has 
been assessed as unimpressive by various independent studies (WGI, 2014; Uneze 
et al., 2016). Given the abysmal outcome of Nigeria’s MDGs efforts, speculations are 
rife that the SDGs may not fare any better. Some critical factors arguably responsible 
for the country’s poor performance on the MDGs include inadequate funding, poor 
governance and weak institutions, and insufficient technological capacity (Uneze et 
al., 2016). Blame has also been laid on the failure of the Nigerian government to design 
a holistic policy and institutional framework that will merge extant planning agencies 
and offices. National SDGs agenda call for the creation of a single government agency 
under which extant planning agencies and offices must be subsumed.  
Sustainability Education in Nigeria 
Following the pattern of its sustainability experience, Nigerian sustainability education 
arose in the form of environmental education. This has remained the dominant 
conception of sustainability education in Nigeria. The mention of education in several 
sustainable development-related documents such as Nigeria’s Agenda 21, NEP and 
101 
 
Nigeria Vision 20:202028 is either in reference to “education for all” or to an 
environmental education. Given such impression of sustainability education, Nigerian 
educational system has responded with chiefly environment-related courses and 
instructions. Lessons on such environmental subjects as natural resources, public 
health economics, environmental sanitation, and pollution amongst several others 
permeate primary educational curricula. In the secondary schools, students are 
introduced to more advanced environmental issues including waste and land pollution, 
climate change, ecology and water pollution. 
The permeation of environmental education into HEIs in Nigeria engendered a number 
of professional degree programmes with Environmental Engineering, Environmental 
Management, Environmental Technology and Environmental Resources Management 
covered within engineering education. Sixteen Nigerian universities presently offer 
these courses (JAMB, 2017). Sustainability education in the form of ESD or EESD has 
not gained much recognition in the Nigerian educational system. In spite of its 
ratification of the 2009 Abuja Declaration which sought mainstreaming sustainability 
education into African HEIs, Nigeria has no explicit sustainable higher education 
framework. There is apparently no Nigerian HEI that offers a strictly sustainability 
degree, course or module29. This absence of purposefully designed sustainability 
programmes in Nigerian HEIs has also been suggested by MESA study in 2004 and 
UNDESD Final Report in 2014. MESA conducted a baseline study in several African 
countries including Nigeria and concluded that sustainability education “was slow to 
evolve in Africa” owing to the continent’s other countless post-colonial challenges 
(Thakran, 2004). UNDESD Final Report suggests that “sustainable development is 
only an emerging interest among African HEIs” (UNESCO, 2014). 
The prospect of an accelerated uptake of context-relevant sustainability education in 
Nigeria has equally not been realised even with the existence of UN-established 
Regional Centres of Expertise (RCE) on ESD. Developed following the start of 
UNDESD in 2005, the concept of RCE features formal, non-formal, and informal 
educational systems in the promotion of ESD. In Nigeria, RCEs are located in Kano, 
Minna, Port-Harcourt and Lagos. Although appreciable progress has been made in

102 
 
terms of the informal and non-formal components of ESD by the RCEs, the formal 
element is inadequately attended to. Contributing to this undesirability is the failure of 
the RCEs to successfully network with Nigerian HEIs thereby fragmenting the ESD 
initiative. Renewed networking efforts are required to mainstream sustainability 
education into HEIs in Nigeria. An important means of achieving such nexus is through 
FME, FMEnv and other HEIs stakeholders including COREN and National Universities 
Commission.  
Summary 
Engineering education and sustainability in Nigeria are as yet not properly aligned. 
Engineering has been practised in Nigeria since the colonial era manifest in road and 
railroad construction, dredging, and water supply amongst others to facilitate imperial 
expansionism. At independence in 1960, Nigeria inherited an educational system 
modelled on the British standard within which emerged its engineering education 
framework. Little has changed about the Nigerian engineering education model. The 
imperative of sustainability education suggests a complex dimension for Nigerian 
engineering education. In spite of being a signatory to several sustainability pacts and 
the experience of an environmental disaster, Nigeria’s response to sustainability is 
somewhat inchoate.  
This chapter discussed the Nigerian sustainability experience and how the country’s 
responses have failed to permeate the HEIs especially engineering programmes. It 
pointed out that even though some thirty engineering fields are presently practised 
and taught in Nigeria, less than five courses are environmental studies. Sustainability 
education in the form of ESD/EESD is virtually non-existent in Nigerian HEIs. The 
chapter stressed the findings of MESA study and UNDESD report as corroboratory 
evidence of the slow uptake of ESD/EESD in Nigeria. The need to galvanise HEIs 
stakeholders by the RCEs was emphasised. Generally, the chapter presented an 
important argument for the present study.

Research Questions 
1. What is the current level of sustainability knowledge of the Nigerian engineering 
community? 
2. What is the sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum? 
3. What sustainability education interventions are appropriate for the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum?  
The methodology for addressing the above research questions benefited from the 
emerging studies of sustainability assessment in higher education. The next section 
presents a review of approaches in assessing sustainability education in HEIs. 
Assessing Sustainability Education  
Sustainability assessment has been undertaken since the emergence of sustainability.  
Across different organisations, assessment tools have been developed to evaluate 
various sustainability initiatives. In higher education, sustainability assessments have 
generally focused on the customary HEI functions of education, research, community 
outreach, and university operation (Lozano and Lozano, 2014). The education 
component of these evaluations usually features curricular assessments vis-a-vis 
sustainability content, sustainability literacy, and sustainability learning process.   
Sustainability Content 
The assessment of a curriculum for sustainability content has usually been conducted 
as part of a systematic evaluation with the aid of methodical assessment tools or 
administration of a stakeholder survey. However, what qualifies as sustainability 
content is not readily intelligible as the concept of sustainability itself is highly fluid as 
already established in the literature. Nonetheless, the point of departure for most 
sustainability evaluators is the use of expert-derived sustainability themes. Some of 
the theme-based assessment tools that have been developed by various researchers 
include the Auditing Instrument for Sustainability in Higher Education (AISHE), 
Assessing Responsibility In Sustainable Education (ARISE), Graphical Assessment 
for Sustainability in Universities (GASU), and Sustainability Tool for Assessing 
Universities Curricula Holistically (STAUNCH).   
105 
 
AISHE is an assessment tool that was originally developed by the Dutch Committee 
on Sustainable Higher Education. The first version of the instrument designed in 2001 
was reviewed in 2012 into AISHE 2012 by a HEI certification organisation dubbed 
Hobéon (Caeiro et al., 2013). The AISHE 2012 framework is made up of four 
categories, namely objectives, people and resources, education, and results (see 
Appendix I). Sustainability assessments in HEIs based on AISHE 2012 are premised 
on these four categories across five stages of development, namely activity-oriented, 
process-oriented, system-oriented, chain-oriented, and society-oriented phases. The 
outcome of an AISHE 2012 audit is typically a verdict on the level of sustainability 
integration in an educational institution (Caeiro et al., 2013). The process of an AISHE 
2012 audit is consensus-building and involves a programme representative group with 
at least two AISHE auditors. The focus of the instrument on a single educational 
programme, abstract criteria and its dependence on representative groups are cited 
as drawbacks (Shriberg, 2002). Assessment of curricular sustainability content in 
AISHE 2012 is covered under the education module and is basically a subjective 
criterion-based process.  
ARISE seeks to evaluate the sustainability and social responsibilities of HEIs. It is an 
instrument developed in response to educational institutions’ need to manage and 
assess sustainability issues holistically. Hence, the purview of the ARISE tool is 
organisational typically covering an entire institution (Caeiro et al., 2013). Eleven 
themes featured in the ARISE instrument include vision and mission, policy, education, 
research, and service to society (see Appendix II). Others are operations/planet, 
operations/people, operations/prosperity, students, professional field, and culture 
(Caeiro et al., 2013). These subjects are based on the international guideline for social 
responsibility of organisations, ISO 26000. ARISE audit proceeds with a documentary 
scrutiny by an appointed audit panel which undertakes site visits. Three possible 
outcomes of an ARISE assessment are “committed”, “recognised”, and “excellent”, 
which describe the stage of a sustainability initiative in an educational institution. The 
education element of ARISE assesses the sustainability content of a curriculum in an 
inexplicit manner deferring to the audit panel’s impression on some generic 
statements. This is considered a deficiency of the ARISE assessment tool. 
GASU (see Appendix III) was developed as a modification of the Global Reporting 
Initiative Sustainability Guidelines intended to guide environmental, economic and 
106 
 
social performance of organisations (Lozano, 2006). GASU aimed to adapt these 
guidelines for use in HEIs by adding an educational dimension. GASU is a graph-
based assessment tool that facilitates the comparison of sustainability efforts between 
educational institutions. The instrument makes use of indicators scaled from 0 to 4 to 
automatically generate nine charts across the three sustainability pillars (environment, 
economy, and society) and the additional educational dimension (Lozano, 2006). The 
strength of GASU in being an indicator-based tool benefits organisations by ensuring 
consistency, which is vital for comparison and benchmarking. Nonetheless, the 
evaluation of sustainability content of a curriculum with the GASU instrument is not 
without limitations due to the added complexity of the educational dimension. To 
accommodate the educational component certain curricular-relevant themes such as 
competency and learning outcomes have been overlooked.   
STAUNCH® (Sustainability Tool for Assessing Universities Curricula Holistically) is an 
education assessment tool developed in 2007 to benchmark the extent of a university 
curriculum’s coverage of sustainability ideas (Lozano and Lozano, 2014). STAUNCH® 
analyses sustainability content of curricula by examining syllabi or course descriptors 
(including course aims and outlines) as data source based on 40 sustainability topics 
across economic, social, environmental and crosscutting dimensions. This implies that 
result accuracies are contingent on the credibility of the course information available 
and that unpublished course information cannot be captured. Nonetheless, the 
assessment tool has proved quite useful in sustainability education research in a 
growing number of HEIs including all universities in Wales and two universities in 
England30. An important strength of the STAUNCH® tool is its focus on the curriculum.  
An operational definition of sustainability content adopted in the present study is the 
spread or coverage of sustainability topics or themes in a curriculum stressing the 
interconnection of environment, economy, and society along with the multidimensional 
problem-solving strategies for addressing sustainability challenges. None of the 
reviewed sustainability assessment tools perfectly matches this working definition 
excepting the STAUNCH®. The sustainability topics featured in the STAUNCH® tool 
seem adaptable for the purposes of the present study in line with the above operational 
definition.

Sustainability Literacy 
Sustainability literacy has been defined variously in the literature. A number of scholars 
delineate sustainability literacy in terms of “skills, attitudes, competences, dispositions 
and values” necessary for delivering a sustainable world (Stibbe, 2010). The global 
non-profit consultancy, Forum for the Future, explains that a sustainability literate 
person should “understand the need for change to a sustainable way of doing things, 
individually and collectively”. Furthermore, such a person should “have sufficient 
knowledge and skills to decide and act in a way that favours sustainable development”. 
Further, sustainability literacy should enable one “to recognise and reward other 
people’s decisions and actions that favour sustainable development” (Parkin et al., 
2004, p.9). Another contribution to the definitional question of sustainability literacy 
describes it as “knowledge, skills and understanding required to fashion a more 
sustainable future” (Vare and Blewitt, 2010). Definitions of sustainability literacy 
emphasise both knowledge and skills. However, the most common instrument 
employed to test sustainability literacy is in the form of a quiz and focus on knowledge. 
Most sustainability literacy tests feature a set of multiple choice questions as typified 
in the Assessment of Sustainability Knowledge (ASK) developed by the Ohio State 
University in conjunction with the University of Maryland (Zwickle et al., 2013). ASK 
contains 16 multiple choice questions about wide-ranging global sustainability issues 
as well as matters of contextual relevance to the United States. An important 
distinction of the ASK instrument is its focus on factual knowledge as opposed to 
beliefs and values. The questions on ASK are expert-derived involving contributions 
of academics from various disciplines. For its several utilisations, the instrument was 
deployed online aided by the SurveyMonkey software package (Zwickle et al., 2014). 
Some constraints of the ASK tool are related to the conventional limitations of multiple 
choice questions and the inapplicability of the tool in other national contexts. Also, the 
ASK instrument assesses foundational knowledge and not necessarily literacy at the 
levels of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.  
An effort to evaluate sustainability knowledge worldwide yielded the first international 
sustainability literacy test dubbed The Sulitest (Carteron and Decamps, 2017). The 
Sulitest is an online multiple choice questionnaire divided into three modules: core, 
specialised (and customised), and surveys (Figure 4.1). The core module features 30 
questions of common relevance to all countries, whilst 20 questions are contained in 
108 
 
the specialised module covering national, regional, and cultural contexts. Provision is 
made in the customised module to allow organisations or firms set context-relevant 
questions. An optional anonymous survey is appended at the end of each session to 
gather demographic information and ask sustainability education questions. The 
development of the Sulitest benefited from inputs of reputed sources in the 
sustainability research community. The tool is supported by the UN and has so far 
been used by at least 612 educational institutions from around the world (Sulitest, 
2016). To partake in the test, an institution must register on the Sulitest website and 
appoint a representative known as the Focal Point. An examiner is also chosen by the 
institution to set the customised questions. Students can only take the test after 
accessing a code generated by the examiner. Some limitations of Sulitest commonly 
cited are questionnaire length, overrepresentation of some countries, and inherent 
constraints of multiple choice questions.

Sustainability Learning Process 
Sustainability learning process, as reviewed in Chapter Two, features numerous 
pedagogical techniques including lecturing and a variety of enquiry-based learning 
approaches, such as PBL, PjBL, and case-study. Jowitt (2004) argues that given the 
well-known pressures on engineering curriculum, the focus of sustainability education 
should be on the learning process and not necessarily on the content. The crux of 
Jowitt’s argument is that sustainability is consistent with systems thinking and should, 
therefore, be mainstreamed into engineering education targeting the “inculcation of an 
appropriate habit of mind, attitudes, and systems skills” (p.87). To produce protean 
and sustainability literate engineers of the future, the engineering learning process 
must be amenable to the use of case-studies, studio-based, issue-driven, process-
based, team-based, and design/delivery focused (Jowitt, 2004). However, Jowitt 
concedes that the use of these enquiry-based learning methods could be augmented 
with some content that will aid the development of appropriate levels of awareness, 
skills and knowledge.  
In terms of sustainability awareness, Jowitt explains that the objective is to develop an 
orientation to engineering problems in the context of environmental, economic and 
social issues. The skills component should cover collaborative abilities as well as an 
ability to assess the advantages and disadvantages of alternatives and to deal with 
complex and ill-defined problems. The characteristics of the knowledge aspect are 
broadness, depth, and technicality amongst others (ThinkUp, 2011). An interesting 
way the enquiry-based learning approach can be utilised in a sustainability education 
research is through a workshop. Workshop typically involves an ensemble of people 
gathered to learn, acquire new knowledge or undertake an innovative problem-solving 
(Ørngreen and Levinsen, 2017). Workshop allows the trial of numerous teaching 
techniques ranging from lecturing to case-study. The research methodology of the 
present study benefited from the imperativeness of process in sustainability education 
through the employment of a workshop. 
Research Approach  
A research approach delineates the modes and procedures employed in the conduct 
of research detailing ways and methods of data collection, analysis and interpretation 
110 
 
(Creswell, 2014). Three research approaches distinguished in academic research 
discourse are quantitative, qualitative and mixed approaches. A substantial body of 
literature has been devoted to explaining these approaches. In the present study, the 
mixed methods research was adopted.  
Quantitative Research  
In the quantitative approach, a research problem is understood or explained 
deductively, i.e. the research process ends with a confirmation or disproof of a theory 
or hypothesis. The main characteristics of the quantitative approach are deduction, 
confirmation, and theory/hypothesis testing amongst others (Johnson and 
Onwuegbuzie, 2004). Quantitative research is common in the physical sciences. The 
philosophical assumption usually associated with the quantitative approach is 
positivism or post-positivism, which underpins the conventional scientific approach. 
Reality is assumed to exist “out there” in the world and can be numerically measured 
and studied. Such an approach is reductionist. Positivist researchers strive to eliminate 
biases and apply conscientious efforts to detach themselves from the studied or 
observed phenomenon. In the current study, quantitative data involved closed-ended 
surveys, content analysis, and a customised sustainability literacy test.  
Qualitative Research 
The qualitative approach to research is traditionally associated with the humanities 
and social sciences. As a research approach, it seeks to explore and understand a 
research problem or phenomenon inductively, i.e. generating theory only at the end of 
the research process. The key characteristics of the qualitative approach are 
induction, discovery, and theory/hypothesis generation amongst others (Johnson and 
Onwuegbuzie, 2004). The philosophical underpinnings of the qualitative approach are 
typically constructivism, interpretivism, and transformative worldview. Knowledge 
according to these schools of thought is socially constructed. The transformative 
paradigm extends the constructivist stance by seeking to examine individual 
experiences of oppression or other unpleasant social phenomenon and developing an 
action plan or agenda for liberation. Scenarios in which qualitative research can be 
useful include examination of an entirely new subject, investigation in an unexplored 
context, and situations of inapplicable extant theories or knowledge (Creswell, 2014). 
111 
 
The qualitative data collected in the present study involved open-ended questionnaire 
and workshops.    
Mixed Methods Approach 
For many decades, qualitative and quantitative research methodologies dominated 
the discourse of academic research based on an incompatibility thesis (Howe, 1988) 
- the view that the two approaches are incompatible and should therefore not be 
conflated. In the 1980s and 1990s, movements emerged challenging the rationale for 
the rigid stance adopted by proponents of qualitative and quantitative approaches. 
These advocacies did not only call for the mixing of the research approaches but also 
integrated them in actual research. The outcome of these efforts is the mixed-methods 
research approach. Mixed methods research is defined as “an approach to inquiry 
involving collecting both quantitative and qualitative data” which are then integrated 
using discrete designs premised on the pragmatist philosophical and theoretical 
assumptions (Creswell, 2014, p.4). The impetus for the rise of the mixed methods 
research is the potential of the approach to combine the strengths inherent in both 
quantitative and qualitative approaches. A more comprehensive understanding of a 
research problem or question is believed to result from the mixed methods approach. 
Although several terms have been used to describe this approach such as 
multimethod, mixed methodology, synthesis approach, and hybrid method, mixed 
method research or mixed research are the most widely accepted and have been used 
interchangeably in this study. 
Rationale for Selection of Mixed Research Approach  
The choice of mixed research to conduct the present study was informed by several 
reasons, which revolved around the research questions. The central query of the 
research raised the question of what sustainability education interventions were 
appropriate for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Critical to answering this question 
was knowledge about the sustainability literacy of the Nigerian engineering community 
as represented by practitioners, educators and students as well as an assessment of 
the sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Whilst some of these 
questions suited the quantitative method, others required a qualitative approach. For 
instance, a quantitative approach involving the use of a sustainability literacy test was 
112 
 
needed to gauge the level of sustainability knowledge of Nigerian engineers and 
students. Similarly, since the study sought to generally investigate a phenomenon 
(sustainability education) in an unexplored context (Nigerian engineering education), 
the qualitative component of the mixed research was invaluable. In addition, the mixed 
research approach was chosen based on its non-limiting and eclectic quality which 
allowed for practical and creative research designs. Hence, a bespoke research 
design and plan was developed in such a way as to result in credible and beneficial 
answers.  
Research Paradigm 
Pragmatism is the research philosophy or worldview linked with the mixed research. 
This study, having adopted the mixed research approach, espoused the pragmatic 
worldview. Pragmatism is a philosophical tradition that gained prominence in the latter 
part of the 19th century through the efforts of such philosophers as Charles Sanders 
Peirce, William James and John Dewey (Hookway, 2016). The pragmatist agenda 
aptly termed pragmatic maxim is based on the rule that the contents of hypotheses (or 
truth value of an expression) are contingent on their practical consequences. 
Knowledge in the view of pragmatists is both objective reality (positivism) and social 
construction (constructivism) and can be derived eclectically using any means 
practicable. An important hallmark of the pragmatic worldview is pluralism, which 
endorses the potency of various approaches to knowledge without commitment to any 
one particular system. The mixed research, upholding the pragmatic stance, makes it 
possible for researchers to utilise qualitative and quantitative approaches liberally 
drawing on the approaches’ philosophical assumptions. Additionally, mixed methods 
researchers based on insights from pragmatism have the advantage of selecting 
methods and research strategies that “offer the best chance to obtain useful answers” 
(Johnson and Onwuegbuzie, 2004, p.15). Thus, in the pragmatic mixed-methods 
research approach, research questions are the most important determinant of a 
research methodology. The present study was guided by the pragmatist research 
philosophy.

Research Design 
In the conduct of mixed research, a number of strategies as illustrated in Table 4.1 
have been used by researchers. The strategies basically differ according to manner 
of data usage, timing of data collection (concurrently or sequentially), and database 
emphasis (Creswell, 2014). Five of these strategies are explanatory, exploratory, 
convergent, embedded and transformative mixed-methods. The explanatory 
sequential strategy involves the collection and analysis of quantitative data followed 
by the collection and analysis of qualitative data. The overall aim of this strategy is to 
use qualitative data to further explain an initially analysed quantitative data. The 
hallmark of this approach is that the quantitative component is given priority over the 
qualitative element; hence the QUAN and qual notations.

Transformative    
 
The exploratory sequential strategy is simply the reverse of the explanatory strategy. 
Qualitative data collection and analysis precede quantitative data collection and 
analysis. The object of the exploratory strategy is to build qualitative results into the 
quantitative phase to facilitate generalisation of findings. Priority is usually given to the 
qualitative component of the mixed research; hence the QUAL and quan notations. 
Convergent strategy is perhaps the most recognisable mixed research approach. It 
involves concurrently collecting quantitative and qualitative data and separately 
analysing them. The overall aim of the convergent strategy is result (data) comparison 
to deepen interpretation. Ideally, both quantitative and qualitative elements are given 
equal priority (QUAN + QUAL), but practically either of the components can be 
emphasised.  
The embedded mixed strategy is an advanced approach that nests or inserts either 
quantitative method within qualitative approach or vice versa. Data can be collected 
concurrently with the overall goal of having different levels of research addressed in a 
single study. The integration of collected data happens during data analysis and 
priority is usually assigned to the predominant method. In the transformative mixed 
approach, aspects of the explanatory sequential, exploratory sequential, convergent 
parallel and embedded mixed strategy are used within a transformative framework. 
The objective of such ensemble is to harness the potentials of mixed research strategy 
within a social justice framework to deliver a transformation agenda.   
Selection of Embedded Mixed Research Strategy 
The present study adopted the concurrent embedded mixed research strategy with 
emphasis on the quantitative component. This implied that the qualitative element was 
nested within a predominant quantitative research design as depicted in Figure 4.2. 
Such strategy proved appropriate for the purposes of the present research.

Data Required 
The research questions of the present study determined the data required. In order to 
answer the questions, data in the forms of sustainability knowledge and sustainability 
content were invaluable. The “knowledge” data were necessitated by the first research 
question: What is the current level of sustainability knowledge of the Nigerian 
engineering community? To address the question an assessment of the knowledge of 
the engineering community was essential. Both qualitative and quantitative data were 
needed for such assessment. The “content” data was required to address the second 
research question: What is the sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum? This question called for an evaluation of the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum in the form of documents and stakeholder perspectives. The last research 
question, “What sustainability education interventions are appropriate for the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum?” required textual data from literature as well as results 
obtained from the analysed data of the first and second research questions. These 
requirements collectively informed the data collection and data analysis methods in 
the present study.  
Survey Population and Sample Size 
The survey population in this research was the Nigerian engineering community which 
comprised engineering students, engineering educators and engineering practitioners. 
Although it was challenging to ascertain the population of the Nigerian engineering 
community, an estimated figure of 100,000 was assumed in the present study. This 
figure was arrived at based on the number of COREN registered engineers and on the 
number of engineering students and educators estimated from the guide provided by

COREN. Appendix IV presents a calculation of the estimated survey population. Using 
a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error, a sample size of 383 was calculated 
for the Nigerian engineering community. However, the sample size that was eventually 
achieved in the study was n=442. Of the 442 respondents, 232 were engineering 
students (n=232), 84 respondents were engineering educators (n=84) and 126 were 
engineering practitioners (n=126). 
Engineering Students 
Engineering students were recruited chiefly from two federally-run Nigerian HEIs 
anonymised in this study as HEI-1 and HEI-2. The sample size of the engineering 
students was n=232. Both HEI-1 and HEI-2 were chosen for their assorted engineering 
programmes, excellent academic record, cultural diversity and logistical reasons. The 
students in HEI-1 (n=137) were sampled from the seven engineering departments in 
the institution. With departmental percentages in parenthesis, the sample comprised: 
agricultural (9.5%), chemical (11.7%), civil (19.7%), electrical & computer (8.0%), 
mechanical (12.4%), metallurgical & material (26.3%), and water resources & 
environmental engineering (13.1%). Similarly, HEI-2 students (n=95) were derived 
from the institution’s three departments: civil (30.5%), electrical (30.5%) and 
mechanical engineering (38.9%). An average of 19 engineering students from each 
department participated in the survey. Two categories of students targeted in the 
survey were postgraduate (PhD and MSc) and undergraduate students. Fourth- and 
final-year students were selected to represent the undergraduate category in view of 
their extensive experience with the Nigerian engineering curriculum. As presented in 
Table 4.2, the sample comprised 10 doctoral, 74 master’s and 148 undergraduate 
students. Also, there were 40 female and 192 male students in the sample.

Engineering Educators  
Eighty-four engineering educators, n=84, were recruited for the survey from HEI-1 and 
HEI-2. The sample sizes for HEI-1 and HEI-2 engineering educators were n=55 and 
n=29 respectively. The educators cut across the seven engineering programmes 
represented by the engineering students. For HEI-1 engineering educators (n=55), the 
percentages of the participants by department were agricultural (1.8%), chemical 
(29.1%), civil (7.3%), electrical & computer (40.0%), mechanical (10.9%), metallurgical 
& material (9.1%), and water resources & environmental engineering (1.8%). HEI-2 
engineering educators (n=29) were represented thus: civil (37.9%), electrical (34.5%) 
and mechanical (27.6%). An average of 10 educators per engineering department 
participated in the study. Table 4.3 presents a demography of the sampled engineering 
educators. The sample consisted of 10 female and 74 male respondents with 25 
bachelor’s degree holders, 40 master’s degree awardees, and 19 doctorate degree 
holders.       
Table 4.3. Demography of engineering educators 
 
Engineering Practitioners 
Engineering practitioners were recruited randomly across Nigeria. COREN and NSE 
provided a significant access to Nigerian engineers, which ultimately yielded a sample 
size of n=126. The engineering practitioners were of various disciplinary backgrounds 
including aeronautical (3.2%), aircraft (0.8%), agricultural (4.9%), chemical (11.1%), 
and civil engineering (24.0%). Others were computer (3.8%), electrical (29.0%), 
mechanical (15.9%), metallurgical (3.6%), and mining engineers (3.7%). Table 4.4 
shows the demography of the sampled engineering practitioners. In terms of the 
employment category, 81 respondents were in the public sector, whilst 42 and three 
were in private and multinational employment respectively. Furthermore, the sample 
consisted of 121 male and only five female participants. The educational level of the 
sampled engineering practitioners featured 88 bachelor’s degree holders, 36 master’s 
degree awardees and two doctorate degree holders. The engineering practitioners

had differing lengths of professional experience with 46 of them in the range of 0-5 
years. Fifty-one had between 6-10 years of professional experience, whilst 20 had 
worked for 11-15 years. Only three of the sampled engineering practitioners had over 
30 years’ professional experience. 
Table 4.4. Demography of engineering practitioners 
 
An interesting observation is the low number of females in the sampled engineering 
community. Overall, only 12% (n=55) of the sample size (n=442) was female. This is 
consistent with the global phenomenon of low female participation in engineering. A 
recent study in Nigeria discovered that the percentage of undergraduate enrolment of 
women in STEM fields was 32.5, whilst that of men was 67.5% (Aderemi et al., 2013). 
The study also found that only 14% of the academic staff in STEM departments across 
Nigerian universities was female. Globally, the most recent statistics on women in 
engineering indicates that only 11% of the engineering workforce is female, with the 
UK having the lowest percentage in Europe at less than 10% (WES, 2018). Therefore, 
the low number of females in the sampled Nigerian engineering community is not a 
unique feature. Some of the reasons variously adduced for low female participation in 
engineering in Nigeria include poor mentorship, inapt guidance and counselling, and 
the stereotyping of engineering as a ‘masculine’ profession (Badekale, 2003). These 
issues must be addressed to reverse the trend. In any event, the underrepresentation 
of females in the sampled Nigerian engineering community could not have significantly 
influenced the outcome of the present study since no gender-biased issues were 
sought. 
Data Collection Method 
Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in this research. The instruments 
used to collect quantitative data were sustainability literacy test, content analysis, and 
closed-ended survey. Qualitative data were gathered from open-ended survey and a 
workshop.

Sustainability Literacy Test 
A sustainability literacy test (SLT) was used to examine the knowledge of the Nigerian 
engineering community. The test was designed based on several sustainability literacy 
assessment tools in the literature. Instruments such as ASK and Sulitest were helpful 
in the development of SLT for the present study (Appendix V). Full-scale adoption of 
the ASK was not possible as it did not only feature US-specific questions, but also had 
the demerit of high response burden in relation to the present study. Similarly, the 
Sulitest was considered unsuitable for the reasons of bureaucracy and inadequate 
alignment with the purposes of the present research. As established in the review of 
the Sulitest, registration for the test involves a somewhat complicated administrative 
procedure. Not only would it be difficult to convince Nigerian HEIs and engineering 
professional associations to register for the online test, but it was not possible in the 
timeframe of the present research. Furthermore, the Sulitest is more appropriate for 
testing higher levels of sustainability literacy as opposed to knowledge of sustainability 
basics targeted in the present study. Since none of the extant tools could be used 
unaltered for the purposes of the current study, a bespoke SLT was designed.    
An important modification in the SLT was the use of true/false/do not know format 
rather than the multiple choice questions of ASK and Sulitest. This questioning style 
was informed by the need to optimise test duration as well as maintain test integrity. 
Additionally, it was important to reduce random guessing by encouraging respondents 
to admit a lack of knowledge where appropriate. Another alteration in the SLT was the 
feature of context-relevant questions focusing on Nigeria. Contextual relevance had 
been repeatedly recommended in the design of sustainability knowledge assessment 
tools in the literature (Sulitest, 2016). Fifteen questions featured on the SLT covering 
environmental, economic, social and crosscutting domains of sustainability. However, 
these domains were not visibly delineated on the SLT as the questions were mixed to 
avoid a modular test design. The questions were generally framed to test foundational 
knowledge as an aspect of sustainability literacy. Other sustainability literacy levels 
such as application, analysis, evaluation, skills, and disposition were not tested as the 
Nigerian engineering community had not been previously studied for sustainability 
knowledge (see Chapter Three). Hence, basic sustainability concepts were the topics 
of interest in the SLT. Both global and country-specific sustainability issues appeared 
120 
 
equally in the four sustainability domains. A self-assessment question was appended 
to the SLT to gauge the perception of respondents on their sustainability knowledge.  
Content Analysis 
Content analysis was used to generate data from three engineering documents: the 
Benchmark Minimum Academic Standards for Engineering Programmes in Nigeria 
(BMAS), HEI-1 engineering handbook, and HEI-2 engineering handbook. Table 4.5 is 
a list of the programmes contained in the engineering documents.  
BMAS Document 
BMAS is a document issued and reviewed episodically by COREN to set out standards 
for running undergraduate engineering programmes in Nigeria. A 367-page document 
containing over 100,000 words, the BMAS lists 30 approved engineering programmes 
with a description of all required courses for each programme. The scope of each 
course details prerequisite and co-requisite topics as well as admission requirements 
and list of laboratory equipment. Common engineering courses are equally detailed. 
The document is divided into three parts including general requirements section, 
specific requirements subdivision and accreditation score sheet. The BMAS is an 
outcome of deliberations by engineering practitioners and academics in Nigeria. 
Deans and heads of engineering departments from Nigerian HEIs as well as COREN 
management are involved in the development of the document. Each Nigerian HEI 
submits the syllabi of its engineering programmes highlighting course contents, 
philosophy, and minimum facilities. A workshop is held to deliberate on these 
submissions.  
Courses are included in the BMAS on the basis of global best practice and contextual 
relevance. The BMAS standardises the syllabi and becomes the official guideline for 
all undergraduate engineering programmes in Nigeria. The preamble of the BMAS 
itemises nine learning outcomes for engineering programmes. Item 6 states that “a 
graduate of an engineering programme accredited by COREN is expected to have 
ability to consider the environment and sustainability in finding solutions to problems” 
(BMAS, 2014, p.13). An interesting fact about the BMAS is that it informs all 
handbooks of engineering faculties in Nigerian HEIs. Furthermore, Nigerian HEIs refer 
to the BMAS for purposes of accreditation and curricular development. The BMAS is 
the basis upon which COREN accredits engineering programmes. The mention of 
121 
 
sustainability as a competence expected of engineering graduates is, therefore, 
reassuring. However, this can only be effective with an actual integration of 
sustainability education in the programmes. The BMAS documentary analysis set out 
to discover if such alignment existed. 
HEI-1 and HEI-2 Engineering Handbooks 
Nigerian HEIs typically maintain engineering handbooks modelled on the BMAS 
document to guide the running of engineering programmes in the institutions. HEI-1 
and HEI-2 engineering handbooks were obtained from the two Nigerian education 
institutions that participated in the present study. Both engineering handbooks provide 
details of the various engineering programmes in the HEIs. Whilst HEI-1 details nine 
engineering fields, HEI-2 particularises three engineering courses. The engineering 
handbooks contain information on admission requirements, student workload, grading 
system, course title, course description and course content. Information on various 
topics covered under each course is equally provided in the engineering handbooks. 
The handbooks are customarily designed and reviewed periodically by engineering 
faculties based on departmental inputs. A faculty administrator collates the inputs and 
prepares a draft to be deliberated on at a faculty meeting. The terms of reference for 
the meeting include the COREN-issued BMAS document. Final approval for the 
engineering handbooks is granted by the faculty dean. Hard copies of the documents 
are normally distributed to students, whilst soft copies are uploaded to faculty 
websites. The HEI-1 and HEI-2 engineering handbooks used in the present study were 
downloaded from the websites of the education institutions.

Closed-Ended Survey 
Closed-ended surveys were employed to gain insights into the perspectives of the 
Nigerian engineering community on sustainability issues as well as on curricular 
sustainability content. Consequently, three categories of survey were developed as 
follows: student survey, educator survey, and practitioner survey.  
Student Survey 
The student survey (see Appendix VI) contained 14 questions and was divided into 
demography and curricular assessment sections. Six demography-related questions 
were posed to obtain such information as name of respondent’s HEI, engineering 
programme, gender, academic level, disposition towards sustainability in Nigeria, and 
awareness of UNDESD. The curricular assessment section featured an existing set of 
questions that had been developed by Watson (2013) premised on 37 STAUNCH® 
sustainability topics (Table 4.6). This cluster of questions sought the students’ views 
on the extent to which these sustainability topics were covered in the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum as represented in their HEIs. The use of a 5-point Likert scale 
(not at all - - to a great extent) allowed the respondents to rate the coverage of the 
themes. The curricular assessment section also included a question on whether 
sustainability course or programme was offered in the HEI. Another inquiry probed 
students’ opinions on ways they had learned about sustainability as well as on the 
means of effective sustainability intervention in the Nigerian engineering curriculum. 
Educator Survey 
The educator survey (see Appendix VII) contained 16 questions with the instrument 
divided into demography and curricular assessment sections. The six demography-
related questions featured items such as name of university, engineering department, 
discipline, gender, academic qualification, disposition towards sustainability education 
in Nigeria, and awareness of UNDESD. The curricular assessment section featured 
the same set of questions as the curricular segment of the student survey adopted 
from Watson’s (2013) instrument of 37 STAUNCH® sustainability topics (Table 4.6). 
The questions were, however, slightly modified to seek the educators’ views on the 
extent to which they addressed these sustainability themes in their teaching of 
engineering. This was considered somewhat pertinent to the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum. Accordingly, the 5-point Likert scale (not at all - - to a great extent) on the 
123 
 
survey allowed the educators to rate the spread of the sustainability topics. A question 
on whether a sustainability course or programme was offered in a respondent’s 
university prefaced the curricular assessment section. Also, educators were queried 
on ways they had taught or encouraged the learning of sustainability in their HEIs as 
well as on the means of effective sustainability education intervention in Nigeria.  
Practitioner Survey 
The practitioner survey (see Appendix VIII) featured nine questions and was divided 
into the two sections of demography and miscellaneous information. Demography-
eliciting questions inquired about respondents’ engineering discipline, academic 
qualification, employment type, gender, years of professional experience, and 
awareness of UNDESD. The miscellaneous section contained a question on whether 
practitioners considered sustainability in engineering practice. Furthermore, there was 
a question that sought to establish the disposition of the practitioners towards 
sustainability in Nigeria. Lastly, a question on the practitioner survey explored 
respondents’ views on the most appropriate sustainability education intervention for 
the Nigerian engineering curriculum. The 5-point Likert scale (not at all - - extremely) 
aided the rating of the responses. Practitioners were not asked questions relating to 
curricular sustainability content as the subgroup of the Nigerian engineering 
community were considered not sufficiently conversant with extant engineering 
curriculum in Nigeria.  
Open-Ended Survey 
Open-ended questions were interspersed with closed-ended questions on all the 
survey categories. The open-ended question common to all the surveys invited 
respondents to comment on sustainability and engineering education in Nigeria. This 
question came at the end of the surveys. One open-ended question posed to both 
educators and students requested them to think about all the engineering courses 
(taught or learned) in the HEIs and list three which addressed sustainability. The open-
ended question uniquely posed to the practitioners asked them to state reasons for 
recognising (or not recognising) sustainability in engineering works. The open-ended 
questioning approach allowed respondents to express their thoughts without any 
restrictions. In phrasing the open-ended questions, careful thought was given to the 
need for brevity, clarity, and relevance. Additionally, the open-ended questions were 
124 
 
made to feature in a way that reinforces logical flow of the entire survey. Overall, there 
were about four open-ended questions within the three survey categories.   
Table 4.6. STAUNCH® sustainability topics31 
 
Survey Pretesting 
The student survey was piloted to 10 final-year engineering students at UCL and 10 
postgraduate students in a Nigerian HEI. The educator survey was pretested by five 
Nigerian engineering educators. However, the practitioner survey was not piloted, but 
this inadequacy was mitigated by the insights gained from pretesting the student and 
educator surveys. Most of the issues raised in the trials were relevant to the three 
survey categories. An important observation from the trial of the surveys was that 
some of the questions were complex and needed to be simplified. Furthermore, the 
issue of ambiguity of concepts such as sustainability, socialism, and consumerism was 
raised. The survey pretesting also revealed the need to clarify instructions with respect

to how respondents would answer the questions. These observations were considered 
in refining the surveys including the SLT. Of the original 20 SLT questions, only six 
were retained with nine fresh questions framed as a result of the survey trial.   
Survey Administration  
Paper-based and web-based means of survey administration were used in the present 
research. The paper-based survey involved physical distribution of the instrument to 
the respondents. The online survey, which was developed with the aid of web-based 
tool, Opinio, was accessed via a survey link. The survey length for both survey types 
was 15 minutes. Each survey was prefaced with a brief overview highlighting the 
purpose of the study and issues of confidentiality and voluntariness of participation. 
However, before the administration of the surveys, the three organisations involved in 
the study, namely COREN, HEI-1 and HEI-2 were formally invited to participate in the 
research (see Appendix X). An administrator was subsequently appointed by the 
organisations to coordinate the distribution of the surveys. Both the web-based and 
the paper-based surveys were routed through the representative of the organisations. 
The survey was administered (distributed and retrieved) over a period of three months 
(May – Aug 17). Follow up messages were sent fortnightly by the representatives to 
the respondents reminding and encouraging them to participate in the survey.  
Workshop  
Workshop was another data collection strategy employed in the current study. The 
event, which was entitled Sustainable Engineering Workshop, aimed to pilot an 
introductory sustainability course to undergraduate and postgraduate engineering 
students in Nigeria. Participants in the workshop were recruited randomly from 
Nigerian HEIs within Kaduna metropolis. In all 21 students partook in the workshop. 
Highlights of the workshop included preliminary assessments, lecture/presentation on 
sustainable engineering, sustainable engineering activity, and post-workshop tests. 
Whilst preliminary assessment involved a pre-workshop sustainability test, the post-
workshop test featured a sustainability test as well as a workshop evaluation survey.      
Details of the workshop are provided in Chapter Eight.

Data Analysis 
The analysis of data proceeded with the aid of computer software tools such as IBM 
SPSS (Version 22)32 and NVivo11 Pro (Version 11.4)33. Details of the software 
packages are available on the websites of the products shown in the footnotes. The 
data analysis involved statistical analysis, SLT scoring and content analysis. 
Statistical Analysis 
Level of measurement typically informs the choice of statistical analysis and statistical 
tests. The level of measurement of a data refers to the meanings of the coding scheme 
or numbers associated with each variable (McCormick et al., 2015). Also known as 
scale of measurement, it is a description of the type or amount of information a variable 
or measure contains. Four levels of measurement have been identified in scientific 
research including nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio (Weisburd and Britt, 2014). 
Whilst nominal scale of measurement comprises categorical data without any precise 
order to the categories, ordinal data are characteristically ordered categories. The 
interval level of measurement features variables which are not only classified and 
ordered, but also maintain equal differences for all categories on the scale. Ratio data 
differs from interval data with the addition of a non-arbitrary or true zero value, with 
zero suggesting an absence of the trait being studied. The four levels of measurement 
are typically represented in a hierarchical relationship with nominal at the lowest level 
and ratio at the highest rung. Between the nominal and ratio scales are ordinal and 
interval levels respectively. Each higher level has the qualities of the level below it. 
In the current research, nominal and ordinal levels of measurement constituted most 
of the data. Consequently, both descriptive and inferential statistics were undertaken 
in the study. Descriptive statistics uses measures of central tendency and measures 
of variability to summarise a given data set. The focus is on the summary of the basic 
features of the data or measure without necessarily reaching any conclusions about 
the sampled data. By contrast, inferential statistics seeks to deduce meaning from the 
sampled data and extend such inferences to more general conditions. As part of the 
data analysis in the present study, descriptive statistics were obtained using such 
measures of central tendency as mean and frequency as well as percentages. The

mean was calculated for all the categorical variables in the study, whilst the frequency 
of individual values was determined and presented on a frequency distribution table. 
The corresponding percentages for all the categories were equally calculated. The 
descriptive statistics provided a summary of the data with results presented graphically 
on a bar chart.  
Inferential statistics in the study involved cross-tabulation, Pearson’s chi-square test 
and repeated measures t-test. Cross-tabulation was used to explore the relationship 
between two or more categorical variables in the research with aid of percentages. 
The percentages of categorical variables were mapped against each other to identify 
patterns or relationship. Pearson’s chi-square test was applied to detect any significant 
differences amongst the categorical variables in the data sets. A cut-off value34 of 
0.001 or lower (p ≤ 0.001) was used for the chi-square test with the null hypothesis 
that the variables were unrelated to each other. The assumptions for conducting a 
Pearson’s chi-square test, namely independence and large sample size, were met for 
the data in the present study. The repeated measures t-test was employed to check 
statistical differences in the pre- and post-workshop test performances of workshop 
participants. Using a cut-off value of 0.001 (p < 0.001) and a null hypothesis of no 
difference between mean pre- and post-marks, the t-test compared the differences to 
zero. To be valid, the t-test assumes normal distribution, and normality test (p < 0.05) 
conducted with the aid of QQ plot confirmed the data to be normally distributed. Hence, 
assumptions for inferential statistics were met for the data in the current study.  
Sustainability Knowledge Assessment 
The three criteria used to assess the sustainability knowledge of the sampled Nigerian 
engineering community were level of awareness of UNDESD, performance on SLT, 
and self-assessment of sustainability knowledge. The level of awareness of UNDESD 
was analysed statistically as already explained above. It was essentially a closed-
ended question demanding a yes or no response to whether participants were aware 
of the UNDESD. The frequency and percentage of each response classification were 
obtained. SLT was graded based on a binary scoring format of correct or incorrect 
answers. Consequently, the fifteen test questions were each scored as either correct 
or incorrect. The percentage of respondents who opted for each answer category was 
                                            
34 The threshold p-values were chosen arbitrarily from p < 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 options. 
128 
 
determined and the overall averages calculated. Although the SLT featured three 
options, namely true, false, and do not know, the do not know option was considered 
an incorrect response to suit the binary scoring format, but also because it represented 
a lack of knowledge about the queried item.  
Respondents to the SLT were also assessed based on the four domains of economic, 
environmental, social and crosscutting sustainability. This was intended to determine 
the performance of the community by sustainability topics. The average scores of the 
respondents on each of the four sustainability domains were calculated and expressed 
as percentages. This aided a comparison of performances on the sustainability topics. 
For the self-assessment of sustainability knowledge, statistical analysis as explained 
previously was undertaken. However, the 5-point Likert scale of the self-assessment 
question (very poor, poor, average, good, very good) was reduced to low (very poor – 
average) and high (good – very good). This facilitated the delineation of self-assessed 
sustainability knowledge as either low or high, which did not only simplify the analysis 
but also provided a basis for comparison. Results of the three assessment criteria 
were synthesised to articulate the level of sustainability knowledge of the Nigerian 
engineering community.   
Content Analysis 
Content analysis in the present study involved three engineering documents, namely 
BMAS document, HEI-1 engineering handbook, and HEI-2 engineering handbook. 
The question that informed the content analysis of the engineering documents was 
whether or not sustainability topics were covered in the handbooks. It was therefore 
of interest to analyse the mentions of a sustainability topic or idea in any engineering 
programme contained in the documents. The documentary analysis involved the use 
of NVivo 11 Pro software. The engineering documents were converted to an editable 
PDF form, uploaded into the NVivo 11 Pro software and filed appropriately. Each 
engineering document was treated as a separate project on the software homepage. 
Thirty engineering programmes described in the BMAS document with the common 
engineering courses formed a total of 31 cases. The nine engineering programmes 
detailed in the HEI-1 engineering handbook and common engineering courses yielded 
a total of 10 cases, whilst the three courses of HEI-2 engineering document with the 
common courses produced a total of 4 cases.   
129 
 
A priori codes based on the four categories of environmental, economic, social, and 
crosscutting themes became parent nodes. In line with the STAUNCH® sustainability 
themes (Table 4.6), the environment node had 9 child nodes each being an important 
environment topic. Similarly, economic topics gave rise to 6 child nodes under the 
economic parent node, while the social parent node had 12 child nodes derived from 
myriad social issues like poverty, bribery, corruption, equity, etc. The crosscutting 
node contained 10 child nodes based on a range of multidimensional themes such as 
systems thinking, responsibility, holistic thinking, etc. The engineering documents 
were then scrutinised and coded at the cases and nodes. Words such as ‘sustainable’ 
used in the literal sense were not coded. Topics had to clearly embody sustainability 
ideas before being coded. Descriptive statistics for each engineering document were 
obtained and tabulated based on the model of Table 4.7.  
Table 4.7. Model for descriptive statistics of engineering documents 
 
The entries for the above table were obtained from NVivo11 Pro. NVivo 11 is a data 
analysis software tool designed to support qualitative data analyses. The computer 
software tool comprises several features that facilitate the management of complex, 
ill-defined and unstructured data. It is easy to organise, analyse and draw insights from 
an assorted dataset using the NVivo 11 Pro. The software supports a variety of data 
sources including emails, videos, online surveys, web-based interviews, photos, and 
social media platforms. NVivo 11 Pro aids researchers in source, theme, case, in-vivo 
and relationship coding which are invaluable to a mixed research data analysis. In the 
model table above, the sustainability theme column variously featured the four 
categories of economic, environmental, social and crosscutting topics and their 
subtopics, whilst the frequency column was used to enter the number of mentions of 
a subtopic obtained from the NVivo 11 as references coded. The process of obtaining 
frequencies of themes from textual data is sometimes referred to as quantitising

Expected occurrence column contained an anticipated mention of sustainability theme 
in the engineering documents, expressed as a function of the number of engineering 
programmes detailed in the documents including the common courses. The 
assumption was that each element of sustainability should be mentioned, at the least, 
once in each engineering programme. Thus, the expected occurrence of sustainability 
themes in the BMAS document, HEI-1 engineering handbook and HEI-2 engineering 
handbook was 31, 10 and 4 respectively (see Table 4.5). Percentage within potential 
theme content was calculated thus: (Frequency/Expected Occurrence) X 100. This 
equation provided an idea of how a sustainability theme, based on its spread potential, 
fared in terms of coverage within an engineering document.  
The last column on the model table featured the percentage within an engineering 
document obtained directly from NVivo calculations. The NVivo percentage coverage 
for PDF documents is conventionally the average of the percentage of characters 
coded and the percentage of the page area coded. The outcome of this average is 
expressed as a percentage of the total document. The percentage of an engineering 
document covering a sustainability theme was calculated for all the documents and 
sustainability themes. The theme content row was used to calculate the sum of the 
entries in all the columns, which resulted in an overall assessment of the theme’s 
content in the relevant document. Additionally, the location of a sustainability theme in 
an engineering document, i.e. the engineering programme in which a mention(s) of 
sustainability occurred was traced and presented on a stacked bar chart.  
Open-Ended Survey Analysis 
The qualitative data analysed in the study was generated by the questions on the list 
of sustainability courses in HEIs and general comments. For the sustainability courses, 
each mentioned course was coded as a node. Repeated mention of a course attracted 
coding at the same node, which eventually yielded a frequency table. The courses 
were subsequently arranged in an ascending order from the least to the most frequent. 
With regard to the general comments, an inductive coding approach was adopted. 
Themes were generated a posteriori from the data as opposed to a priori coding, 
resulting into distinct thematic categories. A matrix table was employed to present 
these emergent themes alongside their descriptions and illustrations from the data.

Validity and Reliability  
An important goal of a mixed research is to draw inferences from the combined 
strengths of quantitative and qualitative research. Central to the issues of validity and 
reliability in a mixed research is the development of justified inferences (Onwuegbuzie 
and Johnson, 2006). However, justifying mixed research inferences, also called meta-
inference, can be problematic for reasons of additive or multiplicative threats from the 
inherent shortcomings of both quantitative and qualitative research. The two elements 
of the mixed research could add or multiply the problems of validity and reliability 
manifest as the problem of integration. How successful (or otherwise) the integration 
of both the quantitative and qualitative strategies is affects the meta-inference quality 
of a mixed research. Threats to validity in the concurrent embedded mixed strategy of 
the present study largely involved such legitimation issues as sample integration, 
inside-outside legitimation, and weakness minimisation.  
Sample integration describes “the extent to which the relationship between the 
quantitative and qualitative sampling yields quality meta-inferences” (Onwuegbuzie 
and Johnson, 2006). A common threat associated with sample integration is that 
unequal sample sizes may constrain the development of meta-inferences. In most 
cases the quantitative component constitutes a larger sample size than the qualitative 
element. Drawing a meta-inference from such arrangement can be severely limited 
especially if the qualitative sampling is unrepresentative of the target population. For 
example, it would be difficult from such setting to make statistical generalisations or 
inform population transferability. Random sampling and similarity of samples have 
been suggested as mitigation measures of sample integration issues (Ihantola and 
Kihn, 2011). An indicator of meta-inference quality is the degree of consistency 
between quantitative and qualitative inferences. In the present study, these factors 
played out in which the qualitative sample was randomly chosen and somewhat similar 
to the quantitative random sample, but also inferences therefrom were congruent.     
Inside-outside legitimation underscores the accuracy of appropriately presenting both 
insider and outsider views for description and explanation purposes. This legitimation 
issue is sometimes difficult to attain as a result of researcher subjectivity. Peer review 
has been recommended as an extenuating measure (Creswell, 2014). In the current 
research, peer review was augmented by bias clarification or reflexivity to critique 
132 
 
descriptions, explanations and interpretations. At least one representative each from 
the three groups of the Nigerian engineering community namely, students, educators, 
and practitioners partook in reviewing the interpretations of the research. Relevant 
portions of the findings were messaged to these individuals via the organisations’ 
contacts. This included aspects of both the quantitative and qualitative components of 
the research. The combined interpretation of the study was reviewed by a duo of 
disinterested social research academics. With regard to reflexivity, a germane issue 
was the researcher’s “enduring urge to bring about a positive change in an educational 
system through which I passed” (see Preface). It was thus important to ensure that 
this desire did not compromise the findings of the study. Consequently, interpretations 
in the present study were repeatedly checked against such potential bias.  
Weakness minimisation describes the degree of reducing the inherent flaws of one 
approach by the other. This is simply one of the objectives of mixed research strategy. 
However, the extent to which the quantitative and qualitative approaches complement 
each other is not readily determinable. Onwuegbuzie and Johnson (2006) advise that 
researchers should conscientiosuly evaluate the compensatory effects of quantitatve 
and qualitative components of an adopted mixed research strategy. This is obviously 
not an uncomplicated process as some weaknesses are only noticeable during the 
fieldwork. Nonetheless, threats to validity of the mixed research components were 
identified and appropriately addressed in the current study. The limitation sections of 
the findings chapters were devoted to highlighting the validity issues pertinent to the 
chapters. In terms of reliability, iterative checks for mistakes during instrumentation, 
coding, decoding and other data collection and analysis procedures were rigorously 
undertaken. Additionally, survey pretesting as already discussed proved useful in 
ensuring the reliability of the surveys.  
Ethical Issues 
Ethical issues considered in this study cut across the various research stages of 
planning, data collection and data analysis. Prior to commencing the fieldwork, ethical 
advice from UCL Research Ethics Committee determined that an ethical approval was 
not required. The study was identified under the exemption category as it involved “the 
use of non-sensitive, completely anonymous educational tests, survey and interview 
procedures [and] the participants are not defined as ""vulnerable"" and participation will 
133 
 
not induce undue psychological stress or anxiety.”35 Nonetheless, conventional ethical 
standards were observed throughout the research. An ethical concern prior to the 
fieldwork was access to the Nigerian engineering community. To address this issue, 
a formal request for access to engineering practitioners, educators and students was 
sought and obtained from appropriate authorities. Only after access approval had 
been secured did the study proceed. In the course of the fieldwork, ethical issues arose 
from interaction with participants bordering on confidentiality and voluntariness of 
participation. These concerns were adequately addressed on the consent forms 
issued to the respondents which clearly stated the purpose of the study.  
To ensure confidentiality, data were anonymised throughout the study. The HEIs that 
were involved in the study, the survey respondents and the workshop participants 
were given codes to hide their identities. For example, the two education institutions 
in the study were referred to as HEI-1 and HEI-2 and their documents dubbed HEI-1 
and HEI-2 engineering handbooks respectively. Practitioners were anonymised as 
PR, educators as ER, and students as SR. An integer was randomly assigned to these 
letters to create a code of sorts such as PR1, ER10 and SR235 corresponding to first 
practitioner respondent, tenth educator respondent, and two hundred and thirty-fifth 
student respondent. Additional ethical concerns considered during the analysis of data 
included issues of reporting findings and data sharing. Concerted efforts were made 
to eschew data falsification, plagiarism, dishonesty, disregard of discrepant data, and 
unethical sharing of findings. 
Challenges 
There is no research methodology that can be devoid of drawbacks. Some of the 
challenges encountered in the present study included missing data, apathy toward 
internet-based survey, and disinclination to participate in a sustainability research. As 
regards missing data, only 20 cases out of 442 responses were reported throughout 
the study. Interestingly, 17 of these missing data affected one survey item, whilst the 
remaining three cases affected another survey element. Given the comparatively low 
impact of the missing data, they were omitted in the data analysis. Another challenge 
the study faced was apathy toward internet-based survey. This obstacle was chiefly 
                                            
35 https://ethics.grad.ucl.ac.uk/exemptions.php 
134 
 
encountered in organisations whose management declined to publish the survey link 
of the research on their official websites. For some unclear reasons, the authorities of 
these institutions approved the use of only paper-based surveys.  
In organisations where the survey link was published online the responses were 
surprisingly poor. A possible explanation could be the poor availability of internet 
access in most Nigerian HEIs. This deprived the research of such online survey merits 
as convenience and expeditious data analysis (especially from the compatibility of 
Opinio with IBM SPSS and NVivo 11 Pro). Lastly, some members of the Nigerian 
engineering community were disinclined to partake in the study for religious reasons. 
The crux of their argument was that the idea of sustainability conflicted directly with 
the divine attributes of sustenance and providence. This position might not have been 
pervasive given the sample size achieved in the research. However, its possible 
espousal by academics begs the question of how many people refrained from 
participating in the study based on such convictions.  
Summary 
The central query of the current research posed the question of what sustainability 
education interventions are appropriate for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. To 
address this key question, the study required data about the level of sustainability 
knowledge of the engineering community and the sustainability content of the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum. Mixed research underlain by the pragmatist philosophy was 
adopted in the study. This chapter reviewed the methodology of the research stressing 
the import of sustainability assessment vis-à-vis sustainability content and literacy. 
The choice of the concurrent embedded mixed research strategy in the conduct of the 
study was rationalised. The chapter further detailed the research design employed in 
the study covering a range of topics including survey population, sample size, data 
collection and data analysis methods. Data collection methods discussed in the 
chapter included sustainability literacy test, content analysis, closed-ended and open-
ended surveys as well as workshop. The data analysis method involved the use of 
IBM SPSS and NVivo11 Pro computer software tools to facilitate statistical analysis, 
sustainability knowledge assessment and content analysis. The chapter ended with 
an overview of validity, reliability, ethical issues and challenges of the research. 
Chapter Five presents the findings of the first research question.

5  Sustainability Literacy of Nigerian 
Engineering Community 
 
Introduction 
This chapter assesses the sustainability literacy level of the Nigerian engineering 
community. It responds to the question: What is the current level of sustainability 
knowledge of the Nigerian engineering community? Answers to the question were 
derived from a survey administered to three groups within the engineering community, 
namely students (n=232), educators (n=84) and practitioners (n=126). Three criteria 
against which the sustainability literacy of the community was measured included level 
of UNDESD awareness, performance on a sustainability literacy test, and self-
assessment of sustainability knowledge. The chapter proceeds by describing the 
results of the assessment of students followed by those of educators and practitioners. 
The results are synthesised to approximate the sustainability literacy of the entire 
engineering community (n=442). The chapter concludes with a discussion of the 
results and limitations of the study.

Student Literacy  
Awareness of UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 
Inquiry into students’ awareness of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable 
Development (UNDESD) revealed that a vast majority (81%) of the students were not 
aware of the Decade (Table 5.1). Disaggregating the data by institution, discipline and 
educational level revealed no statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, 
engineering students were generally unaware of the UNDESD.

Outcome of Sustainability Literacy Test 
Overall Performance 
Table 5.2 shows the performance of the sampled student population (n = 232) in the 
sustainability literacy test, which is expressed as a percentage of students responding 
correctly or incorrectly to 15 sustainability-related questions. There is also an option 
for the ‘do not know’ response. The correct answers are parenthesised in italics and 
placed next to each question.  Only Q8 was correctly answered by more than half 
(51.7%) of the students. The average percentage of students who answered the 
questions incorrectly was 32.1%, whilst almost half of the students (48.8%) admitted 
not knowing the answers. There were no significant differences based on institution, 
discipline and educational level (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, a significant number of the students 
did not answer the sustainability test questions correctly.

Performance by Sustainability Topics 
An assessment of the students’ performance across sustainability themes revealed 
that economic topics had, on average, the highest percentage (35.8%) of correctly 
answered questions followed by the environmental themes (20.5%). Social and 
crosscutting topics recorded small fractions of correct responses – 14.7% and 9.4% 
respectively (Table 5.3). There were no statistically significant differences within the 
student population excepting slight variation based on educational level. Postgraduate 
students performed better than undergraduate students only on economic questions 
(p ≤ 0.001). However, no significant differences were observed in the remaining 
sustainability topics. Hence, the sustainability literacy of the students by topics did not 
vary greatly based on educational level.

Student Self-Assessment of Sustainability Knowledge 
Students assessed their performance on the sustainability literacy test (Table 5.4 and 
Figure 5.1). Most students (79%) rated their sustainability knowledge between very 
poor and average. Only a fraction of the students (21%) considered their sustainability 
literacy as either good or very good. No significant differences were found based on 
institution, discipline and academic level (p ≤ 0.001).

Educator Literacy  
Awareness of UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 
Awareness of the UNDESD amongst educators was somewhat poor as most of them 
(66.7%) were uninformed about the declaration (Table 5.5). Only one-third of the 
educators (33.3%) said they knew about the UN Decade. Additionally, UNDESD 
awareness did not differ significantly across institution (p = 0.746), discipline (p = 
0.298) and academic qualification (p = 0.719). Thus, engineering educators generally 
had inadequate knowledge of the UN Decade of ESD. 
Table 5.5. Educators’ awareness of UNDESD 
 
Outcome of Sustainability Literacy Test 
Overall Performance 
Results (Table 5.6) of the sustainability literacy test revealed that only one-fifth (20.9%) 
of the educators performed well on the test. One-third (33.1%) and almost half (46.0%) 
of the educators respectively answered the questions incorrectly and with a ‘do not 
know’ response. Nonetheless, a large proportion (61.4%) responded correctly to Q8. 
The most incorrectly answered question on the test was Q9 attracting only a small 
fraction of correct responses (3.6%). Disaggregating the data by institution, discipline 
and academic qualification did not reveal any statistically significant differences (p ≤ 
0.001). Hence, the performance of the engineering educators on the sustainability 
literacy test was mostly poor.

Performance by Sustainability Topics 
Educators had a varied performance by sustainability topics (Table 5.7). A good 
proportion (39.3%) of the educators performed well on the economic questions, but 
did poorly (8.4%) on the crosscutting topics. Less than a quarter of the educators 
(19.2%) answered the social questions correctly. The environmental questions trailed 
behind the social topics with nearly a quarter (24.1%) of the lecturers responding with 
correct answers. There were no statistically significant differences based on the 
educators’ institution, discipline and academic qualification (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, the 
educators’ knowledge of sustainability differed by topics, but was largely the same 
across institutions and academic levels.

Educator Self-Assessment of Sustainability Knowledge 
The sustainability self-assessment scores showed that most educators (61%) gauged 
their sustainability knowledge as very poor, poor or average (Table 5.8 and Figure 
5.2). Interestingly, over a third (39%) of the educators assessed their sustainability 
literacy as either good or very good. There were no statistically significant differences 
based on institution, discipline and academic qualification (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, a sizeable 
proportion of the educators considered themselves sufficiently knowledgeable about 
sustainability.

Practitioner Literacy 
Awareness of UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 
Practitioners differed on their awareness of the UNDESD (Table 5.9). Whilst a 
considerable number of the practitioners (35.7%) knew about the UN Decade, the 
majority (64.3%) was ignorant of it. Disaggregating the data by discipline, employment 
type, and length of professional experience revealed no statistically significant 
differences (p ≤ 0.001). Hence, engineering practitioners were mostly unaware of the 
UNDESD.

Outcome of Sustainability Literacy Test 
Overall Performance 
The sustainability literacy test of the practitioners recorded a significant amount of 
incorrect responses (Table 5.10). Only one-quarter of the respondents answered the 
sustainability questions correctly. More than two-fifths (40.5%) of the practitioners 
responded incorrectly to the questions, whilst one-third of them indicated not knowing 
the correct answers. Interestingly, the majority of the practitioners answered Q6 and 
Q8 correctly having recorded 52.1% and 75.2% correct responses respectively.  
However, the practitioners did not differ significantly based on discipline, employment 
type, academic qualification and length of professional experience (p ≤ 0.001).  Hence, 
the overall performance of the practitioners on the sustainability literacy test was 
generally poor.

Performance by Sustainability Topics 
The performance of practitioners on the sustainability literacy test varied according to 
sustainability themes (Table 5.11). Nearly half of the practitioners (49.6%) performed 
well on the economic questions. Almost a quarter of them (24.2%) passed the social 
queries with a fraction of the professionals (22.8%) answering the environmental 
questions correctly. However, a considerable majority either performed poorly or did 
not know the correct answers to the crosscutting questions. Disaggregating the data 
by discipline, employment, academic qualification and length of professional 
experience revealed no statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.001). Therefore, 
practitioners’ performance on the test, although differed across sustainability themes, 
neither depended on engineering specialty nor on practice circumstances.

Result Synthesis 
Combining results of the three groups within the Nigerian engineering community 
fostered a holistic insight into the sustainability literacy of the community (Table 5.13). 
For the level of UNDESD awareness, the results showed Nigerian engineering 
community as generally unaware of the UN Decade. On average, just over a quarter 
(29%) of the engineering community was cognisant of the Decade with a significant 
majority (71%) admitting ignorance. However, the difference in the level of awareness 
amongst the three categories was observed to be statistically significant (p ≤ 0.001). 
Educators (33%) and practitioners (36%) indicated a higher level of UNDESD 
awareness than did students (19%). Hence, students seemed most uninformed about 
the Decade.  
Table 5.13. Sustainability literacy of Nigerian engineering community 
 
The overall performance of the Nigerian engineering community on the sustainability 
literacy test was poor. Scores revealed a nearly eighty percent incorrect and ‘do not 
know’ responses with just over a fifth (22%) of the community answering the questions 
correctly. No significant differences were observed in the performance across the 
cohorts, although practitioners performed slightly better than the educators and 
students, respectively. Sustainability test performance by topics (Table 5.14) revealed 
statistically significant differences within the engineering community (p ≤ 0.001). 
Generally, the community demonstrated strength in economic themes with over two-
fifths of them (42%) answering the relevant questions correctly. The least known topics 
were the crosscutting issues whose questions were answered correctly by only a small 
minority of the community (9%). Performance of the engineering community on the 
social and environmental themes was quite low having recorded some significant 
amount of wrong answers (38% and 57% respectively). Nonetheless, across the three

groups, practitioners excelled in economic and social issues, whilst educators 
performed best on environmental topics. Students performed better than educators on 
the crosscutting sustainability themes. 
Table 5.14. Performance of stakeholders by sustainability topics  
 
Results of the sustainability knowledge self-assessment revealed that the Nigerian 
engineering community mostly rated their sustainability knowledge low. Only 3 in 10 
people (31%) had a high opinion of their sustainability knowledge. Comparing the 
outcome of the self-assessment of sustainability knowledge with actual performance 
on the test was quite revealing (Table 5.15). Perception of sustainability knowledge 
differed markedly from actual scores. For instance, some 21% of the students thought 
themselves as possessing either good or very good sustainability knowledge, but only 
5% of them passed the test. Similarly, of the over one-third (39%) of the educators 
who claimed to have either good or very good sustainability literacy, only a fraction 
(10%) passed the test. Equally, only a small minority (9%) of the one-third practitioners 
(33%) with high estimation (good or very good) of their sustainability knowledge 
performed well on the test. On the whole, even though a proportion of the engineering 
community (31%), on average, rated their sustainability knowledge high, quite an 
insignificant number of them (8%) passed the test. However, it is noteworthy that fewer 
students admitted having adequate sustainability knowledge compared with educators 
and practitioners.

Discussion 
The three criteria used to gauge the sustainability literacy of the Nigerian engineering 
community are level of UNDESD awareness, score on sustainability literacy test, and 
self-assessment of sustainability knowledge.  
Level of UNDESD Awareness 
The UNDESD is critical to sustainability literacy as it aimed at global implementation 
of sustainability education (UNESCO, 2005). Therefore, to appreciate the level of 
sustainability knowledge of a community, an inquiry into members’ awareness of the 
UN declaration that sought to facilitate such knowledge is relevant. This can even be 
useful in testing the effectiveness of the now lapsed UN Decade. The survey results 
show that the Nigerian engineering community is largely oblivious of the Decade. 
There is evident widespread ignorance of the UN Decade within the engineering 
community in Nigeria. This finding is congruent with reports of poor awareness of 
several UN initiatives including MESA, ESD and UNDESD in most African countries 
(UNEP-MESA 2009; Manteaw 2012). The efficacy of the UNDESD in galvanising 
global support for sustainability education is therefore of concern; an observation also 
raised in the UNDESD Final Report (UNESCO, 2014).  
Considering the degree of awareness of the Decade within the Nigerian engineering 
community, the level of success in engendering a sustainability literacy is obviously 
low. However, an interesting fact regarding the comparative levels of UNDESD 
awareness of the Nigerian engineering community is observed. Lack of UNDESD 
awareness is more widespread amongst students than amongst educators and 
practitioners. Although no explicit cause of this discrepancy can be readily 
ascertained, the educators conversant with the Decade may not have been informed 
by concerted sustainability education efforts; otherwise such awareness would have 
reflected on the students. Additionally, the almost equal level of UNDESD awareness 
between educators and practitioners suggests information sources other than HEIs, 
such as international conferences and global political debates platforms. Educators 
and practitioners have access to these fora which may typically elude the students. 
Consequently, sustainability literacy could be enhanced by increased participation in 
international conferences and access to global political issues.

Score on Sustainability Literacy Test 
Sustainability literacy test provides a means of expressing the sustainability 
knowledge of an individual or community. The test is a recurring instrument for gauging 
sustainability literacy in sustainability education research (Zwickle et al., 2014). 
Although there are no universally fixed questions on a sustainability quiz, the test is 
usually framed around sustainability themes and typically contextualised (Kieu et al., 
2016). The Nigerian engineering community performed poorly on the sustainability 
literacy test. The results of the test show no significant differences in the performance 
based on category, although practitioners performed slightly better than educators and 
students respectively. Nonetheless, across the sustainability topics, a notable disparity 
exists in the performance of the community. Practitioners evince relative strength in 
economic and social topics, whilst educators and students are strong in environmental 
and crosscutting themes respectively. Variation in topic familiarity is also noted with 
economic themes being the most familiar topics followed by social, environmental and 
crosscutting topics. The least known topics across the board are crosscutting issues; 
hence the need to emphasise them in an intervention. 
Practical experience could account for the excelling of practitioners on the economic 
and social issues. In the course of executing various engineering works, practitioners 
typically deal with economic and sometimes social costs of a project. Such exposure 
to project development issues in real-world settings might explain the relatively good 
performance of the practitioners on the economic and social questions. Contrastingly, 
the reason for the difference in the performances of educators and students on the 
environmental and crosscutting questions is unclear. Perhaps educators are more 
cognisant of environmental concerns from interactions with their non-engineering 
environmental colleagues or from access to local environmental politics. Nevertheless, 
educators’ skewed familiarity with environmental topics could not have resulted from 
any sustainability education efforts considering students’ relatively poor performance 
on the theme. In the same vein, the outperformance of the students on the crosscutting 
questions may have been due to guesswork. Students’ tendencies to ignore the ‘don’t 
know’ option on a true/false/don’t know question format increases their chances of 
guessing some answers right. For the crosscutting questions, fewer students ticked 
the ‘don’t know’ option, which suggests that their relatively higher score on the theme 
could be mere serendipity.

Self-Assessment of Sustainability Knowledge 
Self-assessment of sustainability knowledge enabled Nigerian engineering community 
to reflect on their sustainability knowledge with a view to offering an evaluation. Using 
the sustainability literacy test as a criterion, the self-assessment tool provided an 
opportunity to check test scores against perceived knowledge. Difference between 
perceived knowledge and actual knowledge is a recognised phenomenon in cognitive 
research (Brinol and Petty, 2012). Three theories for bias of knowledge self-
assessment are self-esteem, frame of reference and personal relevance of the topic. 
With the exception of personal relevance which is positively correlated to actual 
knowledge, self-esteem and reference group have positive and negative correlations 
to actual knowledge (Radecki and Jaccard, 1995). A high self-esteem is likely to result 
in an overestimation of knowledge and vice versa. However, low self-esteem at times 
yields unwarranted knowledge claims in a process called defensive self-esteem 
mechanism. Reference affects perceived knowledge by contrast or assimilation. When 
individuals contrast their knowledge within a reference group, a claim to more 
knowledge is likely if the peer being compared to is deemed less informed; the 
converse is also true. Assimilation arises when people assert the knowledge level of 
their peers. The personal relevance theory assumes that personal importance of a 
topic heightens perceived knowledge.   
In the case of Nigerian engineering community, self-rating of sustainability knowledge 
is averagely low. However, educators and practitioners claim greater knowledge of 
sustainability than students. This difference in sustainability knowledge perception can 
be explained by either the self-esteem or frame of reference theories. Explanation from 
personal relevance of the topic is ruled out as results show no significant relationship 
between sustainability import and perceived sustainability knowledge (p ≤ 0.05). 
Although the self-esteem of Nigerian engineering community was not directly 
measured, it may explain the self-assurance manifest in educators’ self-assessment 
of sustainability knowledge. Educators have a general tendency to exhibit high self-
esteem (Mustaq et al., 2012; Terra, Marziale and Robazzi, 2013) based on several 
factors including academic qualification. Since the minimum requirement for a 
lecturing position in Nigeria is a master’s degree (BMAS, 2014), engineering educators 
might have been constrained to claim sustainability knowledge in justification of their 
educational status. With regards to practitioners’ high estimation of their sustainability 
153 
 
knowledge, the frame of reference theory could be at work. Lending credence to this 
assertion is the fact that participants for the practitioner category in the study were 
recruited mainly from professional associations and groups. Engineering professionals 
filling out a survey in the same room is an archetypal setting for assimilation effect, 
and may have influenced the sustainability self-assessment of the practitioner cohort.  
Some Unexpected Findings 
Low Familiarity with Environmental Topics 
An unexpected outcome of the study is the low score on environmental questions 
featured in the sustainability literacy test. Studies have often reported environment as 
the most dominant sustainability theme in engineering education (Hanning et al., 2012; 
Watson et al., 2013; UNESCO, 2014). Furthermore, the fairly long-standing tradition 
of teaching environmental topics in Nigeria equally increased optimism in a positive 
outcome for the environmental themes. Thus, the lack of familiarity with contextual 
environmental issues shown by the Nigerian engineering community is unanticipated. 
However, it is possible that environmental education has been restricted to only 
environmental engineering students and not covered in the common courses. In this 
case, non-environmental students will not benefit from lessons on the environment. 
This might also explain the poor performance of the majority amongst educators and 
practitioners, being products of the same education system. This finding has important 
implication for sustainability education as it suggests the possibility of environmental 
issues not being adequately addressed by Nigerian engineers in the field. Hence, 
sustainability education intervention for Nigeria should not take environmental learning 
as a given in engineering curriculum.  
Fewer Students Admit Adequate Sustainability Knowledge 
Fewer students than expected claimed adequate knowledge of sustainability. This 
contrasts with findings of many studies which show that students, more often than not, 
overestimate their actual knowledge (Lundeberg et al., 2000; Yadav et al., 2011). 
Consequently, having about 8 in 10 students (81%) admitting inadequate sustainability 
knowledge is remarkable, but also reassuring. Students might have been persuaded 
to be more open about their sustainability knowledge by the apparent research 
objective of introducing sustainability into the Nigerian engineering education. This 
154 
 
information might have encouraged them to genuinely admit ignorance of 
sustainability in the hope of benefiting from an introductory course on engineering 
sustainability. Indeed, the results of a sustainable engineering workshop survey 
conducted in the present research support this claim (Chapter Ten). This finding is 
important as it implies that students are willing to learn about sustainability. Thus, a 
sustainability education intervention for Nigerian engineering curriculum could draw 
strength from such potential.  
Students’ Sustainability Knowledge: Two Data Sets 
In the study by Zwickle et al (2014) reviewed in the present research (see Chapter 
Two), the outcome of a sustainability test administered to a student population at The 
Ohio State University was presented. As previously stated, the test had a total average 
assessment score of 69%, which could be construed as the sustainability literacy of 
the students. The assessment scores for the economic, environmental and social 
domains were 71%, 73% and 61% respectively. There were significant differences in 
the performances of freshmen, sophomores and juniors. Of the three student groups, 
the freshmen were the least sustainability literate. It is noteworthy that a few of the 
questions posed to The Ohio State University students were equally featured on the 
sustainability test administered to the Nigerian engineering students. Precisely, Q1 - 
Ozone layer protects us from acid rain and temperature fluctuations and Q8 - Long-
term profitability is the most commonly used definition of economic sustainability 
appeared on both tests. Consequently, comparing the results from the two data sets 
may provide some interesting insights. 
In terms of general sustainability literacy and with a mean score of 20%, the Nigerian 
engineering students seem less knowledgeable than the students from The Ohio State 
University. Equally, twice as many Nigerian engineering students as The Ohio State 
University students provided the correct answers to the economic questions. Similarly, 
the percentage of the Nigerian students who answered the environmental questions 
correctly was one-third of the percentage of The Ohio State University students who 
did likewise. Furthermore, more Ohio State University students responded correctly to 
the social questions than the Nigerian engineering students. Since the crosscutting 
questions were not posed to the Ohio students, there is no basis for comparison with 
the Nigerian students. However, an interesting observation is made regarding the two 
155 
 
questions (Q1 and Q8) which featured on both of the sustainability literacy tests. Whilst 
merely 10% of the Nigerian students answered Q1 correctly, an overwhelming 92.1% 
of the Ohio students provided the correct answer to the question. For Q8, more than 
half (51.7%) of the Nigerian students responded correctly, which is in contrast to the 
less than half (46.3%) of the Ohio students that answered the question correctly.   
To make sense of these facts, it is instructive to note that the sample composition of 
The Ohio State University comprises both engineering and non-engineering students. 
The Nigerian sample consists strictly of engineering students. Although the sample 
sizes differ (Nigeria: n=232; Ohio: n=1,389), this may not be significant given the 
conventional sample size minimum requirement of n=100 for a 95% confidence level. 
In any event, the comparison between the two data sets demonstrates that there is, 
on average, a higher sustainability literacy amongst the students from The Ohio State 
University than amongst the Nigerian students. The involvement of non-engineering 
students from the Ohio State University may have influenced the outcome of the test. 
Social science students are likely to be more exposed to sustainability issues than 
engineering students. However, not all the sustainability concepts are familiar to the 
students of the US-based institution. Obviously, the Nigerian engineering students are 
more aware of some sustainability basics than The Ohio State University students as 
evidenced by their performance on Q8. Hence, sustainability education intervention 
should not proceed with the assumption that the students in the developed world are 
necessarily more sustainability literate than their counterparts in the rest of the world. 
The implication for Nigeria is that any means of intervention must be context-based. 
Limitations 
Some limitations are acknowledged in the study. One of these challenges involves the 
quantification of sustainability literacy based on level of UNDESD awareness. This 
cognisance gauge assumes that the 10-year global plan of educating the world for 
sustainability somehow influences sustainability literacy. Such association between 
sustainability literacy and level of UNDESD awareness may not be necessarily 
accurate. Often, people benefit from policy outcomes with whose guiding framework 
they are not conversant. Thus, it is conceivable for the engineering community in 
Nigeria to be sustainability literate without being aware of UNDESD. However, the 
chances of such occurrence in the community are quite slim as the results eventually 
156 
 
showed: level of UNDESD awareness did not differ significantly from scores on the 
sustainability literacy test. Hence, UNDESD awareness is an appropriate contributor 
to sustainability literacy, and thus an important variable in the present study. 
Another challenge of the study is limitation due to the constraints of the designed 
sustainability literacy test. As already highlighted in Chapter Five, the design of the 
sustainability literacy test was constrained by time and testable content. To achieve a 
balance between these factors, the ‘true/false/don’t know’ question format was 
adopted featuring some 15 questions across 4 sustainability themes. This questioning 
style is prone to guesswork, but useful for addressing a wide-range of issues and for 
examining conceptual knowledge (Building, 2017). Although the inclusion of ‘don’t 
know’ option had been intended to forestall conjecture, it is not a perfect 
countermeasure. Respondents can ignore the option and alternate arbitrarily between 
the true and false choices. However, such question-answering pattern was not 
observed in the data in any significant proportions. Additionally, focus on sustainability 
basics corresponds with the strength of the test format in aiding assessment of 
conceptual knowledge and consequently suitable for the study. Nonetheless, for 
examining deeper sustainability knowledge the online international sustainability 
literacy test, Sulitest (SLT, 2016) could be employed.   
Summary 
An assessment of the sustainability literacy of the Nigerian engineering community 
was conducted based on three criteria: level of UNDESD awareness; performance on 
a sustainability literacy test; and self-assessment of sustainability knowledge, and 
across three groups: students; educators; and practitioners. The categorical data 
resulting from these surveys were analysed and subsequently synthesised to 
holistically gauge the sustainability literacy level of Nigerian engineering community. 
From these analyses a number of findings ensued as presented and discussed in this 
chapter. Some of the main outcomes of the assessment are recapped.  
Firstly, the Nigerian engineering community was found to generally exhibit a very low 
sustainability literacy with a significant majority (>70%) performing abysmally on all 
the assessment criteria. Secondly, there was an evidence of widespread ignorance of 
the UNDESD within the Nigerian engineering community with students being the most 
uniformed. Thirdly, Nigerian engineering community were more familiar with economic 
157 
 
topics as more than two-fifths of them (42%) passed the economic questions featured 
on the sustainability literacy test. Fourthly, the least known sustainability themes 
across the board were the crosscutting issues. Finally, some unexpected findings of 
the study were little familiarity with environmental themes and sincerity of the students 
in admitting sustainability illiteracy.    
Although, on the whole, the findings highlighted in this chapter indicate the need for a 
sustainability education intervention, it is crucial to assess the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum for its sustainability content. This will facilitate identification of sustainability 
knowledge gaps related to curricular content. To this end, the sustainability content of 
the Nigerian engineering curriculum is addressed in Chapter Six.

6  Sustainability Content of Nigerian 
Engineering Curriculum 
 
Introduction 
 
This chapter addresses the question: What is the sustainability content of the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum? Answers to the question were derived from a documentary 
analysis of three engineering manuals including the BMAS document, and engineering 
handbooks of two Nigerian higher education institutions, labelled HEI-1 and HEI-2. 
Perspectives of engineering stakeholders in the HEIs (n=316) were equally sought to 
complement the documentary analysis. The documents and views were tested against 
a priori codes obtained from the expert-derived sustainability themes (Chapter Four). 
Underlying the assessments was whether sustainability topics were covered or 
mentioned in the engineering curriculum. The chapter proceeds by presenting results 
of the documentary analyses followed by those of the stakeholder surveys. The results 
are subsequently synthesised to estimate the sustainability content of the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum. The Nigerian engineering curriculum was subsequently 
contrasted with the UCL engineering curriculum. The chapter ends with a discussion 
of the findings and limitations of the study.

Engineering Documents  
BMAS for Engineering  
The BMAS document was analysed for its sustainability content based on 4 
sustainability themes: economic, environmental, social and crosscutting topics. The 
results of the analysis are presented in the succeeding sections.  
Economic Content 
Figure 6.1 shows the spread of economic themes across 31 engineering programmes 
contained in the BMAS document. Only 12 programmes covered 5 of 6 economic 
topics with one economic theme, namely GNP, not mentioned in any of the 
programmes. There was no engineering programme that featured all the economic 
topics. However, the economic concept of accountability was covered in the common 
engineering courses. A recurring economic theme in the BMAS was production & 
consumption patterns. This theme occurred four times in chemical engineering 
courses and once each in agricultural, biomedical, civil, communications, gas, 
mechanical, and mining engineering as well as in petrochemical, petroleum, and wood 
products engineering courses. Hence, 16% of the potential BMAS economic content 
featured in the document, which corresponded to 0.65% of the BMAS (Table 6.1).

Environmental Content 
The environmental content of the BMAS document is shown in Figure 6.2. Across the 
engineering programmes, 5 of 9 environmental themes featured in only 11 disciplines 
with environmental engineering covering up to 4 topics. Engineering disciplines which 
covered at least one of the 5 featured themes included civil, chemical, mechanical, 
mechatronics, and metallurgical engineering. Others were mining, petrochemical, 
petroleum, and public health engineering courses. Four environmental themes were 
completely absent in all of the programmes. Pollution was the prevalent environmental 
theme occurring 13 times in the document. The BMAS featured about 8% of the 
potential environmental content corresponding to 0.57% of the document (Table 6.2).

Social Content 
Figure 6.3 and Table 6.3 show the spread of the social concepts in the engineering 
programmes. Only 4 out of 12 social topics were mentioned in 9 programmes with 
health & safety being the most recurring theme. Eight social themes did not feature in 
any of the courses. Thus, just about 3% of the potential social content, which was 
equivalent to 0.45% of the BMAS document, featured in the engineering programmes.

Crosscutting Content 
The distribution of the crosscutting themes within the BMAS involved 7 engineering 
disciplines as shown in Figure 6.4. Only 4 of 10 cross-cutting topics were addressed. 
The themes of communication, reporting, ethics & philosophy featured most frequently 
in the programmes. Six cross-cutting themes did not appear in any of the courses. 
Hence, 6% of the potential crosscutting content corresponding to 0.45% of the BMAS 
was covered in the document (Table 6.4).

BMAS Sustainability Content 
The sustainability content of the BMAS can be determined by collating the results from 
the analysis of the sustainability themes (Table 6.5). The results showed that the 
BMAS document had, on average, an extremely low sustainability content.  Achieving 
only 8% of its potential coverage and contained in merely 2% of the entire document, 
sustainability theme did not receive much attention in the BMAS for engineering. 
However, economic topics were mentioned more than environmental, crosscutting 
and social themes respectively. Social issues were the least addressed themes in the 
BMAS document. Additionally, there was no engineering programme that featured all 
the subtopics of the sustainability themes.

HEI-1 Engineering Handbook  
HEI-1 is a federal university in Nigeria offering 10 engineering programmes domiciled 
in seven departments and also features common courses. The results of the 
sustainability content analysis of its engineering handbook are presented below.  
Economic Content 
The economic content of the HEI-1 engineering handbook was spread across 6 
engineering programmes as shown in Figure 6.5. The most frequently mentioned 
economic theme was production & consumption patterns, which occurred five times 
within three disciplines: chemical, electrical/electronic and mechanical engineering. 
Two themes, namely GNP and resource use & efficiency were not contained in any of 
the engineering programmes. None of the programmes featured more than two 
themes, although accountability and developmental economics were addressed in the 
common courses. Nonetheless, from Table 6.6, about 18% of the potential economic 
content was covered in the handbook, which corresponded to 1.60% of the entire 
engineering document. Thus, the HEI-1 engineering handbook had a somewhat fair 
economic content.

Environmental Content 
Spread of the environmental concepts in the HEI-1 engineering handbook occurred 
across 7 engineering programmes as indicated in Figure 6.6. The themes of resource 
use, energy & water and alternative energy were prevalent in the engineering manual. 
However, 4 of 9 environmental themes did not appear in any of the programmes. The 
exclusions were climate change, resource ecoefficiency, biodiversity and products & 
toxic wastes. Interestingly, environmental engineering, even though, covered all the 5 
featured themes, also failed to include the three omissions. Overall, a significant part 
of the potential environmental content (31%), equivalent to 4% of the engineering 
handbook, was attained in the document (Table 6.7).

Social Content 
The results of the social content of the HEI-1 engineering handbook are presented in 
Figure 6.7 and Table 6.8. With the exception of health & safety and employment, no 
social topic was mentioned in the handbook. These 2 of 12 social themes were 
covered in 6 engineering programmes with only electrical and electronics engineering 
featuring employment issues. In general, the social content of the HEI-1 engineering 
handbook was quite low with merely 5% of its potential attained, which equated to 
about 1% of the whole engineering document.

Crosscutting Content 
Crosscutting concepts were spread across 7 fields in the HEI-1 engineering handbook 
(Figure 6.8 and Table 6.9). However, only half of the themes were mentioned with 
communication & reporting and ethics & philosophy being prevalent. Three of the 
featured themes appeared in the common courses whilst 4 topics were contained in 
metallurgical engineering. Generally, the crosscutting theme had 15% of its potential 
content, corresponding to 0.85% of the entire engineering handbook, covered.

HEI-1 Engineering Handbook Sustainability Content 
Table 6.10 presents a summary of the sustainability content of HEI-1 engineering 
handbook. The results showed that the engineering handbook had a generally low 
sustainability content with just 17% potential attained, i.e. 7% of the HEI-1 engineering 
handbook. Nonetheless, environmental themes were the most frequently mentioned 
topics accounting for half of the document’s sustainability coverage. In addition, the 
crosscutting themes had the least coverage (0.85%), but the social concepts were the 
least dispersed across the disciplines. Interestingly, metallurgical & materials 
engineering featured at least one subtheme of all the sustainability themes.

HEI-2 Engineering Handbook  
HEI-2 is a higher education institution in Nigeria which offers three engineering 
programmes. The succeeding sections present the results of the sustainability content 
analysis of the institution’s engineering handbook.  
Economic Content 
Economic concepts were poorly featured in the HEI-2 engineering handbook as shown 
in Figure 6.9 and Table 6.11. Only the subtheme of accountability was contained in 
the document by two disciplines, namely civil and electrical/electronic engineering, and 
the common courses. Based on the potential economic content of the curriculum, only 
a fraction (12%), corresponding to 0.60% of the document, was featured.

Environmental Content 
The distribution of environmental themes in the HEI-2 engineering handbook occurred 
across two disciplines as indicated in Figure 6.10. Four of 9 environmental themes 
featured chiefly in civil engineering courses with only resource use, energy & water 
mentioned in electrical & electronics engineering. Overall, the environmental coverage 
of the engineering handbook was low at 14% potential content and 1% of the 
document (Table 6.12).

Social Content 
The HEI-2 engineering handbook featured 3 of 12 social themes (Figure 6.11). Only 
civil engineering and common courses contained these topics. Thus, the social 
coverage of the engineering handbook was low as just 12% of its potential content 
(equivalent to 0.66% of the handbook) was attained (Table 6.13).

Crosscutting Content 
Four crosscutting themes spread across the four engineering programmes contained 
in HEI-2 engineering handbook as indicated in Figure 6.12. The subtheme of ethics & 
philosophy recurred in all the programmes. In terms of potential content, the 
crosscutting themes attained about one-fifth (20%) coverage corresponding to 1.33% 
of the whole engineering handbook (Table 6.14).

HEI-2 Engineering Handbook Sustainability Content 
Table 6.15 presents a summary of the sustainability content of HEI-2 engineering 
handbook. The results showed that the engineering handbook had a generally low 
sustainability content barely attaining 15% of its potential content, equivalent to 4% of 
the engineering document. However, crosscutting themes were the most recurring 
topics with subthemes cited in all three engineering programmes including the 
common engineering courses. The discipline of mechanical engineering featured only 
one subtheme of the crosscutting concepts. 
Table 6.15. Sustainability coverage of HEI-2 engineering handbook 
 
Stakeholder Views 
Perception of students and educators on the sustainability content of the engineering 
curriculum operated in their HEIs was analysed. The results of the analysis are 
presented in the succeeding sections. The five responses featured on the Likert scale, 
namely not at all, slightly, moderately, strongly and to a great extent were reduced to 
three categories and notated thus: ɸ1-2 = “not at all” and “slightly” responses; ɸ3 = 
“moderately” responses, and ɸ4-5 =  “strongly” and “to a great extent” responses. 
HEI-1 Student Perception (n=137) 
A total of 137 engineering students of HEI-1 responded to the curricular sustainability 
content questions. The survey sought the opinions of the students on the economic, 
environmental, social and crosscutting contents of the engineering curriculum used in 
their institution.

Economic Content 
Results showed that HEI-1 engineering students had varied views about the coverage 
of economic concepts in the engineering courses (Table 6.16). Nearly half of the 
students (45.7%) were convinced that resource use was covered “strongly” or “to a 
great extent” in engineering lessons. However, GNP was perceived as the least 
addressed economic theme in the curriculum as over half of the students (57.3%) 
stated that the subtheme was either “not included at all” or “slightly” mentioned. 
Overall, one-third of the students (33%) considered economic sustainability concepts 
as adequately addressed in the engineering courses.  
Table 6.16. HEI-1Student perspective on curricular economic content 
 
 
Environmental Content 
HEI-1 engineering students viewed the environmental content of engineering courses 
variously (Table 6.17). The most recognised environmental themes were pollution and 
policy & admin with two-fifths (41%) of the students suggesting a “strong” or “to a great 
extent” inclusion. Conversely, the engineering students considered the subthemes of 
biodiversity, climate change and alternative energy as least addressed topics in 
engineering lectures. On average, a little over one-third of the students (33.9%) 
thought that environmental topics were seriously addressed in the engineering 
curriculum.

Social Content 
Perception of HEI-1 engineering students on the incorporation of social concepts in 
engineering courses was diverse, but significantly skewed towards non-inclusion 
(Table 6.18). A sizeable number of students thought that nearly all the subthemes of 
the social concept were either “slightly” or completely excluded from the courses. In 
particular, over half of the students opined that culture & religion (56%), bribery & 
corruption (52%) and poverty (51%) were not addressed in engineering lectures. Only 
the subtheme of education & training was considered by a good proportion of the 
students (39%) as reasonably addressed in the courses. Overall, almost half of the 
HEI-1 engineering students (46%) perceived the social content of engineering lectures 
as very poor.

Crosscutting Content 
Views on the crosscutting content of engineering lectures at HEI-1 varied amongst 
engineering students (Table 6.19). For instance, a good proportion of the students 
(39%) indicated that sustainable development was either “strongly” addressed or 
mentioned “to a great extent” in the lectures. Such positive view, however, was not 
held for the remaining crosscutting themes. Over half of the students (54%) signified 
failure to learn much about people as part of nature from the engineering lessons. 
Other subthemes of the crosscutting topic which were also poorly acknowledged by a 
good number of the students included holistic thinking (48%), ethics& philosophy 
(39.5%) communication & reporting (38.8%), and systems thinking (38%). On the 
whole, 4 in 10 students (40%) expressed low opinion of the crosscutting content of the 
engineering courses.

educators suggested that resource use (58%) and production & consumption patterns 
(51%) were addressed “strongly” or “to a great extent” in engineering lectures. 
Developmental economics was least acknowledged with a significant proportion of the 
educators (43.6%) indicating that the subtheme was either “slightly” mentioned or “not 
at all” discussed in engineering lessons. Nonetheless, a sizeable number of the 
engineering educators (40.9%) expressed a strongly positive view of the economic 
content of the engineering courses. 
Table 6.20. HEI-1 Educator perspective on curricular economic content 
 
 
Environmental Content 
There was a difference of opinion amongst the engineering educators at HEI-1 on the 
environmental content of engineering courses (Table 6.21). However, a relatively 
positive outlook prevailed in the perceived coverage of the environmental themes. 
Almost two-thirds of the educators (60%) considered the subtheme of resource 
depletion as strongly addressed in engineering lectures. Similarly, the subtopic of 
alternative energy was viewed as adequately covered by over half of the engineering 
educators (54.5%). Nevertheless, biodiversity and land use subthemes were largely 
unacknowledged by the educators with half (48%) and two-fifths (38%) of them opting 
for either “slightly” or “not at all” responses respectively. Overall, the outlook of 
engineering educators on the environmental content of engineering courses at HEI-1 
was somewhat optimistic at 45% perceived coverage.

Social Content 
HEI-1 engineering educators viewed the social content of engineering courses 
differently (Table 6.22). Over half of the educators (56.4%) admitted strong treatment 
or coverage of education & training in engineering lessons. Not less than forty percent 
(40%) of the educators considered the subthemes of bribery & corruption and culture 
& religion as poorly addressed in the courses. In addition, almost half of the educators 
(45.5%) thought that politics and equity & justice were not seriously acknowledged. 
On the whole, about one-third of the educators (32%) perceived social concepts as 
either “strongly” taught or addressed “to a great extent” in engineering lectures.

Crosscutting Content 
Opinions of HEI-1 engineering educators on the coverage of crosscutting themes in 
engineering lectures diverged (Table 6.23). Almost two-thirds of the educators (60%) 
claimed to have strongly addressed the subthemes of communication & reporting and 
transparency in design in their engineering lessons. With the exception of governance 
and ethics & philosophy subtopics, the remaining themes of the crosscutting concept 
were considered adequately covered in engineering lectures by a large proportion of 
the educators (between 45% and 57%). Averagely, over half of the HEI-1 educators 
(51.9%) were satisfied with the crosscutting content of the engineering courses.

the sustainability content of engineering courses at the institution. The results showed 
that students and educators perceived the sustainability content of engineering 
courses somewhat differently. Whilst most educators thought that crosscutting themes 
featured strongly in the lectures, students largely acknowledged the environmental 
concepts.  The economic theme was considered by the students and educators as the 
third and second most addressed topics respectively. Nevertheless, students and 
educators both agreed that social concepts were the least featured issues in 
engineering lectures. In terms of the combined results, a sizeable proportion of the 
HEI-1 stakeholders (40%) considered environmental and crosscutting themes as

strongly addressed in the engineering courses. Furthermore, more than one-third of 
the stakeholders (37%) positively regarded the economic content of the courses. 
However, fewer HEI-1 engineering stakeholders (28%) perceived the engineering 
lessons as adequately addressing the social concepts. Interestingly, more than half of 
the educators (51.6%) and just over a quarter of the students (26.7%) thought the 
engineering lessons strongly addressed crosscutting sustainability themes. Overall, 
not up to one-third of the stakeholders (31.3%) had a strongly positive impression of 
the sustainability content of engineering courses in HEI-1.

HEI-2 Student Perception (n=95) 
Ninety-five HEI-2 engineering students participated in the survey on the sustainability 
content of engineering courses. The students’ perspectives on extent of economic, 
environmental, social and crosscutting coverage in the engineering courses are 
presented in the following sections.  
Economic Content 
The perception of HEI-2 engineering students on the economic content of engineering 
lessons in their institution varied (Table 6.25). Very few students thought that 
economic concepts were featured “strongly” or “to a great extent” in the engineering 
lectures. Only a small minority of the students (12.6%) perceived the subthemes of 
GNP and finances as satisfactorily addressed in the lessons. However, more than half 
of the students (51.6%) stated that the subtopic of accountability was either slightly” 
addressed or “not at all” mentioned in engineering lectures. With a positive response 
average of 21.4%, HEI-2 engineering students had a generally low opinion of the 
economic content of engineering courses in their institution.

Environmental Content 
Engineering students at HEI-2 expressed divergent views on the environmental 
content of engineering courses (Table 6.26). Over two-fifths of them (43.2%) opined 
that alternative energy was adequately addressed in the lectures. Additionally, the 
subtheme of resource depletion was considered by a good proportion of students 
(39%) to be adequately discussed in engineering lessons. Fewer students thought the 
engineering lectures sufficiently addressed products & services (13.7%), biodiversity 
(15.8%), and climate change (27.3%). In general, the perspective of the engineering 
students on the coverage of environmental sustainability themes in the engineering 
courses was negative. Just over a quarter (28.8%) of the students felt that the courses 
addressed environmental issues.

Social Content 
HEI-2 engineering students expressed varying standpoints on the social content of 
engineering courses (Table 6.27). The majority of them (≥53%) were not impressed 
by the spread of several social subthemes. Only the social subtopic of education & 
training was perceived by over one-third of the students (35.8%) as featuring “strongly” 
or “to a great extent” in lectures. The least addressed social themes as perceived by 
the engineering students were demography, bribery & corruption, culture & religion, 
politics and poverty. Remarkably, almost half of the engineering students thought that 
health & safety (47.4%) and peace & security were either “slightly” discussed or “not 
at all” mentioned in the lessons. Overall, only a small minority of the engineering 
students (18.3%) had a high opinion of the social content of the engineering courses.

Crosscutting Content 
Crosscutting Content 
There was no unanimous view on the crosscutting content of engineering courses 
(Table 6.28). An appreciable number of the students [34%, 38%] indicated that the 
subtopics of responsibility, communication & reporting and transparency in design 
featured “strongly” or “to a great extent” in their lectures. Contrastingly, over half of the 
students (52.6%) failed to acknowledge the coverage of holistic thinking in the 
engineering lessons. On the whole, just over a quarter of the HEI-2 students (28.8%) 
expressed satisfaction with the crosscutting content of the engineering courses.

HEI-2 Educator Perception (n=29) 
Twenty-nine HEI-2 engineering educators responded to the curricular sustainability 
survey. The succeeding sections present the results of the survey based on economic, 
environmental, social and crosscutting themes.  
Economic Content 
Engineering educators at HEI-2 had varying perspectives on the economic content of 
engineering courses (Table 6.29). The most acknowledged economic theme was 
resource use with half of the educators (48.3%) admitting discussing the subtopic in 
lectures. On the other hand, developmental economics subtheme was considered by 
over half of the educators (51.7%) as featuring either slightly” or “not at all” in their 
teaching. Generally, a considerable number of the educators (38%) claimed to have 
covered economic topics in engineering lectures.

Environmental Content 
The perspectives of HEI-2 engineering educators diverged on the environmental 
content of engineering courses (Table 6.30). Most of the educators (48.3%) indicated 
that the subtheme of alternative energy was covered in their teaching. The subtopic of 
biodiversity was, however, the least acknowledged environmental theme as barely 
one-fifth of the educators (20.7%) stated it was strongly addressed. Nonetheless, over 
one-third of the HEI-2 educators (36.8%) largely agreed that environmental concepts 
were intensely treated in engineering lessons.  
 
Table 6.30. HEI-2 Educator perspective on curricular environmental content 
 
 
 
Social Content 
Opinions of HEI-2 educators varied on the social content of engineering courses 
(Table 6.31). Only education & training and labour & human right were considered as 
adequately stressed in engineering lessons by two-fifths of the educators (40%). Just 
over one-third of the educators (34%) had a strongly positive opinion about treating 
bribery & corruption, diversity & cohesion, and equity & justice in engineering lectures. 
Interestingly, more than half of the educators agreed to have “slightly” highlighted 
issues of culture & religion in lectures. Overall, less than one-third of the educators 
(31%) admitted teaching social topics “to a great extent” or “strongly” during lessons.

Crosscutting Content 
The treatment of crosscutting concepts in engineering lectures was viewed variously 
by HEI-2 engineering educators (Table 6.32). The majority of the educators (≥55%) 
admitted featuring the subthemes of governance, responsibility, and transparency in 
design “strongly” or “to a great extent” in lectures. About half of the educators (48.4%) 
claimed to have addressed the subtopics of systems thinking and communication & 
reporting. Nonetheless, long-term thinking was thought to have featured “slightly” or 
“not at all” in engineering lessons by over two-fifths of the educators (41.3%). On 
average, nearly half of the educators (47%) regarded the coverage of crosscutting 
concepts in engineering lessons as highly accomplished.

Collation of HEI-2 Perspectives 
The perspectives of HEI-2 engineering stakeholders on the sustainability content of 
engineering courses are collated in Table 6.33.  Stakeholders expressed a difference 
of opinion on the sustainability content of engineering lessons. More educators than 
students considered crosscutting themes as covered “strongly” or “to a great extent” 
in lectures. The students were of the view that environmental topics received the most 
attention. Perspectives of educators and students on the economic theme split into 
second and third most featured topic respectively. Social topic was commonly seen as 
least highlighted in engineering lessons. However, considering the mean percentages, 
over one-third of stakeholders (37.7%) thought highly of the crosscutting content. 
About one-third (32.8%) viewed environmental theme as strongly cited in lectures, 
whilst barely 30% perceived economic theme likewise. Only a quarter of the 
stakeholders (24.9%) were content by the mention of social topics. Largely, over a 
third of the stakeholders (36%) acclaimed the sustainability content of HEI-2 
engineering courses.

Table 6.34 and Table 6.35 summarise the results of the content analyses. Mentions 
of sustainability themes differed in emphasis from one theme to another across the 
documents. In the BMAS document, for example, economic theme had the highest 
percentage coverage, which differed from HEI-1 and HEI-2 engineering handbooks 
that emphasised environmental and crosscutting topics respectively. Social theme 
received second lowest coverage in both HEI-1 and HEI-2 engineering handbooks, 
and worst coverage in the BMAS document.  Crosscutting and economic themes were

the worst covered sustainability topics in HEI-1 and HEI-2 engineering handbooks 
respectively. Largely, sustainability themes were featured mainly in non-core courses 
such as engineering management. Only the BMAS document explicitly mentioned 
sustainability competence as a learning outcome for an engineering graduate. Overall, 
the sustainability content of the programmes based on the documentary analysis was 
low at a mean spread of 4.3% (13.37% average potential content).

Perceived Sustainability Content  
Perspectives of HEI-1 and HEI-2 engineering community are collated in Table 6.36. 
With the exception of crosscutting and environmental themes, there was an almost 
one-to-one match in the stakeholders’ perspectives on the coverage of sustainability 
themes in engineering courses. The difference manifested in the consideration of 
environmental theme by HEI-1 engineering community as having received the most 
attention in the courses. HEI-2 engineering stakeholders, by contrast, thought it was 
the crosscutting theme. Both groups of stakeholders, however, agreed that the social 
theme was the least mentioned sustainability topic in engineering lessons, followed by 
the economic theme. Based on the mean percentages of the themes, almost two-fifths 
of the stakeholders [36.3%, 38.5%] viewed environmental and crosscutting topics as 
addressed “strongly” or “to a great extent” in engineering teaching. Economic theme 
was perceived as featuring “strongly” or “to a great extent” in the lectures by one-third 
of the stakeholders (33.4%). Just over a quarter of the stakeholders (26.6%) thought 
social topics were adequately addressed in engineering lectures. On the whole, one-
third of the stakeholders (33.7%) regarded sustainability topics as contained “strongly” 
or “to a great extent” in engineering curriculum.

Harmonised Sustainability Content  
Table 6.37 summarises the result of sustainability content analysis of engineering 
documents and stakeholders’ perspectives. With a mere 13.37% average potential 
documentary coverage and 33.7% ɸ4-5 mean perceived content, the sustainability 
content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum was largely unsatisfactory. Evidently, 
a significant majority of the stakeholders agreed on the poor content of sustainability 
themes in engineering studies. Nonetheless, for comparative purposes a ranking of 
the sustainability themes based on the percentage of sustainability content was 
derived from the documentary and perceptive analyses. The documentary analysis 
showed that environmental themes had, on average, the most coverage followed in 
turn by economic, crosscutting and social concepts. In terms of the mean perceived 
content, on the other hand, the crosscutting topics ranked highest trailed by the 
environmental, economic, and social themes respectively. 
Table 6.37. Content-wise ranking of sustainability themes 
 
In Table 6.38 a harmonised ranking of the sustainability themes is presented. From 
the results, sustainability concepts dispersed within the engineering curriculum with 
more environmental themes than crosscutting concepts. Similarly, crosscutting issues 
appeared in the curriculum more than economic themes. Lastly, the curriculum 
contained less social topics than economic concepts.

Sustainability Content of UCL Engineering Curriculum  
Although there is no explicit reference to sustainability as an objective of the UCL IEP, 
it will be interesting to evaluate the spread of sustainability themes in the UCL 
engineering curriculum. Given that the UCL IEP model is considered world leading in 
engineering education (Graham, 2018), a comparison of its sustainability content with 
that of the Nigerian engineering curriculum could be illuminating. In the following 
sections, the results of an assessment of the sustainability content of the UCL 
engineering curriculum are presented. 
Economic Content 
Economic concepts were featured unevenly in the UCL engineering curriculum (Figure 
6.13 and Table 6.39). GNP did not appear in any of the engineering programmes. The 
most frequent subtheme was finances, which was cited 12 times in the UCL IEP 
minors and four times in UCL Biochemical Engineering. The subtopic of 
developmental economics was mentioned at least once in all the core engineering 
courses. There was a slight mention of economic concepts in the core disciplines of 
UCL Electronic and Electrical and UCL Mechanical Engineering. Generally, economic 
concepts had a reasonable presence in the UCL IEP minors. However, the UCL 
engineering curriculum had a modest economic content with about 3% of the 
curriculum featuring economic topics.

Environmental Content 
The presence of environmental concepts in the UCL engineering curriculum varied 
(Figure 6.14 and Table 6.40). The most cited environmental subtopic was policy & 
admin, appearing 18 times in the engineering programmes. The subtheme of climate 
change only featured in the UCL IEP minors. Pollution was mentioned in all the 
engineering programmes except UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering. With the 
exception of land use, the UCL IEP minors featured all the environmental subthemes 
at least thrice. Overall, environmental concepts appeared 38 times in the UCL IEP 
minors and 78 times in the entire engineering curriculum. Hence, UCL engineering 
curriculum had a considerable environmental content with around 13% of the 
curriculum covering the environmental themes.

Social Content 
Social concepts were spread sparingly in the UCL engineering curriculum (Figure 6.15 
and Table 6.41). The four social subthemes of bribery & corruption, diversity & 
cohesion, education & training, and poverty were absent in the engineering curriculum. 
The most frequent social theme was health & safety, which occurred 21 times in the 
engineering programmes. Five of the 12 social concepts featured in the UCL IEP 
minors. The UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering was bereft of any social topic 
in its core courses. Generally, the social themes appeared 45 times in the UCL 
engineering curriculum, though nearly half of the mentions was in the UCL IEP minors. 
Thus, the social content of the UCL engineering curriculum was not widespread having 
recorded about 2% coverage.

Crosscutting Content 
The coverage of crosscutting concepts in the UCL engineering curriculum is shown in 
Figure 6.16 and Table 6.42. All the 10 crosscutting subthemes appeared at least once 
in the engineering curriculum. Each of the themes was mentioned at least once in the 
UCL IEP minors. Featuring in all the programmes, communication & reporting was the 
most recurring crosscutting topic. Sustainable development was also mentioned in all 
the programmes. The least cited crosscutting concept was people as part of nature as 
it occurred once each in UCL Electronic and Electrical and UCL IEP minors. UCL Civil 
Engineering and UCL Chemical Engineering had a significant coverage of crosscutting 
concepts. Crosscutting themes generally appeared 129 times in the UCL engineering 
curriculum. With more than one-fifth (~22%) of the curriculum devoted to these 
concepts, the engineering curriculum at UCL had a remarkable crosscutting content.

Summary of UCL Engineering Sustainability Content 
The sustainability content of the UCL engineering curriculum can be approximated 
from a collation of the sustainability themes as presented in Table 6.43. A summation 
of the frequencies and percentages of the themes shows that sustainability concepts 
appeared 290 times in the UCL engineering curriculum, corresponding to a 42% of the 
engineering syllabuses. The most frequently mentioned sustainability themes were the 
crosscutting concepts followed by the environmental, social and economic concepts 
respectively. The UCL IEP minors had the highest coverage of sustainability topics 
which appeared 120 times in the interdisciplinary courses. Trailing the UCL IEP minors 
in terms of sustainability coverage were the UCL Civil Engineering and UCL Chemical 
Engineering, with sustainability themes occurring 48 and 40 times respectively. With 
only nine mentions of sustainability themes in its core courses, the UCL Electronic and 
Electrical Engineering had the lowest sustainability content.

Discussion  
Sustainability Content of BMAS and Engineering Handbooks 
Being the official benchmark for engineering programmes in Nigeria, BMAS guides the 
development of engineering curriculum in Nigerian HEIs. Assessing the BMAS for 
sustainability content is therefore crucial to providing a baseline on the coverage of 
sustainability concepts in Nigerian engineering education. Following on from such 
assessment could be analysis of actual engineering handbooks operationalised in the 
HEIs. In this study, HEI-1 and HEI-2 engineering handbooks have been assessed for 
sustainability content alongside the BMAS document. Whilst the BMAS features 30 
engineering programmes, HEI-1 and HEI-2 engineering handbooks contain nine and 
three engineering courses respectively. Averagely, all three documents have shown 
low sustainability content based on the potential sustainability coverage of the 
documents and programmes.  
Studies on sustainability content of engineering curricula in African higher education 
are scant as sustainability is an emerging interest on the continent (UNESCO, 2014). 
However, inadequate sustainability coverage has been reported in some of the few 
studies that have been undertaken. In a generic sustainability study of 69 African 
institutions barely a quarter of the surveyed HEIs (25%) admitted to have integrated 
sustainability themes in their various programmes (GUNi et al., 2011). Similar finding 
is reported in a content analysis of a management course in a Ghanaian polytechnic 
(Etse and Ingley, 2016). Outside the African continent in regions with relatively visible 
sustainability education, studies have generally revealed insufficient sustainability 
coverage, especially in engineering programmes (Lozano and Watson, 2013; Watson, 
et al., 2013). Hence, sustainability education efforts need to be sustained at every 
stage of intervention.  
In the present study sustainability themes are not distributed equally in the engineering 
documents. BMAS, for instance, contains more economic themes than it mentions 
environmental, crosscutting and social concepts respectively. Conversely, HEI-1 
engineering handbook covers more environmental issues than economic, crosscutting 
and social themes respectively. In HEI-2 engineering handbook, crosscutting themes 
feature more than environmental, social and economic concepts. This finding suggests 
that there is no one-to-one match between BMAS sustainability content and 
196 
 
sustainability content of the engineering handbooks. A possible explanation for this 
discrepancy could be the lack of a focused sustainability education agenda in the 
BMAS document. Excepting the nonspecific learning outcome that an engineering 
graduate must have the ability “to consider the environment and sustainability in 
finding solutions to problems” (BMAS, 2014, p.20), the benchmark document has no 
explicit sustainability strategy. Such inexplicit expectation, which is absent in the 
engineering handbooks, coupled with the failure to feature sustainability issues as 
programme requirements might have contributed to the mismatch between the BMAS 
and the engineering handbooks. Thus, to preclude the arbitrary coverage of 
sustainability themes in engineering education a sustainability education intervention 
must be precise, contextual and integrative.  
Stakeholder Perspectives and Engineering Handbooks 
Student and educator perspectives on sustainability content of engineering curriculum 
are important in a sustainability education research of this nature. These data could 
provide useful insight into the effectiveness of engineering curriculum in conveying 
sustainability themes. In addition, the information may either corroborate or contradict 
the emerging perspectives within individual cohorts as well as affirm or disaffirm 
results of the content analysis. Findings of the present study reveal a difference of 
opinion between educators and students on the sustainability content of engineering 
courses. The study also uncovers an instance of dissonance between stakeholders’ 
perspectives and documentary sustainability content. 
From the perspective of HEI-1 educators, sustainability themes sorted by percentage 
coverage begin with crosscutting themes followed by environmental, economic and 
social topics respectively. On the contrary, environmental topics feature before 
economic, crosscutting and social topics based on HEI-1 students’ perspectives. 
Interestingly, results of the documentary analysis of HEI-1 engineering handbook tally 
with the students’ perspectives. For HEI-2 stakeholders, educators perceive 
crosscutting themes to be the most covered followed by economic, environmental, and 
social topics, whilst students stress environmental themes before crosscutting, 
economic, and social topics respectively. HEI-2 engineering handbook does not wholly 
reflect either perspectives except for social themes – decidedly the least cited in all 
instances. 
197 
 
With respect to the dissonance between perspectives of students and educators, 
studies have commonly reported a difference in perception of education amongst 
stakeholders (Ezen, 2014; Könings et al., 2014). Educators and students tend to 
perceive learning environments differently, attributable to a number of factors including 
teaching and learning approaches (Könings et al., 2014). The educators in this study 
might have covered certain aspects of sustainability which could have escaped the 
students, thereby leading to conflicting views. Also, since educators are normally 
restricted to teaching a specific course, it is likely that their perceptions of sustainability 
content will be relative to an assigned course of instruction. Naturally, such perspective 
will differ from that of the students who are beneficiaries of the whole programme.  
Students’ familiarity with curricular content could account for the one-to-one match 
between HEI-1 students’ perspectives and sustainability content of the engineering 
handbook. However, such outcome is not replicated with HEI-2 students, which 
indicates a gap between the HEI-2 stakeholders and documentary sustainability 
content. Mismatch between learners’ perception and course content has been 
attributed to an improperly designed curriculum amongst other causes (Stefani, 2015). 
Hence, the conflicting results of the HEI-2 sustainability assessment could be 
explained by a lack of an effective sustainability education curriculum. Generally, the 
dearth of a focused sustainability integration in the engineering curriculum could be 
adduced for the differing sustainability assessment results in the study.  
Harmonised Curricular Sustainability Content  
From the synthesised result of the present research, the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum has a perceived low sustainability content and social sustainability is the 
least addressed theme. However, the outcome of the harmonised results does not 
differ significantly from the findings of several sustainability studies. For instance, early 
sustainability studies on engineering curriculum have reported a low sustainability 
content, especially in pre-intervention situations (Azapagic et al., 2005; EESD-
Observatory, 2006). Where intervention has occurred, studies have shown that 
environmental topics are usually the dominant sustainability themes with social topics 
being poorly cited (Byrne et al., 2010a). Hence the findings of the present research 
agree with numerous sustainability studies. An intervention is, therefore, necessary to 
198 
 
align the Nigerian engineering education with sustainability ideals focusing on a 
balance amongst the sustainability themes. 
The low sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum is not an 
unexpected outcome as no decisive steps have been taken in Nigeria to embed 
sustainability into engineering education. Indeed, the current research was driven by 
the realisation that Nigeria has no extant sustainability education model (see Chapter 
Three). The sparse sustainability concepts found in the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum have come mainly from management and ethics courses – conventional 
units in engineering programmes (Holm et al., 2014). These standard modules are not 
purpose-designed for sustainability and therefore lack the necessary sustainability 
finesse. However, since the courses already feature some sustainability themes, 
sustainability education could subsume them as part of an effective intervention for 
the Nigerian engineering curriculum. This would provide an opportunity for bridging 
the gap in the sustainability content of the curriculum.  
UCL Engineering Sustainability Content 
The UCL engineering curriculum has been shown to have a considerable sustainability 
presence. However, the bulk of the sustainability content is traceable to the UCL IEP 
minors. Intrinsically, the core engineering disciplines are typified by low sustainability 
presence, as in the case of the UCL Electronic and Electrical Engineering which has 
only nine mentions of sustainability, and modest sustainability content, as in the UCL 
Civil Engineering where sustainability themes appear 48 times. It is noteworthy that 
the design and professional skills module accounts for a great deal of the sustainability 
presence in the core disciplines. In addition, the distribution of sustainability themes 
across the UCL IEP minors is not even. Whilst a few of the UCL IEP minors make no 
reference to sustainability issues, most of them cite numerous sustainability themes. 
Nonetheless, the social aspects of sustainability are generally the least frequent topics 
in the UCL IEP minors.  
The implication of the unbalanced coverage of sustainability across the UCL IEP 
minors is the possibility of students choosing only the modules with low sustainability 
content. Given that a student is required to select a set of three UCL IEP minors, it is 
conceivable that the minors chosen might not provide the student with a satisfactory 
sustainability knowledge. Although the design and professional skills module that is 
199 
 
interwoven with the core engineering disciplines contains some sustainability themes, 
the sustainability content of the course unit is not independently adequate. Thus, it is 
not a given that the UCL engineering curriculum, despite its remarkable sustainability 
content, guarantees a laudable sustainability literacy. Nevertheless, the high presence 
of sustainability themes in the engineering curriculum might increase the chances of 
sustainability awareness amongst the UCL engineering students.  
UCL and Nigerian Engineering Sustainability Contents 
The analysis of the sustainability content of the UCL engineering curriculum reveals a 
path to sustainability in engineering education, i.e. through the UCL IEP framework. 
However, this means of sustainability integration has been shown to have both merits 
and demerits, which supports the view that there is no one universally effective way of 
incorporating sustainability in engineering education (Jowitt, 2004; UNESCO, 2005c; 
Manteaw, 2012). To explore this point further, the UCL engineering curriculum is 
contrasted with the Nigerian engineering curriculum, both of which stress the value of 
sustainability in engineering education. Table 6.44 shows the number of occurrences 
of four sustainability themes in the two curricula. The sum of the frequencies in the last 
column of the table is the measure of the sustainability content of each curriculum.  
Starting with the economic content, the UCL engineering curriculum has almost twice 
as many mentions of economic concepts as the Nigerian engineering curriculum. The 
environmental mentions in the Nigerian engineering curriculum are one-third of the 
environmental concepts featured in the UCL engineering curriculum. Additionally, the 
social themes of sustainability are mentioned in the UCL engineering curriculum three 
times more than they featured in the Nigerian engineering curriculum. The frequency 
of the crosscutting concepts in the UCL engineering curriculum is seven times higher 
than that of the Nigerian engineering curriculum. On the whole, whilst sustainability 
themes are mentioned 290 times in the UCL engineering curriculum, they featured 80 
times in the Nigerian engineering curriculum.

The dissimilarities between the UCL and the Nigerian engineering curricula raise some 
pertinent questions. For example, do the core disciplines in the UCL engineering 
curriculum have more sustainability content than those of the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum? Another worthy question is whether the UCL engineering students, by 
virtue of the UCL engineering curriculum, are more sustainability literate than their 
counterparts in Nigeria. With regard to the latter enquiry, there is no definitive answer 
as the present study did not assess the sustainability literacy of the UCL engineering 
students. However, based on the preceding observation that the UCL engineering 
sustainability content is mainly in the optional UCL IEP minors, the sustainability 
awareness of the two sets of students might not differ significantly. As regards the 
former question, it is evident from the findings (Table 7.34 and Table 7.43) that the 
core engineering disciplines of both UCL and Nigerian engineering curricula do not 
differ markedly in terms of sustainability content. The only exception is with the 
crosscutting content in which UCL Civil Engineering and UCL Chemical Engineering 
trump the Nigerian equivalents.  
The poor presence of sustainability in the core disciplines of the UCL and the Nigerian 
engineering curricula underscores the difficulty of suffusing specialised fields with 
sustainability topics. This fact has been copiously reported in the literature which 
adduce the packed nature of the engineering curriculum as a contributing factor 
(Allenby, 2007; Sherren, 2007; Sivapalan, 2015). Acknowledging this challenge, Jowitt 
(2004, p.86) maintains that rather than “shoving more material into an already 
overcrowded curriculum“, a focus on the learning process and the systems perspective 
will be an effective strategy of sustainability inclusion in engineering education. The 
UCL IEP framework exemplifies such recalibration of the engineering learning process 
that has yielded some sustainability content. However, since it is not informed by an 
explicit sustainability worldview, it can only go so far as evidenced in the present study. 
The implication for the Nigerian engineering curriculum is the need to combine 
proportionately content and process to attain an optimum level of sustainability content 
that will guarantee sustainability literacy amongst Nigerian engineering graduates.  
Limitations  
The sustainability assessment approach adopted in the study is constrained by the 
problem of defining sustainability content – the question of what constitutes a 
201 
 
sustainability syllabus. Consequently, how to measure the sustainability content of a 
pedagogical document is not unambiguous. Expert-derived sustainability themes as 
employed in this study are a useful means of gauging sustainability content. However, 
the resulting sustainability topics are equivocal and the derived catalogue unavoidably 
incomplete. No expert listing of sustainability themes can be exhaustive enough to 
cover all aspects of sustainability, which is underlain by the fluidity of the sustainability 
concept. These inherent constraints may have limited the research’s potential for a 
comprehensive appraisal of the sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum. Topics in the engineering documents that could qualify as sustainability 
content might have been overlooked for not fitting the a priori codes derived from the 
sustainability themes.  
Being derivatives of the well-established pillars of sustainability, the codes have been 
used effectively in similar studies around the world (Segalas et al., 2010; Lozano and 
Watson, 2013; Watson et al., 2013; de Pauw et al., 2014). These investigations are, 
nonetheless, in post-intervention contexts in which oversight of a potentially qualified 
sustainability idea is more likely than in a pre-intervention context, such as the present 
study. The post-intervention context could contain certain sustainability ideas that may 
not necessarily align with the expert-derived themes, whereas the pre-intervention 
state may be completely bereft of sustainability topics. Therefore, any sustainability-
related ideas or topics in the pre-intervention contexts will be reasonably conspicuous. 
Consequently, the a priori codes were suitable for the baseline sustainability content 
assessment undertaken in the present study, and also appropriate for appraising a 
pre-sustainability-intervention engineering curriculum.  
Another limitation to the study is the ability of HEI stakeholders to accurately assess 
the engineering programmes based on the sustainability themes. Stating the extent to 
which a topic is covered in an engineering programme can be somewhat challenging. 
Both students and educators could be limited in their responses by a number of factors 
including memory errors and misapprehension of the assessment gauge. Memory 
error could be an important challenge as it is not unusual for students to disremember 
course contents especially of programme units previously taken. Students’ failure to 
recall the details of courses in their engineering programmes could hinder their ability 
to correctly assess them for sustainability coverage. Relatedly, unfamiliarity with the 
202 
 
sustainability topics could lead to a misreading of the themes-based assessment 
gauge that may eventually affect appraisal of the programmes.  
None of these challenges significantly impacted on the study as responses were not 
only plausible but also reflective of the documentary assessments. Additionally, the 
involvement of both penultimate year and final year undergraduate students in the 
study as well postgraduate students reduced the effect of memory gaps. As for the 
possible misreading of the assessment criteria little can be done to mitigate the 
situation. Fortunately, such misconstrual is an important part of the stakeholders’ 
subjective experience of the engineering curriculum, which is relevant to the study.  
Summary 
Results of a sustainability content analysis of the Nigerian engineering curriculum were 
presented in the chapter. The assessment involved the official BMAS for engineering 
programmes as well as engineering documents and the perspectives of stakeholders 
(n=316) from two Nigerian HEIs. These data were tested against 37 sustainability 
topics obtained from an expert-derived list of sustainability themes. An outcome of the 
study was that the sustainability content of the engineering programmes based on the 
documentary analysis was low at a mean spread of 4.3% (13.37% average potential 
content). Similarly, only one-third of the stakeholders (33.7%) regarded sustainability 
topics as contained “strongly” or “to a great extent” in the engineering curriculum. 
Furthermore, environmental concepts were the most cited sustainability themes, whilst 
social topics were the least stated issues in the curriculum.  
Most of the sustainability topics appeared in the traditional engineering management 
courses. Only the BMAS document mentioned sustainability competence as a learning 
outcome for engineering graduates. A comparative look at the sustainability contents 
of the UCL and the Nigerian engineering curricula revealed a commonality in the core 
disciplines, with the UCL Civil and UCL Chemical Engineering being the exceptions. 
Although the UCL engineering curriculum was found to contain more sustainability 
topics, the efficacy of such content in terms of sustainability literacy cannot be 
guaranteed.  Overall, the findings confirmed the need for a sustainability education 
intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. The question of an appropriate 
sustainability education intervention for the curriculum is addressed in Chapter Seven.

Introduction 
 
This chapter responds to the question: What sustainability education interventions are 
appropriate for the Nigerian engineering curriculum? Answers to the question were 
informed by stakeholder responses to a survey (n=442) as well as insights from the 
preceding chapters. The chapter proceeds by stating some useful intervention cues 
before analysing the stakeholders’ views on various intervention approaches. The 
chapter concludes with a discussion of the findings and limitations of the study.

Intervention Cues  
Some useful pointers to the prospect of a sustainability education intervention in the 
Nigerian engineering curriculum were observed in the study. These included the likely 
existence of sustainability courses in Nigerian HEIs, current source of sustainability 
knowledge in the HEIs, and stakeholders’ perception of the sustainability content of 
engineering courses in the HEIs.  
Existence of Sustainability Courses in Nigerian HEIs 
HEI stakeholders (n =316) were asked whether a sustainability course or programme 
was offered in their institutions. The majority of the stakeholders (66.7%) responded 
in the negative with only one-third admitting the existence of at least a sustainability 
course in their HEIs (Table 7.1). Disaggregating the data by institution and cohort 
revealed no statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.001). Hence, sustainability 
courses or programmes were perceived as largely non-existent in Nigerian HEIs.

Educators and students assessed the extent to which they had taught and learned 
about sustainability through various means and sources. Results of the assessment 
are presented in the succeeding sections.  
Sustainability Learning 
Table 7.2 shows results of students’ perception of the means of sustainability learning. 
More than half of the students (ɸ4-5 = 52.2%) indicated that the media (TV, radio, 
internet, etc.) was a great source of sustainability knowledge. A little over one-third of 
the students (ɸ4-5 = 34.4%) considered the common engineering courses as an 
important source of sustainability knowledge. Similarly, one-third of the students (ɸ4-5 
= 33.9%) felt that they had learned about sustainability either “strongly” or “to a great

extent” through the core engineering courses. Participation in an undergraduate or 
postgraduate research was considered as a significant source of sustainability 
knowledge by only 3 in 10 students (ɸ4-5 = 31.4%).

Sustainability Teaching 
Table 7.3 presents the results of educators’ evaluation of the various means of 
imparting sustainability knowledge. Over two-fifths of the educators (ɸ4-5 =41.7%;      
ɸ4-5 = 42.8%) specified that they had taught about sustainability “strongly” or “to a great 
extent” by supervising an academic research and by pointing students to media 
sources respectively. Nonetheless, less than one-third of the educators (ɸ4-5 = 31.0%; 
ɸ4-5 = 32.1%) considered core engineering and common/elective courses respectively 
as a great means of teaching about sustainability.

Summary of Stakeholders’ Views on Sources of Sustainability Knowledge 
Table 7.4 summarises the perspectives of the stakeholders on the extent to which 
sustainability has been learned and taught in the Nigerian HEIs. Media sources were 
recognised by a significant proportion of educators and students as a great means of 
acquiring sustainability knowledge. The least acknowledged means or sources of 
sustainability knowledge from the standpoint of the stakeholders were the core 
engineering courses. However, a difference of opinion was observed regarding the 
effectiveness of acquiring sustainability knowledge by means of an academic 
research. More educators than students considered scholarly research as a vital 
means of learning about sustainability. 
 
Table 7.4. Summary of stakeholder views on sustainability knowledge source 
 
 
Perceived Sustainability-Related Courses   
HEI stakeholders (n=316) were asked to mention three courses which in their opinion 
covered sustainability issues. This resulted in a list of 138 different courses (see 
Appendix XI). Figure 7.1 depicts 25 of the most frequently occurring courses (>5% 
frequency), whilst Table 7.5 is a distribution of the perceived sustainability courses. 
From the chart and table, the common/elective course of Engineer in Society and the 
core engineering course of Environmental Impact Assessment were perceived as the 
most sustainability-relevant courses. Also, Research Methodology, a common/elective 
course, and Systems Reliability, a core engineering course, ranked relatively high on 
the sustainability-related courses list. Nearly all the mentioned sustainability-related 
core engineering courses hinted at an environmental aspect of sustainability. With the 
exception of Systems Reliability, which was mentioned by only stakeholders in the 
engineering programmes of electrical, mechanical, and systems engineering, the core 
engineering courses seemed bereft of the economic, social and crosscutting aspects 
of sustainability. The extent to which a number of these courses and programmes

of the perceived sustainability-related courses had been entitled “Sustainable 
Engineering.” This was an important pointer to the need for a sustainability education 
intervention in the Nigerian engineering curriculum.

Sustainability Importance  
The Nigerian engineering community (n=442) responded to three questions on the 
importance of sustainability. Answers to these queries are presented in the succeeding 
sections under the subheadings of sustainability support, sustainability expertise, and 
sustainability education. 
Sustainability Support 
Table 7.6 shows the response of the Nigerian engineering community on whether 
Nigerian engineers should contribute to sustainable development. A vast majority of 
the respondents (88.4%) agreed or strongly agreed with the sustainability support 
statement. Disaggregating the data by groups revealed no statistically significant 
differences (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, it was generally accepted that Nigerian engineers should 
not only be involved in sustainability, but actively support it.

Sustainability Expertise  
Table 7.7 shows the response of the Nigerian engineering community on whether 
Nigerian engineers should acquire a sustainability expertise. An overwhelming 
majority of the respondents (80.5%) agreed or strongly agreed with the sustainability 
expertise statement. There were no statistically significant differences across the 
groups (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, it was largely accepted that sustainability expertise was a 
competence required of Nigerian engineers.

Table 7.8 presents the response of the Nigerian engineering community on whether 
sustainability is important in engineering education. A substantial majority of the 
respondents (87.8%) agreed or strongly agreed with the sustainability education 
statement. Disaggregating the data by cohorts revealed no statistically significant 
differences (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, it was commonly accepted that sustainability was 
essential in engineering education.

Stakeholder Intervention Views 
Stakeholders were queried on the best suitable intervention approach and on their 
general views about sustainability and engineering education in Nigeria. The following 
sections present the results of these inquiries.  
Intervention Approach 
Engineering stakeholders were asked to indicate the appropriateness or otherwise of 
introducing sustainability education via integration into existing core courses, creation 
of new discipline-specific course, creation of new cross-disciplinary courses, and 
integration into common/elective courses.  
Existing Core Course 
Table 7.9 shows the response of the Nigerian engineering community on the suitability 
of the existing core courses as a means of introducing sustainability in the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum. A large proportion of the stakeholders (63.6%) expressed the 
view that the existing core courses were “strongly” or “extremely” appropriate for such 
intervention. There were no statistically significant differences across groups (p ≤ 
0.001). Thus, the integration of sustainability into existing core engineering courses or 
programmes was largely considered a suitable intervention approach.

Discipline-Specific Course 
Table 7.10 shows the response of the Nigerian engineering community on the 
suitability of the discipline-specific course as a means of introducing sustainability in 
the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Just over half of the stakeholders (52.7%) 
expressed the view that the discipline-specific course was “strongly” or “extremely” 
appropriate for such intervention. Disaggregating the data by groups revealed no 
statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, the creation of a new discipline-
specific sustainability course or programme was not overwhelmingly considered a 
suitable intervention approach.  
Table 7.10. Stakeholders' views on intervention via discipline-specific courses 
 
Cross-Disciplinary Course 
Table 7.11 presents the response of the Nigerian engineering community on the 
suitability of a cross-disciplinary course as a means of introducing sustainability in the 
Nigerian engineering curriculum. A little over half of the stakeholders (53.7%) 
expressed the view that the cross-disciplinary course was “strongly” or “extremely” 
appropriate for such intervention. There were no statistically significant differences 
across the cohorts (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, the creation of a new cross-disciplinary 
sustainability course or programme was fairly considered a suitable intervention 
approach.

Common/Elective Course 
Table 7.12 shows the response of the Nigerian engineering community on the 
suitability of the common/elective courses as a means of introducing sustainability in 
the Nigerian engineering curriculum. A sizable proportion of the stakeholders (58.6%) 
expressed the view that the common/elective core courses were “strongly” or 
“extremely” appropriate for such intervention. Disaggregating the data by groups 
revealed no statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.001). Thus, the integration of 
sustainability into common/elective engineering courses was generally considered a 
suitable intervention approach.

from an analysis of the elicited responses. The themes, which were all framed from an 
intervention standpoint, included approach, challenge, focus area, and imperative.  
Intervention Approach 
Several of the comments from the Nigerian engineering stakeholders were ideas about 
intervention approaches. Members of the three groups within the engineering 
community in Nigeria remarked on ways a sustainability education intervention could 
be successfully achieved. Some of the stakeholders suggested a top-down approach 
maintaining that “there should be a law guiding the implementation of sustainability in 
our universities” [ER65]. A practitioner more explicitly stated that the “government 
need to make a legislation to guide…sustainability [in] engineering education” 
[PR104]. Also, notions of a holistic approach were echoed by a number of the 
stakeholders, to wit: “Sustainability and engineering education can only be realistic 
when addressed from a holistic standpoint” [SR102]. Another respondent remarked 
that “emphasis should not be limited to the academic level, but also extended to the 
general public” [SR157]. Other intervention approaches cited by the stakeholders 
included alignment with global best practice: “…needs to be reviewed to be (sic) in line 
with international practices” [ER33], seminars: “…seminars should be organised to 
create awareness” [SR125], and use of add-on approaches: “Sustainability should be 
introduced as a local content added to the engineering syllabus” [SR177]. A summary 
of the stakeholder-suggested intervention approaches is presented in Table 7.14. 
Intervention Challenge 
Likely challenges of a sustainability education intervention for the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum emerged from the general comments of the stakeholders. Lack of political 
will was mentioned as a challenge to the intervention with some participants describing 
it as “the greatest challenge” [ER4]. Another possible constraint suggested by the 
stakeholders was poor sustainability knowledge, which some felt could hinder 
“implementation of these (sic) knowledge” [ER30]. Respondents also mentioned 
corruption in government as a possible encumbrance of a successful sustainability 
education intervention. One respondent explained the corruption charge thus: “[It is] 
difficult to adopt sustainability because of corruption and corporate interest of those 
that benefit from status quo (sic)” [ER18]. Some stakeholders opined that, in addition 
to profiteering by interest groups, lack of capacity could impede any sustainability 
214 
 
education intervention. In the words of one respondent, “Government lacks capacity 
to implement reports sent to them” [ER4]. Still on the issue of capacity a student stated 
that “the potential [of an intervention] in the present national development is poor” 
[SR161]. Overall, the suggested challenges indicated stakeholders’ interest in the 
success of a sustainability education intervention. A summary of the stakeholder-
suggested intervention challenge is presented in Table 7.14. 
Intervention Focus Area 
Results revealed that stakeholders considered several topics as essential in a 
sustainability education intervention. An important focus area stressed by respondents 
was research. Stakeholders opined that an education intervention should comprise a 
practical research element as “we have more theoretical engineers than practical 
engineers” [SR101]. Focusing on a praxis-oriented sustainability research was thus 
suggested as a possible mitigation. Another subject of interest to the stakeholders was 
technology policy. An engineering educator cited “energy efficient processes and low 
environmental emission products” [ER50] as examples of areas that can be covered 
under technology policy within a sustainability education intervention. Other focus 
areas recommended by the stakeholders included EIA, LCA, engineering design, 
renewables, and construction methods, all of which corresponded to the previously 
highlighted sustainability-related courses (see Table 8.5). On the whole, the Nigerian 
engineering community were interested in an effective and meaningful sustainability 
education for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. A summary of the stakeholder-
suggested focus areas is presented in Table 7.14. 
Intervention Imperative 
Stakeholders expressed opinions on the importance of a sustainability education 
intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. These views ranged from ideas 
on the need to integrate sustainability into the engineering education to opinions on 
the benefits of the intervention. One respondent declared that “Nigeria needs 
sustainability engineering education” [ER12], and another participant stated that 
“Sustainability in engineering teaching and practice should be encouraged and 
practised” [PR27]. These sustainability imperatives were repeatedly stressed by the 
stakeholders. Some respondents underscored such intervention merit as the potential 
“to improve the quality of engineering education in Nigeria” [SR18]. Another 
215 
 
intervention imperative also highlighted by the stakeholders was self-reliance. A 
respondent averred that a sustainable engineering education could contribute towards 
Nigeria “becoming more productive and less dependent on other countries” [ER31]. 
The acquisition of contemporary problem-solving skills was equally stated as an 
intervention benefit. In general, the Nigerian engineering community expressed strong 
conviction on the need for a sustainability education intervention in the engineering 
curriculum. A summary of the stakeholder-suggested intervention imperatives is 
presented in Table 7.14.

Discussion 
Lack of Sustainability Courses in the HEIs 
The question to stakeholders on whether a sustainability course, module or degree 
exists in their HEIs is multi-objective. Firstly, it seeks to establish from the perspective 
of the stakeholders the occurrence of any form of sustainability learning or teaching in 
the HEIs. Secondly, it serves as a crosscheck on the results of the sustainability 
content analysis of the engineering documents (Chapter Six). Finally, it conduces to 
the aim of revealing the prospect of a sustainability education intervention in the 
Nigerian engineering curriculum. By the admission of the stakeholders, sustainability 
courses, modules or degrees are largely non-existent in the Nigerian engineering 
education. This finding is not unusual for an engineering curriculum that has not been 
purposefully imbued with sustainability ideals (Chapter Three). However, the fact that 
a few of the stakeholders admit, at the very least, the existence of a sustainability 
course in the HEIs is quite interesting. What is undeniable is the absence of an 
undergraduate or a postgraduate degree programme on either sustainability or 
sustainable engineering in the curriculum. The literature review undertaken in the 
present study and the sustainability content analysis of the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum (see Chapter Six) equally point to such deficiency.   
As for the existence of a sustainability course or module in the HEIs, it is likely that 
some of the respondents have based their judgements on the few sustainability topics 
extant in the curriculum. Corroborating this account is the stakeholder-provided 
sustainability courses list in which some courses, such as Environmental Health, 
Environmental Impact Assessment and Developmental Economics are evidently 
sustainability-related. This is also consistent with the findings of the sustainability 
curricular assessment presented in Chapter Six. However, several of these courses 
are not featured in all the engineering programmes. Therefore, it is plausible that not 
all the respondents will acknowledge them in a survey, which may explain the minority 
contrarian views. It is, thus, reasonable to deduce that for the great majority of the 
engineering community sustainability courses or modules are largely non-existent.  
What the lack of sustainability courses or degrees in Nigerian HEIs implies is the 
plausibility of an intervention. However, the extent to which the absence of a 
217 
 
pedagogical element translates to a propitious intervention prospect is thought-
provoking. Obviously, the lack of a sustainability course in the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum provides a cogent argument for a sustainability education intervention. This 
point, although useful in grounding an intervention proposal, may not sustain the 
process through to implementation. As numerous studies have shown, sustainability 
courses are not designed and embedded into engineering programmes simply as a 
result of their absence (Azapagic et al., 2005; Allenby et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 2009). 
Amongst several other factors, support mechanisms have to be incorporated in a 
prospective intervention to achieve success. This constraint has been identified and 
is catered for in the sustainability education intervention proposed in Chapter Eight. 
Perceived Sources of Sustainability Knowledge 
Stakeholders vary in perception of the means of sustainability learning and teaching 
in Nigerian HEIs. Whilst a consensus exists on some of the sources of sustainability 
knowledge, there are also some marked disagreements (see Table 7.4). The points of 
agreement are on the roles of core engineering and common/elective courses as 
sources of sustainability knowledge. Both educators and students express low opinion 
of these sustainability knowledge sources, which implies that sustainability learning 
and teaching have barely occurred through these means. This finding is expected 
given the long-standing focus of core engineering courses on fundamental topics and 
the limits of extant common/elective courses in the Nigerian engineering curriculum. 
Some studies have already shown that core engineering courses are typically bereft 
of sustainability concepts, especially prior to an intervention (Fenner et al., 2005). The 
sustainability content analysis of engineering documents in the present study (see 
Chapter Six) yielded similar results.  
The point of divergence between educators and students is on the extent to which 
sustainability teaching and learning have occurred via undergraduate or postgraduate 
research. The students fail to corroborate the educators’ views that academic research 
is a crucial means or source of sustainability knowledge in the Nigerian HEIs. The 
inability of the students to recognise any form of sustainability learning by undertaking 
an academic research in spite of the educators suggesting the contrary is quite 
interesting. Could be this be as a result of poor appreciation of what constitutes 
sustainability knowledge? Or could it simply be a consequence of a gap between what 
218 
 
is taught and what is learned? In other words, educators might have taught about 
sustainability during supervision of an academic research, but the students might have 
missed this teaching point.     
With regards to the possibility that a poor grasp of sustainability might have contributed 
to the difference of opinion between the educators and students, it is likely that such 
deficit could have played a part. However, the findings of the present study and the 
various concept clarifications featured in the survey (see Chapter Four), such as the 
catalogue of sustainability themes and a definition of sustainability do not support this 
explanation. Since sustainability was appropriately defined in the context of the 
present study, failure to appreciate the constituents of sustainability knowledge may 
not be a pertinent account. Nevertheless, the argument that a communication gap 
between educators and students has been responsible for the differing views seems 
plausible. Indeed, relationship between teaching and learning has been the subject of 
intense study in educational research (McFarland, 2005; Kullberg, 2010). Results have 
typically pointed to a mismatch between the perceptions of educators on the efficacy 
of their teaching and the learning experiences of students (Kullberg, 2010).  
What is wanting in adducing this explanation for the conflicting views in the case of the 
Nigerian engineering educators and students is the sustainability literacy level of the 
educators. Findings of the present study revealed that an equal level of sustainability 
literacy subsisted for both educators and students (see Chapter Five). Consequently, 
it will be flawed to assume that the educators mentioned sustainability issues at 
academic research meetings which the students did not heed. However, there is an 
interesting point of convergence between the educators and the students on the 
effectiveness of media sources for sustainability knowledge. Media platforms such as 
educational television, radio, newspapers, Internet, etc. have been recognised as a 
great source of sustainability knowledge in some sustainability studies (Mcfarlane and 
Ogazon, 2011; UNESCO, 2012; Fadeeva et al., 2014). The use of these sources could 
be included in an introductory sustainability course as part of sustainability education 
intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. 
Parikh and McRobie (2009) reported the positive impacts of television on the 
education of a community in Sanjaynagar slum in India. Many slum residents admitted 
to benefitting from programmes aired on such TV stations as Discovery channel, etc. 
An evidence of a change in lifestyle ascribed to TV viewing is suggested (Parikh and 
219 
 
McRobie, 2009). The claim by the members of the Nigerian engineering community to 
have accessed sustainability knowledge via media sources is therefore important. This 
could be enhanced by providing an additional engineering sustainability material to the 
TV content. Through a collaboration with local TV stations, the COREN, FMEnv and 
the RCEs could sponsor sustainability-related programmes that would be presented 
regularly nationwide. Examples of such programmes are the role of Nigerian engineers 
in the realisation of SDGs and the engineering sustainability opportunities in Nigeria. 
Distribution of Perceived Sustainability-Related Courses 
The intent of asking stakeholders to mention three courses which they regard as 
addressing sustainability is to identify and double-check the existence of sustainability 
courses in the Nigerian HEIs. The question is also a corollary of the goal to weigh the 
prospect of an intervention. Interestingly, the query produced more than 100 topics 
with some themes clearly unrelated to sustainability as conceptualised in the present 
study. Examples of such extraneous courses listed by the stakeholders are Statistics 
for Engineers and Atomic Spectra. Several reasons could account for the mention of 
these non-sustainability-related courses. The stakeholders who listed such courses 
might have been motivated by the need to identify sustainability issues with their 
engineering programmes. Reputational concerns such as being the only HEI or 
engineering discipline devoid of any sustainability courses could influence some 
stakeholders to respond tangentially. Indeed, the findings from the sustainability import 
statements discussed in the next section show that stakeholders overwhelmingly 
support sustainability education. Hence, it is likely that some of the stakeholders are 
keen to identify some engineering courses with sustainability in order to portray their 
HEIs or disciplines as sustainability-friendly.  
Of the top 25 sustainability-relevant courses listed by the stakeholders, some are 
classified as core engineering courses whilst others fall under the common/elective 
courses category (Table 7.5). The distribution of these courses in this way has 
important implications for the study. Most of the sustainability-related courses are 
biased towards environmental sustainability, but are also taught exclusively as core 
courses in a few of the engineering programmes. This corroborates a previous 
explanation of findings in the present study, which defers to the restriction of the 
environmental topics to a smattering of the engineering students as a reason for 
220 
 
stakeholders’ low familiarity with environmental issues (Chapter Five). For the courses 
that fall under the common/elective category, the extent to which they contain 
sustainability issues has already been found to be insufficient (see Chapter Six). 
Additionally, the fact that none of the listed courses is prefixed or affixed with a 
sustainability label further confirms the lack of concerted efforts to embed sustainability 
in the engineering curriculum. To address these inadequacies, a sustainability-titled 
introductory course has been designed around the four sustainability themes featured 
in the present study and proposed to be taught as a common/elective engineering 
course (Chapter Eight).  
Sustainability Import Statements 
The three sustainability statements in the context of Nigerian engineering seek to 
ascertain the disposition of engineering stakeholders in Nigeria towards supporting 
sustainability, sustainability expertise and sustainability education. An overwhelming 
majority of the stakeholders (>80%) are favourably disposed towards all the three 
propositions. This finding is comparable to the outcome of a survey administered 
world-wide by Azapagic et al. (2005) to engineering students in around 40 universities. 
Nearly all the engineering students surveyed by the researchers thought sustainable 
development was important for them personally and professionally. By admitting that 
Nigerian engineers should contribute to sustainable development, the stakeholders in 
Nigeria could be expressing a willingness to actively participate in engineering 
sustainability. This prospect is enhanced by the concurrence of the stakeholders that 
sustainability expertise is a competence required of all Nigerian engineers. Hence, an 
engineering community with such proclivity for sustainability may have little difficulty 
imbibing the principles of sustainable engineering. 
The enormous support for sustainability education shown by the Nigerian engineering 
community is also encouraging. It demonstrates that stakeholders appreciate the 
existing gap in the Nigerian engineering curriculum and the need to proffer an effective 
and meaningful solution. To acknowledge the presence of a problem is commonly 
considered a critical first step towards solving it. This is particularly relevant realising 
that all the three groups of the Nigerian engineering community, namely practitioners, 
educators, and students share these views. Therefore, it is well within reason to 
envisage that the engineering practitioners in Nigeria, for example, will seek to educate 
221 
 
themselves about sustainability post-intervention. This could even be an impetus for 
the creation of a postgraduate course on engineering sustainability akin to UCL’s MSc 
in Sustainable Resources or the University of Cambridge’s MPhil in Engineering for 
Sustainable Development. Designing such postgraduate degree, however, is beyond 
the scope of the present study and could form part of a future sustainability education 
research for Nigeria. 
Closed-Ended Responses 
The closed-ended question seeks stakeholders’ views on the appropriateness of an 
intervention via core courses, common courses, new cross-disciplinary course, and 
new discipline-specific course. Responses to the closed-ended question favour an 
intervention via core courses and common courses, although more than half of the 
respondents regard all the approaches as suitable. However, the cross-disciplinary 
and discipline-specific courses are inherently problematic and resource-intensive 
(Rusinko, 2010) and may not be appropriate for an introductory course such as 
proposed in the present study. This is not to say that the approaches cannot be 
considered by Nigerian HEIs that have the capacity and wherewithal to manage them 
successfully. Indeed HEIs in Nigeria that may consider offering a postgraduate degree 
on sustainable engineering will find either the cross-disciplinary or the discipline-
specific approaches useful. Nonetheless, the stakeholders’ preference based on the 
closed-ended responses is integration via the core courses and the common courses 
respectively. 
This finding is congruent with several sustainability education studies (Perdan, 
Azapagic and Clift, 2000; Desha et al., 2007; Sinnott and Thomas, 2012; von Blottnitz 
et al., 2015). Intervention via core engineering courses has been documented as the 
best suitable way of integrating sustainability in an engineering curriculum. However, 
studies have equally recognised the challenges associated with employing the core 
engineering courses in the integration of sustainability into an education curriculum. 
An oft-cited disadvantage of this approach is the administrative hiccup occasioned by 
a cramped engineering curriculum (Allenby et al., 2009; Rusinko, 2010). In the case 
of the Nigerian engineering curriculum which grapples with not only a packed content 
but also legacy issues (see Chapter Three), intervention via the core courses is not a 
suitable option for a trial introductory course; hence the choice of the common courses 
222 
 
proposed in Chapter Eight. Nevertheless, integrating sustainability into the core 
courses of the Nigerian engineering curriculum could be an ultimate intervention 
desire. 
Open-Ended Responses 
The open-ended question invites stakeholders to comment on sustainability and 
engineering education in Nigeria, which opportunely produced intervention-oriented 
responses. The general comments of the stakeholders from the open-ended question 
evince not only an exigency but a high sense of pragmatism. Having established the 
imperative of sustainability in Nigerian engineering education and practice, the 
stakeholders comment variously on intervention focus area, suitable approach, and 
possible challenge. On the imperative of sustainability education in the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum, the stakeholders’ comments match several ideas in the 
literature reviewed in the present study (see Chapter Two). With a list of sustainability 
benefits such as economic growth and self-reliance as well as the potential to improve 
engineering education in Nigeria and acquire complex problem-solving skills, the 
stakeholders exhibit a good appreciation of the sustainability imperative. This is 
consistent with the findings from the closed-ended question regarding the import of 
sustainability in the Nigerian engineering context. Similarly, the focus areas suggested 
in the comments of the stakeholders correspond to the gaps noticed in the curricular 
sustainability content analysis (see Chapter Six). These have been considered in the 
course design undertaken in Chapter Eight.  
With respect to the intervention approach, the variously cited examples ranging from 
top-down and holistic method to intervention via the common courses and global best 
practice, a pragmatic undertone is apparent. The stakeholders seem to generally 
advocate a pragmatic intervention approach, i.e. a success-oriented approach given 
the Nigerian context. This is especially pertinent recognising that nearly half of the 
respondents are engineering educators and practitioners who might have served in 
different positions of educational policy-making in Nigeria. Practical considerations are 
invaluable in such situations and most useful in a sustainability education intervention 
for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. A number of studies have indicated the 
contingency of success on the contextual practicalities of sustainability education in a 
given setting. The three-tier approach to teaching about sustainability developed by 
223 
 
Azapagic et al 2005 is underlain by pragmatism evident in its incremental character. 
These pragmatic ideas are reflected in the guideline for intervention developed in the 
present study (see Chapter Eight).  
Limitations 
One of the limitations acknowledged in the study is the likely inability of the students 
to accurately identify appropriate intervention approaches. Since Nigerian engineering 
students are rarely involved in curricular development or course designs, they might 
not be conversant with how best to introduce a course in the engineering curriculum. 
Consequently, asking students to indicate the appropriateness of an intervention 
approach may simply lead to conjecture. The extent to which guesswork might have 
occurred in the students’ responses cannot be ascertained. However, being the 
primary recipients of knowledge via the designed curriculum, students might have 
ideas of the various approaches, especially as course categories. Such familiarity with 
the curriculum could enable them to recognise the most effective course categories, 
which may be handy in responding to the survey. Nonetheless, as the findings of the 
study revealed no statistically significant differences, the possibility of conjecture is 
low.   
Another limitation of the study is the possibility of bias in the mentioned sustainability-
related courses. Since the resulting list is a function of frequency, courses offered by 
an overrepresented engineering programme could rank higher than others. For 
example, Systems Reliability, which is a core course in only electrical, mechanical and 
systems engineering, ranked sixth on the list of the top 25 most frequent sustainability-
related courses. Such drawback could affect the findings of the study by yielding a 
false result, making a listed course appear more pervasive than it actually is. However, 
the collection of data on course type (core or common) alongside the listed courses 
was an effective countermeasure employed in the present study against this bias. The 
piece of information was a valuable filter of the pervasiveness and relevance of the 
perceived sustainability-related courses.  
 
224 
 
Summary  
An assessment was conducted to address the question of what sustainability 
education interventions are appropriate for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. This 
involved an analysis of a stakeholder survey (n=442). On the prospect of an 
intervention, a significant majority (70%) of the stakeholders admitted a lack of 
sustainability courses or programmes in the Nigerian engineering curriculum. In 
addition, almost half of the stakeholders (47.5%) pointed to media sources (TV, 
Internet, etc.) as the means of acquiring sustainability knowledge. Core engineering 
and common courses were considered the least sources of sustainability knowledge. 
Educators and students disagreed on the extent of gaining sustainability knowledge 
via an academic research with the former expressing positive views and the latter 
suggesting the contrary.  
For sustainability-related courses, the common course of Engineer in Society was 
perceived as the most sustainability-relevant course in the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum. Nearly all the listed courses were biased towards environmental issues, 
and no sustainability-titled course featured amongst the mentioned courses. The 
Nigerian engineering community expressed overwhelming support for sustainability in 
terms of the involvement of Nigerian engineers (88.4%), need for sustainability 
expertise (80.5%), and sustainability importance in engineering education (87.8%). On 
intervention approach, stakeholders viewed the suitability of the approaches in 
descending order thus: integration into core courses (63.6%), common courses 
(58.6%), new cross-disciplinary course (53.7%) and new discipline-specific course 
(52.7%). Four emergent themes from the general comments were approach, focus 
area, challenge and imperative.

8  Formulating an Intervention for 
Nigerian Engineering Curriculum 
 
 
Introduction 
This chapter formulates an intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. A 
bipartite intervention featuring guidelines and an introductory course on sustainable 
engineering is presented. The intervention is proposed based on the findings in the 
preceding chapters (Chapters Five to Seven) as well as insights from the reviewed 
literature (Chapters Two and Three). The chapter proceeds with a delineation of the 
intervention requirements arising from the analysed data in the study. Thereafter, the 
details of the intervention are provided and the key elements of a proposed course are 
subsequently trialled by means of a sustainability workshop. The prospect of running 
a sustainable engineering course in a typical Nigerian engineering class setting is 
assessed. An overview of the workshop stating its layout including some preliminary 
sustainability assessments and a presentation on sustainable engineering is provided. 
Other features of the workshop highlighted in the chapter are sustainable engineering 
activity and post-workshop assessments. The chapter concludes with a discussion of 
the findings and limitations.  
 
 
 
 
226 
 
Defining Intervention Requirements 
From the findings in the preceding chapters intervention requirements for the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum can be defined. What follows is a description of the elements 
of a proposed intervention covering strategy, method, approach, and means.  
Strategy 
Holistic – Congruent with findings of the present study and global best practice, a 
sustainability education intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum should be 
holistic. Holistic strategy here implies that the engineering curriculum, understood in 
its broad sense as a stakeholder-led process and involving all facets of an educational 
institution, should be targeted. Hence, all aspects of the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum should be imbued with sustainability concepts. Responsibility for fulfilling 
these requirements should be vested in educational authorities at different levels of 
command. 
Method 
Hybrid Method – The hybrid method of curricular development which combines top-
down and bottom-up approaches is proposed. The top-down approach will cover 
sustainability education policy-making and inclusion of a sustainability course in the 
BMAS document. The bottom-up approach involves recommendations and 
sustainability course designs initiated from HEIs or independent researchers. With 
regard to the top-down sustainability education policy in Nigeria, the Nigerian FME 
and FMEnv will be key actors. Additionally, NUC and COREN will be responsible for 
benchmarking both sustainable engineering course and sustainability proficiency as 
minimum requirements for all engineering programmes and graduates.  
Approach 
Multidisciplinary – In terms of approach, multidisciplinarity is envisaged as the 
appropriate way to constitute a sustainability education intervention for Nigerian 
engineering curriculum. This requirement should be reflected in all sustainability efforts 
in HEIs including curricular development and course designs.  
227 
 
Means 
Common/Elective Courses – The common/elective courses should be targeted for an 
initial integration of a sustainability course into the Nigerian engineering curriculum. 
Consequently, a sustainable engineering module should be designed and taught as a 
common engineering course in all the Nigerian HEIs. The sustainability course should 
subsume and replace the existing Engineer in Society module. 
Guideline for Intervention 
A guideline for sustainability education intervention in Nigerian engineering curriculum 
is presented in Figure 8.1. The diagrammatic representation is intended to convey all 
the aforementioned intervention requirements and elements. Accordingly, holism is 
reflected in the interconnectedness of the roles contained in individual boxes and in 
the intricate relationship between constituent elements. Each step or boxed element 
is linked to and influenced by a preceding and succeeding step. The bidirectional 
arrows or connectors are indicative of the hybrid method (top-down and bottom-up) 
defined in the intervention requirements. This implies that sustainability education 
intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum can be initiated at any level and 
advanced iteratively. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step I. Role of Government 
Sustainability legislation and sustainability 
education policy to be enacted by the federal 
legislature with inputs from FMEnv, FME and 
other stakeholders. 
Step II. Role of Regulators and Professional 
Associations 
NUC, COREN, NAE and NSE adopt enacted 
policy and frame regulations accordingly, 
including making sustainability competence a 
professional requirement. 
Step IV. Role of Teaching Staff 
Design a sustainable engineering course for 
likely inclusion in the BMAS and other 
engineering handbooks & ensure its teaching to 
students. Also, capacity of educators to impart 
sustainability knowledge is important. 
 
Step III. Role of University Leaders 
HEI leaders integrate sustainability ideals into 
mission statements and incentivise faculties and 
departments to emulate such initiative, for 
example, the establishment of sustainable 
engineering centres, etc. 
Figure 8.1. Guideline for intervention in Nigerian engineering curriculum 
228 
 
Role of Government 
The Nigerian Government has a role to play in any sustainability education intervention 
for the country. A crucial governmental role could be the enactment of a sustainability 
legislation from which a sustainability education policy can be derived. The Federal 
Government through FMEnv and FME can originate an executive bill on sustainability 
education for legislation by the National Assembly. The enactment of a sustainability 
education policy will not only provide a legal framework for an intervention, but also 
incentivise stakeholders to gravitate towards sustainability efforts. Inputs for the 
executive bill could proceed bottom-up and top-down to facilitate broad participation. 
Furthermore, a stakeholder conference could be held to provide an avenue for such 
wide consultations. The existing OSSAP-SDGs and RCEs could be tasked to network 
with appropriate organisations to ensure an inclusive policy proposal.  
Role of Regulators and Professional Associations 
Regulators of engineering education and practice in Nigeria as well as engineering 
professional associations are important stakeholders in any sustainability intervention 
in Nigerian engineering curriculum. Sequel to a sustainability education policy, NUC, 
COREN, NAE and NSE could frame engineering practice and education regulations 
around sustainability ideals. NUC and COREN could insert in their episodically 
reviewed regulatory documents the requirement for sustainability proficiency amongst 
all engineering graduates. NSE and NAE could include the evidence of sustainability 
considerations in engineering practice or project as a prerequisite for membership. 
These suggested intervention tacks at the level of regulators and professional 
associations could be effective in enabling not only a sustainability education, but also 
sustainable engineering practice in Nigeria. 
Role of University Leaders 
Leadership in the context of sustainability education occupies a midpoint between 
positivism and naturalism. Whilst leadership from the positivist stance is considered to 
be inherently amoral, the naturalistic perspective concedes the intrinsic intertwinement 
between morality and leadership (Carey, 2002). Therefore, in a strict sense, naturalism 
and positivism diverge on the moral and logical questions of leadership. The University 
of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership defines a sustainability leader as 
229 
 
“someone who inspires and supports action towards a better world” (Visser and 
Courtice, 2011, p.2). This is a morally laden statement in which the legitimacy of 
sustainability leadership is derived from the compelling need to address sustainability 
crises. The sustainability education construct established in Chapter Two adduces 
both logical and moral reasoning to justify the need for a sustainability leadership. This 
aligns with the contingency view of leadership, which is underpinned by pragmatism. 
Hence, the nature of university leadership suggested in the guideline is pragmatic.  
The role of university leaders in a sustainability education intervention for Nigerian 
engineering curriculum is critical. The present intervention proposal targets the 
Nigerian HEIs, which are expected to imbue and teach sustainability themes in all 
engineering programmes. The university leadership at every level must participate in 
supporting this objective for an effective and meaningful outcome. One of the ways 
HEI leaders could contribute is by promoting sustainability ideals in university, faculty 
or departmental mission statements. This would provide some visibility to sustainability 
as a policy in the HEI and also serve as a reorientation tact. University leaders could 
similarly encourage the creation of sustainable engineering research groups and 
centres to further entrench sustainability issues in the HEIs. Ultimately, university 
leaders must be predisposed towards fostering engineering sustainability initiatives for 
a meaningful intervention. 
Role of Teaching Staff 
Teaching staff are typically tasked with the responsibility of imparting knowledge to 
students. In the case of sustainability education intervention for Nigerian engineering 
programmes, the role of the teaching staff is significant. The teaching staff could be 
tasked with the design of a sustainability course in line with a nationally recognised 
minimum standard. However, the teaching staff must have the intellectual capacity 
and proficiency to teach sustainable engineering courses in the HEIs. Based on the 
findings in the present study (Chapter Five), the educators may have to be capacitated 
through instruction in engineering sustainability. Hence, part of the intervention should 
focus on educating engineering educators about sustainable engineering.  
230 
 
Course Design 
An introductory course on sustainable engineering could be designed for the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum in the light of the defined intervention requirements and 
guideline. The course could be entitled An Introduction to Sustainable Engineering in 
Nigeria. Such a course should contain the wide-ranging issues highlighted in the 
present study including contextual sustainability matters and the universality of the 
sustainability challenge. Being an introductory course, the module should establish the 
imperative, raison d’etre, and the rationale for sustainable engineering as well as the 
application and relevance of engineering sustainability in Nigeria. Some elements of 
PBL and PjBL such as seminars, class activities, scenarios and collaborative projects 
should be incorporated in the course structure. Furthermore, the course should feature 
such other teaching techniques as lecturing and case study where appropriate. Both 
individual and group projects should feature in the course.  
In addition, expected learning outcomes, assessment format and weekly topics should 
be explicitly stated in the course outline. The learning outcomes should be couched in 
terms of observable abilities and traits. Examples of topics that could feature in the 
course are Origins of Sustainable Engineering, Systems Thinking, and The Engineer 
as a Leader. Others are Sustainable Engineering in Nigeria, Application of Sustainable 
Engineering and Earth Systems Engineering and Management. The course could fit 
into the common/elective courses of the Nigerian engineering curriculum. It should 
aptly subsume and replace the ubiquitous Engineer in Society course whose existing 
content can be covered under the Sustainable Engineering in Nigeria topic. The 
sustainable engineering course designed for the Nigerian engineering curriculum 
could be included in the official BMAS document and subsequently in the engineering 
handbooks of Nigerian HEIs. The course outline for the proposed module is presented 
below. 
231 
 
 
Course Title: An Introduction to Sustainable Engineering in Nigeria 
Introduction: Sustainability is a 21st century challenge that has elicited political, 
ethical and intellectual debates. Some of the crises that cued sustainability 
advocacy such as biodiversity loss, climate change, carbon emissions and hyper-
consumerism have been attributed to engineering. Being the lifeblood of 
socioeconomic progress, engineering is expected to align with sustainability ideals 
for the benefit of present and future generations. To this end, sustainable 
engineering offers a conceptual departure from conventional engineering by 
broadening the problem and solution domains of engineering across the 
sustainability pillars of economy, society and environment. Globally, sustainable 
engineering principles are shaping engineering practice and Nigerian engineers 
are expected to imbibe such values in order to contribute towards addressing 
sustainability challenges. This course aims to introduce engineering students to 
the fundamentals of sustainable engineering. 
Learning Outcomes: At the end of the course, students should be able to: 
(1) Appreciate the origins, definitions and rationale of sustainable engineering.  
(2) Identify and explain the underlying philosophies, frameworks, principles and 
tools of sustainable engineering.  
(3) Identify and explain the sustainability implications of engineering projects and 
activities in Nigeria.  
(4) Learn to communicate in short essay form and student-led seminars.  
Assessment: Seminar participation/presentation (10%); Sustainable Engineering 
Activity (15%); 1000 word discussion paper (25%); 2000 word essay (50%) 
Week 1 – Origins of Sustainable Engineering: The evolution of sustainable 
engineering via precursory activisms such as conservationism, environmentalism, 
etc., highlighting the contributions of key 1960s environmentalists including Rachel 
Carson, Murray Bookchin, etc. Role of UN World Commission on Environment and 
Development (UNWCED), the Brundtland Report of 1987 and ratification of global 
sustainability pacts. A discussion of the rise of contemporary sustainable 
engineering ideas will feature. 
 
232 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Week 2 – Defining Sustainable Engineering: Various attempts at a definition of 
sustainable engineering will be presented. Pillars of sustainability including 
economy, environment, and society that inform all extant sustainable engineering 
definitions will feature. Conventional engineering is differentiated from sustainable 
engineering. The underlying philosophies of sustainable engineering, such as 
anthropocentrism, ecocentrism, egalitarianism, complexity, holism, precautionary 
principle and technocentrism are addressed.  
Week 3 – Rationale for Sustainable Engineering: The question of why sustainable 
engineering is needed will be treated. Some important reasons such as the 
intricate connection between economic development and engineering as well as 
the instrumental value of engineering are covered. The need to address myriad 
social and ecological crises across the globe is stressed. Examples are given in 
the global, continental, regional and national contexts. 
Week 4 – Systems Thinking: Applying systems notions to problem-solving 
endeavours dubbed systems approach with system thinking as a key cognitive 
tool. System thinking as a way of thinking or engaging with the world based on the 
systemic perspective is differentiated from reductionism and mechanism. A brief 
history of systems thinking including incipient ideas in systems theory will be 
addressed. Several applications of systems thinking in sustainable engineering 
are presented. 
Week 5 – Sustainable Engineering Framework: Frameworks have been copiously 
proposed in the literature. Predicated on the concept of sustainable development, 
the frameworks generally embody principles and tools derived eclectically from 
several disciplines. Examples include Earth Charter Principles, Eco-Industrial 
Parks (EIPs), Design for X (DfX), LCA, etc. The integration of these components 
is usually presented as a sustainable engineering framework. 
Week 6 – Application of Sustainable Engineering: Sustainable engineering is 
gaining currency both as a profession and as a discipline. There is so much 
enthusiasm about applying the ideals of the discipline to real-life projects. 
Numerous examples of projects in which the principles of sustainable engineering 
are applied will be presented.

Week 7 – Sustainable Engineering in Nigeria: An overview of engineering in 
Nigeria is given followed by a review of the Nigerian sustainability experience. 
Topics covered in Engineer in Society are subsumed here. Nigerian engineering 
code of ethics and sustainability principles are compared. The role of COREN in 
engineering sustainability is discussed. The challenges of sustainable engineering 
in Nigeria as well as mitigation measures are covered. 
Week 8 – Sustainable Engineering Activity: An engineering project (proposed, 
ongoing or completed) in the Nigerian context is chosen. Students are tasked to 
identify the sustainability implications of the selected project and thereafter 
suggest possible mitigations. Implications should cover the sustainability pillars of 
economy, environment and society. A 1000 word report is written at the end of the 
activity. 
Week 9 – Sustainable Engineering Seminar I: Various literature on sustainable 
engineering is provided for students to critically review and subsequently present 
a critique of a selected work during short student-led seminars. Students are 
expected to write a 1000 word discussion paper on the selected piece of literature. 
Week 10 – Earth Systems Engineering and Management (Allenby, 2012): 
Sustainable Engineering at a Planetary Scale. Although still a maturing field, 
sustainable engineering at the ESEM level can draw on a number of areas of 
study. Assorted ideas on geoengineering, urban design management & high 
modernism, theoretical ESEM principles, ESEM governance principle and final 
principle will be addressed. 
Week 11 – Sustainable Engineering Seminar II: Various media sources other than 
textbooks and journals on sustainability are suggested for students to critically 
review and subsequently make a presentation during short student-led seminars. 
Students will write a 1000 word discussion paper on the selected medium. 
Week 12 – The Engineer as Leader (Allenby, 2012): In the sustainability 
worldview, an engineer should exhibit myriad qualities: commitment, respect for 
values and opposing viewpoints, willingness to learn and work in multidisciplinary 
contexts. Engineers are increasingly required to also function as leaders within 
their institutions, communities, and society. An engineer should have ideas about 
a variety of topics.

Trialling a Sustainable Engineering Course 
This section trials a sustainable engineering course by means of a sustainability 
workshop. The prospect of running a sustainable engineering course in a typical 
Nigerian engineering class setting is assessed. Participants (n=21) in the workshop 
were recruited randomly and included undergraduate (n=11) and postgraduate (n=10) 
students. The workshop held separately for the two student groups. The section 
presents an overview of the workshop stating its layout including preliminary 
sustainability assessments and a presentation on sustainable engineering. Other 
features of the workshop highlighted are sustainable engineering activity and post-
workshop assessments.  
 
Weeks 13 – 15 – Collaborative Sustainable Engineering Project: Working in a 
team, students collaborate to conceive and design a project in accord with 
sustainability ideals. An ideal collaborative project is multidisciplinary and should 
involve students of various engineering disciplines. A 2000 word essay is written 
individually in addition to a 5000 word collaborative project report.

Workshop Overview 
A workshop was organised to trial an introductory course on sustainability in a typical 
Nigerian engineering class setting. The workshop entitled Sustainable Engineering 
Workshop (Figure 8.2) involved two groups of students: undergraduates (n=11) and 
postgraduates (n=10). The students were recruited via a handbill (Figure 8.3) 
distributed randomly at two Nigerian engineering institutions in Kaduna metropolis. 
The workshop was conducted separately for each student category. Both the 
undergraduate and postgraduate sessions held at different times in the Air Force 
Institute of Technology, Kaduna. Whilst the undergraduate session held on 1 July 
2017, the postgraduate session took place on 8 July 2017. The handbill distributed for 
the workshop contained information on the purpose of the workshop, dates of 
sessions, venue and contact address.

The layout of the workshop is presented in Figure 8.4. Four sessions were conducted 
in the sustainable engineering workshop over a one-hour period including preliminary 
assessments, sustainable engineering presentation, sustainable engineering activity, 
and post-workshop assessments.   
Session 1: Preliminary Assessments 
Session one lasted 10 min and focused on evaluating the sustainability knowledge of 
the participating students prior to the presentation on sustainable engineering. The 
session proceeded with students undertaking a five-question quiz covering basic 
aspects of sustainability and sustainable engineering. These included open-ended 
questions on the definition of sustainability, pillars of sustainability, and definition of 
sustainable engineering. Others covered the rationale for sustainable engineering and 
examples of projects that can be engineered sustainably. A sample of the pre-
workshop sustainability test is at Appendix XII.

Session 2: Presentation on Sustainable Engineering 
Session 2 lasted 25 min and featured a presentation on sustainable engineering. The 
presentation discussed such topics as origins of sustainable engineering, definition of 
sustainable engineering, rationale for sustainable engineering, frameworks, tools and 
principles of sustainable engineering, and application of sustainable engineering. The 
presentation was a concise summary of the Weeks 1 – 3 & 5 – 6 topics in the designed 
introductory sustainable engineering course (see Chapter Nine). Students were 
exposed to the precursory activisms, movements, and global commissions that 
contributed to the evolution of sustainable engineering. The various connotations and 
renditions of sustainability and sustainable engineering as well as the pillars of 
sustainable development were explained to the students. Significantly, conventional 
engineering was differentiated from sustainable engineering in order to aid students’ 
appreciation of the distinction between the two problem-solving approaches.  
238 
 
The field of sustainable engineering was rationalised based on the intricate link 
between engineering and economic activities. Students were made to appreciate that 
engineering, being the principal facilitator of socioeconomic activities, is required for 
societal progress such as promoted in sustainability discourse. The instrumental value 
of engineering was invoked with reference to historic engineering interventions in 
society to underline the point that sustainability challenges can also benefit from 
engineering solutions. Examples of sustainable engineering frameworks derived from 
the various tools and principles highlighted in Chapter Three were mentioned in the 
presentation. Handouts on the sustainable engineering principles were given to the 
students as further reading materials. In highlighting the application of sustainable 
engineering, the examples of revamping Nigerian refineries and the completed Jubilee 
River in England were offered. Whilst the latter exemplified a project that was executed 
in line with the principles of sustainable engineering, the former epitomised a project 
that can be engineered sustainably. The presentation ended with a summary of the 
major points. 
Session 3: Sustainable Engineering Activity 
Session 3 featured a sustainable engineering activity which lasted 15 min. The activity 
presented the students with a railway project scenario in Nigeria and tasked them to 
consider its possible sustainability issues. The task read thus: 
 
 “In order to expand intra-national transportation, Nigeria has begun to revamp its 
railway system. The Abuja-Kaduna rail project is already up and running. Imagine you 
were an engineer on the project. Using the 3 pillars of sustainability (environment, 
society and economy), what sustainability issues would you consider in the project?”  
This activity was designed to be an interactive session with the students sharing ideas 
and experiences amongst themselves. Examples under each sustainability pillar were 
provided in order to assist the students in coming up with relevant issues. Students 
were encouraged to think of possible mitigations of the concerns raised. The Abuja-
Kaduna railway project was chosen for the reason of familiarity. As residents of 
Kaduna metropolis, the students might be aware of the railway project and some might 
have journeyed on the train. Such personal experience with the project could perhaps 
aid the students’ appreciation of sustainability issues. 
239 
 
Session 4: Post-Workshop Assessments 
Session 4 which lasted for 10 min featured two assessments, namely post-workshop 
sustainability test and workshop evaluation. The post-workshop sustainability test was 
a repeat of the quiz undertaken by the students at the beginning of the workshop. The 
students were asked the same five open-ended sustainability questions contained in 
the pre-workshop test. There was, however, a slight variation in the questioning style 
as seen in the quiz sample at Appendix XIII. The aim of the post-workshop test was to 
assess the sustainability learning that had taken place as a result of the students’ 
participation in the workshop. The outcome of the test would be compared with that of 
the pre-workshop sustainability test, hence the need to replicate the questions. The 
students were advised to answer the questions in their own words and avoid verbatim 
reproduction of definitions, except for key terms.  
For the workshop evaluation, a survey was administered to the students featuring four 
questions. Students were requested to reflect on the workshop and respond to the 
following statements indicating the extent of agreement or disagreement with them: 
(a) Participating in the workshop helped me learn about sustainability concepts (b) 
Participating in the workshop helped me appreciate the need for sustainable 
engineering in Nigeria (c) I enjoyed participating in the workshop (d) I am convinced 
that sustainable engineering education should be introduced into Nigerian engineering 
curriculum. The workshop evaluation survey intended to assess students’ satisfaction 
with the sustainable engineering workshop, which would be useful in appreciating the 
prospect of success of the introductory sustainable engineering course. A sample of 
the workshop evaluation survey is at Appendix XIV.  
Test Scoring Criteria 
The pre- and post-workshop tests were allotted a maximum possible score of 20 each. 
The test questions, Q1- Q5, were assigned highest possible scores of 5, 3, 5, 4 and 3 
respectively based on importance and complexity. Two markers who possessed a 
graduate-level sustainability knowledge assessed the tests with each quiz marked 
twice and the mean calculated. The use of key terms in responding to the definition 
questions was considered essential for a pass mark on those questions. The questions 
that required a list of items such as pillars of sustainability and examples of sustainable 
engineering projects were passed only when the items were accurately mentioned. 
240 
 
Hence, participants could score zero marks on such questions. With regard to the 
sustainable engineering justification question, a zero mark was possible where 
respondents failed to logically rationalise the field of engineering sustainability. Citing 
relevant examples attracted full marks on the justification question.    
Pre-Workshop Sustainability Test  
The sustainability knowledge of the participating students (n=21) was tested before 
the workshop. Results of the test are presented below.  
Undergraduate Participants 
Undergraduate students (n=11) were tested on five sustainability-related questions. 
The quiz covered the definition of sustainability, sustainability pillars, definition of 
sustainable engineering, justification of sustainable engineering, and examples of 
sustainable engineering projects. Table 8.1 presents the result of the pre-workshop 
test. On the question of sustainability definition, the average score was 2.1 out of 5 
with only 2 students scoring up to 4 marks. The average score on the pillars of 
sustainability was 0.9 out of 3, which implied that only few students acknowledged the 
sustainability pillars. Students had an average score of 1.5 out of 5 on the sustainable 
engineering definition question, with some of the students unable to even attempt a 
definition. Asked to justify the field of sustainable engineering, students earned a mean 
score of 0.7 out of 4 and nearly half of them failed to rationalise the discipline. On the 
question of projects that can be engineered sustainably, students obtained an average 
score of 1.9 out of a maximum of 3, with only three of them providing relevant 
examples. Overall, the mean score of the undergraduate students on the pre-
workshop sustainability test was 7.2 out of a maximum score of 20.

Postgraduate Participants 
The pre-workshop test administered to the postgraduate students (n=10) featured 
questions on sustainability definition, sustainability pillars, sustainable engineering 
definition, sustainable engineering rationale, and examples of sustainable engineering 
projects. Table 8.2 presents the scores of the postgraduate students on the pre-
workshop sustainability test. On the question of sustainability definition, the average 
score was 1.8 out of a maximum score of 5. Many students could not define 
sustainability. None of the postgraduate students was able to mention the pillars of 
sustainability which returned an average score of 0.0 on the question. Students had a 
mean score of 1.7 out of 5 on the question of the definition of sustainable engineering 
with two students failing to attempt the question. The question on the justification of 
sustainable engineering recorded an average score of 1.1 out of a maximum of 4 
points with nearly half of the students unable to justify the field. Asked to mention three 
examples of projects that can be engineered sustainably, almost all the postgraduate 
students cited relevant projects, with only one students unable to mention any. On the 
whole, the mean score of the postgraduate students on the pre-workshop 
sustainability test was 7.3 out of a maximum score of 20.

Sustainable Engineering Activity 
A sustainable engineering activity was undertaken during the workshop. Excerpts from 
the activity are presented below.  
Undergraduate Participants 
Table 8.3 presents excerpts from undergraduate student responses. The students 
generally evinced an understanding of the issues raising environmental sustainability 
concerns such as biodiversity loss, air pollution, vibration effects, deforestation and 
possible ground water pollution. The recurring social sustainability issues included 
security, safety, and disruption of settlements, whilst economic considerations were 
mostly construction, maintenance, and training costs as well as financial implications 
of extenuating both social and environmental sustainability concerns.

Postgraduate Participants 
Table 8.4 presents excerpts from postgraduate student responses to the sustainable 
engineering task. The students generally demonstrated an understanding of the issues 
with considerations for the environment eliciting such concerns as noise pollution, 
reduced farmland, soil nutrient loss, and air pollution. In terms of social sustainability, 
the students cited security, reduced rural-urban migration, safety, and severance of 
familial ties. The economic concerns included material costs, maintenance, revenue, 
cheaper fares, and improved economic activities.

Collating Pre- and Post-Workshop Test Scores 
Results of the pre- and post-workshop tests on the sustainability knowledge of the 
participating students were collated. The outcome of this comparison is presented in 
the succeeding sections.  
Undergraduate Participants 
Results (Table 8.7) showed that the performance of the undergraduate participants on 
the post-workshop test (M = 13.5, SD = 2.6) was better than the students’ performance 
on the pre-workshop test (M = 7.2, SD = 4.1). All the students made remarkable 
progress in their overall scores on the sustainability test, although two students 
increased by less than 3 points. The mean increment between the pre- and post-
workshop test scores was 6.3 with a standard deviation of 3.1. A repeated-measures 
t-test found this difference to be statistically significant, t (10) = 6.71, p < 0.001. Hence,

Workshop Evaluation Survey 
Undergraduate and postgraduate students were asked to reflect on the sustainable 
engineering workshop and indicate the extent of their agreement or disagreement with 
four statements. The first two statements sought students’ opinion on the effectiveness 
of the workshop in facilitating a knowledge of sustainability concepts and in justifying 
the need for sustainable engineering in Nigeria. The last two statements were queries 
on whether participants enjoyed the workshop and if the workshop influenced their 
conviction for sustainability education to be introduced in the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum. The results of the workshop evaluation survey are presented in Table 8.9. 
From the findings, all the students positively agreed with the four statements. Hence, 
both undergraduate and postgraduate students opined that the workshop had helped 
them learn about sustainability. Similarly, the students agreed that the workshop was 
effective in helping them appreciate the need for sustainable engineering in Nigeria. 
Furthermore, both groups of students found the workshop enjoyable. Finally, the 
students unanimously accepted that sustainability education should be introduced in 
the Nigerian engineering curriculum Overall, the workshop evaluation revealed a 
positive feedback for an introductory sustainable engineering course.

Discussion 
A bipartite sustainability education intervention is proposed in this study. One part of 
the intervention sets out a guideline for the introduction of sustainability education in 
the Nigerian engineering curriculum. The other intervention element is a sustainability-
titled introductory course designed to be included in the official BMAS document for 
subsequent adoption by the Nigerian HEIs.  
Guideline for the Intervention 
The intervention guideline is a set of steps that can be followed to ensure a successful 
implementation of sustainability education in the Nigerian engineering curriculum. An 
important feature of the guideline is that it espouses the top-down and bottom-up 
approaches as well as iteration. The four areas covered in the guideline, namely 
governmental role, regulatory and professional bodies, university leadership, and 
teaching staff are essential to the success of the intervention. Roles of government, 
regulators and university leadership in the implementation of a national sustainability 
education framework are greatly acknowledged in sustainability education research 
(UNEP-MESA, 2009; UNESCO, 2013). Additionally, the sustainability education 
declarations reviewed in Chapter Two repeatedly stress the critical role of educational 
authorities in the design and development of sustainability education. The Abuja 
Declaration, for example, assigns roles for HEIs, national and regional governments

as well as development partners in its call for action on sustainability education in 
African HEIs (AAU, 2009). In the Nigerian context where the government has 
enormous powers to determine national interests, a fact also alluded to in the 
stakeholders’ comments (Chapter Seven), government involvement in sustainability 
education efforts cannot be overemphasised. This understanding has contributed to 
the composition of the guideline in which the Nigerian Government is allotted a 
noticeable role. 
The rationale for including regulators and professional associations in the guideline is 
evident in their statutory roles. Studies have shown that the efforts of regulatory and 
professional associations cannot be decoupled from the modest progress made in 
sustainability education in engineering programmes of several countries (Coral, 2009; 
Penlington and Steiner, 2010). The experiences of UK-SPEC, ABET, and IPE are 
exemplary (Chapter Two). As already established in Chapter Three, COREN features 
a sustainability competence as a learning outcome of engineering programmes in 
Nigeria, but fails to follow through with an appropriate sustainability content in the 
BMAS document. Furthermore, the body has not made sustainability teaching an 
accreditation requirement as obtainable in the other regulatory bodies. Thus, in line 
with ideas of global best practice to which the stakeholders alluded in their comments 
(Chapter Seven), the engineering regulators in Nigeria could make sustainability 
education an accreditation condition.  
Similar to the role of the professional and regulatory bodies is that of university leaders 
and teaching staff. This role is rather obvious and warrants no expatiation. Suffice it to 
state that in HEIs where sustainability education has been well-received, university 
management and teaching staff played a significant role. Such potentiality of HEI 
leadership in the advancement of sustainability education is aptly captured in not only 
the sustainability education declarations but in other myriad intervention proposals 
(Coral, 2009; Watson et al., 2013; Etse and Ingley, 2016). Hence, university leadership 
and engineering teaching staff in Nigeria are suitably poised to contribute towards the 
realisation of sustainability education in the Nigerian engineering curriculum. The only 
caveat, however, is on the need to capacitate the Nigerian engineering educators to 
have the requisite knowledge and skills to participate effectively in the teaching of 
sustainability to engineering students. Such measure can be undertaken by individual 
HEIs.

Introductory Sustainability-Titled Course   
The proposed course entitled “An Introduction to Sustainable Engineering in Nigeria” 
aims to introduce Nigerian engineering students to some fundamentals and theories 
of sustainable engineering. It is an attempt to fill a gap that has been identified in the 
present study, i.e. the lack of a bespoke sustainable engineering course in the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum. The course is suggested to run as a common course 
subsuming and replacing the existing Engineer in Society module, which has been 
found to pervade the Nigerian engineering curriculum. The choice of the course title is 
informed by the need to reflect the Nigerian context and to situate sustainable 
engineering practice in Nigeria within a global setting. The main elements of the course 
structure are introduction, learning outcomes, assessment criteria, weekly topics and 
a reading list. The introduction provides a brief background to the course and states 
the purpose for which it is run. Such information does not only correspond with best 
practice in curricular development and course design, but also stimulates interest in a 
sustainability course (Heywood, 2005a). Similarly, learning outcomes and assessment 
criteria are all considered important descriptors of a course. 
The choice of the fifteen weekly topics is based on the learning outcomes of the 
proposed course and on the assumption of a semester-long course. The topics have 
been chosen and arranged to progressively introduce the students to the ideals of 
sustainable engineering over a 15-week period. The first three topics (Weeks 1-3) 
invite the students to appreciate the rationale for sustainable engineering presenting 
the historical context and the underpinning philosophies of the field. These topics are 
essential to expose the students to some of the reasons for the ascendance of 
sustainable engineering and the need for its practice. It is assumed that only when 
students buy into the sustainability worldview will they be motivated towards 
sustainability literacy. The next three topics (Weeks 4-6) introduce the students to the 
tools of sustainable engineering with reference to systems thinking and the application 
of sustainable engineering in the real world. These themes which naturally follow the 
theoretical underpinnings seek to point the students in the direction of sustainable 
engineering principles, frameworks and methods. Having established the rationale for 
engineering sustainability, it is appropriate to consider how projects can be engineered 
sustainably.  
252 
 
The topic in Week 7 focuses on Nigeria and seeks to underscore the relevance, 
application and likely challenges of sustainable engineering in the country. The topic 
is in line with the objects of contextual focus and local content highlighted by the 
stakeholders. Sustainability issues have been discovered to be better appreciated 
through context-relevant discussions (Jenneth and Ros, 2008; Lucena, 2013). The 
topics in Weeks 8, 9 and 11 feature a sustainable engineering activity and seminars 
as part of the PBL and PjBL approaches adopted in the course. These are intended 
to give students an opportunity to work out learning needs and to connect learning 
with the outside world. Weeks 10 and 12 feature themes adapted from Allenby’s 
(2012) topics proposal for a sustainable engineering course. These topics are 
considered important in the Nigerian context given the broad focus of the ESEM and 
the essence of The Engineer as Leader. For Weeks 13-15, a collaborative sustainable 
engineering project is proposed to encourage teamwork and the ability to conceive, 
design and implement an engineering project sustainably.  
The reading list provided at the end of the outline has been drawn in line with the 
purpose of the proposed course. The textbooks are intended to broaden the students’ 
knowledge of the field and to expose them to the extensive scholarly work that has 
been undertaken in the area. Each textbook on the reading list is considered an 
important resource in the understanding of the fundamental concepts and theories of 
sustainability and sustainable engineering. Although the works have mainly been 
undertaken in the developed world context, this fact does not necessarily diminish their 
relevance to an introductory course on sustainable engineering for the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum. The wide-ranging issues covered in the textbooks including 
references to other works will provide the students with a rich content from which to 
study further. However, it is desirable to have similar scholarly works in the Nigerian 
context featured on the reading list. Presently, such works are rare, and it would be an 
interesting future work to produce a sustainable engineering textbook in the Nigerian 
context.  
Contrasting Students’ Pre-Workshop Test Scores  
The pre-workshop sustainability test recorded strikingly similar overall mean scores 
for both groups of students (PG=7.3, UG=7.2). Given that the highest possible score 
on the test was 20, a low level of sustainability knowledge is inferred. Furthermore, an 
253 
 
almost equal level of sustainability awareness amongst the students in both categories 
is deduced. The findings of Chapter Five have already shown that Nigerian 
engineering students irrespective of academic status generally exhibit a low level of 
sustainability knowledge. Students tend to be largely unaware of sustainability issues 
especially before an intervention. This could, therefore, account for the poor 
performance of the students on the pre-workshop sustainability test. Interestingly, 
some undergraduate students on the test had a fair idea of sustainability pillars which 
totally eluded the postgraduate students. Although just two undergraduate students 
listed all the pillars of sustainability correctly (possibly copied from each other) the fact 
that none of the postgraduate students could mention even one of the three 
sustainability pillars indicates a worrying gap. The implication is that sustainability 
education intervention at postgraduate level is as important as an intervention at 
undergraduate level.  
Another remarkable contrast between the undergraduate and postgraduate students 
relates to the highest score recorded on the pre-workshop sustainability test. For the 
undergraduates it was 16 out of 20, whilst the postgraduates had a top score of 11. 
This suggests that at least one undergraduate student, who might have learned about 
sustainability via media sources (Chapter Seven), had a relatively good knowledge of 
the sustainability issues highlighted on the test. The importance of alternative sources 
of sustainability knowledge such as Internet and TV is noteworthy. The postgraduates’ 
comparatively low top score is indicative of an across-the-board unacquaintance with 
the basics of sustainability. Nevertheless, all the postgraduate students except one 
effortlessly provided appropriate sustainability project examples; the undergraduate 
students could not satisfactorily illustrate such projects. Familiarity with real-life 
projects, perhaps through involvement in engineering works, might have enhanced the 
chances of the postgraduate students to offer these examples. Additionally, justifying 
sustainable engineering was particularly more difficult for the undergraduate students 
than it was for the postgraduate students, albeit trivially. This could have resulted from 
a difference in levels of critical reasoning skills coupled with poor sustainability 
knowledge. Overall, the findings of the pre-workshop test point to the need for an 
intervention.  
254 
 
Outcome of the Sustainable Engineering Activity 
The outcome of the sustainable engineering activity undertaken by the students during 
the workshop was encouraging. All the students grasped the purpose and teaching 
point of the activity. Nevertheless, some observations are made with respect to the 
students’ responses. An important observation is that students readily distinguished 
environmental issues for the railway project in the sustainable engineering scenario. 
Conversely, students struggled to discern social and economic concerns relevant to 
the given scenario. This suggests that whereas environmental aspects of sustainability 
are easily identifiable, social and economic issues are not. However, this is not quite 
unexpected given the currency of environmental sustainability as documented in the 
literature and reported in the present study (Chapters Two and Three). The implication 
of this observation for a sustainable engineering course is that learning techniques 
must be geared towards training students to recognise all possible sustainability 
issues of a project. One way of achieving such objective is through interactive 
strategies which the workshop did not adequately accentuate.  
An additional point noted from the sustainable engineering activity is the failure of the 
students to mention possible mitigating measures of the sustainability challenges. This 
might have occurred due to a flaw in the design of the sustainable engineering activity. 
Alternatively, the omission might have been a consequence of students’ inability to 
properly understand the task instruction. However, since a few of the students 
mentioned some possible extenuation of the identified issues, the oversight could not 
have resulted from instruction ambiguity. Nonetheless, to achieve optimum outcomes 
sustainable engineering activities should be designed in a way that minimises 
communication gaps. In terms of contextual relevance, some students mentioned a 
few social issues that could ensue from the railway project example, such as reduced 
kidnapping incidents,36 loss of family ties, etc. This is an evidence of not only thinking 
outside the box but also of appropriately contextualising a problem. The implication for 
the trialled course is that such mode of thinking should be encouraged in sustainable 
engineering courses. 
                                            
36 Kidnapping incidents along Kaduna – Abuja road soared in 2017 with cases reported on a daily 
basis. Travellers resorted to journeying by train in order to outmanoeuvre the criminals. 
255 
 
Contrasting Students’ Post-Workshop Test Scores  
The difference between the overall mean scores of postgraduate and undergraduate 
students on the post-workshop test is marginal (PG=14.2, UG=13.5). Generally, the 
post-workshop performance of the two student groups is impressive given the highest 
possible score of 20.  Nonetheless, some undergraduate students still struggled to 
define sustainability with one of them utterly failing to delineate the concept. The 
postgraduate students, on the other hand, evinced a reasonable grasp of the 
sustainability definition, even though one of them also misrepresented the concept. 
Interestingly, both groups of students were able to list the three pillars of sustainability. 
Furthermore, there was an impressive attempt by both groups to define sustainable 
engineering, which yielded the same mean score of 3.4. All students made a modest 
effort to justify sustainable engineering scoring an average of 50% on the justification 
question. With the exception of one undergraduate participant, all students grasped 
how to typify sustainable engineering projects. The highest scores amongst 
undergraduate and postgraduate students were 17 and 18 respectively.  
The outcome of the post-workshop test reveals fairly good knowledge of the five 
sustainability-related questions. The small margin between the overall mean scores of 
the two student groups is indicative of the students’ potential to learn regardless of 
academic level. By and large, the post-workshop scores portray a student group that 
is willing to learn, but still facing some difficulties. The ability of the students to 
reproduce the three pillars of sustainability suggests that learning has taken place. 
However, the unsuccessful attempt of some students to define sustainability and 
sustainable engineering as well as justify sustainable engineering could be attributed 
to the complexities of these topics. Moreover, it could mean that the intervening lecture 
was inadequate for imparting such knowledge. These two constraints are important 
for running a sustainable engineering course. The lesson is that adequate time must 
be allotted to clarifying the basics of sustainability and justifying the field of sustainable 
engineering.     
Comparing Pre- and Post-Workshop Test Scores 
Comparing the pre- and post-workshop test scores based on a repeated measures t-
test, a significant progress is evident in the performance of the two student groups. 
The undergraduate participants moved from an overall mean score of 7.2 to 13.5, 
256 
 
whilst the postgraduate respondents had their overall mean score increase from 7.3 
to 14.2. With a mean percentage increase of 88% for both groups of students, the 
marked improvement can be linked to an intervention, which, in this case, is the 
sustainable engineering workshop. The workshop manifestly facilitated the students’ 
enhanced knowledge of sustainability. Some of the students had quite impressive 
percentage increments on the test with one undergraduate student’s score increasing 
by 400%. This student had a paltry pre-workshop test score of 2 but eventually 
achieved a post-workshop test score of 10. Similarly, a postgraduate student who had 
scored 4 points on the pre-workshop test earned a post-workshop score of 14 points, 
gaining a 250% increment.  
The potential of the introductory course to increase the sustainability knowledge of 
students is confirmed. Corroborating this is the outcome of the workshop evaluation 
survey in which the students unanimously agreed to have learned about sustainability 
from the workshop. Hence, an introductory sustainable engineering course is useful 
for teaching and learning about basic sustainability concepts. Another strength of the 
workshop and by extension the introductory course is a potential to make students 
appreciate the need to engineer projects sustainably in Nigeria. This fact is also 
deduced from the workshop evaluation survey and can be linked to the sustainable 
engineering activity featured in the workshop. The use of the Abuja - Kaduna railway 
project as a scenario in the classroom activity provided an apt setting for students to 
identify and relate meaningfully with the problem. Thus, localising sustainability issues 
is obviously an effective way of provoking not only interest in sustainable engineering 
but also original thinking based on cultural experiences of sustainability challenges. 
Limitations 
An important constraint of the research is that the proposed sustainability education 
intervention, especially the designed sustainability course, is limited to findings and 
interpretations in the present study. Although the suggested sustainable engineering 
course is informed by remarkable insights gained from various analyses in the study, 
it is not a flawless proposal. Subjectivity cannot be completely ruled out in the choice 
and structure of the course content. Hypothetically, it is conceivable that a different 
researcher may come up with a dissimilar course design given the same information. 
However, the fact that the Nigerian engineering curriculum has been established to 
257 
 
offer no sustainable engineering module, an introductory course is considered most 
suitable. Nonetheless, at the point of implementation by COREN, the proposed course 
could benefit from deliberations of engineering academics and practitioners including 
deans and heads of engineering departments from all Nigerian HEIs. This could be 
done during one of the episodic reviews of the BMAS document, in which the new 
course is proposed to be inserted.  
Some other limitations acknowledged in the study involve the design of the sustainable 
engineering workshop. The one-hour duration may be insufficient to adequately trial 
the introductory sustainability course. In particular, the 25 min allotted to the 
presentation session did not allow for an extensive discussion and explanation of 
sustainability and sustainable engineering issues. This constraint might have reduced 
the prospect of sustainability learning amongst the students as a few of them struggled 
with some questions on the post-workshop sustainability test. Failure to adequately 
treat the topics due to shortage of time could have been a contributing factor. However, 
the choice of the one-hour for the workshop was informed by the need to avoid 
overburdening the students and the objective of the workshop to provide a rudimentary 
sketch of sustainable engineering. Moreover, the overall performance of the students 
on the post-workshop test and the outcome of the workshop evaluation survey showed 
that time inadequacy might not have had any significant effects.  
Another limitation of the study is the apparently small sample size for both categories 
of participants as well as the inherent constraint of pre- and post-test assessment. 
Regarding the sample size, a slightly higher number of participants (n=30) would have 
been more desirable to represent a typical Nigerian engineering class. However, the 
workshop’s sample size (n=21) is not totally wide of the mark as some graduate and 
undergraduate (usually final year) engineering classes in Nigeria comprise a small 
number of students. Given the difficulty of recruiting participants, the sample size of 
the workshop is not only pragmatic but also potentially representative of a Nigerian 
engineering class. The issues of internal and external validity are raised in relation to 
the pre- and post-test assessment adopted in the study. This evaluation approach has 
the tendency to increase internal validity at the expense of external validity.  
In the present study, threats to internal validity were envisaged from participants’ prior 
sustainability knowledge. This concern was, however, disconfirmed by the overall low 
mean score of the students on the pre-workshop test; although two undergraduate 
258 
 
students had an above-average score on the test attributable to learning resources 
other than HEI-based lessons (Chapter Seven). Interestingly, there was no noticeable 
change in the performance of the two students on the post-test. Additionally, the 
assessment quiz featured open-ended questions that provided no clue to the possible 
answers. Thus, the internal validity of the pre- and post-workshop assessment scores 
was safeguarded having ruled out external influences. With regard to the external 
validity of the study, it is difficult to ascertain the degree or strength of generalisability. 
However, two measures taken towards improving the external validity of the study 
were random sampling and normality tests. Random selection of the participants by 
means of the handbill had the advantage of reducing bias that could have arisen from 
a strictly purposive sampling. Additionally, the result of the normality test conducted 
on the sample showed that the data was normally distributed (p = 0.101 at p < 0.05). 
Hence, the external validity of the study was not compromised by the use of the pre- 
and post-assessment instrument. 
Summary 
This chapter proposed and formulated an intervention for the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum and also trialled key elements of the designed sustainability course to test 
its effectiveness and suitability. Intervention requirements for the curriculum were 
defined as holistic and espousing the hybrid method of intervention as well as 
multidisciplinarity targeting the common courses classification. This resulted in a 
bipartite intervention comprising a guideline and an introductory course entitled “An 
Introduction to Sustainable Engineering in Nigeria.” Highlighted in the guideline were 
roles of government, regulators and professional bodies, university leaders, and 
teaching staff, whilst the sustainability course featured 15 weekly topics.  
A sustainable engineering workshop was organised to trial an introductory course on 
sustainability in a typical Nigerian engineering class setting. The workshop involved 
two student groups: undergraduate (n=11) and postgraduate (n=10). The outcome of 
the workshop comprised mainly insights into the prospect of successfully running a 
sustainable engineering course. The results of the pre-workshop test revealed that 
both undergraduate and postgraduate students had a low sustainability awareness 
having earned nearly equal overall mean scores of 7.2 and 7.3 out of 20 respectively. 
Similarly, the overall mean scores of the two student groups on the post-workshop test 
259 
 
were close at points 13.5 and 14.2 out of 20 for undergraduates and postgraduates 
respectively. The difference between the pre- and post-test scores was found to be 
significant based on a repeated-measures t-test for undergraduate students: t (10) = 
6.71, p < 0.001, and for postgraduate students: t (9) = 6.16, p < 0.001. 
Results of the workshop evaluation survey showed that all the students agreed to have 
learned about sustainability by participating in the sustainable engineering workshop. 
Furthermore, all the students indicated that participating in the workshop helped them 
to appreciate the need for sustainable engineering in Nigeria. The students were also 
unanimous in stating that they had enjoyed participating in the workshop. Lastly, all 
the students felt convinced of the need to introduce sustainable engineering education 
in Nigeria. Overall, the sustainable engineering workshop elicited a positive feedback 
for an introductory sustainable engineering course. Some of the lessons derived from 
the workshop included the need for an intervention at the postgraduate level as well 
as the appropriateness of incorporating systems thinking in the designed course. 
Another feedback from the workshop was the suitability of the sustainable engineering 
activity which aided in problem contextualisation. A key lesson of the workshop is the 
need to provide an adequate time for the course.

Further Work 
 
Introduction 
The present study aimed to formulate a suitable sustainability education intervention 
for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. To achieve this aim, the research queried the 
current level of sustainability knowledge of the Nigerian engineering community, 
examined the sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum, and 
explored sustainability education interventions appropriate for Nigerian engineering 
curriculum. Various research methods and tools were employed to address these 
questions including a modified sustainability literacy test, stakeholder survey, and 
content analysis of engineering documents. The study equally featured a workshop 
trial of sustainable engineering course. The findings of the study were contained in 
Chapters Five to Eight. This chapter concludes the entire thesis and highlights the 
contributions and further work emanating from the study. It underscores the usefulness 
and expediency of the proposed sustainability education intervention for the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum.

Conclusions 
Assessment #1: Current level of sustainability knowledge of the Nigerian 
engineering community 
An assessment of the sustainability literacy of the Nigerian engineering community 
was conducted based on three criteria: level of UNDESD awareness; performance on 
a sustainability literacy test; and self-assessment of sustainability knowledge, and 
across three cohorts: students; educators; and practitioners. The categorical data 
resulting from the survey were analysed and subsequently synthesised to holistically 
gauge the sustainability literacy level of Nigerian engineering community. From these 
analyses several findings ensued (Chapter Five). The Nigerian engineering 
community was found to largely exhibit very low sustainability literacy with a significant 
majority performing abysmally on all the assessment criteria. There was an evidence 
of widespread ignorance of the UNDESD within the Nigerian engineering community 
with students being the most uniformed. The Nigerian engineering community were 
more familiar with economic topics than the social or environmental issues. The least 
known sustainability themes across the board were the crosscutting topics. Slight 
familiarity with environmental sustainability and the candidness of students to admit 
sustainability illiteracy were the unexpected findings of the study.  
The findings corroborate the work of Azapagic et al (2005), reviewed in Chapter Two, 
which reported low level of sustainability knowledge amongst engineering students in 
Europe and America. Some studies (UNEP-MESA, 2009; Manteaw, 2012) have 
similarly exposed a widespread ignorance of global sustainability initiatives around the 
world, which raises concerns about the efficacy of such efforts. Therefore, obtaining 
comparable results for not only engineering students but also practitioners and 
educators in Nigeria suggests a crucial need for an intervention. However, such 
intervention cannot proceed with the view that the Nigerian engineering community 
are sufficiently informed about environmental issues, since the results of the present 
study have unpredictably revealed that such familiarity is not a given. Thus, even 
though it contradicts several researches (Hanning et al., 2012; UNESCO, 2014), the 
discovery of poor familiarity with environmental sustainability within the Nigerian 
engineering community is instructive. It accentuates the need to ensure that an 
intervention achieves a balance amongst the dimensions of sustainability.  
262 
 
Assessment #2: Sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum 
The sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum was analysed based 
on three engineering documents, namely official BMAS for engineering programmes, 
and engineering handbooks of two Nigerian HEIs. Additionally, the perspectives of 
engineering educators and students on the sustainability content of the engineering 
curriculum as operationalised in the Nigerian HEIs were examined. These data were 
tested against 37 sustainability topics obtained from an expert-derived list of 
sustainability themes (see Chapter Four). An outcome of the investigation (Chapter 
Six) was that the sustainability content of the engineering programmes was mostly 
low. The majority of the stakeholders strongly agreed that the sustainability themes 
were insufficiently covered in the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Also, environmental 
topics were found to be the most cited sustainability themes, whilst social concepts 
were the least stated. Most of the featured sustainability themes appeared in the 
traditional engineering management courses. Only the BMAS document mentioned 
sustainability competence as a learning outcome for engineering graduates. 
The findings are not unexpected of an engineering curriculum that has not been 
deliberately embedded with sustainability themes as reviewed in Chapter Three. The 
results are, however, consistent with the works of GuNi et al. (2011) and Etse and 
Ingley (2016) who reported low sustainability content in the academic programmes of 
African universities. Interestingly, studies outside the African continent, in regions with 
supposedly visible engineering sustainability education, have equally suggested an 
unsatisfactory sustainability content in a number of engineering programmes (Lozano 
and Watson, 2013; Watson, et al., 2013). This implies that in addition to devising an 
education intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum, implementation efforts 
must be strategised to ensure continued support at every stage of the intervention. 
Similarly, the dominance of the environmental content in the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum corroborates several studies (Coral, 2009; Byrne et al., 2010) stressing the 
need for a balanced sustainability education intervention. The presence of some 
sustainability themes in the engineering management courses point to the potential of 
subsuming such courses in an intervention as suggested by Allenby (2012).  
 
263 
 
Assessment #3: Suitable sustainability education intervention for the 
Nigerian engineering curriculum 
An assessment of a stakeholder survey was conducted to explore the sustainability 
education interventions appropriate for the Nigerian engineering curriculum (Chapter 
Seven). The stakeholders acknowledged a lack of sustainability programmes in 
Nigerian HEIs. Media sources such as educational television and Internet were 
discovered to be a great means of acquiring sustainability knowledge. The common 
course of Engineer in Society was the most perceived sustainability-relevant course. 
Virtually all the listed courses were biased towards environmental sustainability, and 
none had a sustainability title. Stakeholders expressed an overwhelming support for 
sustainability in terms of the need for involvement of Nigerian engineers, the need for 
sustainability expertise and the importance of sustainability in engineering education. 
The relevance of the various intervention approaches were viewed in the descending 
order of core, common, cross-disciplinary and discipline-specific courses. Emergent 
themes from the comments of the stakeholders were approach, focus area, challenge 
and imperative, all of which contributed to the formulation of a sustainability education 
intervention.  
Findings such as the lack of sustainability courses/degrees in the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum are plausible reasons for an intervention. However, studies have shown 
that sustainability courses/degrees are not designed and embedded into engineering 
programmes simply as a result of their absence (Azapagic et al., 2005; Allenby et al., 
2009; Murphy et al., 2009). In addition to political will, the evidence-based strategies 
reviewed in Chapter Two are critical to a successful sustainability intervention. 
Stakeholder participation and use of pedagogical techniques including the conversion 
of the common courses into sustainability courses are important components of an 
intervention. The prospect of an intervention in the Nigerian engineering curriculum is 
propitious as the stakeholders are favourably disposed to engineering sustainability. 
This finding confirms previous studies regarding stakeholder interest in sustainability 
issues (Mcfarlane and Ogazon, 2011; UNESCO, 2012; Fadeeva et al., 2014). With 
such an overwhelming support for sustainability by the engineering community in 
Nigeria, the likelihood of devising a successful sustainability education intervention is 
high.

Contributions 
Contribution #1: Bipartite Sustainability Education Intervention 
A bipartite sustainability education intervention which consists of a guideline and an 
introductory course entitled “An Introduction to Sustainable Engineering in Nigeria” 
was devised for the Nigerian engineering curriculum (Chapter Eight). Requirements 
for the intervention were defined as holistic and espousing the hybrid method (top-
down and bottom-up) as well as multidisciplinary approach targeting the common 
courses. These resulted from the findings of the study and the reviewed literature. The 
guideline is a set of steps that can be followed to ensure a successful implementation 
of the intervention. It covers roles of government, regulators and professional bodies, 
university leaders, and faculty, whose relevance has been established in sustainability 
education research (Chapters Two and Three). The proposed sustainability course 
features 15 weekly topics ranging from the foundational issues of rationale and 
principles down to the elaborate ideas of earth systems engineering. PBL, PjBL and 
other pedagogical techniques are encapsulated in the designed course. Aspects of 
the course trialled in a workshop were unanimously appreciated by participants.   
Contribution #2: Alternate Sustainability Literacy Test 
Testing the sustainability literacy of individuals is an important aspect of sustainability 
education research. Most sustainability literacy tests feature a set of multiple choice 
questions with four or five alternative answers. The ‘true/false/don’t know’ format is 
seldom used on a sustainability literacy test for the demerit of random guessing by 
respondents. The sustainability literacy test employed in the present study (Chapter 
Five) featured the ‘don’t know’ option alongside the true/false choices to mitigate the 
threat of guesswork. However, this required a caveat urging test takers to be as honest 
as possible with their answers since no penalties were due for any of the options. This 
measure proved successful as no random guessing pattern was detected on the 
sustainability literacy test. Other factors that informed the design of the test were 
unsuitability of the existing test tools with the purposes of the present study (such as 
probe of sustainability fundamentals), time and resources. These factors were catered 
for in the resulting sustainability literacy test. Therefore, the modified test instrument 
265 
 
can be utilised to test foundational sustainability knowledge especially where time and 
resources are limited.  
Contribution #3: Content Analysis of Nigerian Engineering Documents 
Content analysis as a way of gauging the spread or coverage of sustainability in an 
engineering curriculum is quite common in sustainability education research. Most of 
the curricular assessments relating to sustainability content have focused on the 
engineering curriculum in the form of documents published online by universities. 
However, such analyses are normally complemented by a stakeholder survey to 
account for the aspects of sustainability content that may have been missed on the 
websites of the universities. Curricular sustainability content analysis provides for an 
objective evaluation of the curriculum, but the curricular stakeholder survey assesses 
the subjective experience of stakeholders. Whilst a number of sustainability content 
analyses have been conducted on the engineering curricula of several HEIs around 
the world, the Nigerian engineering curriculum, prior to the present study, had not been 
assessed for sustainability content (Chapter Three). Hence, the sustainability content 
analysis of the Nigerian engineering documents undertaken in the current research 
(Chapter Six) is an invaluable baseline resource for future sustainability education 
research in Nigeria.  
Contribution #4: Extension of Sustainability Education Research 
Sustainability education research in the context of Nigerian engineering education is 
an extension of a study area with a history of developed world focus (Chapter Two). 
By examining the issues around sustainability education in the Nigerian engineering 
curriculum, the present study contributes to the continuing sustainability education 
discourse. This is especially relevant to the Nigerian engineering education community 
as the current research presents an opportunity to improve the engineering curriculum 
through the various sustainability education techniques. Furthermore, the research is 
useful in drawing the attention of educational authorities in Nigeria to develop a 
sustainability education framework as required in the numerous pacts ratified by the 
country’s leadership. Additionally, the study is a contribution to the existing knowledge 
on sustainability education since it revealed some country-specific details about the 
prospects and challenges of sustainability education in Nigeria. The recommended 
266 
 
sustainability education intervention (Chapter Eight) is actionable at various levels of 
command within the Nigerian educational authority structure.  
Contribution #5: Workshop Trialling of Sustainable Engineering Course 
The several approaches adopted in sustainability education research to measure the 
impact of a sustainability course have generally been in a post-intervention context. 
These are mostly full-fledged courses run over a semester in a community that is 
reasonably sustainability literate. In a pre-intervention context compounded by want 
of time and resources, it is nearly impossible to design, implement and assess the 
impact of a sustainability course. The workshop trial employed in the present study 
(Chapter Eight) provided a way around these constraints. It enabled the trial of aspects 
of the designed sustainable engineering course in a typical Nigerian engineering class 
setting. The outcome of the workshop satisfactorily served the purposes of the present 
study and indicated the usefulness of workshops as a means of trialling a sustainability 
course. Thus, where time and resources are insufficient, a sustainable engineering 
workshop can be organised to trial an introductory sustainability course.  
Further Work 
Further Work #1: Conversion of the Designed Course into a Postgraduate 
Sustainable Engineering Programme  
An important realisation from the present study was that a sustainable engineering 
programme at the postgraduate level was needed. There was almost no difference 
between the sustainability knowledge of postgraduate and undergraduate students. 
Similarly, the educators and practitioners displayed scant sustainability knowledge. 
Although the recommended introductory sustainability course can be taught at both 
educational levels, the course is designed for inclusion in the BMAS document and 
engineering handbooks of Nigerian HEIs. These documents are generally details of 
undergraduate programmes. However, the proposed sustainable engineering course 
can be upgraded to a postgraduate level programme either as a certificate course or 
a degree programme. Educators and practitioners could benefit from such courses. 
Nonetheless, this may require extensive consultations with stakeholders as well as 
insights gained from recognised postgraduate sustainable engineering programmes 
across the world. Study could be conducted in the future to achieve this goal.

Further Work #2: Assessment of the Influence of Religious Values on 
Sustainability Interest in Nigeria 
One of the challenges encountered in the present study was a disinclination of some 
stakeholders to participate in the research for socio-religious reasons. The disobliging 
individuals expressed strong objection to the concept of sustainability for contradicting 
the divine attributes of sustenance and providence. Religious issues could be a barrier 
to sustainability if the adherents of a religion fail to align their religious values with 
sustainability principles. In the incident reported in the present study, the main point of 
the religious argument was that the Earth needed no human protection since God who 
made it will sustain it.  Being a deeply religious society, Nigeria might be populated by 
a fair number of people who share this view. Insights from the educational aims 
discussed in Chapter Two would suggest the presence and potency of education for 
salvation. Such educational aim could either facilitate or hinder sustainability education 
efforts. The possibility of this eschatological educational paradigm influencing some 
members of the Nigerian engineering community against sustainability research is 
disquieting. It begs the question of how many engineering stakeholders in Nigeria are 
averse to sustainability issues for socio-religious reasons. A related question could be 
how pervasive is the religion-induced aversion to sustainability concepts across the 
Nigerian society. Future research could seek some answers to these questions.    
Further Work #3: Invitation of Nigerian HEIs to Register and Undertake the 
Sulitest 
The Sulitest, which is the web-based international literacy test instrument developed 
to examine global awareness of core sustainability knowledge and skills, is suitable 
for higher levels sustainability literacy. The tool is supported by the UN and has been 
used by at least 612 educational institutions from around the world. An advantage of 
the Sulitest is that it provides a potent database useful in mapping the current state of 
sustainability literacy. Participating universities can also use the test results to monitor 
progress of sustainability education initiatives over time. However, participation on the 
test requires an official registration. Interestingly, no Nigerian HEI has registered to 
use the Sulitest.37 In the future, when Nigerian HEIs will have adopted the designed 
sustainability course of the present study, they could register to undertake the Sulitest.

The outcome of the online sustainability test could form part of a future research to 
gauge the impact of the implemented sustainability course.  
Summary 
This chapter concluded the present thesis and presented the contributions and further 
work ensuing from the research. Evidence of scant sustainability knowledge of the 
Nigerian engineering community and inadequate sustainability content of the Nigerian 
engineering curriculum was found in the study. A bipartite intervention consisting of a 
guideline and an introductory sustainable engineering course was proposed as an 
implementation strategy. The contributions of the research included development of 
an alternate sustainability literacy test, creation of a baseline database from the 
content analysis of the Nigerian engineering curriculum, and extension of sustainability 
education research. Design of a postgraduate sustainable engineering programme, 
assessment of socio-religious impact on sustainability interest in Nigeria, and invitation 
of Nigerian HEIs to register with the Sulitest are studies that can be undertaken in the 
future.

Calculation of Survey Population  
Estimation of Student Population 
Estimation of Educator Population: The COREN recommended student/educator is 15:1. For a student 
population of 65,150, the educator population can be estimated thus: 1/15 x 65,150 = 4,343. Hence, the 
estimated educator population is 4,343. 
Estimation of Practitioner Population: Information obtained from COREN revealed that there are about 
30,000 registered engineers in Nigeria.  
Estimation of Population of Nigerian Engineering Community: The population of the Nigerian engineering 
community is estimated by summing the figures. This gives 65,150 + 4,343 + 30,000 = 99,493.

This study aims to formulate a sustainability education intervention for the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Using the mixed-method approach, the study assessed the level of sustainability knowledge of the Nigerian engineering community, examined the sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum, and proposed a context-relevant sustainability education intervention. Data for the study were sourced variously from publications of regulatory bodies, engineering handbooks, surveys and workshops with stakeholders. The Nigerian engineering community was discovered to have low sustainability literacy based on a sustainability literacy test, level of stakeholder awareness of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development, and self-assessment of sustainability knowledge. Both content analysis and stakeholder survey converged on the low sustainability content of the Nigerian engineering curriculum. With insights gained from the findings, a bipartite intervention consisting of a guideline and an introductory sustainable engineering course is proposed. Whilst the guideline specifies roles for government, regulators, university leaders and faculty, the designed course features 15-weekly topics for adoption in the engineering handbooks. Aspects of the proposed course trialled in a sustainable engineering workshop indicated favourable prospects for the introduction of the course. Workshop participants were unanimous in declaring the usefulness and expediency of sustainability education in the Nigerian engineering curriculum. Although the research findings are particularly relevant to the Nigerian engineering curriculum, the study confirms the slow uptake of sustainability education in the developing world. By closely examining the feasibility of sustainability education intervention in the engineering curriculum in a different cultural and social setting, the research contributes to the global efforts towards the reorientation of engineering education to sustainability","['Thesis', 'Doctoral']",disabled

Abstract 
Phishing attacks and other social manipulation attacks are an everyday occurrence for most workers in their email 
boxes. Others experience social engineering tricks to take and divert payments on legitimate electronic commerce 
transactions.  This exploratory pilot study aims to examine the impact of user’s personality on the likelihood of 
user’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks. Five expert interviews were conducted to investigate what traits 
makes some individuals more or sometimes less susceptible to social engineering attack than others. The 
personality traits were obtained using the big five personality model for correlation with interview data. The result 
suggests that users with high scores in agreeableness and extroversion traits are likely to be more susceptible to 
social engineering attack than others. These results are a useful start for further research into the impact of different 
tricks on different personality types.

INTRODUCTION 
Social engineering (SE) is a term generally used to describe the act of manipulating people to access information. 
It is the process of deceiving people to inadvertently perform an action that can cause harm or increase the 
probability of causing future harm (Stewart & Dawson, 2018, p. 188). Hadnagy in his view on social engineering, 
described it as “the art or better yet, science, of skilfully manoeuvring human beings to take action in some aspect 
of their lives” (Hadnagy, 2010, p. 10). Krombholz et al. described it as the process of manipulating users to 
compromise the information system (Krombholz, Hobel, Huber, & Weippl, 2015, p. 114). SE is a unique form of 
cyberattack which involves hacking humans through technology and the art of psychology of human behaviour to 
gain unauthorized access into an information system (Campbell, 2018, p. 1).  While hackers target loop holes in 
technology, social engineers manipulate humans to access information that cannot be easily accessed. Social 
engineers exploit human feelings and thoughts through fear, curiosity, greed and sympathy (Alexander, 2016). 
They capitalize on the psychology of people’s expect and tendency to help others (Jones, 2004, p. 3). SE attacks 
come in various forms ranging from telephone calls and email requesting personal information from what appears 
to be a legitimate source or text message (Parrish Jr, Bailey, & Courtney, 2009, p. 286). There are two main types 
of SE attacks, the targeted and target of opportunity (Bullée, Montoya, Pieters, Junger & Hartel, 2018).  A targeted 
attack is the one in which the attacker is very specific in terms of the victim while a target of opportunity attack is 
the one in which the attacker distributes to a lot of people hoping to get response from as many victims as possible. 
SE usually involves two stages, the location, and the psychological method used. The location is where the attack 
takes place. This could be online, at work place or over the telephone. The second phase involves using different 
psychological methods to manipulate a victim. It includes exploitation of asserted authority, people’s commitments 
and strong relationships. The exploitation can come in form of manipulating people’s tendency to help, 
reciprocation, liking and similarity (Jones, 2004, p. 4). Irrespective of the method used, the goal of a social engineer 
is to gain access to desired information by manipulating the victim without the victim’s awareness. 
Information is of great importance to governments and organizations. There has been a rise in information security 
violations with attempts to get sensitive information by illegal access. Organizations invest a lot in technical 
solutions to prevent information theft. However, technical solutions have proven to be insufficient as users are 
often the weakest link in an information system (Mouton, Malan, Leenen, & Venter, 2014, p. 28). The human link 
is believed to be the weakest link in an information security system (Mitnick, Simon, & Wozniak, 2006, p. 12; 
Mouton, Leenen, Malan, & Venter, 2014, p. 186). Humans often react to emotions which makes them more 
vulnerable than machines (Mouton, et al., 2014, p. 267). Mouton also noted that an organization’s biggest threat 
is not technical protection but the people working in the organization. Attackers find it easier to gain unauthorized 
access through people rather than penetrating the security system (Mouton, Leenen, et al., 2014, p. 267).  Several 
organizations tend to use training solutions and raising awareness through warnings about social engineering 
attacks. These methods have generally been proven to be ineffective (Junger, Montoya, & Overink, 2017, p. 75). 
Proceedings of the 16th Australian Information Security Management Conference (2018) 83
This is likely because most training around social engineering are based on detecting electronic threats such as the 
phishing attack and avoiding malware downloads which can be easy to manage. However, the human-based social 
engineering attack which has been neglected poses more threats to the organization (Hadnagy, 2010). In this paper 
we report exploratory pilot study research into personality type as an antecedent for human behaviour and adopt 
the research question “What individual’s personality traits is more susceptibility to social engineering attacks?” 
The following propositions were developed from the literature reviewed. 
P1: Each personality trait of the big five model are susceptible to different types of social 
engineering attack. 
P2: A user’s personality trait will increase the user’s susceptibility to social engineering attack. 
BACKGROUND LITERATURE 
Orgill et al. investigated user’s susceptibility to SE attacks by posing as a computer support engin eer 
from the organization asking for personal information such as username and passwords with the disguise 
of performing vulnerability auditing on the network. It was discovered that 80% of the people gave their 
username and 60% provided their password (Orgill, Romney, Bailey, & Orgill, 2004, p. 179). Also, the  
result showed that isolated users were easier to manipulate than those in groups. Furthermore, the effect 
of peer pressure and authority had significant influence on the likelihood of user’s suscepti bility to SE.  
Bakshi et al. conducted an e-mail based social engineering attack study to raise awareness and assess 
the threat of social engineering attacks on IT systems (Bakhshi, Papadaki, & Furnel l, 2009, p. 54). An 
experimental website was created and email with embedded link to website was sent out to employees. 
The result indicated that about 23 percent of the employees followed the link. A similar study by Jagatic 
et al. focused on phishing on social networks. The research was done on university students and the 
result indicated that the students were highly susceptible to fishing attack. Also, they found that females 
were more susceptible to phishing attacks than males (Salgado, J & Tauriz, 2014; Jagatic, Johnson, 
Jakobsson, Jakobsson, & Menczer, F., 2007).  
The result of these studies shows how vulnerable an organization can be to social engineering attacks. 
One of the ways to deal with social engineering attacks is to understand why individuals fall for this 
attack and then to provide training as a countermeasure. A successful SE attack can be determined by 
the extent to which the victim is able to resist manipulation or be able to detect the attack (Uebelacker 
& Quiel, 2014, p. 25). One of the ways of understanding what qualities makes people more susceptible 
to SE attacks more than others is in using behavioural or personality models. Personality models help 
to understand what makes people think and respond the way they do. Personality from a psychological 
perspective is defined as a state when a person’s thoughts, feelings and behavioural patterns are 
relatively stable (Uebelacker & Quiel, 2014, p. 25). Understanding the relationship between individuals 
and information security is particularly useful in forecasting an individual’s ability to maintain 
information security standards and policies (Shropshire, Warkentin, Johnston, & Schmidt, 2006, p. 
3435). There are multiple approaches to personality dimensions. Several models have been developed 
to identify different types of personality traits such as the Five Factor Model (the Big five). The Big 
five is one of the most widely used theoretical models and has received more attention than other options 
in the literature (Matz, Chan, & Kosinski, 2016, p. 36; Salgado & Tauriz, 2014, p. 3). The big five is 
coherent and scientific as it defines personalities along a continuum rather that in categories or types. It 
gives room for different types of behaviour in different circumstance. The big five tests determine 
personality traits using Openness to experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and 
Neuroticism referred to as OCEAN (Roccas, Sagiv, Schwartz, & Knafo, 2002, p. 7 92). Table 1 briefly 
describes the big five traits.

TEST SET UP 
A researcher’s perspective and assumptions of what constitutes truth and knowledge constructs the way we see 
ourselves, other people and the society around us. These views and beliefs are referred to as a paradigm (Cypress, 
2017). Schwandt defined paradigm as a shared world view that represents the beliefs and values in a discipline 
and that guides how problems are solved. A paradigm can help clarify research questions and help in research 
design. This research will employ a qualitative non-experimental method to answer the research question. The 
methods fit context-based research that will provide insight into and allow capturing other people’s perspective of 
real-life situations. A qualitative research approach is best suited for a study that serves the purpose of description, 
interpretation, verification, and evaluation of behaviour (Peshkin, 1993). Also, qualitative research generally seeks 
to answer the what, how and why question rather than how much or how many (Cypress, 2017). This best suits 
this study where a constructivism approach has been chosen with the underlying view that there is no single reality 
to be found, and knowledge is gained interactively (Chilisa & Kawulich, 2012, p. 9).  
Data is collected through a purposive, semi-structured, expert interview. Interview methods give voice to people, 
which allows them to freely present their life situations in their own words, and provide personal interaction 
between the researchers and their subjects (Kvale, 2006, p. 481). Also, interview research methods are more 
powerful tools for obtaining narrative data that allows researchers to investigate people's views in greater depth 
compared to questionnaires and surveys. In particular, expert interview is concerned about the participant’s 
knowledge and experiences as a result of their actions, roles, responsibilities or obligations within a specific 
organization or institution (Littig & Vienna, 2013). Expert interviews are more efficient and concentrated way of 
gathering quick quality data than using observation and surveys (Bogner, Littig, & Wolfgang, 2009, p. 3). An 
expert in this sense is a person with insight in aggregated or specific knowledge (Albladi & Weir, 2018).  Also an 
important consideration in qualitative research is determining the sample size. The determination of qualitative 
sample size is challenging one that is based on different study designs and contextual considerations (Turner-
Bowker et al., 2018, p. 842). Contrary to a quantitative research approach where the sample size can be calculated 
using statistical techniques, qualitative sample size is calculated by the number of participants that will be needed 
to attain saturation (Glaser, Strauss, & Strutzel, 1968, p. 61). The concept of saturation emerges when no more 
data are being found. In this study the number five was chosen from participants who had experienced on social 
engineering attack, and hence were classed knowledgeable of the phenomena and hence a quicker saturation point 
was reached for the pilot study. The thematic analysis was conducted using the NVIVO software. 
RESULTS 
The interview and trait data was thematically analysed in NIVO and is presented in the following two tables. Table 
2 presents an overview of the factors identified by participants that made them susceptible to SE attacks based on 
their experience as a victim. Table 3 shows their personality traits. 
The findings present some contradictions to the previous findings reported, for example, McCormac et al., 2017; 
Shropshire et al., 2006, p. 3446, regarding which personality trait is more prone to SE attack. Participant one 
believed the attack was successful because of a trusting relationship, love, or humour as a motivating factor. These 
findings are indications of extraversion and agreeableness traits which agrees with the participants personality 
result. Participant two believed it was desperation of finding a job and trust in other people’s feedback that made 
the SE attack successful. These traits are indications of conscientiousness and agreeableness. However, the 
participant’s personality test result does not indicate that. The third participant believed it was the fear of being 
locked out of personal account and not having access to money as well as lack of training and proper education as 
at that time that made the SE attack successful. These traits are indications of agreeableness and neuroticism. The 
participant believes in compliance and being loyal as well as fearful of losing personal money. This does not totally 
agree with the personality result. The fourth participant believed it was pressure from authority, the ease and 
comfort as well as cost savings that made the SE attack successful. These are indications of agreeableness and 
Proceedings of the 16th Australian Information Security Management Conference (2018) 85
conscientiousness. This is also contrary to the result from the participant’s personality test. The last participants 
indicated that money, curiosity and trusting positive feedback from others that led to the successful SE attack. 
These traits are indications of openness, extroversion and agreeableness which are in line with participant’s result. 
From this study and the scenarios examined, the findings indicate that personality traits can determine the 
likelihood of SE attack and users with some type of personality are more susceptible than others. While people 
with high score in agreeableness and extroversion trait are likely to be more susceptible to SE attack, the likelihood 
of a successful SE attack is not only dependent on the personality trait, it depends on the user’s circumstance and 
the attack technique of the attacker. Though some types of personality traits have the tendency to be easily 
manipulated, if the attacker does not motivate them, the chances of a successful attack is low. Also, the result 
indicated that people that are more trusting will likely be more susceptible because once your trust level increases, 
your guard falls. Overall, it is believed that SE attack is usually a targeted attack, and people who score high in 
agreeableness and extroversion are likely to fall victims more than other personality traits.

In answer to Proposition 1: One of the participants suggested that lack of training and education is the main factor 
enhancing user’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks. It was believed that if users understand the traits to 
look out for irrespective of the technique used, the likelihood of susceptibility to SE attack will be reduced. Two 
of the participants believed it’s the user’s motivating factor that matters irrespective of technique that is been used 
if the user is not motivated the trick will not work on them. Two other participants supported that it’s a synergy of 
the user’s motivating factor, attacker’s technique and chance. All the participants believed that personality is one 
of the reasons why people fall victim of social engineering attack. Considering social engineering attack is a 
targeted attack which means the social engineers knows the class of people they want which are likely to fall 
victim. This brings in personality profile. Drawing from the data analysis, it was stated that the factors which 
serves as the motivation can vary from time to time depending on the user’s situation, however, the user’s 
personality is expected to be relatively constant. As this study is focused on examining the personality trait that is 
more susceptible to SE attack the personality test followed the interviews. After the participants each explained 
the scenarios where they’ve been a victim of a social engineering attack and why they think things made them 
susceptible. Then they were asked to take the big five personality test.

In answer to Proposition 2: while the incident rate of social engineering attacks continues to increase, the need to 
understand what makes people vulnerable to this attack is imperative. Social engineers build their attack scenarios 
based on personality profiles. Several attempts have been made to prevent these attacks with the use of technical 
solutions and raising awareness through warnings about social engineering attacks. However, these methods have 
generally been proven to be ineffective (Junger et al., 2017, p. 75). This purpose of this study was therefore to 
examine what personality trait makes users more susceptible to SE attack. These data were gathered from 
experiences of participants who understand how social engineering works and have once been a victim of a SE 
attack. Several user’s motivating factors were identified and the personality traits with the likelihood of increased 
susceptibility determined. The result is intended to contribute to the body of knowledge by informing individuals 
and organizations the kind of personality trait that are more prone to SE attacks, this in turn provides a basis for 
identifying possible SE techniques and initiating effective solutions through the decision making of user’s who are 
more susceptible to social engineering attack. 
CONCLUSION 
The field of social engineering clearly needs further research especially in identifying the user’s susceptibility and 
to aid effective countermeasures. As the social engineering techniques become more sophisticated and the incident 
rate increases, it is important to provide effective measures. One of the potential measures is in examining a user’s 
susceptibility. When the users are aware of their SE vulnerability, organizations will be able to measure their risk 
to social engineering and employ effective measures to counter these attacks according to the distinct identified 
user’s weakness. Several studies have focused on testing the rate of the user’s susceptibility through phishing 
techniques. However, most of these studies have not focused on what attributes makes the user act the way they 
act. While there is literature focusing on the relationship between the user’s personality traits and their 
susceptibility rate to SE attack, there is a discrepancy in existing literature on what individual personality traits 
make users susceptible to attack. The results reported in this paper suggest that users with high scores in 
agreeableness and extroversion traits are likely to be more susceptible to social engineering attack than others. We 
also identified moderating variables that included emotional state, the environment and motivations. These results 
are a useful start for further research into the impact of different social engineering attacks on different personality 
types. This has been an exploratory pilot study that has located the variables and focus for a quantitative 
exploration of the issue.

Assessing generational differences in susceptibility to Social Engineering 
attacks. A comparison between Millennial and Baby Boomer 
generations. 
Abstract: 
In the age of digital society Social Engineering attacks are very successful and 
unfortunately users still cannot protect themselves against these threats. Social 
Engineering is a very complex problem, which makes it difficult to differentiate among 
vulnerable users. These attacks not only target young users or employees, they select 
massively, regardless of the users' age. Due to the rapid growth of technology and its 
misuse, everyone is affected by these attacks, everyone is vulnerable to them (Purkait, 
2012; Aggarwal et al., 2012). Users are considered the ""weakest link"" of security 
(Mohebzada et al., 2012; Mitnick and Simon, 2011) and as such, protecting confidential 
information should be the ultimate goal of all people. However, despite the fact that a 
number of different strategies exists to educate or train endusers to avoid these attacks, 
they still do, phishing still succeeds (Dhamija et al., 2006). This is mainly because the 
existing security awareness trainings, theoretical courses, or frameworks are expected to 
be equally effective for all users regardless of their age, but experience has shown that this 
is not true (Alseadoon, 2014). In order for these security trainings to be effective, it is 
essential that they are composed based on the Social Engineering security weaknesses 
attributed differently to different generations. Identifying unique characteristics 
(demographic and personality) of generations, determinants of their vulnerability is what 
this work aims to do. Then frameworks crafted based on that information (addressing 
these weaknesses) would be of use and worth implementing. Therefore, taking into 
consideration the complexity of this problem, this study suggests that there is a need to 
research it from a broader perspective, adding the ""generation"" element into the study 
focus to find out if there is indeed any difference in susceptibility among generational 
cohorts. In order to do so, this research will adapt both qualitative and quantitative 
methods towards reaching its objectives. Collected-data of users' performance in a 
phishing assessment are analyzed and psychological translation of results is provided. 
Thus, the first research question seeks to address what factors determinate endusers 
vulnerability to Social Engineering, and results from quantitative data (statistical analysis) 
show that generation is an important element to differentiate potential victims of Social 
Engineering, whilst computer-efficacy or educational level do not play any noteworthy 
role in predicting endusers' likelihood of falling for these threats. In consistency with the 
above elements and previous studies, also gender is shown no potentiality in predicting 
susceptibility (Parsons et al., 2013). The second research question deems to explain what 
makes generations differ in susceptibility and this study's findings propose that generation 
Y personality traits such as consciousness, extraversion and agreeableness are key 
influencers of their shown vulnerability. Finally, along with establishing strong 
foundations for future research in studying generations susceptibility to Social 
Engineering, this thesis employ these findings in proposing a framework aiming to lessen 
millennial likelihood to Social Engineering victimization. The originality of this study lies 
on its overall approach: starting with an exhaustive literature review towards identifying 
factors impacting generations' susceptibility level, then statistically measuring their 
vulnerability, to finish with a solution proposal crafted to suit the observed generational 
security weaknesses.

Põlvkondade erisuste hindamine sotsiaalse manipuleerimisrünnetega 
(Social Engineering attacks). Y-põlvkonna (millennial) ja beebibuumi 
ajastul sündinud põlvkonna võrdlus. 
Lühikokkuvõte: 
Digitaalse ühiskonna ajastul on sotsiaalse manipuleerimise ründed (social engineering 
attacks)väga edukad ja kahjuks kasutajad ei suuda ennast selliste rünnakute vastu kaitsta. 
Sotsiaalne manipuleerimine (social engineering) on keeruline probleem, mistõttu on väga 
raske eristada kõige kaitsetumaid kasutajaid. Sellised ründed ei ole suunatud ainult noorte 
ja töötajate vastu, vaid on laiaulatuslikud sõltumata vanusest. Tehnoloogia kiire kasvu ja 
selle ebasihipärase kasutamise tõttu on kõik selliste rünnakute poolt mõjutatud, kõik on 
haavatavad (Purkait, 2012; Aggarwal et al., 2012). Kasutajaid peetakse turvalisuse 
""nõrgimaks lüliks"" (Mohebzada et al., 2012; Mitnick and Simon, 2011), ja seega 
konfidentsiaalse info kaitsmine peaks olema kõikide inimeste eesmärk. Hoolimata sellest, 
et on olemas erinevaid lahendusi kasutajate koolitamiseks selliste rünnakute vältimiseks, 
andmepüük on jätkuvalt edukas (Dhamija et al., 2006). See on eelkõige seetõttu, et 
küberteadlikkuse koolitused, teoreetilised kursused või raamistikud eeldatakse olevat 
võrdselt efektiivsed kõikidele kasutajatele vaatamata nende vanusest, kuigi kogemus 
näitab et see ei ole tõsi (Alseadoon, 2014). Selleks, et koolitused saaksid olla efektiivsed, 
on oluline et need on koostatud lähtudes sotsiaalse manipuleerimise turvanõrkustest, mis 
on erinevatel vanusegruppidel erinevad. Käesoleva töö eesmärgiks on põlvkondade 
unikaalsete tunnuste (demograafilised ja isikulised) ja nende haavatavuste faktorite 
määratlemine. Sellealusel on loodud raamistik, mis on võimalik rakendada ja mis 
addresseerib neid nõrkusi. Arvesse võttes probleemi keerikust, käesolev uurimistöö näitab, 
et on vaja läbi viia edasisi uurimusi laiemast perspektiivist lähtuvalt lisades ""põlvkondade"" 
elemendi uurimiseesmärkidesse, et kas on erinevusi haavatuse riskide osas läbi 
põlvkondade. Käesolev uurimistöö kasutab nii kvalitatiivseid kui kvantitatiivseid 
meetodeid eesmärkide saavutamiseks. Andmekogumise rünnaku efektiivsuse hindamisel 
analüüsitakse kasutajate käitumist ning antakse sellele psühholoogiline tõlgendus. 
Esimene uurimisküsimus keskendub sotsiaalne manipulatsiooni haavatavuse faktorite 
määratlemisele ja kvantitatiivsed andmed (statistiline analüüs) näitab, et põlvkond on 
oluline element potentsiaalsete sotsiaalse manipulatsiooni ohvrite eristamisel, kusjuures 
arvutikasutusoskus ja haridustase ei määra olulist rolli hindamaks kasutajate tõenäosust 
langeda selliste rünnakute ohvriks. Eelpool toodud faktorite ja ka eelnevate uuringute 
alusel, ei ole ka sugu määrav faktor haavatuvuse ennustamisel (Parsons et al., 2013). Teine 
uurimisküsimus püüab selgitada, mis põhjustab põlvkondade haavatuvuse erinevused ning 
uuringu tulemusel näitavad, et  Y-põlvkonna isikuomadused, sh teadvus, ektravertsus, ja 
meeldivus on põhifaktorid mis mõjutavad haavatavust.  Viimasena, lisaks  tugeva aluse 
loomisel edaspidiseks põlvkondade haavatavuse uurimisel, pakub käesolev töö välja 
raamistiku, milles on eeltoodud leiud arvesse võetud ja mille eesmärk on vähendada Y-
põlvkonna haavatuse vähendamine sotsiaalse manipuleerimise rünnakutele.  Käesoleva 
magistritöö unikaalsus seisneb üldises lähenemisviisis: alates ulatusliku kirjanduse 
ülevaatega ""põlvkondade"" haavatavuse faktorite määratlemisega, statistilise analüüsiga

1 Introduction 
1.1 Motivation 
In the digital age, technology has an unavoidable presence in the lives of people, they can 
now carry all of their everyday activities online: go shopping online, work online, vote 
online, in other words, all users now have another ""residency"" online. While involved in 
such online services they often forget or pay little attention to the security threats behind 
these activities. Users do not give equal attention to security, some lack doing it and 
become “easy prey” or favorite targets for the attackers. Their lack of attention towards 
these attacks is known as vulnerability or susceptibility, which is attributed differently to 
victims. Some authors claim that the current generation (a precise definition of what a 
generation is, is given by (Borges et al., 2006)) is extremely vulnerable to these attacks, 
(Alseadoon, 2014) although other studies have found their parents (older users) possess 
higher susceptibility rates to Social Engineering attacks. Therefore, it is essential to 
specify groups more vulnerable to these attacks. 
In order to find out if there is any significant difference in the likelihood of falling victim 
to Social Engineering among generations, firstly it is necessary to identify factors which 
impact cohorts' vulnerability. Only then, it is possible to propose methods to reduce 
susceptibility of different groups to Social Engineering attacks, tailored specifically to 
their unique Social Engineering security weaknesses. 
There are many works addressing reasons why users fall for Social Engineering attacks. 
For instance, some studies list lack of technology related knowledge at the top, while some 
others argue users' education as the most important factor. Thus, to mitigate their 
susceptibility to Social Engineering attacks as undoubtedly the most successful security 
attacks nowadays, this study seeks to first identify and understand these determinant 
factors on deeper grounds and then address them to determine the most appropriate 
defense strategy. 
Social Engineering hereinafter SE, is considered to be ""the act of manipulating a person to 
accomplish goals that may or may not be in the ""target’s” best interest"" (Hadnagy, 2010, 
p.32). From identity theft to financial losses, the damages that Social Engineering attacks 
bring both on individual and organizational scale are enormous. Phishing is the most 
commonly used form of Social Engineering attacks, there are around 150 million phishing 
emails sent every day stated in a study by Get Cyber Safe (2013).  
Taking into consideration the dimensions of this problem it has been studied by previous 
works as well, where most researches focused on specific personality or demographic 
factors determining certain individual’s susceptibility to Social Engineering attacks and 
leaving the generational element fairly unaddressed. Furthermore, the literature has been 
studying users' phishing detection behavior and no attention (to the best of this thesis’ 
knowledge) has been given to generations, in terms of comparison of their vulnerability to 
Social Engineering attacks. What if there is indeed difference?   
This thesis aims to properly address this question by assessing generations' real 
performance on Social Engineering attacks (particularly in phishing assessment). 
Moreover, a detailed focus to this problem is given in the following sections. 
9 
 
1.2 Research problem 
Users exposing important credentials to attackers, is one of the biggest issues of security 
of today and many researchers believe that vigilance and education are the only ways to 
protect against Social Engineering as such (Aggarwal et al., 2012; Kumaraguru et al., 
2007; Allen, 2006), since technology has demonstrated that it cannot do a lot in regards 
(Mitnick and Simon, 2011). However, no matter how much SE education frameworks 
are composed or how many SE security trainings are implemented, this problem has 
still remained unsolved, people still fall for SE attacks, they are still considered the 
easiest potential victims of the security chain (Purkait, 2012; Long, 2013). Therefore, 
the main reason why Social Engineering attacks are more successful than other security 
attacks, is because they target directly the human element since it is easier to manipulate 
people than technology (Mitnick, 2011). Mitnick and Simon explain that “cracking the 
human firewall is often easy, requires no investment beyond the cost of a phone call, and 
involves minimal risk” (2011, p. 4). In regards, previous works have lacked to cover all 
the reasons behind users' susceptibility, factors that influence their actual behavior when 
presented with actual Social Engineering attacks. Moreover, literature has a gap in 
identifying groups more vulnerable to Social Engineering attacks and understand each 
generation's SE security weaknesses.  
This work will seek to find and propose the most adequate way to educate this 
""vulnerability link"" not to be the easiest pray of these attacks via patching their SE security 
weaknesses. 
For a proper approach towards the outlined problem, this thesis attempts to solve the 
following issues: 
• Firstly, it identifies factors impacting generational groups' victimization to SE 
attacks. 
• Then it assesses the differences in generational susceptibility via analyzing 
collected data from real-life performance on phishing assessment.  
• Translation of statistical analysis findings to personality differences across the two 
generational groups is the next carried out step. 
• Finally, it presents the most efficient SE security training program to fit the 
security requirements of specific generations.  
 
1.3 Research questions 
a. Is there any significant generational difference in susceptibility to Social 
Engineering attacks? 
This research claims to assess the response of this question by quantitatively examining 
data collected from real phishing attack assessment. Statistical analysis is used to reveal 
any potential distinction in vulnerability among generational groups, along with providing 
a clear panorama of their actual likelihood of victimization. Nowadays, many 
organizations complain of the current generation, or young people of today born between 
1982 and 2002 (Howe and Strauss, 2009), claiming that they are extremely vulnerable to 
SE threats (due to their distinct personality traits and heedless behavior) and that could put 
every organization into great security risks making organizations more and more unwilling 
to hire them. Is there indeed such a contrast in SE vulnerability among them or is it all 
overhyped? 
b. What factors impact generational groups susceptibility to SE?  
10 
 
Demographic factors are proven to indicate users tendency to respond to Social 
Engineering risks with many researchers suggesting women to be more susceptible than 
men (Janet et al., 2008) or others have found age group 18-25 more likely to become 
victims of these attacks. Besides age and gender, users scoring higher in computer-
efficacy are inclined to defend from phishing (Parrish et al., 2009). On the other side, also 
Big Five model's personality traits are claimed to be important factors to differentiate 
among groups, thus understanding their impact on generations' possibility to SE 
victimization is trivial. Literature has shown that different cohorts share unique 
characteristics and attitudes (Sessa et al., 2007; Wey Smola and Sutton, 2002), even 
talking about security. Thus, these qualities affect their actual behavior (Coomes and 
DeBard, 2004) and at the same time are key to explain users' tendency of becoming 
victims of phishing attacks (Parrish et al., 2009). This thesis will dig deeper into 
understanding each of these factors' correlation with vulnerability to SE threats, in terms 
of determining their role in predicting the more susceptible groups. For instance, would a 
phishing attack affect equally one teenager who shows an over-sharing attitude on SNS, 
and a Baby Boomer who does not share the same weakness? Does Social Engineering 
have the same success rate in groups scoring differently on agreeableness trait?  
c. How to craft the best solution to reduce cohorts vulnerability to Social Engineering 
threats?  
The final contribution of the author to complete this research as a whole, is to propose the 
most proper strategy to mitigate generational groups’ found susceptibility based on their 
specific SE security needs and requirements. After identifying the generational cohort 
most vulnerable to these risks and listing its SE unique security weaknesses, it is 
meaningful to explore the most appropriate defense meeting all the covered issues 
throughout this research. The solution is thought to be planned matching the necessary 
behavior skills to the targeted audience based on their SE needs and weaknesses. Thus, the 
thesis aims to design a solution based on the CIA triad principles via balancing both 
attackers' and targets' motivation (note that end users are not motivated to protect 
themselves from Social Engineering). The originality and the value of the solution is tied 
to its main objective: train the enduser through motivation.  
 
1.4 Significance of the study and contribution 
Considering it an essential starting point in deploying the most adequate solution to 
mitigate users vulnerability, this thesis proposes a new way to differentiate potential 
victims of Social Engineering attacks based on generational cohorts. 
This work strongly assumes that the existing frameworks fail to educate users against 
Social Engineering due to their generalized attribution or the wrong ""tailoring"" they give 
to all endusers, pretending equal effectiveness regardless of their security differences. 
Therefore, this thesis claims that via understanding and explaining how generational 
cohorts differ in perceiving Social Engineering risks (in terms of unique factors which 
make them fall for these attacks), it is easier to build up better mitigation methods or 
education frameworks to help lessen their susceptibility. 
Thus, the next contribution of the author is emphasizing the importance of crafting unique 
SE mitigation strategies for every generational cohort (and not only) attempting to patch 
specific security weaknesses each group owns. 
11 
 
Then, this thesis' effort in comparing different generational groups' actual vulnerability to 
social engineering attacks to find out if there is any noteworthy difference they share, is 
considered its main contribution.  
To achieve these goals, a great focus is given to identification of generations' factors 
influencing their likelihood to become potential victims. Hence, the first task is to identify 
and analyze different generations' specific personality attributes that play an important 
role in determining their degree of susceptibility with a systematic literature review 
performed. The second task is statistical analysis of the collected dataset from real 
phishing assessments. At the end as a full-packet, a defense strategy approaching findings 
is proposed. 
Briefly, the specific contribution is to: 
• explain the importance of measuring generational differences in vulnerability to 
Social Engineering attacks. 
• explore the best way to measure generations' actual susceptibility. 
• identify factors influencing cohort-groups' possibility to fall victims to SE attacks. 
• measure susceptibility via statistical analysis of the phishing collected-dataset. 
• explain found susceptibility difference across groups. 
• propose solutions to reduce the generational gap in vulnerability level. 
• propose future directions complying with this work's findings and implications. 
Moreover, the ability to identify groups more vulnerable to Social Engineering attacks 
should benefit the literature considerably in pursuing further research in mitigating these 
attacks and reducing the damages they bring. On the other side, this work can also be a big 
assistance to organizations as well since knowing your employees' weaknesses and 
vulnerability level is translated to risk assessment done to them. To this thesis best of 
knowledge no previous study has empirically examined the difference in susceptibility to 
Social Engineering attacks across these two specific generations.

2.2 Core Concepts   
Security awareness is one of the core terms of this work and a specific definition of it is 
essential in order to clarify possible misconceptions. Unfortunately, literature still lacks a 
precise definition of this term (Hänsch and Benenson, 2014) thus, researchers have come 
up with their own definitions implementing different approaches. Having said that, Hänsch 
and Benenson (2014) have carried out a deep systematic study in getting the definition of 
the term. They propose 3 different aspects of it to be defined: security awareness as 
perception, as protection and as behavior. Paying particular attention to all three 
categories, they emphasize the fact that users should know that danger exist and also how 
13 
 
to protect themselves against it. Similar to other papers, Shaw et al., differentiate between 
awareness programs and trainings (2009). They define security awareness as a 
combination of ""perception, comprehension and projection"" (2009, p.1). Amankwa et al., 
state that information security awareness is ""any endeavor to focus employees' attention on 
information security in order to ensure that all employees understand their roles and 
responsibilities in protecting the information that is in their possession by using print or 
electronic media"" (2014, p.3). However, there are other works that propose that security 
awareness aims to change behavior towards Social Engineering threats (Winkler and 
Manke, 2017). 
Actually, there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" security awareness (Hänsch and Benenson, 2014), 
but in this paper Social Engineering awareness is defined as a combination of knowledge 
and attitude towards Social Engineering threats. To put it simply, it is the actual 
behavior users present towards real Social Engineering attacks. 
Social Engineering is the most crucial term to be defined as the main focus of this thesis. 
It is interesting to know that even users that almost do not have any relation to technology 
at all understand that Social Engineering is a problem and as such, it should be solved. A 
simple search on Wikipedia precisely highlights it being ""psychological manipulation of 
people into performing actions or divulging confidential information"". One of the creators 
of the http://www.social-engineer.org, Hadnagy deeply explains all the consecutive phases 
of Social Engineering attacks and the idea of persuasion behinds it (2010). Furthermore, 
Allsopp states that Social Engineering is ""obtaining of confidential or privileged 
information by manipulating legitimate sources"" (2010, p.51). Regarding the way how 
Social Engineering attacks are carried out, the traditional template is described in detail by 
Snyder (2015), explaining all phases from information gathering to persuasion. 
There is an enormous number of definitions for Social Engineering, but the one to best fit 
this paper's perspective is ""the act of manipulating a person to accomplish goals that 
may or may not be in the ""target's"" best interest"" (Hadnagy, 2010, p.32). 
In light of this thesis' aim, phishing is the next term that should be aptly defined. Actually, 
there are many disagreements among authors while categorizing phishing, as many of 
them do not consider it a form of Social Engineering attack (Snyder, 2015). However, 
definitions given to this term are very similar, even by quoting Wikipedia: ""phishing is the 
attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card 
details (and, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by disguising as a trustworthy 
entity in electronic communication""(Wikipedia, 2017) one can get the idea behind it. In 
the context of this thesis it is described as: a method used by cybercriminals to steal 
mostly login-credentials or other relevant information by camouflaging emails to 
look legal for mainly financial fraud or identity theft (Alghamdi, 2017). Phishing 
attacks mostly deploy tricking techniques (sophisticating day by day) and different 
mediums (mainly emails or social networking sites) to make users give up personal 
information. Phishing attacks are not solely damaging end users by making them phish out 
log-in information or install malware on their computers (Hong, 2012), but can also ruin 
an organizations' reputation together with tremendous monetary losses. As far as users 
lack the proper security behavior in regards, phishing will continue being a step ahead of 
the current attempts to protect endusers against it.  
Susceptibility to Social Engineering attacks is the likelihood that a person will respond 
to and become victim of a real Social Engineering attack. Others have also proposed 
similar definitions, defining it as ""the inability of users to suspect a phishing email"" 
(Alseadoon, 2014, p.67). A different aspect is defined by Parrish et al., though, in context 
14 
 
of phishing it is the time to respond to such attack or the time calculated that a person will 
interact with the attacker (the hook) (2009). It is the state of being inclined to respond to 
a SE attack. 
Millennials are actually called people of the current generation or the first generation of 
the new millennium. Born and raised in the times of digital technology and social media, 
they are the first ""always connected"" generation (Palfrey and Gasser, 2011; Prensy, 2001). 
Many different categorizations exist regarding this generation's starting period, but in this 
study's scope it is from or after 1982 to the early 2000s (Howe and Strauss, 2009). 
Actually, there are also different points of view regarding this generation's endpoint, as 
there are researches that argue that millennials are still being born (Donnison, 2007). 
However, it is noticed that most of the studies use the span of 18-25 years to categorize 
them. Literature has called them by different nicknames: the Net Generation (Braber, 
2016; Becker, 2015), digital natives (Stringfellow Otey, 2013; Palfrey and Gasser, 2011), 
Generation Y (Hurst and Good, 2009), Nexters (Ng et al., 2010) or Nexus Generation. All 
these labels are coined due to them being highly technology or internet-competent and the 
fact that they have a strong multitasking and BOYD attitude in their workplace. It is 
claimed they trust the virtual world like no previous generation, and moreover lack 
attention of their working organization's cyber security policies. It is also argued that users 
of age 18-25 are more susceptible to phishing attacks than older age-groups (Pattinson et 
al., 2012; Sheng et al., 2010). On the other hand, many researchers claim that this 
generation's members are more aware of phishing attacks due to being computer-savvy 
users. A detailed overview of the Millennial generation's unique qualities related to SE 
security awareness compared to the particular traits of the previous generation is presented 
in the following chapter. 
On the other side are the Baby Bommers, the other studied subject of this thesis. People 
of this generation are born between 1946-1964 (Kumar and Lim, 2008). According to 
Borges et al., they have higher self-reliance than millennials (2006). Current literature has 
called them immigrants of the digital world (Jiang et al., 2016). In comparison to digital 
natives (current generation members) who have grown up with computers and the Internet, 
they ""learned how to use email and social engineering late in life"" (Palfrey and Gasser, 
2011, p.4). Millennial, Baby Boomer, digital natives and digital immigrants or other alike 
terms are used interchangeably throughout this study.  
 
2.3 Studied Subjects 
As stated in the introduction as well, this study extends its concentration on two particular 
generational groups: Millennials and Baby Boomers. Actually, selecting solely these two 
generations to focus on, is not purposeless. The main motivation behind this choice, is due 
to the conflicting notions: digital natives v. digital immigrants. Comparing one cohort that 
has grown up with the internet being always there with a cohort group which learned to 
use the internet later on life (Palfrey and Gasser, 2011) and understanding this difference 
in respect to falling for Social Engineering attacks is trivial.   
Secondly, this thesis is focused only on these two specific groups as they cover most of the 
today's workforce. Moreover, in the nearest future the boomers will retire and millennials 
will take over the workforce by making up the biggest percentage in the workforce (80% 
by end of 2020). Thus, it is a must to find out their susceptibility in comparison to the 
previous generations in the workforce, then organizations will know what to expect and 
15 
 
what to consider while crafting security policies. Here it is also safe to mention the 
organizations' recent unwillingness to hire employees of Generation Y due to the claims 
that they are much more likely to fall for these attacks. To aid the understanding of 
organizations' reluctance, it is crucial to seek out the real truth, their degree of 
vulnerability to falling for Social Engineering attacks.  
Then, having experienced different historical events, they do not differ only on age, but 
also on personality which has relevant ramifications on their Social Engineering attitude 
and behavior. For instance, their SE security perception: the millennial generation consider 
themselves more protective to these threats compared to boomers and vice versa. It is 
relevant to study their perceptions towards these attacks in general and to identify their 
actual degree of susceptibility. Furthermore, sharing a strong relationship among them 
(parent-child) and having lived in two different societies (millennials are the internet kids), 
it is interesting to find out their SE security weaknesses.  
On the other side, there exist many inconsistencies in generations starting dates (Solnet et 
al., 2012) (many researchers conflict on categorizing cohorts years span). Risking to lead 
to a possible generational overlap because of this reason, this study left out of its focus the 
generation in between the Baby Boomer and the Millennial generations (Generation X). 
As such, this research assumes a more precise differentiation among the targeted cohorts 
in regards to their vulnerability to Social Engineering.  
Finally, the previous literature has claimed that specifically these two cohorts differ the 
most in terms of security awareness, it is time to solve this dilemma, do they indeed? 
 
2.4 Summary 
This chapter has identified and explained the main concepts of this work, defining them in 
the context of the studied problem. It discusses the central subjects of this thesis: the 
Boomers and Millennials and specifies the reasons why does it matter to direct the 
research on these particular generations. Furthermore, the list of abbreviations used 
throughout the thesis is provided here.

identify the relevant papers conducted on this topic, to help explain the academic context 
pursued towards writing this thesis. The way it approaches the previous research is via a 
systematic and exhaustive literature review, considering the research questions to be 
answered (Armitage and Keeble-Allen, 2008). Hence, many online libraries and other 
repositories are used as sources to gather previous related works. In order to find studies 
pertinent to this thesis focus, a combination of keywords such as : social engineering, 
phishing, vulnerability, susceptibility, millennial and generational cohort is used for the 
searching phase. Papers are then gathered for a brief abstract reading, to select the ones 
noteworthy for this thesis. As a matter of fact, this chapter identifies and digests factors 
proposed by current literature determining users' degree of vulnerability to analyze them 
later in the next chapter. It seeks to find out to which group the literature has coined the 
term ""easy prey of SE attacks"", to digital natives or to their parents? Apart from that, it 
seeks to understand reasons why standard trainings or awareness increasing materials have 
limited effect in reducing users' vulnerability.   
 
3.1 Identifying factors impacting users' vulnerability 
To defend from Social Engineering attacks organizations assign a considerable budget to 
protective measures such as technology or employees security trainings. However, due to 
different reasons they fail to properly protect their assets from these types of attacks. Thus, 
many researchers have addressed the problem of Social Engineering as an area of 
particular concern in terms of finding out what makes its attacks so successful. 
One of the most explicit approaches to this question is taken by Dhamija et al., trying to 
understand why phishing works (2006). The answer to this question seems easy though: 
security is not the main concern of people (Purkait, 2012). Most of the researchers 
somehow ring the alarms, stressing that ""Users are not motivated to learn about security; 
for most users, security is a secondary task"" (Kumaraguru et al., 2010, p.1). Although, this 
is not that superficial since there are many other reasons behind this heedlessness, 
weaknesses that social engineers wisely exploit. What particular factors predict users' 
vulnerability to SE attacks?  
Lack of knowledge related to Social Engineering in particular or technology in general is 
said to be one key factor influencing users' susceptibility. Literature uses the term 
computer self-efficacy (CSE) meaning in other words, the users' capability to successfully 
use computers (Compeau and Higgins, 1995). Dhamija et al., in their work explain that 
people lack the adequate knowledge to understand how operating systems, email or the 
entire web works and, phishing criminals exploit this weakness to get what they need. 
Furthermore, many endusers ignore security warnings because they find them technically 
difficult to understand (2006; Wu et al., 2006), and they risk more falling for phishing 
attacks. Along these lines, Downs et al., suggest a more detailed understanding of the web 
as such, could reduce vulnerability (2007). Therefore, technology sophistication decreases 
individuals' phishing susceptibility (Wright and Marett, 2010) since users' showing high 
computer knowledge tend to doubt more the authenticity of everything online (Wright et 
al., 2010).  
17 
 
However, deficiency in knowledge regarding technology is not the only factor influencing 
users' likelihood to become potential victims of SE attacks, their lack of awareness is 
another vital element (Aburrous et al., 2010; Wright and Marett, 2010). With Social 
Engineering attacks evolving day-by-day, users should be aware how to protect against 
and not simply know that they exist. The wrong decisions people usually make when faced 
with real phishing attacks are mainly due to their lack of awareness, demonstrating once 
more the great necessity of efficient phishing awareness trainings to deploy (Aburrous et 
al., 2010). Although, a contrary approach is assessed by Halevi et al., who disagree to 
translate users' susceptibility to lack of awareness (2015) since experience have shown that 
regardless possessing phishing awareness, many users yet fall for phishing attacks in great 
terms (Alseadoon, 2014). 
""Big Five"" personality model, made up of traits such as openness, conscientiousness, 
extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (Gosling et al., 2003) are found to be notable 
predictors of human behavior (Jagatic et al., 2007), and potential determinants of 
individuals' vulnerability to Social Engineering attacks (Uebelacker and Quiel, 2014; 
Halevi et al., 2013). Addressing the relation of personality and phishing email response, 
many studies have proposed neuroticism the trait mostly associated with responding to 
phishing emails (Halevi et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2016). Furthermore, Cho et al., on their 
study developed a mathematical model aimed to predict what personality elements are 
indicators of social engineering vulnerability and found that agreeableness and 
neuroticism have remarkable effects on decision performance (2016). However, in another 
work Halevi et al., via real-life spear-phishing attacks conducted in their study targeted 
conscientiousness the most relevant trait to determine phishing susceptibility (2015). On 
the other side, Parrish et al., suggest that extraversion in context of phishing could lead to 
increased vulnerability (2009). Supporting the same findings, Workman explains that 
extraversion is considerably related to high effective commitment, making users divulge 
personal information as they want to fit to some particular group (2008). Moreover, 
people's ability to detect deception is directly influenced by their emotions (Forgas et al., 
2008) and characterized by positive emotions, extraverted people may easily fall for 
phishing while processing emails (Alseadoon et al., 2012). Parrish et al., in their work 
were focused mainly on trust as one of the main aspect of agreeableness and found it to be 
the strongest personality characteristic influencing peoples' susceptibility (2009; Modic 
and Lea, 2012). While users' phish out sensitive information, trust is highly involved 
(Weirich and Sasse, 2001).  
It is known that Social Engineering attacks become even more successful when criminals 
are armed with enough information about targets beforehand, and social networks are the 
perfect repositories to provide such information. SNSs are recently converted into 
dangerous weapons in the hands of social engineers who may take criminal actions 
towards damaging endusers. In the same line with these studies Vishwanath et al., in their 
work implemented a research model to explain factors that best predict an individual's 
possibility to get phished, and apart from technological efficacy and email load, suggest 
also media habits as a major contributor to Social Engineering susceptibility (2011). With 
internet being no longer limited to anyone, people often just want to explore the online 
world but unfortunately happen to expose themselves to phishing (Furnell, 2010), mainly 
due to the over-sharing attitude on social media. Defining self-disclosure as personal-
relevant information exchanged online in this paper's context, it is said to be a very 
dangerous asset in help of so-called social phishing attacks (Jagatic et al., 2007). As a 
matter of fact, Halevi et al., did the first work on studying the relationship among 
18 
 
personality, Facebook and phishing and found that people who tend to post more on 
Facebook are more vulnerable to privacy attacks (2013). 
 
At the end, Mitnick and Simon quote: “as improvements are made in the technological 
weapons against security breaches, the social engineering approach… will certainly 
become significantly more frequent and attractive to information thieves” (2011, p. 259). 
It has passed a long time since then but unfortunately this statement is more accurate than 
never, Social Engineering attacks continue making the latest news and feasibly increase in 
the nearest future. This all means that there is still an enormous and rapid work that should 
be done in order to further study these and other factors influencing users' likelihood to 
become prey of Social Engineering attacks. In order to hopefully ""patch"" them in the 
nearest future it should further the investigations aiming to understand the human aspect of 
these semantic attacks. At the end of the day, this is not a problem with no solution, it is 
just a very complex issue. As Schneier quotes: ""to target the people problem, not the math 
problem"" (2000), these elements should be addressed and studied in deeper grounds and 
dimensions. 
 
3.2 Millennials vs. Baby Boomers,  who are more vulnerable? 
Many researchers (Kumaraguru et al., 2009; Sheng et al., 2010; Workman, 2008; Dhamija 
et al., 2006; Alseadoon, 2014) agree that demographics explicitly impacts users' 
perceptions and decisions when dealing with phishing emails. Specifying solely ""age"" 
asset of demographics, they claim that it can anticipate users' likelihood to become 
potential victims. There are other works though, that found that user's demographic in 
general and age in particular, cannot predict users' vulnerability to phishing attacks 
(Mohebzada et al., 2012; Long, 2013). Considering these contradictions, it is safe to 
clarify that different works carry out different approaches to the division of age periods 
when categorizing groups and thus, may obtain distinct findings (Alseadoon, 2014).  
Emphasizing the lack of research studying demographics in context of phishing 
susceptibility Sheng et al., argue that via knowing groups more susceptible to phishing, it 
is easier to concentrate into anti-phishing education (2010). This work is the nearest to this 
thesis's focus, not only in terms of analyzing groups more vulnerable to phishing attacks, 
but also in studying the psychology behind their great potential to fall for such threats. 
Moreover, they found that targets of age 18-25 fell mostly for the attack (Sheng et al., 
2010).  
Being born on the glorious times of Web 2.0, the members of net generation are used to 
the tremendous amount of information online, as a result they can handle and process it 
better than any other generation (Parment, 2013). Moreover, it is undoubting that people 
of current generation are great multi-taskers and tech-savvy and also, it is suggested that 
these qualities can decrease the possibility of getting phished or social engineered. 
However, even-though the millennial group possess these unique characteristics in high 
rates, they still fall for phishing, mainly because they overestimate themselves to be able 
to evaluate certain cues in phishing emails (Stebila, 2010). This implies that they consider 
themselves enough computer-efficient to defend against these threats but actually, they are 
equally likely to get phished as others less technically sophisticated. Alseadoon also, in his 
PhD dissertation found that young people aged 18-25 are more vulnerable to these attacks 
as they tend to be more risk-takers (2014). To support the same findings, other authors 
explain that young people of today yet lack the sufficient security awareness to protect 
19 
 
themselves from internet vulnerabilities (Boyd, 2007; Livingstone et al., 2005). The 
National Study of Youth and Religion, stated that almost 60% of millennials believe in 
their own greatness to be able to distinguish what is right or wrong in terms of security 
(Stein, 2013), overestimating the ability to protect themselves online compared to older 
users (Miltgen and Peyrat-Guillard, 2014; Jiang et al., 2016). This generation's members 
have narcissistic perceptions (Bergman et al., 2010) and entitlement attitude (Ng et al., 
2010; Bauer, 2009) due to the excessive praise gained by their parents, the Boomers. Other 
noteworthy studies attain their focus on agreeableness and stated that more agreeable 
individuals are at a higher rate of security risk and generally, younger people and women 
present higher values of agreeableness (Darwish et al., 2012). 
On the other hand, contrasting the above findings there are studies that have found that 
older adults lack awareness and knowledge concerning security more compared to 
younger users (Jiang et al., 2016). Therefore, in their work Jiang et al., analyze differences 
in SE behavior among 3 generations: the Silent Generation, older Baby Boomers and 
Millennials. Hence, an interesting fact noticed on their findings is the SE security 
perceptions the groups have for each-other, such that older adults defined Millennials 
reckless and more vulnerable to online threats, while Millennials claimed to attribute this 
weakness to older adults, considering themselves knowledgeable enough not to fall for 
these threats (Jiang et al., 2016). In context of media over-sharing habits previous studies 
have showed previous generations' members less likely to post personal information on 
Facebook compared to digital natives (Christofides et al., 2012) decreasing their scale of 
vulnerability.  
Actually, there exist different approaches taken by researchers to find out user age-groups 
more likely to become potential victims of Social Engineering attacks and as a result, 
different findings are presented. Although, the findings are not proportional due to distinct 
directions purchased and differences in groups' age division. Accordingly, this explains the 
fact that there is no previous work (to the best of this thesis knowledge) that focuses on 
studying generational-groups differences in likelihood to fall for SE attacks.   
 
3.3 Methods implemented to measure users' vulnerability 
Proportional with users' increase in vulnerability to Social Engineering attacks, have been 
the proposed attempts to lessen it. Experience has shown that it cannot be reduced what is 
not calculated, as such the approach should start from measuring end-users' vulnerability 
to later be able to try to mitigate it. There are different methodologies proposed to measure 
users' susceptibility to phishing or Social Engineering attacks in general, researchers have 
suggested many possible ways starting from the real attack scenario assessments to 
cognitive processing tests. Therefore, Kumaraguru et al. proposed the Cognitive 
Reflection Test(CRT), as an efficient way to measure users' vulnerability to phishing. 
They found that people who scored high on the CRT were more likely to fall for phishing 
emails (2007; Jensen,1998).  
On the other side, Kevin Mitnick suggests security assessment as the best way to test 
employees' susceptibility to Social Engineering attacks (Mitnick and Simon, 2009). 
Sharing the same proposal, Jakobsson et al., argue that real-life attack assessments not 
only explain potential extend of victimization but at the same time identify the kind of 
attacks working the most among end users (2008). Shifting the attention to organizations, 
Nohlberg also stresses that the best way to measure employees' security awareness is 
testing them when they do now know they are being tested (2005). However, researchers 
20 
 
emphasize the fact that those assessments should be ethically and legally complying with 
security policies (Jakobsson and Ratkiewicz, 2006). Moreover, SANS Institute also 
proposes security awareness survey as the adequate method to measure employees' 
awareness within an organization (also the best way to identify gaps in regards to security 
awareness) (SANS Institute, 2017). 
Each of these methods have drawbacks, some arise in more accurate results and some lack 
it, some involve ethical issues or risks of data disclosure. For instance, it is claimed that 
some methods produce less reliable data and others, can easily put subjects at risk through 
exposure of sensitive data (Hale et al., 2015). Aiming to reduce endusers vulnerability, 
many researchers propose education and training to prevent people from falling for this 
attacks (Jakobsson and Myers, 2006; Downl et al., 2006). Taking into consideration the 
failure on teaching the individual not to fall for Social Engineering attacks, is seems like 
""security user education is a myth"" (Gorgling, 2006). 
 
3.4 Gaps in literature 
As the problem of social engineering is escalating and techniques deployed by attackers 
sophisticating, it is vital to investigate further this issue of great concern in deeper 
grounds, to possibly find out why educational programs and standard awareness trainings 
have not lessen endusers fallings for phishing (even-though they have been trained) 
(Karakasiliotis et al., 2006; Kumaraguru et al., 2009). In order to compose frameworks or 
tools aiming to reduce phishing susceptibility one must firstly understand how and why 
people fall for them (Downs et al., 2007). To do this, the literature yet lacks to further 
consider potential roles of individual attributes into predicting their vulnerability.  
Secondly, there should be a fair balance in studying victims' SE detection and response 
behavior, in terms of difference in their susceptibility determination. Apart from that, 
almost all the existing work is focused on the individual to understand why he falls for 
these attacks, and little attention is given to other elements of study for instance, 
generational cohorts. In regards this work will purpose a new direction to pursue, claiming 
a meaningful correlation among generations and vulnerability to Social Engineering.  
Should it ever be considered that in lieu of composing more and more standard solutions 
that lack to fully achieve their goals, to address potential victims differently, perhaps into 
particular generational-groups. What if trying to tailor mitigation strategies to different 
audiences (generational groups) respectively in line of their needs and weaknesses in 
terms of vulnerability to SE attacks? Would this change anything? 
 
3.5 Summary 
This chapter has analyzed previous approaches taken to identify the main factors 
explaining users' likelihood of falling for Social Engineering attacks and at the same time 
have examined the proposed methods deemed to measure users' scale of vulnerability. All 
this done in purpose to possibly understand the extent of the gap in the literature and what 
is lacking in terms of directions to pursue in the future to properly address these issues. To 
finally find out who are more susceptible and what qualities makes them behave that way, 
to later be able to close this gap.

4 Conceptual Framework 
This chapter presents the theoretical framework of the thesis and gives further insight to 
the importance of the research problem studied in this paper. Hereby, it explains the 
research methodology of data collection. The main research question and the reflective 
hypothesis are synthesized here. The factors identified by the previous studies are 
categorized and will be analyzed and digested to justify findings.  
 
4.1 Research question and hypothesis 
➢ RQ : Are generational cohorts equally vulnerable to Social Engineering attacks? 
 
In order to deepen the focus on millennial generation, in this chapter the research question 
is slightly modulated to be: Is there any significant difference in susceptibility to Social 
Engineering attacks among the current generation and their parents' generation? To assess 
the response of this question, a holistic approach is taken combining an exhaustive 
literature review with analysis of quantitative data obtained from real-life phishing 
experiment conducted. 
 
➢ H1: There is a notable difference in susceptibility to Social Engineering attacks 
among generation Y and Baby Boomers. 
 
This study hypothesizes that indeed there is distinction in susceptibility among 
generational cohorts, specifically millennials may be more vulnerable and possess a 
greater likelihood of becoming potential victims of SE. To shed light to this problem of 
particular concern, this study will combine generations security weakness indicators  
supported by analysis of their real performance in phishing assessment. To reveal insights 
into how differently generations get Social Engineered, throughout this study generations 
are studied as groups rather than individuals, assuming them representatives of each whole 
generation (Fisher, 2015). 
 
4.2 Obtained dataset justification 
When trying to carry out a Social Engineering attack experiment or a phishing assessment 
in particular, there are a lot of constraints involved, be them ethical, legal, security or 
privacy related. Keeping in mind these considerations discussed below and the opportunity 
to get a proper dataset of sufficient quality for this study's research questions, the author 
does not conduct its own experiment and in lieu of, decides to use dataset from previously 
conducted phishing assessment.  
4.2.1 Ethical Considerations 
Even-though phishing experiments are considered one of the best ways to measure users' 
and employees' vulnerability to Social Engineering threats, there are also cases in which 
organizations avoid conducting them. Major contributors to this reluctance are ethical 
issues evolved. Social Engineering is strongly correlated with ethical considerations due to 
manipulation and deception techniques used. Moreover, these concerns are more present 
when running real-life phishing assessments since they have direct impact on participants. 
22 
 
Thus, they can damage them financially but most frightening is the psychological cost 
they leave to victims (Alseadoon, 2014; Aburrus et al., 2010). Experience has shown that 
most of the participants react really harsh to the assessment since they feel violated, 
mainly when they are not previously notified about the attack (Kumaraguru et al., 2009). 
""Some of the employees called the experiment unethical, inappropriate, illegal and 
unprofessional""(Aburrus et al., 2010, pg.251). The cases requiring researchers to be 
prosecuted are numerous, for instance in cases when participants' personal information 
from social-media is used.  
Having a good dataset on hand (with respect to this thesis research questions), this work 
does not consider it necessary repeating the same study. However, before obtaining the 
dataset this study ensured that the sample group was not asked to provide any secret 
account information and also ensured to destroy the raw data at the end of this study. 
Anyway, to further the understanding of  how to conduct ethical SE assessments, it is 
important to read the Jakobsson and Finn (2007) work, emphasizing three ethical 
principles to take into account: the respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, in terms 
of rights and the well-being of users (Jakobsson and Finn, 2007). 
 
4.2.2 Legal Considerations 
Apart from ethical constraints, while conducting an experiment researchers often have to 
assess legal considerations as well. There have been cases unintentionally resulted  in law 
infringements and consequently, many researchers were being sued or prosecuted. Hence, 
everyone should be especially careful with risks of data breaches, data leakages or identity 
thefts. Unintentional leads to sensitive personal data harvesting or confidential information 
disclosure can occur, be this on individual or organizational scale. Data protection laws 
and regulations, protecting actors' privacy or security rights on internet should be strongly 
taken into account. On the other hand, companies' Terms and Conditions should be strictly 
respected and followed in cases where organizations are subjects of the experiment. 
Taking into account all these risks and having the opportunity to rely on others' data, this 
study avoids carrying out such risky experiments. 
 
4.2.3 Getting Approvals 
Besides ethical and legal considerations, getting the needed approvals on time is another 
serious element many authors have to ensure before conducting such studies. Hereby, one 
needs to get the appropriate approvals from the entities evolved in the assessment before 
setting-up such assessment. For instance, in this case it was aimed to conduct the 
experiment in a big organization and in a high school thus, getting the needed approvals 
would had not been an easy task, taking into account the fact that young teenagers and 
Baby Boomer employees would have been the experiments' feasible targets. On one side 
stand companies, which work for years to ensure employees' trust and on the other side 
stand the school's representatives or teenagers' parents who would not have been easily 
convinced to expose students to risks of this nature. Adding here the fact that getting the 
right approvals takes a lot of time, this study considered it be the case.  
 
23 
 
4.2.4 Significant sampling 
Along these lines, the most important factor that should be taken into account while 
planning to conduct an experiment is the sampling. Getting a considerable sample to carry 
out the phishing attack is often difficult due to many limitations, and this leads to fail 
attaining statistically meaningful sample size and results as well. In this case, obtaining a 
truly representative sample of target users was difficult, nearly impossible. Apart from 
that, ensuring a homogeneous representative of the studied generations from the available 
dataset, is the main reason why this study does not involve conducting any form of Social 
Engineering attack assessment. 
 
4.3 Methodology used 
In this research a combination of data-collection techniques is used, a mix of quantitative 
and qualitative methods. Taking into account this research problem of particular concern, 
the methodology chosen aims to solve out the research questions (Gable, 1994). By 
combining these two complimenting methods, it is studied the interactive relationship 
between groups' security weaknesses and their actual susceptibility, to provide detailed 
insights into how and why generations get Social Engineered.  
 
4.3.1 Qualitative method 
In the first phase, the literature review is conducted to identify factors impacting users' 
possibility to fall for SE attacks, making up the qualitative data used in this study. The 
theoretical model carried out aims to investigate and digest the level of influence these 
factors have on groups' susceptibility. Their impact is tested and evaluated combining 
related works' findings with phishing email experiment's results. This work was reluctant 
in choosing other methods for the data collection (survey or questionnaire) due to high 
chances of outcomes overestimation, since users still limit the understanding of phishing 
(Jakobsson and Finn, 2007). As such, this research methodology assumes that each factor 
extracted from the literature review plays an important role in explaining users' 
vulnerability to Social Engineering attacks. The approach assessed does not assign every 
factor to a single generation, in a one-to-one relationship (Fisher, 2015) rather distributes 
them on each generation, based on their degree of appliance and level of presence. The 
generation showing higher occurrence of elements strongly related to victimization, is 
determined the most likely to fall for Social Engineering attacks, and hence, the most 
vulnerable. The detailed analysis is carried out in the next chapter. This thesis validates 
findings and assumptions analyzing the obtained dataset. 
 
4.3.2 Quantitative method 
Quantitative methodology is proven to be able to support findings, that is the main reason 
this study preferred to integrate it in the chosen methodology. On the other side, both 
literature and experience has shown that one of the best methods to gather data related to 
participants' behavior and their potential to fall for these attacks is via real-life phishing 
assessments. In distinct from other forms of attacks, phishing experiments have the benefit 
of being able to measure real performance results. In this way, the gathered data from the 
experiment provide a panoramic view of users' deployed decisions when faced with real-
life phishing emails and hence, their degree of vulnerability.  
24 
 
The quantitative dataset taken from a phishing assessment is analyzed using appropriate 
tools, and details are given in the next chapter.  
 
4.3.3 Experimental variables 
• Dependent variables:  
o Susceptibility 
• Independent variables:  
o  Computer self-efficiency,  
o  Generation, 
o  Personality traits, 
o  Education, 
o  Gender,  
o Age 
 
The identified qualities assumed to be primary indicators of groups' degree of 
vulnerability, make up the independent variables of the thesis statistical analysis. To better 
comprehend the relationship between independent variables with the dependent one, a 
detailed statistical analysis is carried out and findings are presented in the next chapter. 
Studied by previous works as well, all these elements are thought to play a significant 
impact on determining peoples' susceptibility and this study will seek to quantitatively 
validate assumptions in the next chapter.  
 
4.4 Summary 
This chapter has presented an overview of the research methodology, what approach is 
used in the thesis and how it is implemented. The justifications of obtained dataset is 
provided and hypothesis is stated. Hence, it has also revealed techniques used towards 
collection of both qualitative and quantitative data for analysis. The ethical and legal 
considerations are presented. Therefore, the evaluation framework that lays out the 
research questions is done on the next chapter.   
 
25 
 
5 Quantitative Analysis 
This chapter describes the implementation of the conceptual framework presented in the 
previous chapter and its empirical evaluation. It also analyzes phishing assessment 
obtained dataset and report findings. Here are also outlined factors influencing phishing 
susceptibility dissimilarity among generations. The groups' found differences in the degree 
of vulnerability are explained using generations' unique characteristics synthesized from 
the literature review. 
 
5.1 Descriptive statistics 
In order to answer the main research question listed on chapter 1(Is there any significant 
generational difference in susceptibility to Social Engineering attacks?), the simulated 
phishing assessment dataset is analyzed. Despite its many constraints (mainly legal and 
ethical), phishing experiment is considered the best method to measure users' vulnerability 
since it can demonstrate users' actual likelihood of victimization (Jones, 2016). Along with 
assessing endusers' susceptibility, it can outline relevance to real world behavior users 
show when faced with any SE attacks. 
 
5.1.1 Experimental Email 
Simulated phishing experiment is used to measure users' actual susceptibility to SE 
attacks, as the most genuine way to assess their actual phishing management behavior. 
Adding particular value to this research, the collected-dataset is received from another 
researcher (Swapan Purkait). The type of phishing email sent to participants is a click 
email, aiming to direct participants to disclose sensitive information (specifically, their 
Gmail account login credentials) into a spoofed site. 
Regarding the determination when one becomes victim of phishing, according to different 
studies and authors there are many definitions of ""falling for the phish"". Thus, a precise 
explanation of its meaning, is given by Sheng et al., (2010) however, in this thesis context 
falling for phish or getting social engineered, are considered cases when participants 
clicked on the provided link and submitted their personal information.  
 
5.1.2 Experimental Subjects 
A total of 430 people participated in the assessment but in order to draw more significant 
conclusions, the population considered for this study is focused on two particular 
generational cohorts : (the Millennial and the Baby Boomer generation). Thus, for this 
study only the data pertaining to these two specific groups is analyzed, the remaining data 
is deleted. The final sample size for this research is 337 (N=337). The sample is chosen to 
represent both groups, consisting of 337 participants of different background (age, 
education, gender, occupation). The targets selected for the assignment are part of the 
same university campus in India. As a matter of fact, the participants are considerably 
representative of this thesis's studied population. Thus, participants varies in elements like: 
26 
 
o Generation: Actually, 293 participants of the assessment are millennials (86.9%) 
and the other 44(N=44) or 13.1% of the sample pertain to the Baby Boomer 
generation.  
o Age: The same age categorization of groups that is outlined on chapter 2 is used, 
practically millennials (17-35), and Baby Boomers (50-62). The mean of age for 
the millennial cohort is 27.3 years old and 54.6 years for Baby Boomers. There is a 
highest number of 25 years old participants (n=35) from millennials and a highest 
number of 51 years old participants (n=10) from Baby Boomers. 
o Gender: All the participants of the sample are Indians comprised of 229 male 
(68.0%) and 108 (32.0%) female. There are 95(32.4%) female and 198 (67.6%) 
male from the millennials. On the other hand, there are 31(70.5%) males and 
13(29.5%) females from the BB group. Data coding is used for the sake of this 
experiment data analysis. For instance, regarding participants' gender, male is 
coded 1 and female is coded 2. Data coding is also used to present other elements 
of the dataset as well, such as education and computer self-efficacy (shown below). 
The age and gender distribution of the sample are presented in the tables below. 
o Computer efficacy: 168 users (49.9%) have technical background and 
169(50.1%) have non-technical background. In this thesis technical background is 
translated as computer self-efficacy. Coding is also used here, where being 
technical competent is given a 1, and not competent a 2. 
o Education: Concerning education, codes 1-4 are used representing the level of 
education the users have, Bachelor(1), Masers(2), PhD(3) and Professional(4). Out 
of the studied sample: 151 participants have bachelor degree, 124 masters, 40 PhD 
and 22 professional education. 
 
5.1.3 Demographic distribution 
After excluding the data not pertaining to either of the focused groups ( Millennial and 
Baby Boomer), the answers of 337 responders are kept and analyzed. Details of the 
descriptive characteristics are given in the tables below.

5.2 Analysis of results 
5.2.1 Susceptibility rates 
Lord Kelvin quotes: “To measure is to know”, in the same reasoning this study aims to 
know each generation's degree of vulnerability by measuring their actual performance 
when faced with the phishing attack. Analysis of data collected from the phishing 
assignment generates the effects' of several independent variables (see section 4.3.3) on 
the single dependent variable (phishing susceptibility). Having said that, the received 
28 
 
dataset is initially entered into a Microsoft Excel file to statistically analyze it. The figure 
below presents participants' actual victimization on the phishing assessment. 
 
              
                                     Figure 1. Participants victimization rates 
 
In order to indicate falling for the phish, data coding is reused. A value of (2) is given to 
""falling"" victim of the experiment and a value of (1), to non-victim. Presented also in the 
table below solely 29 participants or (8.6%), responded to the email and gave up their 
login credentials and 308 (91.4%) of them did not. It is safe to mention that it is surprising 
the number of participants who got phished. Hence, the assessment's results show a 
considerable value of victimization from the overall targeted sample, and the generation 
who mostly fell for the attack is the millennial generation. Moreover, on generational scale 
out of 293 millennial participants', 29 responded to the email, this percentage (8.6%) is 
higher than Baby Boomers, whose number of victimization occurrence is surprisingly 0.  
  
Table 5.  Generations extend of victimization 
Group Total Victim Non-Victim 
Millennial 293 29 264 
Baby Boomer 44 0 44 
Total 337 29 308 
 
As a matter of fact, the calculated percentage of victimization of the whole sample (8.6%) 
is considered acceptable and in normal range for victims who fall for phishing incidents 
(Knight, 2004). This high victimization rates among millennials shows that they are 
comfortable divulging their login credentials via email. This hypothesize a lack of concern 
29

from their part in authenticating phishing emails or in SE security in general. However, 
possible factors impacting these results are discussed in the sections below. 
 
5.2.2 Supporting the stated hypothesis 
This thesis' aim to answer the first research question (see Chapter 1), is attained by 
quantitatively measuring the targeted cohorts' actual vulnerability on phishing 
performance. Thus, independent sample t-test is performed in order to analyze the null and 
alternative hypothesis. T-test is used to test whether there is any significant distinction 
between means of two groups (DeCoster and Claypool, 2004). The null hypothesis (see 
H0 and H1 in Chapter 4: That is no statically significant difference among the two studied 
generational cohorts) is actually rejected by the analyzed data which, supports the 
alternative hypothesis. Having set alpha α=.05, results from the unpaired sample t-test 
show a significant contrast of subjects actual performance on the phishing attack ( 
probability p< α). Independent sample t-test arise in a t-Stat (two-tail) value of 5.663 with 
292 degrees of freedom, explaining the existing difference on phishing susceptibility 
among them. To summarize, these results fit also the results of the Chi-squared test (see 
section 5.2.3), rejecting the null hypothesis (the approach of hypothesis disproving is 
attained). Further details on t-test are provided on the table below. 
 
Table 6. Unpaired samples t-Test results 
t-Stat(two-tail) t Crit(two-tail) Prob p(2-tail) α=.05 Df 
5.663 1.968 p=0.000000035 0.05 292 
    
5.2.3 Groups and falling for phish 
Another way to answer the first research question is by executing the Chi-Squared test to 
assess any difference among the two studied-generations leading to acceptance or rejection 
of the null hypothesis (Zibran, 2007). Chi-Squared test is used to measure the probability 
of association of independent groups (Maxwell, 1971). Results show a significant 
distinction on susceptibility among millennials and baby boomers, with millennials being 
more vulnerable (p=0.02). Thus, there is enough evidence (t-test and chi-squared test) to 
conclude an undeniable contrast among these two studied generational cohorts on 
performance on phishing assessment. Slightly differing on age categorization, other 
researchers (Sheng et al., 2010; Kumaraguru et al., 2009) have also found younger users of 
age 18-25 to be more vulnerable to these types of threats.  
On the other hand, both males and females are considered equally vulnerable to SE 
attacks, with not enough evidence proving the opposite (p=0.4). Moreover, no difference 
was also shown among technical efficient group and the non-technical efficient one 
(p=0.3), having set the target (p<0.05). Also, groups alternated in educational level, 
demonstrated non-statistically significant difference on susceptibility from the Chi-
squared test results (p=0.08).  
 
30 
 
5.2.4 Estimating variables impact on susceptibility 
In order to find out the main reasons users fall for Social Engineering attacks, the impact 
of several variables on susceptibility is analyzed. Thus, having susceptibility to phishing 
attack the only dependent variable of the study, linear regression is performed to test the 
impact of a number of potential predictors on this variable. Linear regression is used to 
measure the strength of each of the predictors on the one variable of interest 
(susceptibility) (Montgomery et al., 2012). Hence, regression coefficient is calculated to 
show the type of relationship among variables. For this study, the significance of a relation 
is obtained in a probability value lower than (p< 0.05) (DeCoster, 2006). Any p-value 
(indicating the strength of relationships) greater that this significance level demonstrates 
lack of evidence to prove variables' notable influence on vulnerability to SE threats.  
Therefore, linear regression is applied many times independently among pairs of the 
dependent variable with the independent ones and results are shown below.  
 
Table 7. Linear regression output 
Susceptibility predictors (p-value) 
Regression 
coefficient(Beta) 
Age p=0.29 β=-0.002 
Gender p=0.47 β =0.023 
Generation p=0.02 β =-0.098 
Education p=0.86 β =0.002 
Technology efficacy p=0.34 β =0.029 
 
As shown also from the table above, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed on 
finding out the strength of the relationship among pairs. 
Age 
Participants’ age is found to not predict their susceptibility to Social Engineering attacks 
F(1-335)=1.103, p=0.29, with a negative insignificant relationship between these two 
variables (β=-0.002). These results are consistent with results of other studies 
(Kumaraguru et al., 2007; Dhamija et al., 2006). However, there exist also studies that 
claim that age do have an important impact on users' performance on phishing attacks 
(Sheng et al., 2010; Kumaraguru et al., 2009).  
Education 
A positive non-significant correlation is also found between users' education and their fall 
for the attack F(1-335)=0.0278, p=0.86. In support to results of this study, (Dhamija et al., 
2006; Sheng et al., 2007) concluded that educational level does not play any significant 
role on users' vulnerability. 
Gender 
Linear regression results do not show any significant impact of gender on users' shown 
degree of vulnerability, F(1-335)=0.502, p=0.47 with the Chi-Squared test also showing 
31 
 
no difference among males and females in the rates they fell for the phishing assessment. 
In support to these findings, Kumaraguru et al, also found no distinction in phishing 
performance among 2 genders (2007). Other researchers however, have found females to 
be more vulnerable to such attacks (Jagatic et al., 2007; Sheng et al., 2010; Alseadoon 
2014).  
Technology-efficacy 
Furthermore, technology efficacy is spotted unimportant in predicting susceptibility F(1-
337)=0.908, p=0.34, supporting the findings of the other researchers (Vishwanath et al., 
2011). However  Dhamija et al., found lack of knowledge regarding technology in general 
to be one of the main reasons why people get phished (Dhamija et al., 2006). Sheng et al, 
found that for each unit of users' increase in knowledge concerning technology, they fall 
for 3.6% fewer phish, categorizing self-rated knowledge regarding technology a relevant 
asset in reducing users' likelihood of becoming potential victims of any type of SE attack( 
2010). 
Generation  
As it is assumed, generation is observed to explicitly predict users' susceptibility to SE, 
resulting in having the highest impact of all factors F(1-335)=4.805, p=.029. This means 
that when this item increases, the likelihood of users responding to phishing emails 
decreases (β=-0.098). This variable is proposed and studied by this thesis for the first time 
and statistical results highlight that it should be a new essential field of study for other 
researchers as well. Additionally, these results demonstrate higher chances for intruders to 
exploit millennials comfort zone in regards to Social Engineering. 
This analysis is focused understanding 5 correlations in total and surprisingly only one of 
them is classified as noteworthy and the remaining 4 are considered statistically 
unacceptable. Generational element is found to be significant at p<.05, being the only 
supported factor to have a worthy of attention correlation with vulnerability.  
 
5.2.5 Multiple regression and Multicollinearity 
Multi-collinearity tests if there exists any relationship among independent variables that 
could influence the regression analysis outcomes and hinder the overall output 
interpretation. Hence it is notable to be performed in this study to deepen the 
understanding of the findings. The multi-collinearity test is done when there are more than 
one potential predictors on the model that could have a significant relationship among 
each-other (Hair et al., 1998) and interfere the results. This study assumes that the 
relationship between age and generation makes it difficult to distinguish each of these 
variables' effect. Thus, variable inflation factors (VIF) (used to calculate the inflection of 
the independent variables' variances (Lin, 2008)) are measured and results interpretation is 
given below. 
 
 
 
 
 
32 
 
Table 8. Multicollinearity test results 
Independent variables VIF value 
Age 9.296 
Gender 1.019 
Technology 1.060 
Education 1.385 
Generation 8.336 
    
In order to understand the variable inflation factor values presented in the table below, the 
threshold 10 (VIF > 10) is set to indicate the presence of collinearity among independent 
variables (Belsley et al., 2005). Comparing the computed VIF values, it is assumed to exist 
a correlation among age and generation explanatory variables. Though, assumptions 
cannot be concluded since the VIF values are below the threshold and further investigation 
controlling for age effect is necessary. Therefore, recalculating the VIF values omitting the 
variable showing the highest VIF factor (the age factor) changes the results of the analysis 
and collinearity is avoided. Nevertheless, this approach is claimed to obscure the statistical 
model and getting a large enough sample size to cover geographic representation of the 
targets is suggested as the most proper solution to circumvent collinearity occurrence 
within the model. 
 
Table 9. Multicollinearity test 
Remained factors VIF values 
Gender 1.003255 
Technology 1.058756 
Education 1.100619 
Generation 1.158866 
 
The justification of using multiple regression apart from linear regression, is not only to 
investigate multicollinearity presence in the model, but also because linear regression 
could only measure a single predicting variable with the predicted one, being unable to test 
many-to-one relationships. Moreover, this is done in order to at the end solely the 
variables resulting in significant relationships are kept and exclude the others from the 
final model. Multiple regression is suitable for analyzing multiple independent variables 
impact on a single dependent variable. Thus, multiple regression is performed and results 
are shown in the table below. 
 
33 
 
Table 10. Multiple Regression output 
Predictors Std err p-value β coefficient Statist signific 
Age 0.004 0.008 0.012 Yes 
Gender 0.032 0.294 0.034 No 
Education 0.020 0.676 -0.008 No 
Tech-efficacy 0.031 0.734 0.010 No 
Generation 0.129 0.001 -0.422 Yes 
Significant at  **p<.005 
     
Again, in the same line with linear regression, results from multiple regression show 
generation factor to have the strongest impact on susceptibility (p-value <.005). Consisting 
in a negative relationship (β=-0.422), as generation variable increases, vulnerability level 
of users actually decreases. The coefficients (Beta values) for the rest of the independent 
variables are listed in the table above. 
An explanation of  the younger generation's shown vulnerability can be attributed to their 
lack of awareness on SE risks. Therefore, the Millennials' high tendency to respond to 
Social Engineering attacks is described and related to their personality traits, 
distinguishing them from previous generations. 
 
5.4 Summary 
This chapter has analyzed collected-dataset from phishing assessment and findings are 
presented. It has explained how outcomes of the analysis enabled answers to the research 
questions. The results from the phishing experiment have showed that young people of 
today fell victim of the assessment at higher rates than their parents and as such, are 
assumed to be more susceptible to Social Engineering threats. This section has also 
outlined factors influencing users' response to these attacks.  
 
34 
 
6 Understanding gens shown susceptibility 
This chapter explains generations found vulnerability to SE, reasons that interpret their 
shown high degree of susceptibility and the psychology behind it. Having said that, this 
section aims to answer the third research question of this study and at the same time to 
psychologically explain the quantitative findings from the phishing assignment dataset 
analysis. In light to this aim, certain personality traits are highlighted as having major 
contribution to generations' likelihood of victimization. At the end of the chapter, a 
defense strategy to combat Social Engineering threats is proposed. 
 
6.1 Potential victims psychological profile 
In order to explain cohort groups shown susceptibility to phishing experiment this study 
seeks to understand how are personality traits and generational differences in regards to 
phishing related. Generational groups unique personality characteristics are a reflection of 
different political and social changes lived by each cohort group thus, generations are 
proven to differ in personality traits (Barrick et al., 2001; Macky et al., 2008). As such, 
shaped by certain personality traits sensitive to these attacks, different cohorts perceive 
security risks differently (Ng et al., 2012). Peoples' personality is nothing more than their 
likelihood to behave in certain ways, and its traits (Big Five traits) are shown to have a 
determinant impact on users feasibility to responding to Social Engineering attacks 
(Uebelacker and Quiel, 2014; Halevi et al., 2013) . 
The Chi-squared test and regression analysis show a significant correlation between 
millennials and falling for the phish (See 5.2.3). Hence, it is worth finding out what 
personality qualities make this cohort more susceptible to phishing, compared to their 
Baby Boomer parents. 
Many researchers target conscientiousness, the most relevant personality trait to 
determine phishing susceptibility (Halevi et al., 2015), due to its link to continuance 
commitment (Erdheim et al., 2006; Workman, 2008). Therefore, a significant difference is 
found between generations on conscientiousness trait with young people of today 
(millennials) found to be more conscientious than the other generations on the workforce 
(Generation X and Baby Boomers) (Roberts et al., 2006), clarifying millennials bad 
performance on the conducted assessment. On the other side, both effective and normative 
commitment are suggested to relate to extraversion as such, (Erdheim et al., 2006), 
increasing the likelihood of millennials falling for SE attacks (Workman, 2008; Parrish et 
al., 2009; Alseadoon et al., 2012). Correspondingly, an increase of extraversion, 
conscientiousness and emotional stability is found to characterize younger generations 
(age 20 to 40), all being personality elements explicitly increasing susceptibility to 
security risks and to SE attacks (Roberts et al., 2006). Thus, many other researchers 
(Andre et al., 2010; Gentile et al., 2010; Scollon and Diener, 2006; Smits et al., 2011) 
emphasized the fact that younger cohort groups are more vulnerable to phishing as they 
score higher on extraversion compared to older generations.  
Showing a generational increase on self-esteem, over-confidence and entitlement, many 
studies found Generation Y to possess higher levels of narcissistic personality traits 
(Steward and Bernhardt, 2010; Twenge et al., 2008; Twenge and Foster, 2010; Bourke and 
Mechler, 2010) than older generations, who show lower narcissism scores (Foster et al., 
35 
 
2003). Narcissism in particular is found to have a strong relationship with extraversion, 
explaining this paper's found generational difference in vulnerability to phishing attack.  
Moreover, one other domain of Big Five personality traits that happen to increase peoples' 
susceptibility to SE is high agreeableness rates (Parrish et al., 2009; Modic and Lea, 
2012). Darwish et al., claim an increased level of agreeableness among younger people 
and woman (2012), potentially explaining results of the statistical analysis in this work 
(specifically, millennials shown high victimization rates on the assignment). In the same 
consistency other studies found young users to be more vulnerable to phishing attacks as 
possessing higher levels of agreeableness, which is strongly correlated to the likelihood of 
falling victims of security attacks (Srivastava et al., 2003). 
 
6.2 Awareness and training against SE 
This section reveals insight towards designing the most effective strategy to reduce young 
people of today susceptibility to Social Engineering threats. It specifies objectives to 
achieve, needs and weaknesses to comply with, policies and procedures that have to be 
met. It covers all the phases of a continual awareness training from design, development 
and implementation to explore at the end the best evaluation practices to measure its 
effectiveness. It describes the combination of the current solutions on place to establish the 
best program to include in every high-school curricula.   
 
6.2.1 The best defense against Social Engineering 
It is already clear that there are no great solutions decreasing end-users vulnerability to 
Social Engineering, regardless of existing numerous proposals having different 
effectiveness rates. In this case it is worthless to propose any new equally effective 
solution. Moreover, there is ""no need to reinvent the wheel if there are vehicles already in 
place (Desman, 2001, pg. xv)."" How about exploiting all these taken efforts by combining 
them, taking the best of each to comply with specific requirements and specific target 
group? This leads to the idea of expansion of the already proposed solutions via 
necessities recognition and meeting objectives.  
Special awareness campaigns, training sessions or education are examples of several 
applied methods that have been the most effective ones in mitigating vulnerability to 
Social Engineering attacks. Trying to find out the best possible solution that works 
reducing likelihood to fall for SE attacks, recall the educational security conferences and 
their approach. Excellent events with detailed covering of most important security issues, 
a lot of text material which is tough to understand and many security threats to became 
aware of. Then every participant walks through the conference door accompanied by the 
positive feedback and the brain filled with important theory needed to be remembered. 
Taken by the everyday's routine, the great lessons picked up at the conference hall are 
already gone. The core theoretical security concepts are forgotten, none is bothered 
changing passwords, doubting a friendly behavior or even paying attention to malicious or 
unapproved content spread on SNS. At this point everybody realizes that this is not the 
best approach to follow. Education is the highest level of any learning phases which starts 
with awareness, than training. Thus, it is worth implementing it only when the first two 
phases are fully and effectively covered.  
36 
 
Millennials are critically not aware of Social Engineering threats because no one has put 
sufficient efforts to show them, so every program of this profile should start addressing 
awareness at the very grounds. It is crucial to achieve building SE awareness among the 
current generation (you cannot make them change attitude unless they want to). However, 
awareness is simple attention to security thus it is not enough, a more interactive approach 
should also be included in any effort reducing susceptibility towards SE. Both awareness 
and training as fundamental learning phases should be tightly incorporated  in any Social 
Engineering defense framework.  
In a research conducted to understand Estonians attitude and willingness on the 
implementation of security awareness and trainings in elementary, secondary and higher 
education it is emphasized by the researchers that nothing is done at the lower stages of 
education yet (Lorenz and Kikkas, 2012). Also the results of some interviews conducted 
with some fellow students of Cyber Security program at TUT, emphasized that education 
of new generations should start from schools as part of their curricula as soon as possible. 
They argue that parents do not have neither time nor resources to do it. A very well-crafted 
security program part of every school can do better in training students to grow up 
knowledgeable users ready to enter the workforce and able to influence their parents. 
Due to all the above covered reasons and millennials' specific security needs, this 
thesis proposes an effective awareness and training program as the best solution to 
mitigate vulnerability to Social Engineering, with awareness intended to create SE 
security consciousness and training to build security skills and behavior.  
The thesis also stresses out the necessity of such program to be integrated in every national 
high-school curricula and to be implemented periodically. It proposes a very productive 
way to develop training programs or campaigns to raise awareness to Social Engineering 
threats and to meet each school's goals. The only known defense for SE attacks is an 
effective security awareness program (Gardner and Thomas, 2014). A template of a SE 
security awareness training is provided on Appendix A of this thesis. 
 
6.3 Program model and assets 
Objectives: 
It is essential to recognize the need for such security frameworks to be incorporated to any 
school program since there is not a single high school (to this thesis best of knowledge) 
that offers a Social Engineering security program. In light to this objective it is crucial to 
clear out that there is not either any previous work that have emphasized the necessity for 
a SE security program nor have composed a training framework for schools to implement. 
However the main objective of this program is to build security consciousness among 
students, arriving at the point they posses secure behavior without having to think before 
applying it. The program will continually remind and teach them the importance of 
protecting themselves against SE threats. To do so, the program aims to ensure that all 
students understand the need to include a SE security awareness program in the school 
curricula via letting them know that everyone is vulnerable to SE attacks. Moreover, it 
should ensure that they understand and acknowledge their security responsibilities. The 
program should clearly specify security policies, ensure that the training have a strong 
awareness approach. So, users must be appropriately focused to meet the program goals, 
be fully motivated to change the behavior that makes them vulnerable to Social 
Engineering risks. Thus, the ultimate scope of the awareness training is making the 
weakest asset of the security chain (users), the strongest link via teaching them to play 
37 
 
an essential role in ensuring Social Engineering security via protecting themselves and 
sharing awareness also to their Baby Boomers parents. 
Program profile 
The program should be build focusing mainly on two things: meeting students security 
needs and schools policies and requirements. The model proposed here passes through 
program design, development, its implementation and evaluation. Such strategy 
combining practical learning and interaction is fundamental for this on-going training 
program, being able to build security skills and behavior. In their work Lorenz and Kikkas 
found out that 71% of Estonians prefer hands-on security trainings instead of theoretical 
ones (2012). People learn differently based on their generational and educational 
background, and current generation learns much different than those entering in the 
workforce 30 years ago (Gardner and Thomas, 2014).  There is a big difference between 
providing material of how to defend against SE to this generation and teaching them 
practical skills of a security behavior. Passive learning seems not to work among 
millennials, they would prefer interactive learning instead. Current generation students 
needs social learning, workshops to make them realize how easy it is to fall for these 
attacks. Also this thesis proposes classroom training via active learning, as the most 
efficient type of learning in reaching goals (Gardner and Thomas, 2014). Active learning 
in this training context is explained here (Prince, 2004). This thesis proposes a awareness 
and training model to incorporate seminars, conferences, workshops, short security 
meetings, roundtables, Q&A sessions and other alike facilities in the material delivery. 
Program material 
The selection of material is another essential element to decide about while crafting the 
proper awareness training. Therefore, the training material should be carefully selected 
considering the behavior that school want to convey to students and skills to show when 
faced with actual Social Engineering threats. Achieving to share awareness to students, 
ways to deliver the awareness material are enormous: school monthly newsletter, poster 
campaigns, pens campaigns, monthly security days, security note of the day or other 
innovative ideas created by the security team while designing the program or when 
updating it. Another innovative and appealing idea is rewarding students for compliance 
with school's security policies or continual SE security promotions or acknowledgements 
via coffee mugs, bookmarks, mouse pad, paper weight. In order to make millennials pay 
attention to the program and to awareness particularly, the message in the awareness 
material should also be short and concise, integrate catchy security slogans. Therefore 
both awareness and training material should be simple, easy to use and easy-to-access. 
Because it is an on-going process it is crucial not to stick to only one technique, instead 
mix different delivery techniques up and look to adequate repositories to get the most 
appropriate material. In reach of this, it should not be a take-on-somewhere framework or 
any traditional one, it should be composed based on school's culture. The ways to deliver 
the training should also be new and creative enough to make them participate and learn 
security skills. A list of topics to be covered by the program is provided in Appendix B of 
this thesis. 
Social Psychology 
The crafted program should take into detailed consideration the millennial students 
psychology, as directly involved in the process of changing attitude and behavior via 
changing behavioral intentions. Manjak argues, “Employees will not be motivated to 
change behaviors if they see no reason to change (2006, p. 12)."" This thesis highlights 
38 
 
the importance to carefully include motivational drivers while designing and 
implementing the program. The security team responsible to design the awareness 
training should include an expert of the field of psychology in planning and composing the 
program. Security rewarding or appraisals for proper security behavior by students are 
innovative ideas that should not miss in the maintenance of the program. Moreover, the 
training should be designed to comply with generation Y personality traits vulnerable to 
Social Engineering attacks. By specifying particular security behaviors intended to convey 
among school students, social learning in compliance with social psychology is proved to 
work best for them. However, security is said to be a process (Schneier, 2000) and it 
should take a lot of continual efforts in achieving to build security consciousness among 
""nexters"". Thus, this is crucial for young people of this generation and employees of 
tomorrow, to be packed with the needed security behavior (before entering the workforce) 
required in every organization struggling to create such a culture. 
The program security team 
In order to build the most appropriate awareness and training strategy for any school to 
execute, the establishment of a security team is crucial. Behaving as the central authority 
of this long process, its primary duty is to develop security policies and set standards. The 
team will have to deal with the general management of the awareness and training 
program being the main responsible party of the training overall efficacy. Thus, it should 
ensure the training productivity via keeping track of its success and compliance. 
Therefore, the security team will specify methods to be used in evaluating the program 
effectiveness: conduct questionnaires, focus groups, interviews, periodic assessment on 
students' security awareness etc. These tools are also a way to measure the program's 
accessibility and material understanding by students, via monitoring their attendance and 
performance. At the end the team should carry on needed updates on the program based on 
the conducted periodic reviews.  
 
6.4 Summary 
This chapter has pursued to explain the current generation observed susceptibility to 
Social Engineering and has revealed different methods aimed to lessen their vulnerability. 
The results found on chapter 5 are validated in this section via tuning the adequate SE 
defense for schools to integrate in their curricula. The next session gives suggestions and 
directions for future work to be done through assessing the thesis limitations.

7 Discussions 
This chapter focuses on concluding this thesis findings and summarize its core 
contribution. Reviewing results and implications, it identifies new challenges to extend the 
mitigation of SE vulnerability in the future and explore the unaddressed aspects of this 
problem. On the whole, it is still requisite to study deeper the generational factor of SE 
attack and evaluate any thoughts or findings in regards. On that reason, this research 
concludes with recommendations.  
 
7.1 Drawing final conclusions 
Overall, this thesis proposed to study endusers' vulnerability to Social Engineering in 
terms of generational cohorts. The statistical analysis showed susceptibility to be 
significantly affected by generational factor and paradoxically, technology-efficiency was 
not found to be able to ameliorate users SE threats detection abilities. In the same lines 
with the current research findings, it was reasonable to conclude that none of the analyzed 
demographic factors plays any relevant role determining users vulnerability. Moreover, 
educational level produced insignificant results to expect a furthered education to give 
better chances of detecting SE threats. 
The obtained results enabled this thesis to meet its main objective, highlighting the 
importance to differentiate victims of Social Engineering frauds on generation-base in 
future studies. Via analysis of targets' performance on phishing assessment, this research 
found the current generation of today showing higher likelihood to be deceived by SE 
attacks. Having the starting date the same as Internet Domain Name System, it was 
surprising to find out the most internet-savvy generation to be more vulnerable to SE 
attacks compared to Baby Boomer generation. This implies that just because one is 
knowledgeable to SE threats, does not become more aware or less vulnerable and vice 
versa. 
In chapter five and six, the author explained reasons contributing to gens' shown 
susceptibility and claimed to link SE vulnerability to their personality characteristics. 
Generally speaking, consciousness, agreeableness and extraversion traits were found to 
show the highest impact on generation Ys' tendency to fall for Social Engineering threats. 
These particular personality elements are also suggested by previous works to correlate to 
increased susceptibility to phishing and to enlarge current generation potential to SE 
victimization. Answering the second research question these personality characteristics 
can be exploited by intruders to make millennials phish out sensitive information. 
Implying the necessity for a defense strategy for any high school to implement, finally this 
study evaluated the effectiveness of the numerous SE mitigation methods proposed, to 
come out with a solution meeting the observations driven from the overall research. Rather 
than changing current generation personality characteristics (proved to correlate to 
increased vulnerability) the mitigation strategy propose to employ these specific 
characteristics to build secure behavior and attitude towards SE among high-school 
students. The third research question was answered crafting the SE security program 
complying with the millennial generation SE security needs and expectations. The impact 
of the awareness and training program proposed in chapter 6 is promising since it is 
planned covering relevant findings of this research.

7.2 Practical limitations 
Target groups' tested vulnerability is translated to SE security weaknesses they 
demonstrate when faced with SE attacks and that should be addressed by every 
methodology seeking to reduce users susceptibility. Generally speaking, changing 
weaknesses into adequate SE security skills will definitely confine Millennials from fall 
for SE attacks at higher rates via lessen their deficiency in SE security awareness. 
The first limitation of this research is being a cross-sectional study (see Twenge and 
Campbell, 2008) as such, it does not expect to have fully assessed and support the stated 
hypothesis or to have completely answered the research questions. Moreover, the 
approached hypothesis is just an assumption (since this work is the first to anticipate a 
substantive difference among the studied generational cohorts) and specific conclusions of 
the root causes of the detected difference in vulnerability cannot be easily elicited. 
The second limitation constitutes in that although both generations were core targets of the 
study, there was a disproportional generational distribution of participants on the 
assessment (low number of Baby Boomer participants) which could lead to question the 
significance of the results. 
Another core limitation of this research stays on the fact that the targeted endusers shared 
the same cultural background and more specifically, the same university campus, lacking 
to validate the revealed outcomes through covering a wider geographic area. Therefore, 
the same findings do not expend to other cultures and countries (due to deficiency of 
research on the same topic), which may result in different generations profiling on Social 
Engineering susceptibility. 
In addition, generational groups in this research were created assigning individuals to a 
generation according their birth years however, what if the observed vulnerability 
dissimilarities be confounded by age and to have altered this research's results? For future 
works, a fleshed-out methodology should be employed, isolating the effect of generation 
or keeping the age variable constant to derive more specific outcomes. 
Furthermore, in order to reveal meaningful conclusions and understand stereotypes 
occurring across these two generations it is trivial to access a large enough number of 
victims (confined by many reasons). 
These several elements could have resulted in better conclusions if could have been 
included in this research, thus a longitudinal research should be undertaken to cover 
these limitations via taking this thesis as a benchmark to draw better outcomes. 
 
7.3 Recommendations for future work 
Along the findings, the author in this study has also outlined hints to evolve researching to 
defend against SE and at the same time to avoid digging into wrong directions. Currently, 
there is a fair gap in related works studying generational differences in personality 
influencing their susceptibility to SE, since the few studies that exist are mostly focused on 
generational differences in general (Twenge, 2000) and not on susceptibility to SE 
specifically hence, this thesis is a crucial foundation on seeking empirical evidence to this 
approach. Moreover, there is no other research on studying endusers vulnerability to SE on 
generation-base, this work propose a means of categorizing victims of SE on generational 
cohorts sharing similar personality characteristics directly correlated to increase SE 
41 
 
vulnerability. For instance, replication of this study could be recommended to continue 
analyzing the effect of variables which are studied here for the first time.  
Hence, this research highlights the importance to continue research: 
➢ personality differences among generations in relation to susceptibility to SE (since 
it is already proven that generations distinctions in personality traits impact their 
likelihood to respond to these attacks). 
➢ deeper grounds towards supporting the stated hypothesis, for instance it is 
worthwhile seek to complement other researches on how to profile SE victims.   
➢ how to determine what is the right balance to propose strategies to mitigate 
endusers tendency to get social engineered (why not improving the existing ones 
complying with your needs instead). 
➢ the same topic with data in which age factor can be controlled (noting the 
interdependence that age-generation elements have on each-other). 
Bounded by time constraint, this study missed to evaluate the proposed SE security 
awareness and training program efficiency thus, it is trivial to evaluate this thesis proposed 
model effectiveness in reducing vulnerability and furthermore, use this as a benchmark for 
other proposed training programs. Nevertheless, this work is a promising start to the idea 
of studying victims to SE attacks categorized on generational cohorts and future 
approaches should continue exploring how victims of SE attacks differ via enhancing this 
study's rule of thumb guidelines and listed challenges.

Appendix 
I. The Social Engineering security awareness and training framework 
layout for any high school to corporate in its curricula 
 
❖ National School Security Policy and procedures 
o SE security scope 
o Objectives 
o Duties and limitations 
 
❖ Program design 
This phase of the program reveals the first impact to its approach since it outlines 
the particular objectives the program aims to meet. Such, the overall strategy 
should be developed complying with the school requirements and students security 
needs. It ought to clearly identify school's security policies and standards, the 
communication channels used and needs for such a program to include in the 
school curricula. In other words it should list out crucial elements of the program 
before implementing it. Having said that, the program of this nature should be 
planned on detail, after a long period of time collecting ideas, pointing out 
expectations and identifying intended goals.  
Via incorporating any existing technique proven to reduce individuals 
susceptibility, the program should be designed making students understand the 
necessity to include a SE security training program in their school curricula, along 
with making them recognize school's IT security policies and their security 
responsibilities. 
 
❖ Program management 
In order to achieve the aspired goals it is crucial to put particular emphasis on the 
program management, hence this thesis proposes to settle it on a central authority. 
Every school should establish a security awareness team to carry out the whole 
on-going program and as such, the program effectiveness responsibility to be 
mainly concentrated on this asset. Therefore, the team should work on each 
program's element and instill compliances towards obtaining its objectives. It 
should manage the bullet points of the strategy: policy enforcement (schools 
security policy should be practical enough to ensure students acceptance and 
compliance), successful promotion of the security program and make decisions on 
how often the program will be implemented (note that it is very taught to achieve 
security consciousness by running the program once, twice or three times a year). 
Being part of the school curricula, the program should be persistent, a continual 
event to implement.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
54 
 
❖ Program development 
Development of the training content via establishing its core scope and the 
designed strategy is carried out. The selection of the training resources should be 
addressed keeping in mind students needs and their approach to learning (in 
achieving to bolster their SE security skills). Being a fundamental asset of any 
learning theory, awareness material of the program should be chosen to be both 
low cost and efficient in delivering the Social Engineering security message. The 
campaigns content should be simple, short and straight to the point. Towards 
retaining students competence to Social Engineering defense, the security policy 
development is trivial for this program. Hence, sufficient documents listing goals, 
limitations and expectations of school should be created. The overall program must 
be set complying the school's vast array of requirements via outlining students 
security duties and limitations.  
 
❖ Program implementation 
Once have gone through all the above phases of the training strategy and being 
equipped with clear-cut goals, implementing the program is the final step in 
achieving to render the adequate SE fortification. Additionally, beneficial 
communication channels and training material delivery mediums should be on 
place while implementing the training (prefer class-based instead of web-based or 
distance-learning). In the broadest view, such robust training can undoubtedly 
achieve hardening the millennial students falling for Social Engineering. 
Delivering the training periodically, continual implementation of lessons learned 
and feedback, is the best way to reach program's testing and evaluation.  
 
❖ Program evaluation 
Even-though this is a post-implementation step, constructive testing is core to 
maintain in a on-going security awareness program. It directly addresses the 
training efficiency via monitoring and evaluation of the program. By selecting 
effective evaluation methods to carry on (conducted questionnaires, focus groups, 
interviews, periodic assessment of school's security awareness), it provides 
opportunities to improve students training for the next implementation. 
Furthermore, feedback is crucial in any on-going process, as it provides chances to 
patch management or perform program updates to reach better results on upcoming 
sessions. Beyond measuring the program's accessibility via periodic reviews worth 
performing, it safeguards targets from serious endangerment of falling prey of SE 
attacks. The inclusion of motivational drivers on the very roots of the program 
leads to the most efficient arsenal towards fighting Social Engineering.    
 
55 
 
II. List of topics to be included in any high-school SE security 
awareness and training program

Sotsiaalne manipuleerimine (social engineering) on keeruline probleem, mistõttu on väga raske eristada kõige kaitsetumaid kasutajaid. Sellised ründed ei ole suunatud ainult noorte ja töötajate vastu, vaid on laiaulatuslikud sõltumata vanusest. Tehnoloogia kiire kasvu ja selle ebasihipärase kasutamise tõttu on kõik selliste rünnakute poolt mõjutatud, kõik on haavatavad (Purkait, 2012; Aggarwal et al., 2012). Kasutajaid peetakse turvalisuse ""nõrgimaks lüliks"" (Mohebzada et al., 2012; Mitnick and Simon, 2011), ja seega konfidentsiaalse info kaitsmine peaks olema kõikide inimeste eesmärk. Hoolimata sellest, et on olemas erinevaid lahendusi kasutajate koolitamiseks selliste rünnakute vältimiseks, andmepüük on jätkuvalt edukas (Dhamija et al., 2006). See on eelkõige seetõttu, et küberteadlikkuse koolitused, teoreetilised kursused või raamistikud eeldatakse olevat võrdselt efektiivsed kõikidele kasutajatele vaatamata nende vanusest, kuigi kogemus näitab et see ei ole tõsi (Alseadoon, 2014). Selleks, et koolitused saaksid olla efektiivsed, on oluline et need on koostatud lähtudes sotsiaalse manipuleerimise turvanõrkustest, mis on erinevatel vanusegruppidel erinevad. Käesoleva töö eesmärgiks on põlvkondade unikaalsete tunnuste (demograafilised ja isikulised) ja nende haavatavuste faktorite määratlemine. Sellealusel on loodud raamistik, mis on võimalik rakendada ja mis addresseerib neid nõrkusi. Arvesse võttes probleemi keerikust, käesolev uurimistöö näitab, et on vaja läbi viia edasisi uurimusi laiemast perspektiivist lähtuvalt lisades ""põlvkondade"" elemendi uurimiseesmärkidesse, et kas on erinevusi haavatuse riskide osas läbi põlvkondade. Käesolev uurimistöö kasutab nii kvalitatiivseid kui kvantitatiivseid meetodeid eesmärkide saavutamiseks. Andmekogumise rünnaku efektiivsuse hindamisel analüüsitakse kasutajate käitumist ning antakse sellele psühholoogiline tõlgendus. Esimene uurimisküsimus keskendub sotsiaalne manipulatsiooni haavatavuse faktorite määratlemisele ja kvantitatiivsed andmed (statistiline analüüs) näitavad, et põlvkond on oluline element potentsiaalsete sotsiaalse manipulatsiooni ohvrite eristamisel, kusjuures arvutikasutusoskus ja haridustase ei määra olulist rolli hindamaks kasutajate tõenäosust langeda selliste rünnakute ohvriks. Eelpool toodud faktorite ja ka eelnevate uuringute alusel, ei ole ka sugu määrav faktor haavatavuse ennustamisel (Parsons et al., 2013). Teine uurimisküsimus püüab selgitada, mis põhjustab põlvkondade haavatavuse erinevusi ning uuringu tulemused näitavad, et  Y-põlvkonna isikuomadused, sh teadvus, ekstravertsus ja meeldivus on põhifaktorid, mis mõjutavad haavatavust.  Viimasena, lisaks  tugeva aluse loomisel edaspidiseks põlvkondade haavatavuse uurimisel, pakub käesolev töö välja raamistiku, milles on eeltoodud leiud arvesse võetud ja mille eesmärk on vähendada Y-põlvkonna haavatust  sotsiaalse manipuleerimise rünnakutele.  Käesoleva magistritöö unikaalsus seisneb üldises lähenemisviisis: alates ulatuslikus kirjanduse ülevaates ""põlvkondade"" haavatavuse faktorite määratlemisega, statistilise analüüsiga haavatavuste hindamiseks ja lõpetades lahenduse väljapakkumisega, mis aitab lahendada ""põlvkondade"" turvalisuse  probleemi.In the age of digital society Social Engineering attacks are very successful and unfortunately users still cannot protect themselves against these threats. Social Engineering is a very complex problem, which makes it difficult to differentiate among vulnerable users. These attacks not only target young users or employees, they select massively, regardless of the users' age. Due to the rapid growth of technology and its misuse, everyone is affected by these attacks, everyone is vulnerable to them (Purkait, 2012; Aggarwal et al., 2012). Users are considered the ""weakest link"" of security (Mohebzada et al., 2012; Mitnick and Simon, 2011) and as such, protecting confidential information should be the ultimate goal of all people. However, despite the fact that a number of different strategies exists to educate or train endusers to avoid these attacks, they still do, phishing still succeeds (Dhamija et al., 2006). This is mainly because the existing security awareness trainings, theoretical courses, or frameworks are expected to be equally effective for all users regardless of their age, but experience has shown that this is not true (Alseadoon, 2014). In order for these security trainings to be effective, it is essential that they are composed based on the Social Engineering security weaknesses attributed differently to different generations. Identifying unique characteristics (demographic and personality) of generations, determinants of their vulnerability is what this work aims to do. Then frameworks crafted based on that information (addressing these weaknesses) would be of use and worth implementing. Therefore, taking into consideration the complexity of this problem, this study suggests that there is a need to research it from a broader perspective, adding the ""generation"" element into the study focus to find out if there is indeed any difference in susceptibility among generational cohorts. In order to do so, this research will adapt both qualitative and quantitative methods towards reaching its objectives. Collected-data of users' performance in a phishing assessment are analyzed and psychological translation of results is provided. Thus, the first research question seeks to address what factors determinate endusers vulnerability to Social Engineering, and results from quantitative data (statistical analysis) show that generation is an important element to differentiate potential victims of Social Engineering, whilst computer-efficacy or educational level do not play any noteworthy role in predicting endusers' likelihood of falling for these threats. In consistency with the above elements and previous studies, also gender is shown no potentiality in predicting susceptibility (Parsons et al., 2013). The second research question deems to explain what makes generations differ in susceptibility and this study's findings propose that generation Y personality traits such as consciousness, extraversion and agreeableness are key influencers of their shown vulnerability. Finally, along with establishing strong foundations for future research in studying generations susceptibility to Social Engineering, this thesis employ these findings in proposing a framework aiming to lessen millennial likelihood to Social Engineering victimization. The originality of this study lies on its overall approach: starting with an exhaustive literature review towards identifying factors impacting generations' susceptibility level, then statistically measuring their vulnerability, to finish with a solution proposal crafted to suit the observed generational security weaknesses",['Thesis'],disabled

Abstract 
The Internet and in particular social media applications such as Facebook, YouTube and 
many others, are obviously “overtaking the world” and could be regarded as “a global 
consumer phenomenon” (Camilia, Ibrahim, & Dalhatu,  2013) . Social media usage is 
one of the most common activities among children, adolescents, and emerging adults 
nowadays. It offers today’s youth a portal for entertainment and communication and it is 
becoming one of the main platforms for accessing information and news. This aggressive 
adoption of social media among the younger generation could be attributed to their up to 
date knowledge of and comfort with the latest technology and the convenient 
accessibility to these social networking tools (Vorderer, 2016). This study aims to shed 
the light on the social media effects on the academic performance of university students 
in Egypt and aims to clarify to different stakeholders the relationship between the social 
media usage and academic performance and to harness full potential of social media. This 
study examines the role of social media in students’ academic endeavors and ultimately 
their academic performance through their reported perceptions and reflections. It also 
examines factors that might influence the nature of this relationship, and its tentative 
impact on the academic performance of Nile University undergraduate students. An 
explanatory sequential mixed method approach is employed in order to get both 
quantitative and qualitative data, the responses of 442 Nile university undergraduate 
student were collected and were scored, coded and inserted into SPSS, and were analyzed 
using multiple statistical descriptive and inferential statistical tests based on the research 
question and the nature of the data to be analyzed using frequency tables, crosstabs, 
Anovas, post hocs and t-tests. The findings of the study explains the perception of Nile 
university students of social media effects on their academic performance, and to what 
extend do they use social media for academic related purposes, and it explores the effect 
of the different academic majors, academic statues and gender on the social media usage 
perception and usage. Significant differences in the behavior of students from different 
academic majors and different academic status in perceiving and using social media 
emerged which might require further investigation.

Chapter 1 
Background and Significance 
Advances in Internet technologies have spurred on compelling changes in how we 
interact, communicate, learn, and build knowledge. For much of the connected world, it 
permeates nearly every aspect of our existence from shopping and banking, to 
communication and education among many other pursuits (Tariq, Mehboob, Khan, & 
Ullah, 2012).  In general worldwide Internet users have increased rapidly between 2005 
and 2014 (Freund & Weinhold, 2002).  In 2015, there were 6.5 billion Internet users 
around the world and in 2014 they became 7.2 billion (Singh, 2017). The Internet and in 
particular social media applications such as Facebook, YouTube and many others, are 
obviously “overtaking the world” and  could be regarded as “a global consumer 
phenomenon” (Camilia, Ibrahim, & Dalhatu,  2013). According to Grossman (2010) if 
Facebook were a country it would be the third largest country after China and India and 
twice as big as the United States of America. According to Facebook statistics “more 
than 30 billion pieces of content (web links, news stories, blog posts, notes, photo 
albums) are shared each month” and “People on Facebook install 20 million applications 
everyday” (2011,PARA.2&4). On YouTube every minute, 10 hours of content are 
uploaded to the video sharing platform.  
 It is not surprising that social media usage is one of the most common activities 
among children, adolescents, and emerging adults nowadays. It offers today’s youth a 
portal for entertainment and communication and it is becoming one of the main platforms 
for accessing information and news. The social media usage of American adults aged 18–
29 years who represent the higher percentage of university students rose from 12 percent 
in 2005 to 90 percent in 2015 (Perrin, 2018). Also in Egypt, the rate of social media users 
is increasing, El Gazzar (2013) mentioned that social media users specifically those who 
are using Facebook have exceeded seven million which is (9.76%) of the population, 
(40%) of these are between 18-24 years old. Saied, ElSabagh and El-Afandy, (2016) 
reported that this percentage has increased to 54.6% in 2015; more than 80 percent of 
them are young people specifically university students.  
  
10 
 
This aggressive adoption of social media among the younger generation, according to 
Vorderer (2016) could be attributed to their up to date knowledge of and comfort with the 
latest technology and the convenient accessibility to these social networking tools. For 
instance, they can access social media from their cell phones any time any place. This 
encourages them to use social media not only for receiving and retrieving information, 
but also for being online and connecting with others, and from being from being 
consumers and participants to “prosumers” which means that they consume and produce 
media on the social media platform (as cited in Obar & Wildman, 2015) 
 The social media craze has also hit university and post-secondary institutions, 
which cannot remain impartial to these rapidly changing technologies (Dumpit & 
Fernandez, 2017). Putting into consideration how social media became embedded within 
the young generation lifestyle, college student affairs professionals found a way to use 
social media as a method of communication between the college administration and the 
students (Junco, 2012). Furthermore, most of the universities nowadays have an official 
page or group on one of the social media networks where students, professors and staff 
can share resources and interact (Selwyn, 2009). DeAndrea, Ellison, LaRose, Steinfield 
and Fiore (2012) mentioned that many universities have even established their own social 
media networks in order to help new students to socialize and connect with the faculty 
members, staff, and alumni and to establish a sense of connection with the institution. 
Using social media networks in such a way helps in facilitating the process of knowing 
more about campus facilities, activities and events especially for the freshman students, 
and ultimately adjusting to university life. 
Researchers found various effects of social media use on college students’ 
experiences Junco (2014). Some of the mentioned effects are: enhanced self-esteem 
(Gonzales & Hancock, 2011; Mehdizadeh, 2010; Tazghini & Siedlecki, 2013) as well as 
the development of identity and peer relationships (Pempek, Yermolayeva & Calvert, 
2009), relationship building and maintenance (Ellison, Steinfield & Lampe, 2007; 2011; 
Ellison, Vitak, Gray & Lampe, 2014; Manago, Taylor & Greenfield, 2012; Valenzuela, 
Park & Kee, 2009), higher life satisfaction, social trust, civic engagement, and political 
participation (Valenzuela, Park & Kee, 2009) student engagement (Heiberger & Harper, 
  
11 
 
2008; HERI, 2007; Junco, 2012; Junco, Elavasky & Heiberger, 2012; Loken, 2011), as 
well as perceptions of social and academic integration (Selwyn, 2009; Yu, Tian, Vogel & 
Kwok, 2010), perceptions of social support (DeAndrea, Ellison, Larose, Steinfield & 
Fiore, 2011; Manago, Taylor & Greenfield, 2012). 
The impact of social media on learning and teaching is increasingly considered and 
debated among higher education scholars, administrators, and stakeholders. Lynn, Healy, 
Kilroy, Hunt, Werff, Venkatagiri and Morrison (2015) considered social media as one of 
the game-changers in the realm of learning and instruction. Selwyn (2012) discussed the 
implications of social media for new types of learners, learning and higher education 
provision. McLoughlin & Lee (2010) stated that using social media networks in the 
educational process could help educators to apply the inquiry-based approach and 
encourage the collaboration between the instructor and the students, thereby encourage 
engagement. Also important is the potential of these technologies for encouraging 
independent self-directed learning as well as encouraging students’ as active producers of 
knowledge (Dumpit & Fernandez, 2017), which once again is commonly regarded  as a 
positive affordance for media. 
Although a very large community exists online, including on social media,  that 
focuses on education, this might not be the case for university students (Tariq et al., 
2012); even though the majority of students are active users on social media networks, 
yet 70 percent of them do not use social media for academic purposes (Jones, Blackey, 
Fitzgibbon, & Chew, 2010). Tariq et al. (2012) are some of the researchers that 
emphasize that the affordances of technologies might have severe negative consequences 
on “social networks addicts.”  They, for example, fear that “social networks grab the total 
attention and concentration of the students and divert them towards non educational, 
unethical, and inappropriate actions such as useless chatting, time killing by random 
searching “(p. 409). 
Statement of the Problem 
Bennett, Maton and Kervin (2008) are an example of educators that suggested 
that using media technology can help students enhance their academic performance. Yet, 
many educators and parents are worried that their children and students are spending too 
  
12 
 
much time using social media networks. Some institutions and instructors ban the use of 
social media in classrooms believing that it negatively impacts students’ attention, 
engagement, and accordingly their GPA.  
Rambe (2012) indicated that “the essentialist view that new technological innovations 
(especially Social Media) disrupt higher education delivery ride on educators’ risk averse 
attitudes toward full scale adoption of unproven technologies. However, this 
unsubstantiated logic forecloses possibilities for embracing the constructive dimensions 
of disruptions, and grasping the tremendous academic potential of emerging 
technologies.” (p.132). The results of previous research is not conclusive, with some 
studies suggesting a negative impact for social media, and others suggesting promising 
opportunities for engagement. Over generalizations regarding the impact of social media 
are obviously not justified. More needs to be discovered about the variables that influence 
this relationship and about strategies that help students, faculty, and higher education 
institutions harness the full potential of these pervasive technologies. The study aims to 
uncover some of these factors. Culture and context also play an important role in the 
adoption and usage of innovation. The study fills yet another gap by shedding the light on 
the social media effects on the academic performance of university students within the 
Egyptian context.  
Purpose of the Study 
The purpose of the study is to examine the role of social media in students’ 
academic endeavors and ultimately their academic performance through their reported 
perceptions and reflections. It also seeks to examine factors that might influence the 
nature of this relationship, and its tentative impact on the academic performance of Nile 
University undergraduate students. The results of this study are expected to be of benefit 
to stakeholders at Nile University and beyond. It is expected that the results will provide 
a deeper understanding of the phenomenon at hand, especially within the Egyptian local 
context. It will also help the university administrators and faculty members recognize the 
extent to which university students’ use social media and in what ways it might impact 
their academic engagement and performance, and accordingly make more informed 
decisions with regard to the usage of social media for academic purposes.

Chapter 2 
Literature Review 
In this study four main themes will be addressed through analysis and research that 
will help in understanding the effect of social media usage among college students on 
their academic performance followed by the theoretical framework. The four main 
themes that were are: the concept of social media, influence of Social Media on Students’ 
Academic Performance, gender usage of social media and social media usage in Egypt. 
1) The Concept of Social Media 
Kaplan and Haenlein (2010) defined social media as “Internet based applications 
that allow the creation and exchange of content which is user generated” (p.61). They 
stated that social media was first known in1979, when Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis 
from Duke University created the Usenet, a worldwide discussion system that 
allowed Internet users to post public messages; and also when Bruce and Susan 
Abelson founded “Open Diary” in 1998.Open Diary was an early social networking 
site in which members of a certain community shared their daily diary online and the 
word “blog” was first used at the same time. Before the second stage of development 
of the Internet, “Web 2.0,” in the late 1990’s, users browsed only for the aim of 
getting information through reading from various resources and watching videos 
(Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). According to Kaplan and Haenlein (2010) users at this 
time were considered consumers not participants. It was mentioned in Ritzer and  
Jurgenson (2010) study (as cited in Obar & Wildman, 2015) afterwards, Web 2.0, 
representing the second stage of the Internet development namely “User Generated 
Content (UGC)”, Internet users were transformed from being consumers and 
participants to “prosumers” which means that they consume and produce media (as 
cited in Obar & Wildman, 2015).  These new affordances are what made the 
applications and dynamic interaction of social networking possible. Some of the 
common features that qualify a tool to be considered a social networking site are: 
enabling users to communicate with each other in an easy way and allowing users to 
exchange information, pictures and messages (Dijck, 2011). There are many forms of 
social media, presented in the table below, which allow users to interact with other 
media users of their choice.

Table 2.1  
Forms of social media adapted from Grahl (2012) as cited in Alwagait (2015) 
Forms of social media Description 
Social networking sites (SNS) 
Services in which users set up a profile in 
order to establish a connection with friends 
or other users, who have similar 
backgrounds or interests. The profile 
contains a users’ personal information. 
SNS provide various ways for users to 
interact with one another. Examples of 
SNS include Facebook and LinkedIn 
 
Bookmarking sites 
Services which allow users to save, search 
and organize links to various Internet 
resources and websites. Some services will 
allow the tagging of links in order for them 
to be shared easily as well as being 
searched for. Examples of bookmarking 
sites are Diigo and Delicious 
 
Micro blogging sites 
Services which combine SNS and blogging 
but the messages exchanged are limited in 
terms of size. Users have to subscribe to 
the services. Examples of micro blogging 
sites include Twitter. 
 
Media sharing sites Services which allow users to upload and 
  
16 
 
share media such as videos and photos as 
well as allowing users to comment and tag 
media. Examples of media sharing services 
include YouTube and Flickr 
 
Social news sites 
Services that allow other users to vote on 
news articles and links to external articles, 
which are posted by users. The news 
articles that get the most votes are 
displayed more prominently on the site. 
Examples of social news sites include  
Digg and Reddit 
 
Blogs and forums 
Blogs are like online diaries of thoughts, 
which give other users the opportunity to 
post comments on the blog postings. 
Forums allow registered users to have 
conversations with other users by post 
messages. Examples of blogging sites 
include WordPress and Blogger 
 
While social media networks collect a lot of personal data about the users, they also 
afford the privacy of the users. For example, the visibility of the online profiles 
depends on the social media network website privacy terms and conditions. Boyd and 
Ellison (2007) mentioned that LinkedIn controls what the user can display and see 
according to the user’s subscription and paid fees. On the contrary, Facebook users’ 
profiles are available to all other users in the same network, unless a profile owner 
decides to change the privacy options. Moreover, private messaging, comments and 
  
17 
 
friends features differ from one social media network website to another depending 
on the feature and user base (Boyd & Ellison, 2007). 
With all the features social media are providing, they have facilitated the lives of 
millions of people. Although they are easily accessible and despite the tremendous 
opportunities they offer, social media can have their drawbacks. Issues of privacy, 
detachment from reality and being the target of advertisers are some of the main 
concerns. However, they are creating a new communication landscape that is yet to 
be discovered and used.    
2)  Influence of Social Media on Students’ Academic Performance 
Using social media to enhance the learning process can take a number of forms, target 
various skills, and utilize different tools. University educators propose that social media 
can have a positive influence on interaction, engagement, knowledge building, and sense 
of community (Rovai, 2001). However there is also research that shows that these same 
tools can distract learners from their studies, and encourage procrastination and 
superficial thinking. The following section will present some of the studies that addressed 
the relationship between social media and academic performance and learning. This 
review presents a snapshot mainly on studies dealing with the most popular social 
networking tools such as Facebook, rather than a comprehensive review of all forms of 
social media.  
Studies generally imply that social media is mainly used by college students to 
socialize rather than for academic pursuits. Raacke and Bonds-Raacke (2008) found out 
that college students around the age of 20 with accounts on Myspace or Facebook use 
these systems “to keep in touch with old friends” (96.0%), “to keep in touch with my 
present friends (91.1%), “to post/look at pictures” (57.4%), “to make new friends” 
(56.4%), and “to locate old friends” (54.5%). But only 10.9 percent stated that they used 
it “for academic purposes”, and only 12.9 percent listed their courses on their profiles. 
Similarly, Michikyan, Subrahmanyam, and Dennis (2015) used a mixed-method 
approach to investigate the relationship between online academic disclosure (namely 
status updates about their academic experiences) and academic performance for 261 
students with an average age of 22 years. Thematic analysis of their posts indicated that 
  
18 
 
14% of their contributions to Facebook were academic in nature. On the other hand, the 
majority of students in Camilia, Sajoh, and Dalhtu (2013) used social media for academic 
purposes.  
Several studies suggest that the time spent on social media takes away from the time 
available for studying. Alwagait, Shahzad, and Alim (2015) investigated to role of social 
media on academic performance of 108 Saudi students. Survey data revealed that Twitter 
was the most popular social network followed by Facebook. The average number of 
hours spent by students on social media was 25.3 hours. Sixty percent of the respondents 
acknowledged that excessive use of social media negatively impacted their performance, 
and indicated that 10 hours per week of use would ensure that their academic 
performance is not negatively impacted. SimilarlyKrischner and Karpinski (2010) noted 
that some students do not have control on their social media while engaged in academic 
activities, and that they spend more time on these networks than they do studying or 
sleeping.  They point out that empirical research suggests the negative impact of multi-
tasking, or attempting to simultaneously process different sources of information, on 
performance. They underscore that this leads to increased study time and an increased 
number of mistakes on assignments. Junco (2013) examines the relationship between 
Facebook activity, time taken for class preparation and overall GPA for 1839 students. 
Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that time spent on Facebook was 
significantly negatively correlated with overall GPA, but only weakly related to time 
spent on class preparation. Moreover, using Facebook to search for information was a 
positive predictor of GPA while time spent on socializing was a negative predictor.  
Some studies delve deeper into the phenomenon of spending too much time on social 
media and almost portray it as a coping mechanism. Student in Krischner and Karpinski 
(2010) for example, did not believe that it impacted their academic performance 
negatively. Those who did report a negative influence explained social media as a 
strategy for guiltless procrastination. The path analysis conducted by (Michikyan, 
Subrahmanyam, & Dennis, 2015), mentioned earlier, for example, determined that 
academic performance was a predictor of Facebook use rather than the opposite. Students 
with low GPA are more active on Facebook than students with high GPA; one of the 
  
19 
 
reasons of this is the fact that students, who are facing academic or social problems turn 
to Facebook as a way of distraction from the difficulties that they are facing. Similarly, 
Fogel, and Nutter-Upham (2011)’s study about the self-reported executive functioning 
associated with academic procrastination by distributing a thirty minutes questionnaire on 
212 university students, showed that there is a relationship between social media use, 
procrastination and poor academic performance, between 30 to 60 percent of college 
students stated that they use social media to procrastinate on their academic duties and 
socialize or surf the internet. 
Very few studies have investigated variables that might impact how, when, and to 
what extent students used social media.  Krischner and Karpinski (2010) conducted an 
exploratory survey study to examine if and how 102 undergraduate and 117 graduate 
students in public US University used Facebook, and how this usage related to hours of 
studying and GPA. The survey they used also elicited information about students’ own 
perceptions on Facebook use. Facebook users reported lower GPA and fewer hours 
studying. Users and nonusers did not however differ in terms of the amount of time they 
spent on the Internet, but their studying strategies differed. These results held regardless 
of student status (whether they were an undergraduate or graduate) or their major 
(humanities, social sciences, medical, STEM or business). The study also suggested that 
personality and hours spent working are related to Facebook use. 
Boogart (2016) conducted a study in four universities to investigate the impact of 
Facebook on campus life at four higher education institutions, analyzing the responses of 
3134 students.  He found significant relationships between time spent on Facebook, and 
several demographic variables. Females spent significantly more time on Facebook. 
Students with a GPA of 2.99 or less reported being longer on Facebook than those with a 
higher GPA. Also, students who are in their first and second years of undergraduate study 
spend more time using Facebook than those in their third year – the majority of the third 
year students (almost 70%) spent less than 30 minutes on day using it.  
Julia, Langa & Miquel (2015) underscored the importance of social and relational 
factors in for educational attainment within higher education. They examined the impact 
of the connectedness afforded by social media tools on the performance of students 
  
20 
 
within desperate disciplines of study – creative and non-creative – at the bachelor’s level, 
76 students participated from the business administration and management discipline 
which is considered as non-creative and 78 students participated from the industrial 
design engineering discipline which is considered as creative. The results of their study 
suggested that close social ties within the network of their discipline helped students 
within the non-creative discipline perform better. The same was not true for the creative 
discipline in which the relationship between social ties and performance was inversely 
proportional.  
 A few studies suggested a more positive potential for social media, but also the 
variation of how students interacted and perceived these tools. Camilia, Sajoh, & Dalhtu 
(2013) investigated this relationship in the Nigerian context. The responses of 536 
students to a survey revealed that 97% of students used social media networks. Facebook 
was the most popular social network site, followed by “2go” and YouTube. The majority 
of students (91%) spent less than 4 hours a day on social networks. A quarter of the 
students reported that they believed that social media impacted their academic 
performance positively, 32% indicated that it impacted it negatively; the rest though it 
had no effect. About 75% of the students reported that they used it for academic 
assignments. 
Wodzicki, Schawmmlein and Moskluik (2012) pointed out the potential of social media 
to develop students’ self-directed learning skills because they give students a platform to 
explore subjects and gather information through accessing existing data on the web or 
interacting with like-minded students to constructively exchange ideas and build 
knowledge through informal and formal activities. Wodzicki et al (2012) however note 
that little is known about how these informal learning opportunities are harnessed and 
about the characteristics of the students who engage in these activities. To examine these 
relationships, they conducted three studies to investigate academic knowledge exchange 
via StudiVZ, an equivalent to Facebook on 774 users of StudiVZ students. The sample 
consisted of 498 women and 276 men between 19 and 29 years, which is a typical age 
range for German students. Analysis revealed that one fifth of students employed this 
social media tool to build knowledge. However, the majority, especially freshman, used it 
  
21 
 
for social purposes such as networking and getting oriented to the university 
environment. The researchers concluded that knowledge exchange and social functions 
for using social networks should be regarded as intertwined rather than mutually 
exclusive.  
Rambe (2012) employed an ethnographic approach to examine the impact of 
social media on meaningful learning and pedagogical strategies. To do that they 
examined the Facebook postings of students and instructors enrolled in an Information 
Systems course within the South African context. The results of the study showed that 
165 participants posted 154 wall posts, 121discussion board posts, and 139 posts to the 
administrator‘s inbox over two semesters. Rambe concluded that Facebook constituted a 
collaborative “safe” “third space” that facilitated student expression, the development of 
learning communities, and encouraged knowledge construction. On the other hand, 
Rambe suggested that postings fell short of manifesting deeper levels of conceptual 
engagement and learning. 
Junco, Heiberger, & Loken (2011) examined the impact of twitter on university 
students’ engagement and GPA. Using an experimental design, students from a first year 
pre-health seminar were assigned to an experimental group (N=70) in which Twitter was 
used for a variety of academic activities and a control group (N=55). The analysis of 
engagement and GPA via an ANOVA test showed that students in the experimental 
group were significantly more engaged and had a higher GPA. Analysis of Twitter 
postings also reflected that high level of engagement on behalf of students and faculty.  
They concluded that social media has no negative impact on student academic 
performance if they learned to allocate their time effectively.  
 A number of the above studies suggest a negative relationship between social 
media use and student academic performance. However, several of the above studies 
imply that it is not the time you spend on social media or the Internet that could be related 
to a low GPA (e.g., Junco, 2011; Krischner & Karpinski, 2010), but there might be some 
underlying factors such as the activities that you engage in during that time and how you 
manage your studying time, etc. (e.g., Junco et al., 2011). A number of the above studies 
  
22 
 
also show that the effect might differ according to the students’ academic statues and the 
academic discipline (e.g Boogart, 2016; Julia, Langa & Miquel, 2015). 
3) Gender Usage of Social Media 
Males and Females use social media at similar rates (Pew research center, 2017). 
However, according to Lim, Heinrichs and Lim, (2017) females perceive social media 
differently than males. Social media corporations found out that interest and curiosity are 
the main factors that affect the social media usage of females, whereas variety of contents 
is the main factor that affects the social media usage of males. There are also several 
researches mentioned that there are gender differences in the social media usage. For 
example one of the conducted studies to analyze this phenomenon showed that females 
listen to less music on social media sharing platforms than males (Putzke, Fischbach, 
Schoder & Gloor, 2014). On the other hand, in 2007 a research from Pew research center 
showed that 70 percent of female teenagers use social media and that only 54 out of the 
70 are active members and post photos on different social media platforms, as compared 
with males with 54 people, only 40 out of the 54 are active members (Ularo, 2014).  
Another study by Zheng, Yuan, Chang & Wu (2016) showed that females use to put 
seductive profile pictures more than males because they believe that the attractiveness of 
the profile picture influences the number of online followers or friends they have. This 
study also showed that females gave emphasis to emotional expression while using social 
media. On the contrary, males enjoy showing that they are having fun while using social 
media. A study by Chan, Cheung, Na Shi & Lee (2015) showed that the majority of 
females use social media for socializing and connecting with their family members, 
whereas males are more focused on task- oriented actions and gaming.  
It was also mentioned by (Correa, Hinsley &Zungia, 2010) that the personality traits 
affecting the social media usage of males and females differ. For example, males who are 
emotionally stable tend to use social media less than the males who are not emotionally 
stable. However, emotional stability does not have any effect on the social media usage 
of the females. It was also mentioned that females who are open to experience tend to use 
social media more than the females who are introverts. However, openness to experience 
and extraversion do not have any effect on the social media usage of males.

Gender usage is also altered when it comes to the social media multitasking 
phenomenon. Research showed that females tend to use multiple social media platforms 
at the same time while doing other things. Studies showed that 50.5 percent used to talk 
face to face with other people and 56.2 percent use to talk on the phone while using social 
media (Ularo, 2014). Researches mentioned that females are better at multitasking than 
males. For example, Offer and Schneider (2011) reported that mothers spend 10 more 
hours a week multitasking compared with fathers” as cited in (Mantyla, 2013, para.1) 
Studies that focus on the role of gender with reference to academic activities and 
performance are rare. 
4) Social Media Usage in Egypt 
 The Arab Republic of Egypt is in Northeast Africa. Egypt has over 90 million 
inhabitants, making it the highest populated country in the Arab world and the third 
populous African country after Nigeria and Ethiopia. Two thirds of Egypt’s population is 
below 29 years and it has a low rank in the gender inequality index; Egypt ranks 131 out 
of 155 countries (“About Egypt”, 2018) 
The Egyptian higher education system has rapidly expanded in the past decades 
due to the enormous increase in the population. This expansion has led to overcrowded 
universities; public universities can reach 400 students in one section, which also led to a 
poor quality of education. Furthermore, Egypt is suffering from a shortage of well-
qualified trainers, teachers and professors due to the lack of training and low wages. 
Besides, Egypt’s gender inequality in literacy is to be considered high among the other 
countries; 65 percent literacy for women versus 82 percent of men (“Gender Equality and 
Women's Empowerment”, 2017). Consequently, this literacy rate means that the social 
media usage in Egypt may not be the same among males and females. Yet, again this 
might not be relevant to the higher education context under examination here.   
 Internet users in Egypt are increasing rapidly reaching about 54.6 percent of the 
population in 2015, more than 80 percent of them are young people specifically 
university students (Saied, ElSabagh & El-Afandy, 2016). According to a study held by 
Saied, ElSabagh and El-Afandy (2016), which included 484 Egyptian and 277 Malaysian 
  
24 
 
higher education students, and investigated Internet and Facebook addiction among youth 
of both countries, mobile phones are the most frequently used device to access social 
media. 
A higher percentage of Egyptian students reported feeling lethargic, spent less 
time with their friends and spent more time using social media during their study time. 
Moreover, the most commonly reported effects from using social media among the 
Egyptian and Malaysian students were: headache, eye irritation, disturbance of sleep 
patterns, increase in body weight and decrease of physical exercise (Saied, ElSabagh & 
El-Afandy, 2016). It was also mentioned by El-Khouly (2015) that in Egypt people 
access Facebook in one day more than the cumulative readership of every newspaper in a 
week and that 18 percent spends more than eight hours on social media, which affects 
their academic performance. These results would support those researchers and educators 
that work against the substantial adverse effects of social media (Tariq et al, 2012). 
 Social media though might have great potential for higher education within Egypt. 
As a result of the big number of students attending Egyptian universities and that the 
existing high student-teacher ratio, the use of technology in the Egyptian higher 
education is considered a means of refining the reliability and efficiency in the 
presentation and delivery of knowledge and the use of information and communication 
technology aptitudes for enhancing the quality of higher education in Egypt (Eraqi, 
Abou-Alam, Belal & Fahmi, 2011). It was also mentioned by Sobaih, 
Moustafa,Ghandforoush & Khan, (2016) that higher education students may use social 
media in academic purposes due to the lack of communication technology and poor 
infrastructure of the public academic institutions, which make the use of social media 
have a great potential to be utilized as a communication platform. However, after 
questioning a sample of the academic staff in public universities, it turned out that faculty 
members use social media frequently but for non-academic purposes and that they do not 
prefer communicating with their students through social media channels to protect their 
privacy. It was also mentioned by (El-Khouly,2015) that in Egypt people access 
Facebook in one day more than the cumulative readership of every newspaper in a week 
and that 18 percent spend more than eight hours on social media, which affects their 
  
25 
 
academic performance. This excess of social media networks use in Egypt reached a very 
high level during Egypt’s 2011 revolution. 
 The potential for social media emerged clearly during Egypt’s 2011 revolution 
(Frost, 2016). Egypt’s level of Internet usage reached 30 percent during that momentous 
historic moment.At that time Egypt had nearly four million Facebook users, which made 
the transferability of information and discussions between the protesters easy. The 
number of tweets from Egypt and the world wide increased from 2,300 to 230,000 tweets 
per day the week before Mubarak’s resignation and the videos showing protests went 
viral (Safranek, 2012). However, it was mentioned in some studies that only 14 percent 
of the tweets were from inside Egypt and the rest of the tweets were from another 
countries (Aday,Farrell, Freelon, Lynch, Sides& Dewar, 2013; Brym, Godbout, 
Hoffbauer, Menard & Zhang, 2014.).  
The majority of Egyptian users of social media during the 2011 revolution were 
young, well-educated and lacking politics awareness (Howard & Hussain, 2011; Howard 
& Parks, 2012). Social media had a political impact in more than one country in the past 
couple of years. Safranek (2012) stated that social media played a major role in the 
Philippines, Maldova, Iran, Tunisia, Lebanon, Syria, Libya and Egypt. 
 As a result of the increased number of social media networks users in Egypt 
during the revolution, the majority of the Egyptian youth generation became heavy users 
of such networks (Frost, 2016). Consequently, studying the effect of social media on their 
academic performance is essential. Because according the media dependency theory, the 
more people use social media the more social media will affect their lives (Ball-Rokeach, 
1985). 
5) Theoretical Framework 
According to the literature review sections, the research is anchored on two theories: 
The Uses and Gratification theory and the Connectivism theory. 
As was previously mentioned, social media offers today’s youth a portal for 
entertainment and communication and it is becoming one of the main platforms for 
accessing information and news. This study aims to explore the undergraduate students’ 
  
26 
 
perception of using social media on their academic performance and relate it to their 
actual academic performance, the results will reveal whether they have control over their 
social media consumption or not. Uses and gratification approach identifies the needs and 
motives behind online media usage. According to Olise & Makka, (2013) the theory was 
developed by Elihu Katz in the early 1970’s Uses and gratification theory suggests that 
social media users have power over their media consumption and assume an active role in 
interpreting and integrating media into their own lives and that they are responsible for 
choosing media to meet their desires and needs to achieve gratification (Olise & Makka, 
2013). Uses and gratification of the social media approach focuses on why and how 
people use social media to satisfy their needs (Larose, Mastro, & Eastin, 2001).   
This study aims to explore to what extent do undergraduate students using social 
media in academic related purposes and whether it affects them positively or negatively. 
Connectivism learning approach emphasizes the role of social media context in how 
learning occurs and explains how Internet technologies have created new opportunities 
for people to learn and share information across the World Wide Web and among 
themselves (Siemens, 2005). The theory was developed by Stephen Downes and George 
Siemens (Transue, 2013). Connectivism theory suggests that students are encouraged to 
seek out information on their own online and express what they find and that learning 
may reside in non-human appliances. Connectivism suggests that the use of technology to 
help individuals to be connected with knowledge and information ought to improve the 
learning process not vice versa (Evans, 2014). 
Summary 
To summarize, several studies suggest that social media is mostly used to socialize – 
to connect with old friends and seek new relationships. Academic activities constitute a 
smaller time of students’ time on social media (e.g.,  Michikyan et al., 2015; Raacke & 
Bonds-Raacke, 2008). However, other studies indicated that students spend substantial 
time employing social media for academic purposes (e.g., Camilia et al., 2013). 
  Many studies suggest that students spend too much time on social networking 
apps, and that this simply comes at the expense of time dedicated to focusing on 
academics (e.g., Alwagait et al., 2015; Krischner & Karpinski, 2010). Krischner and 
  
27 
 
Karpinski (2010), however, found that it was not how much time students spent on the 
Internet; it was rather the nature of the activity that differentiated between high achievers 
and lower achievers. Junco’s (2013) study also underscored the importance of “how” 
students spent their time rather than “how much.” 
  Some studies tried to explore some of the reasons that lead to the negative impact 
of social media, especially on academic achievement. One of the more researched causes 
is the multi-tasking phenomenon and the affordance of the social media that distract 
students from their studies (e.g., Krischner and Karpinski, 2010). Whereas many of the 
studies suggest that it is this ubiquitous connectivity to friends and the world beyond 
academics that are the reason for distraction, other studies suggests that social media is a 
venue for students to vent about their negative feelings (e.g., Fogel & Nutter-Upham, 
2011; Michikyan et al, 2015) and an excuse to procrastinate about completing tasks that 
they dislike. 
  Other research attempted at finding variables that might be related to social media 
and academic achievement. Some of the variables explored were time spend on social 
media, gender, status, and discipline. Gender and time spent on Facebook, and academic 
status emerged as significant variables in Boogart (2016). Julia et al. (2015) suggest that 
the influence of social media might dramatically vary by the discipline students are 
pursuing. As manifested from the section on gender and social media above, the 
variations in how males and females use the tools imply that there might also be 
differences in how students use it for educational purposes.  
  Putting Blogging and Wikis aside, the literature implies that social media mostly 
had a negative impact on students’ academic performance. Some exceptions to that are 
studies that imply that the influence of social media might vary from one student to the 
other (e.g., Camilia et al., 2013; Wodzicki et al, 2012). Other studies suggested that we 
might need to determine what kind of performance we are referring to and that the results 
might vary by how we measure impact (e.g., Rambe, 2012; Junko et al., 2011). The high 
level of adoption of social media by young Egyptians on a daily basis, and as tool for 
awareness raising. Knowledge creation and mobilization during the 2011 revolution 
portrays it a tremendous power as a catalyst for change that requires further deliberation 
  
28 
 
and examination, rather than uninformed rejection. According to both theories mentioned 
above students obviously can be the masters of their usage, and the connectivity social 
media afford have great potential for different forms of learning.

Research Methods  
1) Research Design 
            The research employed a mixed methods “Explanatory Sequential Design” to 
collect both quantitative and qualitative data. According to Creswell (2012), “a mixed 
methods research design is a procedure for collecting, analyzing, and mixing both 
quantitative and qualitative methods in a single study or a series of studies to understand 
a research problem” (p. 535). Moreover, according to Creswell (2012), “The rationale for 
this approach is that the quantitative data and results provide a general picture of the 
research problem; more analysis, specifically through qualitative data collection, is 
needed to refine, extend, or explain the general picture.” (p.543). Following the 
explanatory sequential design quantitative and qualitative data were collected 
sequentially, using an adopted survey, as well as three focus groups for 15 students from 
the research sample. Both data sets were analyzed separately and the qualitative findings 
helped in explaining and elaborating on the quantitative results. “This design also 
captures the best of both quantitative and qualitative data—to obtain quantitative results 
from a population in the first phase, and then refine or elaborate these findings through an 
in-depth qualitative exploration in the second phase” ”(Creswell, 2012, p.543). 
2) The Context 
The research focuses on the undergraduate students of Nile University in Cairo. Nile 
University (NU) is a research institution of learning committed to excellence in education 
and research. It was officially inaugurated in January 2007 as a national (Ahleya), non-
governmental and non-profit university. Nile University’s aim is to be one of the leaders 
in technology and business education in Egypt and the Middle East/North Africa 
(MENA) region. Its business and technology-based programs and research centers are 
designed to address critical areas of vital importance to the economic growth and 
prosperity of the people of Egypt and the region and to engage in cutting edge applied 
research (What is Nile University, 2017). 
Nile University offers a variety of diplomas, Masters and PhD programs as well 
as a strategic set of undergraduate programs in selected areas, Nile University’s focus is 
  
30 
 
mainly on the science majors. It also offers executive education and professional 
development programs. (What is Nile University, 2017). 
 
3) Population of the Study 
The population in this research is all the registered undergraduate students in Nile 
University. The total population includes 884 registered undergraduate students 
majored in Computer Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electronics and 
Communication Engineering, Computer Engineering, Industrial Engineering, 
Mechanical Engineering and Business Administration). The numbers and 
percentages of all registered undergraduate students was obtained through the 
Student Affairs Office, classified by major and gender, outlined in Table 3.1 
below. The aim for obtaining this information was to evaluate the 
representativeness of the sample of students participating in the study of Nile 
University’s undergraduate population.

4) Sampling 
For the quantitative component of this study, and in order to get a representative 
sample covering different characteristics such as: gender, academic status, and 
major, the purposeful sampling technique was applied. The researcher chose the 
English language classes because such classes include a huge number of students 
with different academic statuses and majors. The researcher distributed the survey 
during the English language classes after getting the English department consent. 
The English department in Nile University offers 5 levels of English proficiency 
courses, which range from the elementary to the advanced levels. Passing all five 
levels is required for the undergraduate students to be able to graduate. It was 
expected that students enrolled in these classes would be representative of the 
population. To gather the qualitative data for this study, the researcher sent an 
email to 15 students from the students who completed the survey asking them to 
attend the focus group. The researcher chose 5 students from those who 
mentioned that the social media use has affected their academic performance 
positively and 5 from those who mentioned that the social media use has affected 
their academic performance negatively, and five from those who mentioned that 
the social media use have no effect on their academic performance. Participation 
in this study was voluntary for all data collection methods. 
 
5) Participants 
The Participants in this study were 424 undergraduate students. Two participants 
failed to respond to all items so their data was not included in the analysis, thus 
the valid responses were 422. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 23. After 
comparing the demographics of the sample with the demographics of the 
population, the researcher revealed that the sample is representative in terms of 
gender and academic major.  The demographics of participants are outlined in the 
below 3 tables.

For the qualitative research method, a total of fifteen students attended the focus groups, 
an email was sent to the students who answered a specific question about the social 
media effect on their academic performance from the survey inviting them to attend the 
focus groups. The researcher chose five from each of the 3 groups: those who responded 
that social media had a positive influence on their performance, and those who responded 
that social media had a negative influence, and those who are undecided about whether it 
had a positive or negative impact on their performance. Table 3.5 outlines their 
demographics each student have a code, the coding system is explained in the data 
collection section.

6) Research Instrument 
The quantitative instrument for this study is a survey.  Ohaja (2003) defines a 
survey as the study of the characteristics of a sample through questioning, which 
enables the researcher to make generalizations concerning the population of 
his/her study. This design is considered appropriate because it enables the 
researcher to establish the range and distribution of some social characteristics, 
and to discover how these characteristics may be related to certain behavior 
patterns or attitudes (Zurmuehlin, 1981).   
The researcher adapts Peter Osharive’s (2015) Social Media and Academic 
Performance of Students Questionnaire (SMAAPOS) (Appendix 1).The 
researcher checked the reliability of the research instrument which was 
determined by Peter Osharive (2015) using a split half test using the odd and even 
numbered items to form the two halves. The two halves were administered to a 
sample of students from a university not selected for the main study. The Pearson 
Correlation Coefficient was used to determine the reliability of the instrument. A 
co-efficient value of 0.65 indicated that the research instrument was reliable 
  
35 
 
(Osharive,2015) The researcher chose this survey because it was the only 
available survey that is addressing the same population (undergraduate students), 
moreover, it was also made to test the relationship between the social media 
networks usage and the student’s academic performance. In light of those two 
reasons, the researcher thought that using this instrument will give adequate 
answers to the research questions. However, this tool was used in Nigeria. Thus, 
the researcher added and edited some questions to make sure that the 
questionnaire would fit in the Egyptian context.  
 The questionnaire is divided into two sections (A and B). Section A 
consists of 7 questions and elicits demographic information. Section B consists of 
22 likert-scale questions that elicited information about the students use of social 
media: Strongly Agree (SA), Agree (A), Neutral (N), Disagree (D) and Strongly 
Disagree (SD) (Osharive, 2015) and one open-ended question at the end of the 
questionnaire asking them if they have any further comments on the impact of 
social media on your academics.  
As for the qualitative research instrument, the researcher employed focus groups. 
As per Creswell (2012), “Focus groups can be used to collect shared 
understanding from several individuals as well as to get views from specific 
people” (p.384) . The researcher selected 10 questions (Appendix 5) from the 
survey and rephrased them in order to better understand and interpret some 
answers in more depth.  The questions varied slightly as that the focus group 
solicited the input of students who report that social media had a positive 
influence on their performance, a negative influence, and those who didn’t 
mentioned that social media has no impact on their performance.  
7) Pilot Study 
The survey was tested on 50 students from a representative sample of potential 
participants. The pilot was conducted for the intentions of timing the length of the 
survey per participant, to check the feasibility of conducting the survey on 
campus, and to test the clarity of the items of the survey. The pilot study showed 
that the items of the survey were clear and did not cause any confusion, the 
response and completion rate of the pilot survey was 100% – all the 50 
  
36 
 
participants responded and completed the survey. There were no logistical 
problems at all in conducting the pilot study. Data collected from the pilot study 
was not included in the results. 
  
8) Reliability and Validity of the Instrument 
The reliability and validity of the research instrument was determined. The 
Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used to determine the reliability of the 
instrument. A co-efficient value of 0.68 indicated that the research instrument was 
relatively reliable. According to (Taber, 2017) the range of a reasonable reliability 
is between 0.67 and 0.87. 
 
9) Data Collection and Analysis Procedures 
9.1. Approvals. 
The researcher has taken the below approvals before collecting data: 
a) Institutional review board (IRB) (Appendix2) 
b) Central Agency for Public Mobilization and statistics (CAPMAS) 
(Appendix3) 
 
9.2. Data Collection Procedures. 
For the quantitative data collection, the researcher has created the questionnaire in 
Google Forms and used it to collect data. Data collection took place on Nile 
University campus during the English classes. The questionnaire link was sent to 
the class attendees through MOODLE – the official course management system 
used at the university; students were familiar with it. The researcher solicited the 
input of students in 28 different English classes from all levels. At the beginning 
of each class the researcher would introduce the survey, and assure the students 
that this survey is anonymous. As for the qualitative data collection, after 
obtaining the IRB approval to do this follow up, an email was sent to the 
participants inviting them to attend the focus group sessions on Nile University 
campus. 
 
  
37 
 
9.3. Data Analysis. 
The collected quantitative data were scored, coded and inserted into SPSS, and 
were analyzed using multiple statistical descriptive and inferential statistical tests 
based on the research question and the nature of the data. to be analyzed using 
frequency tables, crosstabs, Anovas, post hocs and t-tests. 
Eighty students responded to the open-ended question of the survey soliciting 
additional comments on the topic of social media with reference to their 
performance. Based on the initial reading of students’ contributions the responses 
were classified into two categories: informative results category (62.5%) and 
uninformative results category (37.5%). The uninformative results category 
consisted of thank you notes, as for the informative results category, it consisted 
of different point of views about social media use. The researcher read the 
answers thoroughly in attempt to formulate any themes, however there were no 
themes due to the short and different answers.  
 As for the qualitative data, the researcher has adopted the “bottom 
up” approach in analyzing the data. According to Creswell (2012) “This analysis 
initially consists of developing a general sense of the data, and then coding 
description and themes about the central phenomenon” (p.237). Therefore, focus 
groups discussions were audio-recorded then transcribed. After data transcription, 
the researcher started to highlight influential quotes that are relevant to the 
research questions objectives which led to themes formulation that are related to 
the research questions. Students who attended the focus groups were given codes 
based on the focus group number and the number of participants in each group, 
for example ( G1,S1) (See Figure 1)

Table 3.6 shows that the majority of the participants have chosen the categories 
“agree to strongly agree” for two statements. For instance, the percentage of “I make 
use of WhatsApp or alternatives to share information with my classmates” is (72.5%), 
“We have a social media group for some of my courses” is (74.1%). About 16% of 
students disagreed or strongly disagreed with the first statement and 12% with the 
second, whereas the rest were neutral. The qualitative results implies that the majority 
of the students use social media networks as a communication platform due to the 
various number of available features and benefits. For example, they can reach each 
other easily and quickly via WhatsApp groups whether by texting, voice notes or video 
calls. 
Almost half of the students agreed to strongly agreed with the following 
statements: “I follow the latest developments in my field through social media” 
(51.9%);”Sometimes I use social media to understand what I have been taught in class” 
(48.2%); and “I have to use social media extensively because most of my course 
assignments/projects are in the forms of blogs/online presentations” (45.5%). For the 
first statement, almost 25% disagreed and the rest were neutral. The same trend was 
  
42 
 
noticed for the second statement. For the third statement, disagreement was slightly 
lower, and those who chose the “neutral” choice reached 30 percent.  The results of the 
last statement slightly conflict with those of another statement, “Social media is 
encouraged by professors as part of class assignments”, to which only about 30% of 
students agreed or strongly agreed. About 25 percent disagreed and the rest were 
neutral. The latter results mirrored those of the statement “I engage in academic 
discussions on social media platforms” to which 32.5% agreed or strongly agreed. 
About 20% of students disagreed to this latter statement, and about 37% were neutral. 
Also with reference to academic forums via social media, only 18.3% of students 
reported that “Engaging in academic forums on social media confuses me”. Over 43% 
disagreed with that statement and about 39% were neutral. These results are mostly 
good, partially bad. In the qualitative results students talked about the lack of 
credibility or the internet yet mentioned that it often opens links that are lead you to 
interesting ideas even if they are not credible. Also it might be based on the results that 
students in some subject rely more on data from the internet especially if they are using 
social media as a data collection instrument such as in marketing. The qualitative 
results also show that business students are more likely to opt for social media for 
academic reference whereas engineering do not find social media interesting as a 
source of knowledge 
On the contrary, table 3.6 shows that the minority of participants selected the 
categories “agree to strongly agree” on five statements, such as “I engage in academic 
discussions on social media platforms” amounted (32.5%), ”I solely rely on 
information gotten from social media to do my assignments without consulting other 
sources” is (23.5%), ”Engaging in academic forums on social media confuses me” is 
(18.3%), “Social media is encouraged by professors as part of class assignments” is 
(30.6%) and ”I communicate with the professor through social media” counts 
(36.7%).   
It was also noted that the table demonstrates that a large number of participants 
picked out the categories “disagree to strongly disagree” for two statements: “I solely 
rely on information gotten from social media to do my assignments without consulting 
  
43 
 
other sources” (50.9%).  Only about 25% agreed with this statement, and the rest of the 
students opted for the neutral choice.   
Moreover, according to the last open question asking them if they want to leave 
a comment about social media, some students have mentioned that using social media 
for academic related purposes is easier for them. A senior engineering student gave an 
example of using social media for academic purposes as follows: 
I think it is good if you make the most use of it in a proper way.  In my 
last university we used to make a group for each subject and ask the 
doctor to share the slides information and any notes with us, having the 
ability of discussing these posts as students and sharing and 
commenting brings us more together.  It is also very important when 
you are posting important things for events or opportunities 
Whereas a junior business student explained” I think if each course in the 
university has a group on Facebook this will help us as a student’s so much to be aware 
of everything happens in this course”. 
 
Question 2 
2.  How do students perceive the impact of social media on their academic 
engagement and performance? 
Eleven statements sought to investigate how the undergraduate students of Nile 
University perceive the impact of social media on their academic performance. Table 
3.7 below depicts how they perceive the effect of social media on their academic 
performance.

A high proportion from the participants in Table 3.7 selected the categories 
“disagree” and “strongly disagree”. For instance, the percentage of “Social media have 
impacted my GPA negatively” is (47.4%), “Social media have impacted my GPA 
positively” is 26.6%. For the first statement, 25.4% agreed and 27.3% were neutral. As 
for the second statement, 26.6% agreed and 42.2% were neutral. It was noticed that a 
high percentage of students disagreed about the negative impact of social media on 
their academic performance and a low percentage of students disagreed about the 
positive impact of social media on their academic performance. However, a high 
percentage of students were neutral about the second statement and a low percentage of 
students were neutral about the first statement. The qualitative results show different 
  
46 
 
opinions from those who are not academically affected by social media and those who 
are affected positively and negatively. 
Almost half of the students disagreed or strongly disagreed with the following 
statements: “I will not perform well in my academics even if I stop using social media” 
(43%), “My unlimited access to social media through my cell phone distracts me in 
class” (55.3%). For the first statement, 27.7% agreed and the rest were neutral. The 
same trend was noticed for the second statement.  
On the other hand, table 3.7 shows that almost half of the students were within 
the categories “agree” to “strongly agree” for instance, the percentage of “The hours I 
spend online on social media are more than the hours I spend reading university stated 
content” is (55.2%), “Once I interrupt my study time with social media, I lose 
concentration” is (50.2%); and “Social media has improved my communication skills” 
(52.4%). For the first statement, 23% disagreed and the rest were neutral. The same 
trend was noticed for the second statement. For the third statement, disagreement was 
slightly lower, and those who chose the “neutral” choice reached almost 22%.  
It was also noted that table 3.7 demonstrates that a small number of students 
picked out the categories “agree to strongly agree” to three statements with reference to 
social media negative effects: 30% of students reported that “The time I spend online 
on social networks takes away from my time studying”, 36.7% reported that “Online 
social networks distract me from my studies”; and 22.3% reported that “Social media 
has negatively impacted my writing skill”. For the first two statements, almost 30% 
disagreed and the rest where neutral. For the third statement, disagreement was higher, 
it reached (59.9%) and the rest were neutral. 
 
Question 3 
What is the relationship between academic effort, academic performance and use 
of social media? 
A.      Number of hours (social media) 
B.      Number of hours spent studying 
C.      GPA 
  
47 
 
 
For the purpose of this question the numbers of hours of study per week were used to 
determine academic effort, GPA was used as an indicator of academic performance, and 
number of hours students reported spending on social media per day were used as a 
measure of “use of social media”. 
The below three tables show the categorization of the three variables: GPA, number of 
study hours per week and number of hours on social media per day.

Measures of central tendency were computed to summarize the data for the three 
variables. The following are the results of this analysis for the three variables; (GPA) 
N=418, M=3.02, SD=0.66, (Hours spend studying per week) N=422, M=11.69, SD=8.79, 
(Hours spent on social media per day) N=421, M=6.711, SD=5.154.”. The above data 
demonstrates that the average hours spent on social media is more than the average hours 
spend studying; given that the hours spent on social media is by day and the hours spent 
studying is by week it is not expected to influence the statistical analysis. 
Correlation analyses in the below table was used to examine if there is a significant 
relationship between the three variables GPA, number of study hours and number of 
hours on social media.

Results indicated that there is a significant, though weak, positive relationship between 
GPA and hours of study, r = .113, n= 418, p =.021; and a significant, though weak, 
negative correlation between number of hours spent on social media and GPA, r = -.155, 
n=417, p=.002. The results suggest that an increase in the number of hours studying is 
associated with a higher GPA, which an increase in the number of hours spent on social 
media is associated with a lower GPA. However, there is no significant relationship 
between number of hours on social media and number of hours studying.  
 
Question 4 
  
51 
 
Is there a relationship between gender, academic status, and academic major and: 
1) use of social media, and 2) perception of the impact of social media on academic 
engagement? 
In order to answer this question, the researcher has divided the answer under three themes 
and examined each theme with three variables: gender, academic status, and academic 
major. The three themes are: Engagement in academically related social media activities, 
Perception of the impact of social media on academic engagement, and how much time 
they spend on social media. Due to large amount of data collected, only significant results 
will be presented below whereas the rest of the results are in the appendices.  
1) Engagement in Academically Related Social Media Activities: 
a) Gender. 
A cross tabulation sought to investigate the frequency distribution of the gender variable, 
followed by a chi square test to indicate if there is any significant relationship between 
engagement in academically related social media activities and gender.

The above figure shows that 48.6% males are within the categories agree to strongly 
agree about using social media to understand what they have took in class. Similarly, 
47% of the females are also within the categories agree to strongly agree about the same 
statement. Overall, the results suggest that both males and females have the same attitude 
about using social media to understand what they were taught in class. However, the 
extreme choices are more prominent. Females strongly agree at a higher percentage that 
they use social media to learn in class, which male more strongly disagree that they do 
not use it to understand.

Figure 3 Academic status and engagement in academically related social media activities 
 The above figure shows that (72.68%) sophomore are within the categories agree to 
strongly agree of having a social media group for some of their courses. the same trend 
was noticed with the freshmen. For the juniors and seniors, they have reported lower 
percentages. However, the extreme choices are more prominent. Sophomores strongly 
agree at higher percentages that they have social media group for some of their courses, 
which freshman more strongly disagree that they do not have such groups. The 
qualitative results show that freshman students don’t use social media in academically 
related purposes compared to the other academic status due to their unknowingness of 
how things will go in the university, then they get caught up with the trend.

Figure 4 Frequency distribution of the academic major variable 
Figure 4 shows that the majority of the students who chose disagree to strongly disagree 
for solely relying on social media in doing their assignments are from the engineering 
majors. For instance, the percentage of computer engineering students who disagreed is 
(71.43%) and only 17.77% agreed and the rest were neutral. The same trend was noticed 
for all engineering majors except civil engineering. The percentage of civil engineering 
students who disagreed with the statement is lower than the rest of the engineering 
majors. On the other hand, the percentage of business administration and civil 
engineering students who opted agree to strongly agree is almost the same and higher 
than the rest of the majors. The qualitative results spectacle  that business students are 
more likely to opt for social media for academic reference whereas engineering do not 
find social media interesting as a source of knowledge.

Figure 6 shows that more than 50% of all the majors selected agree to strongly agree for 
having a social media groups for some of the courses. However, the extreme choices are 
more prominent. Industrial engineering students strongly agree at a higher percentage 
than the other majors. Qualitative results indicate that almost all the students have a 
social media group for at least one of their courses. The qualitative results also 
demonstrate that this high percentage doesn’t mean that all students prefer having a social 
media group for their courses. However, sometimes they are forced to join to keep up 
with the course updates, given that as mentioned before more than half the students use 
social media platforms in discussing course related content.

(1, N = 422) = 37.535, p = .039. For instance, civil engineering students reported 
the highest percentage of the students who agreed on the statement. 
2) Perception of the Impact of Social Media on Academic Engagement: 
To examine whether students’ perception of the impact of social media differed among 
students’ based on gender, academic status or academic major: the researcher averaged 
the results of 10 statements:  (q30, q23, q21, q20, q13, q12, 11, 10) and two of the ten 
items were reversed: q 16, and q29.   
a) Gender: 
An independent samples t-test was run to determine if there were differences in the 
perception of the impact of social media on academic engagement between males and 
females. The results indicated that there is no significance t (420) = -.066, p=.947 
between gender and the perception of the impact of social media on academic 
engagement.  
b) Academic Status: 
Analysis of variance was conducted to determine if there was a relation between the 
perception of the impact of social media on academic engagement and the students’ 
academic status. The results indicated that there is a significant difference between the 
four different groups at the p<.05 level for the three conditions [F (3,418) = 3.91, 
p=.009]. Post hoc analysis indicated that there is a difference between juniors and 
sophomores SRA (p =.005). The results shows that juniors perceive positive impact of 
social media on their academic engagement more than the sophomores do as outlined in 
the below multiple comparisons table.

⃰The mean difference is significant at the 0.05 level. 
Academic Major: 
Analysis of variance was conducted to determine if there was a relation between the 
perception of the impact of social media on academic engagement and the students’ 
academic major. The results indicated that there is no significant relationship between the 
two variables [F (6,415) = 1.279, p=.266]. 
3) How much time they spend on social media: 
To examine whether the time in which students spend on social media differed among 
students based on gender, academic status and academic major. The researcher have used 
the question about the time in which students spend on social media per day as the 
dependent variable and the gender, academic status and academic major as the three 
independent variables. 
a) Gender 
An independent samples t-test was run to determine if there were differences in the 
perception of the impact of social media on academic engagement between males and 
females. The results indicated that there is no significance in the scores between females 
(M=12.09, SD=8.14) and males (M=11.51, SD=9.09); t (420) =.625, p=.575 in the 
perception of the impact of social media on academic engagement. 
b) Academic Status: 
Analysis of variance was conducted to determine if there were differences in the time in 
which the students spend on social media per day and the students’ academic major. The 
  
62 
 
results indicated that there is no significant relationship between the two variables [F 
(3,417) =.408, p=.704].  The analysis of variance also shows that the mean average of 
time spent on social media daily by all the students is 10.88 hours a day. 
c) Academic Major: 
Analysis of variance was conducted to determine if there were differences in the time 
they which the students spend on social media and the students’ academic major. The 
results indicated that there is significant relationship between the two variables at the 
p<.05 level for the three conditions [F (6,414) = 2.26, p=.037]. A multiple comparison 
(Appendix 4) was conducted to determine which majors exactly differed in the amount of 
hours spent on social media and the comparison showed that there is a statistically 
significant difference between business administration and computer engineering students 
(p=.037). Business administration students spend more time on social media than the 
computer engineering students. 
Qualitative Results 
         The results show the different as well as the similar perspectives of Nile 
University students regarding how they perceive the social media effect on their 
academic performance, which will further explain the relationship between their social 
media usage and their academic performance. Results will also show to what extent the 
undergraduate students of Nile University are using social media in academic related 
purposes. Also, to what extent is the use and perception of social media differs between 
gender, academic statues and academic majors. Findings are displayed for each research 
question and the different themes under it. 
Question 1: The Use of Social Media in Academic Related Purposes 
 The first research question attempts to understand the reasons of social media use in 
academic related purposes in light of two themes and each theme has subthemes as 
outlines in figure 8 below. 
  
63 
 
 
Figure 8 the first research questions themes and subthemes 
The first theme discussion findings are aligned with the quantitative results, which show 
that more than (70%) of the students use social media to share information with their 
colleagues. The students’ responses reinforced that communication is one of the most 
advantages of using social media in academic related purposes due to its user-friendliness 
compared to the formal communication channels that they are not comfortable with. 
Some of the student’s statements about using social media as a communication platform 
were: “Throughout the university years I have learned that having a group on Facebook 
or WhatsApp is the best and easiest way for discussing any course content with my 
colleagues” (G2, S1) and “I prefer using WhatsApp and Facebook because my classmates 
can reach me at any time, you know nowadays we all have smart phones with internet” 
(G1, S1). However, it was noticed from the discussions that using social media as a mean 
of communication doesn’t necessarily  mean that the students prefer it, some students 
mentioned that they use social media in academic related purposes due to the difficulty of

using Moodle; the university formal channel of communication. Some of these statements 
were: “The university formal channels of communication is down most of the time, and 
it’s not user friendly at all it takes forever to initiate a chat with my classmates” (G1, S3) 
and “I have complained a lot about MOODLE (university channel) In addition, I don’t 
feel comfortable with the interface of the university formal channels” (G1, S5). 
 In the quantitative results, more than half of the students reported that they use social 
media to follow the latest developments in their field through social media. It was 
interpreted from the discussions that students preferred using social media networks such 
as YouTube and WordPress in following the latest developments in their field due to its 
ingeniousness as was mentioned by (G3, S2) “it’s more fun and creative to use YouTube 
and Facebook rather than using the formal dull channel of communication Moodle”  
As for the second theme, which discusses the disadvantages of social media use in 
academic related purposes. The discussions with the three groups show that students 
might use social media as a data collection instrument but they don’t depend on it due to 
its lack of credibility. The latter results mirrored the quantitative results, when only 9% of 
the students agreed that they can solely rely on information gotten from social media. 
Some of the interesting statements were: “I agree that social media networks are not 
credible but when I search for a topic it opens a lot of other links for me” (G1, S5) and: 
The main disadvantage that I see in using social media networks for related 
academic purposes is the lack of control of the content, sometimes I find very 
interesting data that I would like to use in my assignments but I don’t because I 
don’t know who said it and when and why, I feel that it’s not credible specially 
that anyone can post anything.  (G3, S5) 
 
The discussions demonstrate that social media use in academic related purposes distract 
some of the students. This opinion echoes the 18.30% who agreed that engaging in 
academic forums on social media confuses them, as was mentioned by (G2, S3) “I don’t 
feel at ease because I concentrate more when using hard copies of my studying material”. 
The discussion also demonstrates that a few numbers of students consider using social 
number in academic related purposes an invasion of their privacy, which emulates the 
  
65 
 
37.40% who disagreed on using social media to communicate with their professors. It 
was stated by (G2, S5): 
I feel uncomfortable in dealing with the professor or the TA from my social 
network profile; there are a lot of information about me that I would like to keep 
away from my professors and classmates. Social media should be for socializing 
and having fun only (G2, S5). 
Most of the students who were involved in the discussions had a similar opinions about 
the advantages and disadvantages of social media use in academic related purposes, 
where they all agree that social media is the most convenient communication platform to 
be used among students, however a few have reported that it is not preferable for them to 
use this platform in academic related purposes.   
Question 2: Perception of Social Media Effects on the Academic Performance 
Research question 2 attempts to understand how students perceive the effects of social 
media use on their academic performance. The three themes related to this question are: 
positive effects of social media on the academic performance, negative effects of social 
media on the academic performance and no effects of social media on the academic 
performance. The findings of this question demonstrated that each student perceive social 
media effects according to his/her use which aligns with the uses and gratification 
approach that the behavior of the social media consumers differs from one to one in 
interpreting and integrating social media into their lives.   
During the discussion of the positive effects of social media on the academic 
performance, the students revealed that they believe that their use of social media have a 
positive effects on their academic performance in a direct and indirect ways. For instance, 
it facilitates communication with their teacher assistants, it keeps them aware of any new 
course announcements, and sometimes they find internship opportunities through social 
media networks. As was mentioned by (G1, S3): 
I use to check the Facebook/WhatsApp group for any updates and announcements 
we even have the TAs of the courses on the group which is awesome. Also one of 
the most important social media channels is LinkedIn. It's really awesome and 
there students are able to enhance their career by reading great success stories and 
finding internships to enrich their hands on experiences (G1, S3) 
  
66 
 
Focus group has helped in clarifying the contradictory extreme responses of the 
quantitative results. For instance, the (60%) who disagreed that social media has 
negatively impacted their GPA and the (52%) who agreed that social media has improved 
their grade responses were explained in the above statement. 
 The discussion of the negative effects of social media on the academic 
performance with the students revealed a lot of similar answers. For instance, the whole 
group reported that distraction and social media addiction are the two main reasons for 
the negative effects. Interestingly, these results explain the 50.2% who agreed that they 
lose concentration when they are interrupted by social media during studying. Some of 
the very expressive statements were: 
Unfortunately I am addicted to social media, I have Facebook, WhatsApp, 
Instagram and YouTube on my cell phone and I can’t stop myself from checking 
the updates every couple of minutes. Therefore, using social media networks in 
any academic related purposes will end up by me distracted from whatever I’m 
doing by checking the updates (G2, S1). 
Every time I use social media especially Facebook to check the course group I get 
dragged to read my friends status and sometimes I engage in long conversations 
with my school friends and family members and out of a sudden I find myself 
wasted a couple of hours in nothing. I know that a lot of courses use social media 
for educational purposes; on the other hand distractions are all over the place. 
Starting from simple chats to new song hits and episodes of my favorite series that 
I watched 3 times before. I believe that less hours on the phone (engaged in social 
media) Equals too many advantages in life (G2, S3). 
 
Social media networks have impacted my writing skills and communication skills 
negatively, whenever I use social media to communicate with my colleagues or to 
post something I use to write using the franco-arab language because this is the 
most common used language on social media networks, even the TAs use it. 
Additionally, social media networks takes away from my studying time to the 
extent that I use to open the social networks apps (Facebook) during the class 
time, even if the class is interesting and the professor is good it’s just so tempting 
and as a young adult sitting in a class in University, I feel the urge to check my 
social media apps like Instagram every 10 minutes (G2, S2). 
There are also few students who admit that social media have both effects on their 
academic performance, as was mentioned by (G2, S4): 
  
67 
 
What can I say! Social media is a double edge weapon, I can’t deny its 
importance in my life; it helps me in socializing and connecting with my friends 
especially with my school friends and family members who travelled abroad. 
Social media also keeps me posted with the recent updates of everything going 
around us. But unfortunately it waste a lot of time, I remember that one day I 
stayed flipping between different social media networks for a whole day. So it 
definitely takes away from my studying time, mainly YouTube, it has negative 
impact on the way and time I dedicate for studying (G2, S4). 
Lastly, the discussion of the no effects of social media on the academic performance with 
the students revealed that some students believe that social media doesn’t have any 
negative nor positive effects on their academic performance, which mirrors the high 
proportion of students who picked neutral in most of the survey questions. It was 
interpreted from the students discussion that they were not affected by social media 
because they are aware of its disadvantages and because they know how to set priorities 
and control their time. Some of expressive statements were: 
 Social media as in (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram....etc.) doesn't affect me that 
much, I only use it for some purposes only. I open the social media apps that I 
have on my phone whenever I want to connect with my friends and I sometimes 
use it to search for something interesting for me, therefore, social media for me is 
a tool which means that I can use it whenever I want to. I am the one who is in 
control of social media not vice versa. I never felt the urge of checking my social 
media apps continuously; it really saddens me to see that most of the people don't 
know how to use social media in a good way (G3, S1). 
Social media networks has nothing to do with academic performance that is why 
it’s called SOCIAL media network, I guess that using such networks while 
studying cause distraction, that’s why we should be cautious and aware of the 
consequences of wasting our time. However, at the end it depends on the person, 
if one has the will to study he'll find a way (G3, S2). 
 
 Social Media helps me to relax from the stress caused by academics, but it 
doesn’t affect me in any way! In my opinion, there is no relationship between 
social media networks and studying, it is as if you are comparing the English 
courses with the science courses. I have my own priorities and I know when I can 
use social media to have some fun and when to study to get better grades. At the 
end of the day everyone does what he/she wants (G3, S5). 
After discussing the themes with three different groups, it was noticed that each group 
perceive social media effects on their academic performance according to their social 
media usage behavior. For instance, those who perceive social media effects positively 
  
68 
 
use it effectively, and those who perceive social media effects negatively use it 
extensively, and those who are not affected by social media, use it wisely. 
Question 3: The relationship between study hours and social media hours spent by 
students and its effect on their academic performance 
Research question 3 attempts to understand if there is a relationship between the number 
of hours spent studying and the number of hours spent on social media, and the academic 
performance of the students. Thus, there is one theme and three subthemes for this 
question. The theme is “The hours spent on social media” and the three sub themes are: 
positive relationship between the theme and the academic performance, negative 
relationship between the theme and the academic performance, and neutral relationship 
between the theme and the academic performance. 
Looking further into the three subthemes. Some students mentioned that the hours they 
spend on social media affects their academic performance in a good way “Whenever I 
attend a course I find myself dragged to join a WhatsApp group for the course, followed 
by a Facebook group for the same course and honestly speaking such groups benefit me a 
lot because we all share valuable information on it” (G1, S4). On the contrary, some 
students mentioned that the hours they spent on social media affects their academic 
performance in a negative way “ Social media takes away from my studying time, mainly 
YouTube, it has negative impact on the way and time I dedicate for studying” (G2, S4). 
However, some students mentioned that the hours that they spend on social media don’t 
have any effects on their academic performance, because they know how to organize 
their time and set their priorities “It really saddens me to see that most of the people don’t 
know how to use social media in a good way” (G3, S1). “There is no relationship 
between social media networks and studying” (G3, S5). Looking at the three different 
point of views, there is no consistency in any of the three opinions. Hence, it seems that 
there is no actual relationship between the spent hours on social media and academic 
performance if the student know how to set his priorities and manage his time in an 
effective way, which emulates the 34.10% who picked out the category neutral in the 
survey for the statement “The time I spend online on social networks takes away from my 
time studying”. 
  
69 
 
Question 4: The use and perception of social media According to different Academic 
Statues, Academic Majors and Gender 
Research question 4 attempts to understand the relationship between the students use and 
perception of social media use in academic related purposes and the different academic 
statues, academic majors and gender of the students. The three themes related to this 
question are: Students’ experience throughout their academic stages, students’ academic 
majors and social media use in academic related purposes, and gender differences in 
using social media in academic related purposes. 
Looking further into the first theme, which is the students’ experience throughout their 
academic stages. The discussions show that there are differences in the social media use 
in academic related purposes for the same student throughout his/her academic stages, as 
was mentioned by a senior student (G3, S1): 
I was literally addicted to social media and playing online games till my second 
semester when my GPA reached 1.98 and I was placed on probation. So I tried 
hardly to focus on my studies and I found out that when I stopped spending a lot 
of time on social media it really differed with me. By the way I am not saying that 
I have increased my studying time but not spending so much time on social media 
made me have more time for relaxation and practicing my hobbies. Therefore, as 
a senior, yes my attitude towards using social media networks have changed 
throughout the university years (G3, S1). 
Moreover, discussions also show that freshman students don’t use social media in 
academically related purposes extensively, however they use it more in socializing with 
their friends. These results mirror the quantitative section results about having a high 
percentage of freshman students who disagree of having a social media group for some of 
their classes. 
As for the second theme, which is students’ academic majors and social media use in 
academic related purposes. The discussions show that social media use in academic 
related purposes differed from a major to major. Engineering students vary greatly in 
answers on how long they spend on social media from: not know how long, to declaring a 
set number of hours that does not exceed 3, to saying that it’s only when it is 
academically needed. It was also interpreted from the discussions that engineering 
  
70 
 
students can’t use social media in academic related purposes due to the nature of their 
field of study. Some of the engineering students’ expressive statements were: 
For me I definitely use the internet in order to explore new information about my 
courses. But when it comes to social media, I only use it as a way of 
communication between me and my colleagues to discuss course related 
assignments. I can’t for example use Facebook to get information about heat 
transfer or thermodynamics course. I believe when it comes to academic related 
matters, social media is only a mean of communication (G1, S4). 
 
As engineering students I can’t by any mean use social media networks in any 
academic related purposes. We use the Egyptian knowledge bank and google 
scholar websites for academic related purposes the most. However, sometimes I 
find an interesting links on Facebook about an academic related topic to my 
studies (G1, S5) 
 
I hear my friends from the business major talking about their assignments; I get 
the impression that in some of the assignments they can depend on social media. 
For example, one of my friends used Facebook to do an assignment about the 
social media marketing techniques. I only use it to discuss course material with 
my classmates and the teaching assistants (G1, S3). 
On the contrary, unlike engineering students business administration students stated that 
they use social media for academic related purposes. Some of the business major 
students’ statements were: 
It’s easier for me to use social media in academic related purposes because most 
of my course work is about conducting surveys (which I can easily do it via social 
media networks). Also, I use social media a lot in the courses that are related to 
mass communication, supply chain and marketing courses. I think that the nature 
of my major allows me to utilize social media. However, I think that engineering 
students work in labs and the nature of their major is more practical than ours 
(G1, S1). 
All students in the focus groups said that they use social media mostly for socialization, 
and less for academic purposes. However, the above statements show that there was a 
difference between businesses and engineering in how useful they regarded social media 
and how often they used it for academic purposes. On the other hand, Regardless of 
major, all regard social media as much easier to communicate since they are on it all the 
time. Also, the engineering students described Moodle as technically clunky, inefficient, 
  
71 
 
and not seamlessly integrated into their activities. Several students from both majors 
talked about the importance of regulating their usage of social media.  
As for the third and last theme, which is gender differences in using social media in 
academic related purposes. Both males and females reported they prefer using social 
media channels than the formal channels because social media channels is more 
accessible, user friendly and open part of their daily life. There is variation among the 
females usage of social media, most of them use it for activities around campus and to 
know more about colleagues. As for the males,  
There was a more deliberate shift to using it better for academic purposes and using it 
less for socializing.  
Discussion 
This study investigated the effect of social media usage on Nile university 
undergraduate students, the primary objective of this study was to examine if there is a 
relationship between social media usage and students’ major, academic status and gender, 
and to what extent are the students using social media in an academic related purposes 
and how are they perceiving the effect of their social media usage on their academic 
performance. 
Surprisingly, in this study the majority of the participants indicated using social 
media in academic related purposes such as: sharing information with classmates and 
having social media groups for some of the courses and following the latest 
developments in their field through social media. However, Alwagait (2015), Wodzicki, 
Schawmmlein & Moskluik (2012) and Raacke & Bonds-Raacke (2008) have shown that 
students were hardly interested in using social media networks for study related 
knowledge. The difference may be explained by the fact that the latest one of the 
mentioned studies was three years ago and according to Vorderer (2016) the use of social 
media is rapidly increasing especially among the younger generation, or what was 
mentioned by Sobaih, Moustafa,Ghandforoush & Khan (2016) that higher education 
students may use social media in academic purposes due to the lack of communication 
technology and poor infrastructure of most of the Egyptian academic institutions, or 
  
72 
 
because the mean of the participants GPA in this study is 3.02 out of 4.00 which may 
show that they are generally good students and according to ( Michikyan, 
Subrahmanyam, & Dennis, 2015) Students with low GPA are more active on Facebook. 
Yet, as was shown in the results the majority of the participants use social media in 
academic related purposes but they don’t solely rely on it which might show that the 
students are aware that social media is not a credible pool of information or the 
assignments are challenging enough. Moreover, the focus groups discussions show that 
the field of study plays an important role in this issue. For instance, engineering students 
find it difficult to use social Media in any academic related purposes. On the contrary, 
business students especially those who are majored in mass communication and 
marketing find using social media useful to their studies. 
The present study also shows that multitasking doesn’t affect the students’ 
academic performance and that for instance accessing social media networks using their 
cellphones inside a classroom or while studying doesn’t distract them. However, 
according to other studies Lau (2017) and Janssen, & Brumby (2010) have shown that 
media multitasking behavior is a predictor of a poor academic performance and that it 
affects the students’ concentration specially during studying. The difference may be 
explained by the fact that the majority of students in the current study use social media 
for academic related purposes, consequently, it doesn’t distract them from studying. 
However, it is helping them.  
Consistent with previous research (Tariq, Mehboob, Asf, & Khan, 2012; Boogart, 
2016; Michikyan, Subrahmanyam, & Dennis, 2015; Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010) which 
had proposed a negative impact of social media usage on the students’ academic 
performance. In the present study, the results indicated that there is a negative correlation 
between the time spent on social media and the students’ academic performance. On the 
other hand, the present study indicated that there is a positive correlation between study 
hours and academic performance and negative correlation between the time spent on 
social media and the time spent studying, consequently, the more students use social 
media the less they study and the lower their GPA gets. What is worrying is that more 
than half the population stated that the time they spend on social media is more than the 
  
73 
 
time they spend studying and that they lose concentration once their study is interrupted 
by social media. 
Ularo (2014) have empirically demonstrated that females are more interested in 
using social media than males. However, the present study obtained a different result, it 
shows that there is no difference between males and females in using social media but 
further it reveals that females use social media in academic related purposes more than 
males. Furthermore, the present study results demonstrated a relationship between the 
students’ academic status and the use of social media in academic related purposes, 
consistent with other research (Pempek, Yermolayeva & Calvert, 2009) freshmen are the 
least category from the students’ academic status in using social media in academically 
related purposes. However, they use social media for socializing more than the 
sophomores, juniors and seniors. Moreover, the present study shows that there is a 
difference between different majors in the social media use in academic related purposes, 
engineering students use social media for academic purposes more than business 
administration students. 
Conclusion and Recommendations 
This study aims to shed the light on the social media effects on the academic 
performance of university students in Egypt and aims to clarify to different stakeholders 
the relationship between the social media usage and academic performance and to 
harness full potential of social media. Interestingly, this study shows that there are three 
different students opinion of the social media effect on their academic performance, 
according to the survey analysis and the focus group discussions; the students are divided 
into three groups. The first group believes that social media have a positive effects on 
their academic performance, the second group believes that social media have a negative 
effect on their academic performance, and the third group believes that social media does 
not have any effects on their academic performance. As per the focus group discussions, 
each group has discussed how do they perceive this effect and why do they think that this 
effect take place. For instance, the positive effects group mentioned that using social 
media as a way of communication in discussing course related contents have a positive 
effect on their academic performance, the negative effects group mentioned that their 
  
74 
 
addiction to social media takes away from their studying time which have a negative 
effects on their academic performance, and the no effects group mentioned that social 
media have nothing to do with their academic performance and as long as they know how 
to control their time nothing will affect their academic performance. The discussion and 
the results show that the relationship between the social media use and the academic 
performance depends on the students’ usage of social media. This explains the negative 
correlation between the students’ academic GPA and the time they spend on social 
media, which can be addressed by increasing the students’ awareness about the social 
media addiction effects. Furthermore, the results of the present study show that the 
majority of the participants use social media for academic related purposes as a mean of 
communication, they use it connect with their colleagues in order to discuss class related 
contents. Higher education institutions in Egypt may utilize this fact in creating a semi-
formal social media networks to be monitored by teacher assistants to better assist the 
students and to insure the credibility of the exchanged information between students. 
Also, faculty might consider harnessing on this engagement with social media, and think 
of ways to creatively engage students with class content. Social media awareness for 
students is needed to address the social media addiction issue. Significant differences in 
the behavior of students from different academic majors and different academic status in 
perceiving and using social media emerged which might require further investigation. 
Also, using social media as a communication platform in discussing course related 
content falls with the development of communities of learners which is seemingly on 
high demand, this area might require further investigation. 
 
Limitations 
There are a number of limitations in this study that should be further addressed in the 
future. First, the survey was too long for the students to an extent that some students 
didn’t complete it out of boredom. Second, the survey was conducted during the English 
classes which made it difficult for students to use their cellphones in filling the survey 
due to internet network issues, future researchers should conduct the survey in a 
computer lab. Third, the number of female participants was quite low in the focus groups. 
  
75 
 
Fourth, the survey needs to be further refined and validated to accurately capture the 
conceptual dimensions of the phenomenon under study. Fifth, asking for the time spent 
on social media is general because the answers didn’t specify if the app is just open, 
whether they are socializing, or doing academically related study. Sixth, the neutral 
option in the survey in some way encouraged the students to choose it to avoid the effort 
of thinking and deciding.

Social media usage is one of the most common activities among children, adolescents, and emerging adults nowadays. It offers today’s youth a portal for entertainment and communication and it is becoming one of the main platforms for accessing information and news. This aggressive adoption of social media among the younger generation could be attributed to their up to date knowledge of and comfort with the latest technology and the convenient accessibility to these social networking tools (Vorderer, 2016). This study aims to shed the light on the social media effects on the academic performance of university students in Egypt and aims to clarify to different stakeholders the relationship between the social media usage and academic performance and to harness full potential of social media. This study examines the role of social media in students’ academic endeavors and ultimately their academic performance through their reported perceptions and reflections. It also examines factors that might influence the nature of this relationship, and its tentative impact on the academic performance of Nile University undergraduate students. An explanatory sequential mixed method approach is employed in order to get both quantitative and qualitative data, the responses of 442 Nile university undergraduate student were collected and were scored, coded and inserted into SPSS, and were analyzed using multiple statistical descriptive and inferential statistical tests based on the research question and the nature of the data to be analyzed using frequency tables, crosstabs, Anovas, post hocs and t-tests. The findings of the study explains the perception of Nile university students of social media effects on their academic performance, and to what extend do they use social media for academic related purposes, and it explores the effect of the different academic majors, academic statues and gender on the social media usage perception and usage. Significant differences in the behavior of students from different academic majors and different academic status in perceiving and using social media emerged which might require further investigation","['text', 'Social Media', 'Academic Performance']",disabled

Abstract
This chapter presents a range of viewpoints on the social responsibilities of the engi-
neering profession. These social responsibilities of the engineering profession are in 
many ways synonymous with macroethics. Analysis of the engineering codes of eth-
ics and educational requirements are used to support these arguments, and are com-
pared with the perceptions of engineering students and working engineers. The social 
responsibilities of engineers include human safety and environmental protection in 
engineering designs. But it may extend further to include pro bono work and consid-
erations of social justice issues. Research has found that perceptions of the professional 
social responsibilities of engineers vary across different countries/cultures, engineer-
ing disciplines (e.g., mechanical versus environmental engineers) and by gender. The 
impact of engineering education and broader college experiences on evolving notions 
of professional social responsibility will be described, in particular community engage-
ment. Concerns about decreasing commitment to socially responsible engineering 
among college students, a so-called “culture of disengagement” will be presented, as 
well of the interaction of students’ social goals for engineering and leaving engineering 
studies.

1. Introduction
Social responsibilities are a part of all professions. The profession of engineering is no dif-
ferent. However, there are a diversity of opinions within the engineering profession about 
what specifically these social responsibilities entail, differing among sub-disciplines within 
engineering and across different countries and cultures. The process by which an individual

develops their feelings toward their professional social responsibilities as engineers, and how 
these values change over time, have been examined. This chapter will highlight the array of 
opinions and recent research into these areas.
2. Social responsibilities of the engineering profession
The engineering profession has a variety of ethical responsibilities to society and the environ-
ment. This field of inquiry has recently been termed macroethics [1]. But these professional 
social responsibilities may be in tension with the business side of engineering [2]. The major-
ity of engineers work for businesses, whose primary motivation is often profit and corporate 
stockholders, rather than societal impacts. Luckily, this has begun to change based on move-
ment toward corporate social responsibility (CSR) and realizations that companies can thrive 
economically while considering social and environmental impacts (the triple bottom line). 
CSR means that companies commit to principles of accountability to community stakehold-
ers, customers, suppliers, employees, and investors. CSR often embraces ideas of sustainabil-
ity, including human rights and environmental issues, as well as a chain of responsibility and 
duty of care. Engineering-focused companies often make their commitments to CSR publicly 
available (e.g., Bechtel [3]).
The characterization of engineering as a profession is also somewhat in tension. Individual 
licensing of engineers promotes the notion of profession, but industrial exemptions in the 
licensing laws somewhat erode this independence from employers [4]. Zhu and Jesiek [5] also 
question whether engineering is a profession in China, based on the lack of an explicit ethical 
code. It becomes clear when exploring the engineering profession that it should not be viewed 
as homogeneous, but rather consider that there are distinct cultures in this regard among dif-
ferent sub-disciplines and among countries.
This section presents a few sub-topics related to social responsibility in engineering: human 
safety, environmental protection and sustainability, pro bono work, social justice, and diver-
sity. The extent to which these elements are included in professional codes of ethics, bodies 
of knowledge, and requirements for educating engineers are considered to reflect commonly 
held beliefs related to the social responsibilities of the engineering profession. Further, what 
a professor chooses to teach engineering students in regards to professional social respon-
sibility has been interpreted as endorsement of the relevance of the topic to the engineering 
profession. For some topics there is general agreement across engineering sub-disciplines and 
individuals, while other social responsibilities are being actively debated.
2.1. Human safety
Public trust in engineering requires that the profession considers its impacts on human safety. 
There is widespread consensus in the codes of ethics of engineering professional societies 
worldwide that engineering has a primary duty to protect public safety, health, and wel-
fare [6]. Engineering-related failures or problems that result in injuries or death are often 
Social Responsibility42
front-page news (e.g., levee failures in New Orleans, interstate bridge collapse in Minnesota, 
ignition switches in cars) [7, 8]. It is of concern that the accumulated impact of frequent news-
worthy incidents may over time erode public trust in engineering.
Although generally “bundled,” health, safety, and welfare each have particular nuances. 
Vesilind [9] notes that there may be instances when these three elements differ, both in fact 
and among the perceptions of various groups within the public. Further, the public should 
not be viewed as a monolith, but rather engineers need to be aware of “diverse publics” with 
different needs and goals [10, 11].
Health is generally characterized as being able to function physically without pain, and may 
also include mental soundness. Promoting health is a direct goal of biomedical engineer-
ing. Environmental and civil engineers are tasked with providing clean drinking water and 
preventing the spread of toxic chemicals via air, water, and soil. Chemical engineering is 
involved in manufacturing medicines, as well as pesticides and other chemicals that may 
have toxic effects. Thinking specifically about health-related issues is perhaps less prevalent 
in other engineering disciplines. One challenge is the uncertainty that surrounds what is in 
fact protective of human health, given incomplete toxicological information and difficulties 
evaluating chronic effects (e.g., cancer). Different countries have different paradigms regulat-
ing the development, distribution, and use of new chemicals with regards to the information 
that is required on human health effects, with some taking a more precautionary approach 
[12]. Further, US drinking water regulations take into account both human health and treat-
ment costs. Overall, engineers may disagree on what conditions sufficiently protect human 
health.
Safety is associated being protected from physical injuries or death, again considering risks. 
Thus, civil engineering infrastructure that will be safe in the face of hurricanes or earthquakes, 
construction engineering to protect on-site workers, mechanical engineering of cars to pro-
tect occupants during crashes, etc. Other engineering disciplines are also critically impor-
tant to safety but as sub-systems may garner less attention (such as software engineering 
for computer controls or electrical engineering). However, public safety broadly applies to 
all engineering disciplines. The International Education Association knowledge profile for a 
Washington Accord Program includes “comprehension of… the professional responsibility 
of an engineer to public safety” [13]. Disciplinary differences within engineering in the extent 
that students are taught about safety in their courses were found in a study of engineering 
educators; among ~1400 survey respondents (96% from institutions in the US), 44% taught 
engineering/computing students about safety in their courses. However, this varied from 76% 
in chemical engineering to 26% in computing [14]. Safety is included explicitly as a cognitive 
“cross-functional” outcome within the Chemical Engineering Body of Knowledge [15].
Welfare relates to overall well-being, potentially inclusive of happiness, health, material 
wealth, and feelings of security. Thus, welfare is more subjective than health or safety, and is 
correspondingly harder to measure. While protection of human or public welfare is a com-
mon statement in US codes of engineering ethics [16, 17], this term is not included in some 
international ethics codes [18–20]. The Australia code uses the term “wellbeing” in place of

43
welfare [18]. The Royal Academy of Engineering’s (RAE) Statement of Ethical Principles 
[20] includes “public good,” separate from the “health and safety” paramountcy clause. The 
Chemical Engineering Body of Knowledge [15] lists “concern for public welfare” among its 
affective domain outcomes. It is clear that engineers may have different notions of welfare 
than individuals within the public. Vesilind [9] gives the examples of engineers reducing 
speed limits on highways to 55 miles per hour to provide increased safety, but having the 
majority of the public believe their overall welfare was better served by higher limits that 
enabled them to reach their destinations more efficiently.
There has been a recent debate about how engineers can best serve this most basic mandate to 
protect human health and safety. One environmental scientist/engineer, Sedlak, accused oth-
ers of “crossing the line” from dispassionate researcher to being activists [7]. Sedlak (trained 
as an environmental scientist, but a professor of civil and environmental engineering for over 
20 years) called into question Prof. Marc Edwards (MS/PhD civil engineering) and his involve-
ment in the Flint, Michigan, lead crisis, and Daniel Carder (BS/MS mechanical engineering) 
who helped expose the Volkswagen emission problem. Edwards and Carder likely perceived 
it as their social responsibility as engineers to uphold the preeminent requirement to pro-
tect human health and safety [21, 22], and acted in compliance with the engineering codes 
of ethics to expose ethical wrong-doing (e.g., ASCE Canon 1d [17]). In response to Sedlak’s 
editorial, a number of individuals shared differing views on the professional responsibilities 
of environmental engineering and science as related to the public [23–28]. There are perhaps 
differences in the social responsibilities of engineers and scientists, and the extent to which 
individuals identify with these disciplines ([24] written by a licensed professional engineer, 
[36] a Board Certified Environmental Engineer, [25, 27] members of the National Academy of 
Engineers, [23, 25, 28] degrees in chemistry). An individual’s personal identity with respect to 
their profession may be significant in how they perceive their social responsibilities.
2.2. Environment and sustainability
Engineering codes of ethics include environmental protection among professional social 
responsibilities (Table 1), with the exception of some specialized sub-disciplines (biomedi-
cal and aerospace engineering). “Comprehension of the impacts of engineering activity: … 
environmental” is one of the knowledge outcomes of a Washington Accord Program [13]. 
Environmental considerations in the engineering design process have also been explicitly 
required for accredited engineering degrees under ABET (Criterion 3, Outcome 2 [36]). Despite 
widespread inclusion in codes of ethics and professional education requirements, environ-
mental protection issues do not appear to be an equally prevalent focus of different disciplines 
within engineering. In a study of engineering educators, an average of 32% of the ~1400 sur-
vey respondents taught engineering/computing students about environmental issues, ranging 
from a high of 76% in environmental engineering to a low of 6% in computing [14]. Among 180 
engineering educators in the study by Romkey [37], the average implementation of “I encour-
age students to consider the potential environmental impact of technology” was 2.49 (where 
2 = sometimes and 3 = often on a 1–4 scale). Internationally, commitments to environmental 
protection are generally considered to be somewhat stronger in the EU versus the US.
Social Responsibility44
Engineers’ social responsibility for environmental protection may originate from different eth-
ical frameworks [38]. From an anthropocentric framework, one may simply understand that 
preservation of the environment is ultimately self-preservation for human life. Alternatively, 
from a biocentric perspective one may recognize the intrinsic right to life of all organisms on 
the planet. The environment and ecology may be viewed to have distinct value, beyond that 
of maintaining human existence.
A more limited sub-group of countries and engineering disciplines include sustainability 
and/or sustainable development within their code of ethics (Table 1). Australia’s code shows 
a commitment to sustainability in the first sentence of the preamble statement, “use of knowl-
edge and skills for the benefit of the community to create engineering solutions for a sustain-
able future,” and “promote sustainability” is one of the four key statements of ethical practice 
[18]. In fact, the mandate to protect the “health, safety and wellbeing of the community” is 
placed under the heading of promoting sustainability. Sustainability knowledge or abili-
ties are included as stand-alone outcomes within the bodies of knowledge for US chemical, 
civil, environmental, and professional engineers [15, 39–41]. Sustainable design and develop-
ment as a social responsibility of engineers has been endorsed by many scholars around the 
globe [42–45].
One issue may be the lack of consensus on the meaning of the term sustainability or sustainable 
development. In general, sustainability includes considerations of both current conditions and 
future generations, crossing environmental, societal, and economic elements. Sustainability

is included in the educational requirements for engineers under the Washington Accord 
outcomes [13]. In contrast, sustainability is not explicitly required in engineering education 
under ABET, which accredits the majority of the programs in the US and additional pro-
grams across 30 countries. Sustainability is mentioned as a potential consideration in the engi-
neering design process under both the old ABET EC2000 criteria and the new requirements 
[36, 46]. The new requirements do include considerations of “global, economic, environmental, 
and societal contexts” within the ethics outcome, but these considerations might be primarily 
immediate versus long term. Interestingly, more faculty indicated that they teach engineer-
ing/computing students about sustainability (42%) as compared to environmental impacts 
(32%), ranging from 74% in environmental engineering to 15% in biomedical engineering [14].
2.3. Pro bono
The idea of pro bono work is that professions should donate some of their technical expertise 
to individuals or organizations unable to pay for those services. This can be providing services 
for free or at a reduced rate. While this is commonplace in professions such a law and medi-
cine [47], the idea just seems to be starting to grow in engineering and is by no means uni-
versal [6]. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) first approved a policy statement 
on pro bono services in 1996 [48], encouraging engineers as individuals to provide services to 
charitable causes and in emergency situations; however, its real purpose appears directed at 
liability issues and indemnification. The National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) 
has a policy statement pertaining to liability of “good samaritans” who volunteer their engi-
neering services upon request in times of crisis [49].
Within the codes of ethics for engineering, hints of commitment to pro bono service can be 
found. The NSPE code [16] states that “Engineers are encouraged to participate in civic affairs; 
career guidance for youths; and work for the advancement of the safety, health, and well-
being of their community”; a similar statement is found in [31]. The ASCE code [17] states that 
“engineers should seek opportunities to be of constructive service in civic affairs and work 
for…their communities.” However, the mandate for pro bono activity is unclear.
Riley and Lambrinidou [11] suggest that pro bono service should comprise at least 5% of the 
employed hours of engineers. Interviews with working engineers found that some engineer-
ing companies allow donating standard work hours to engineering service, such as to groups 
like Engineers Without Borders (EWB)-USA [50]. Moulton [51] asserts, “An enormous amount 
of software development/support is done at low or no cost, for example, public help forums 
and much of the work toward Open Source/Linux/GNU etc.” (p. 334).
In a study of pro bono engineering in Australia in 2011 [52], a high demand for pro bono 
engineering, reasons for engaging in pro bono activities, benefits from pro bono activities, and 
challenges were documented. A sense of professional responsibility was identified among 
the motivations for participating in pro bono activities in engineering. While providing rich 
information and detailed case studies, the research left unanswered questions such as what 
percentage of engineering companies or individuals engage in pro bono activities, and to 
what extent (hours per year).
Social Responsibility46
In a small study (methods described in [8]), working engineers were asked in a survey to rate 
their agreement with the statement “Engineering firms should take on some pro bono work.” 
Among the 465 respondents, 12% disagreed, 21% were neutral, and 68% agreed; 49% of the 
survey respondents had recently graduated (within 1 to 2 years) with an engineering degree 
from a US institution and 27% of the respondents were members of EWB-USA. Differences in 
opinions were found based on gender (females higher average agreement), discipline (environ-
mental higher agreement than mechanical), and years since earned Bachelor’s degree (higher 
agreement for those who earned degree 6 or more years prior). By comparison, responses 
from US engineering students (n = 4191, 17 institutions, all ranks and majors, 2011–2014) to 
the same question were: 11% disagree, 34% neutral, 55% agree (Bielefeldt unpublished data, 
combined from studies described in [53–55]). Thus, among both engineering students and 
professionals the majority agreed to some extent that engineering firms should take on pro 
bono work.
In Australia, the University of Technology Sydney studied the attitudes of their students 
toward pro bono engineering. Based on a report that students were required to submit after 
their first internship, it was found that: 20% poorly engaged with the pro bono aspect of the 
assignment, 10% had not considered pro bono before, 10% acknowledged little knowledge 
of pro bono in engineering, 30% focused on what they could get out of pro bono work, 20% 
indicated they might engage in pro bono work in the future, and only 10% showed a clear 
intention to be involved in pro bono work [51].
Engineering service groups comprised of volunteers are becoming more popular. A prime 
example is EWB-USA which works to help meet the basic needs of global communities. In 
2015, EWB-USA reported 16,800 members in 288 chapters [56]. These chapters include both 
student chapters (typically affiliated with a university or college) and professional chapters. 
This is a large number of engineering students/ professionals engaged in donating their 
time to help others through engineering. EWB International (EWB-I) has 65 organizations 
that are part of its network [57]. EWB-Australia is particularly active; in 2015–2016 they 
reported 3275 members/friends, plus 30 university partners with 9513 students engaged in 
an EWB challenge activity, and 13,000 students engaged via their school outreach program 
[58]. They state, “our EWB Connect initiative has been pioneering the creation of a pro bono 
engineering culture across the profession.” [58, p. 4]. Other examples of pro bono focused 
engineering service groups include Bridges to Prosperity, Engineering World Health, and 
the Community Engineering Corps (an alliance of ASCE, EWB-USA, and the American Water 
Works Association).
In engineering education, pro bono work can take the form of service-learning or Learning 
through Service, also termed community engagement [59, 60]. VanderSteen et al. [61] dis-
cussed humanitarian service-learning projects locally (in Canada) and abroad (Ghana); both 
appeared to have impacted students’ views of socially responsible engineering. Linkages 
between community engagement activities among US engineering students and professional 
social responsibility attitudes were found in a large study [62]. As well, engineering faculty 
believe that students learn about ethics and societal impact issues via community engagement 
activities [63].

2.4. Social justice
Social justice relates to the distribution of wealth and privileges in society, as well as issues 
related to poverty and development. There are a growing number of advocates that engineer-
ing social responsibility encompasses social justice issues, including engineering faculty in 
the US [64, 65], Australia [66], Finland [67], and Colombia [68]. A group devoted to this issue, 
Engineering, Social Justice, and Peace (ESJP), routinely hosts a conference. But there are also 
naysayers [69–72], and the majority of the public comments posted with these articles were 
against social justice education for engineers. For example, one commenter noted “Employers 
will shun engineers who they suspect may have been indoctrinated with social justice ideas. 
In short, SJW ideology is a highly destructive virus” [71]. The robust number of comments 
posted with these essays speaks to their controversial nature; for example, 279 comments on 
the Washington Times article [72].
Many have asserted that the majority of engineering activities are devoted to benefitting the 
wealthiest on the planet, versus devoting attention to the large percentage of the global popu-
lation that survives at a near subsistence level. Engineering education programs to address 
these concerns in the US include the D80 center at Michigan Technological University [73], 
the Engineering for Developing Communities Program at the University of Colorado Boulder 
[74], and a number of other programs [75]. There are also similar programs in Spain [76] and 
Canada [61].
There does not appear to be widespread formal education of engineering students about 
social justice and/or poverty issues; only 17% and 15% of engineering faculty taught these 
topics in courses, respectively [14]. However, these topics are reasonably pervasive in co-
curricular engineering service groups (such as EWB-USA). Among faculty mentors of engi-
neering service groups, 90% felt students learned about engineering and poverty and 47% felt 
students learned about social justice.
2.5. Diversity
There are a number of diversity-related issues in engineering. A primary issue is the persistent 
lack of diversity within the engineering workforce in the United States and many other parts 
of the world, which is predominated by men and generally lacks racial/ethnic diversity. Other 
“non-visible” diversity issues relate to socio-economic status (low income individuals under-
represented), cognitive and personality types, etc. [77]. The lack of diversity in the engineering 
profession is also found in engineering education. Implicit bias and a chilly climate are often 
cited as potential reasons for the lack of diversity within the engineering profession. It has 
been argued that this lack of diversity is detrimental to engineering and limits the ability of 
engineering to best fulfill its mandate to benefit society [77, 78]. It is unclear if one of the social 
responsibilities of the engineering profession relates to employing the diversity of individuals 
in society. Statements related to diversity in engineering codes of ethics are summarized in 
Table 2. Generally, these relate to avoiding discriminatory treatment, but the Australia [27] 
and the UK [29] codes also include language to promote/support diversity. Most recently 
in the summer of 2017, the ASCE updated its code of ethics to include  provisions related to 
diversity [79]. The ability to work effectively in diverse teams is an explicitly acknowledged 
Social Responsibility48
requirement for engineering graduates [20, 46]. However, diversity concerns, like social jus-
tice, are not universally embraced as being relevant to engineering [71].
Another important issue with respect to diversity is the extent to which the profession fairly 
compensates workers, without regard to gender, race/ethnicity, etc. In India, female engineer-
ing/computing workers generally earn less than male counterparts [80]. Cech [81] found that 
wage differences by gender in engineering within the US might be partially accounted for 
based on the nature of the work being done with respect to a technical:social dualism hypoth-
esis. It was found that women were more represented among less “technical” sub-disciplines 
in engineering and among more social tasks in engineering.
3. Individual social responsibility development
An individual’s perceptions of their social responsibilities as engineers will develop over time 
via the process of professional socialization. The professional socialization process begins with 
novice views of the engineering profession. These informal influences may include messages 
from media (e.g., movies, news, books), family or acquaintances (e.g., parent an engineer), and 
school (primary and secondary). Some students’ pro-social motivations are a driver for their 
decision to major in engineering [54, 82]. This aligns with efforts to market the social benefits 
Discipline Country Engineering ethics code text related to diversity
Engineering [18] Australia “1.3 Respect the dignity of all persons. (A) treat others… without 
discrimination… (b) …without bias in respect of race, religion, gender, age, 
sexual orientation, marital or family status, national origin, or mental or

of engineering, in line with recommendations from the US National Academy of Engineers 
“Changing the Conversation” report [83]. A higher percentage of female engineering students 
included helping people, helping the environment, and positively impacting society as reasons 
they chose their engineering major, based on open-ended responses [84]. Differences were also 
found among disciplines; a greater percentage of students majoring in environmental and civil 
engineering described helping goals as compared to students majoring in mechanical engineer-
ing [54]. Among UK students given 7 options as to why they decided to study engineering, only 
13.5% selected a desire to ‘make a difference’ to the world; there was no difference between 
female and male students, and this aspiration was the lowest among 4th year students [82]. 
There is also some evidence that students who enter engineering with the strongest pro-social 
motivations leave engineering majors during college at a higher rate than their peers [85, 86].
Professional socialization processes for engineers are more explicitly occurring during higher 
education and in the engineering workforce. The continuum of the development of professional 
civil engineers is outlined explicitly in the Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge (BOK) [40]. 
Here, the acquisition of various knowledge, skills, and attitudes is mapped from the Bachelor’s 
degree in engineering, through a Master’s degree or additional formal education, and dur-
ing mentored experience working under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer. 
In regards to professional and ethical responsibility, the civil engineering BOK includes pro-
posed affective domain outcomes such as “commit to the standards of professional and ethical 
responsibility for engineering practice” [40, p. 94]. Within the “attitudes” outcome elements 
such as honesty, integrity, consideration of others, respect, and tolerance are included [40].
During higher education, in addition to learning important knowledge and skills, students 
are developing attitudes and affective outcomes associated with engineering. Professional 
socialization during higher education includes courses and a variety of informal education 
experiences outside the classroom, such as professional societies or internships in engineer-
ing. A number of studies have explored student perceptions related to elements of social 
responsibility. Despite bringing students with aspirations toward positive social benefits into 
engineering, there is evidence that these goals may diminish over time [87, 88].
Professional socialization continues into the engineering workforce. While Cech [87] found 
continuing evidence of decline in the public service beliefs of alumni from engineering pro-
grams after 1.5 years in the workforce, counter-evidence suggests that working engineers 
may become more committed to their professional social responsibilities over time. A sur-
vey of working engineers (Bielefeldt unpublished, from the study described in [8]) found 
that the majority (61% of n = 467) agreed with the statement “Since earning my bachelor’s 
degree, I have become more motivated to help people and society through my work”; only 
16% disagreed and 23% were neutral. Responses did not differ by gender but did differ 
based on years since earning Bachelor’s degree (5 or fewer years lower than 6 or more years) 
and engineering discipline (mechanical lower than environmental). Similarly, the majority 
(67%) disagreed with the statement, “Since earning my bachelor’s degree, I have become less 
confident of my ability to make positive impacts on people and society through engineering.” 
Responses differed by gender (female stronger agreement than males), years since earning 
Bachelor’s degree (5 or fewer years more agreement versus 6 or more years), and discipline 
(environmental stronger agreement than civil).
Social Responsibility50
Models have been proposed to explain the development of professional responsibility atti-
tudes in individual engineers. The Professional Social Responsibility Development Model 
(PSRDM) [89] was based on an ethic of care framework, and drew from Schwartz’s [90] altru-
istic helping behavior model, Ramsey’s [91] model for integrating social responsibility into 
the decision process of scientists, and the Delve [92] Service Learning Model. The PSRDM 
includes three realms: personal social awareness, professional development, and professional 
connectedness. The personal social awareness realm describes one’s personal feelings of a 
desire to help others, which is inclusive of the dimensions of awareness that needs exist, feel-
ings that one possesses the ability to help, and a connectedness that motivates one to action. 
Separate from these personal feelings, an engineer should develop professionally. The three 
dimensions of this realm include one’s belief that a variety of base skills are needed for engi-
neers, feelings that engineering has the capacity to help address societal issues (professional 
ability), and an awareness that one should analyze the societal impacts of engineering and 
include stakeholders from the community in the engineering process. Finally, it is anticipated 
that a person’s individual motivations to help will come together with their engineering pro-
fessional development, to inform their sense of professional connectedness. A personal moti-
vation to help others through application of one’s engineering skills can be fostered through 
a cycle of engaging in this helping behavior. It will also increase one’s sophistication in their 
awareness of both the costs and benefits of helping and serving others through engineering.
An Input-Environment-Output type of model derived from Wiedman [93] was used by 
Rulifson [92] to describe the development of professional social responsibility ideas in 
engineering students. As inputs, individuals bring pre-dispositions toward personal social 
responsibility and attitudes toward engineering into college. These are developed from fam-
ily influences and high school, etc. Within higher education, a number of factors have been 
determined to influence ideas of professional social responsibility. However, Cech [87] nota-
bly found that attitudes toward public service decreased among 326 engineering students 
attending four US institutions. This concerning trend was termed a “culture of disengage-
ment.” It is perhaps not surprising given that the majority of engineering studies focus on 
technical issues, and preference technical issues over the interactions of technology with soci-
ety. This technical:social dualism may reduce students’ focus on the impacts of their work as 
engineers. However, experiences during engineering studies may counter this decrease in 
engineering students’ ideas of socially responsible engineering. Some engineering students 
cited courses as impactful to their views of social responsibility [94]. Brodeur [95] suggested a 
number of ways to integrate social responsibility ideas into engineering education, including 
the use of the CDIO Syllabus, cooperative learning, constructive controversy, and design-
implement projects. Service-learning may advance students’ ideas of social justice [96] and 
social responsibility [62, 95].
4. Conclusions
There are some elements of engineers’ professional social responsibilities that are widely 
agreed upon. These include protection of human health and safety, and protection of the envi-
ronment. Other engineering social responsibilities have less consensus across countries and

disciplines, including the mandate to participate in pro bono work, strive for social justice, and 
embrace diversity. Corporations focused on engineering activities and for which engineers 
work typically have corporate social responsibility statements which document their com-
mitments and contributions to sustainability in the form of their working conditions, the local 
community, and environmental impacts. Finally, studies are documenting how engineers’ 
develop their sense of professional social responsibility, including their upbringing, college 
experiences in and out of the classroom, and socialization in the engineering workforce. Some 
troubling findings are that an individual’s commitment to socially responsible engineering 
may actually decline over time, perhaps as they begin to separate their technical expertise from 
social commitments or feel that business interests outweigh broader social responsibilities.
There are still a number of unanswered questions in regards to engineers’ beliefs of their 
professional social responsibilities, and factors that contribute to shaping these beliefs. More 
research that involves working engineers is needed. This should include longitudinal stud-
ies. It is unclear how the job roles of an engineer – from a freshly graduated junior engi-
neer, to a more senior engineer with supervisory responsibilities – may impact their views 
of professional social responsibility. It is also unclear how the work setting – public entity, 
private consultant, working for industry – might be impactful. Job roles should also be 
explored – research, design, project management, sales, etc. These studies are needed in dif-
ferent countries and cultural settings, as well as in different engineering disciplines. Due to 
the widespread impacts that engineers have on society and our planet, it is imperative to 
understand how to better foster social responsibility commitments among engineers.

Discussions of diversity in American librarianship usually focus on gender or ethnicity, but 
historical studies also show a lack of diversity in educational and disciplinary backgrounds. 
Librarians traditionally hail from the humanities, especially English and history. But as current 
educational attention shifts to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, are 
librarians reflecting this change? Anonymized data from ALA-accredited graduate programs 
from the last five years was collected, coded, and classified to determine librarians’ educational 
and disciplinary backgrounds and in what ways, if any, they differ from the past 65 years and 
from the contemporary U.S. general population. Unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary 
librarians still hail predominantly from English and history—a stark contrast from the business 
and health undergraduate degrees earned by the general U.S. population. Backgrounds in STEM 
fields remain lacking in librarianship, but librarians with undergraduate education in the arts are 
on the rise, perhaps supporting the creativity, flexibility, innovation and risk-taking necessary in 
21st century libraries.

Introduction 
 
In recent years, increased attention has been paid to diversity in American librarianship, or 
discussions of the lack thereof. While many of these discussions have focused on gender or 
ethnicity, other factors, such as educational and disciplinary background, also contribute to 
diverse perspectives. This is especially true in American librarianship, where the master’s degree 
serves as the professional criteria for the field, thus presuming previous undergraduate education. 
But contemporary librarianship needs to represent and reflect the diversity of today’s needs. An 
increased focused on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields is underway, 
with employment in these fields growing significantly faster (24.4%) than non-STEM jobs 
(4.0%) (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2017). This growing emphasis on STEM, combined 
with the advent of creative tools like makerspaces in libraries and the need for 21st century 
librarians to be innovative, flexible, creative problem-solvers (Bertot, Sarin, & Percell, 2015) 
means that librarians need knowledge and education that supports these new areas of strength. 
 
  
To support these needs, we need a more educationally diverse library profession. This study 
examines the educational diversity of American librarianship. Drawing on both historical and 
contemporary data, we investigate the following research questions: 
 
1. What are the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary librarians? 
2. In what ways, if any, do the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary 
librarians differ from those of the past, or from the contemporary general population?  
 
We conclude with a discussion of potential implications for the field of American librarianship, 
with special consideration paid to the needs of the field going forward in the 21st century. 
 
Literature Review 
 
Many studies in the course of contemporary American librarianship have sought to profile the 
educational and disciplinary backgrounds of various types of library practitioners. During the 
first half of the 20th century, education for librarianship was often provided through training 
courses at functioning libraries. But as librarianship became increasingly established as a 
profession, more formalized approaches to education emerged. In 1948 the American Library 
Association passed a resolution calling for library education to only be offered at the graduate 
level (Bobinski, 2007) and by 1951, the American Library Association had limited accreditation 
to programs offering master's (i.e., graduate level) degrees (Quinn, 2014). At this time, the 
earliest reported data on librarians’ education backgrounds showed that only 58% of public 
librarians in America held college degrees; of those who did, one-third majored in English and 
one-sixth in social science (Bryan, 1952, p. 58-60). While one-third of 58% does not represent a 
majority of librarians in the field at the time, this sample does reflect a starting point for a 
persistent pattern, where English and social science majors are consistently represented at higher 
rates in studies dealing with general populations of librarians. A few years later, Douglass (1957) 
found English to, again, represent at a much higher rate as a major area of undergraduate study, 
with 35.8% of 545 contemporary library school students focusing on it in their undergraduate 
education (p. 59). 14.4% studied history; 10.7% foreign languages; 8.17% education; 7.78% 
social sciences; 7.2% library sciences; 4.28% biological sciences; 3.7% physical sciences; 1.75% 
fine arts and 1.36% business administration  [Categories of “other,” “no answer,” or “undefined” 
are not included here; thus percentages may not total 100%]. Based on available data, it seems 
that most librarians hailed from humanistic backgrounds despite the post-World War II rise of 
information science, the Space Race, and other contemporary national interests in science and 
technology. 
 
Morrison (1969) found that 72% of academic librarians in the United States pursued humanities 
as an undergraduate course of study; this included those who majored in a foreign language but 
not history, which comprised an additional 26% (p. 19) [Per Morrison, some subjects reported 
two or more majors; thus, percentages total more than 100.] 16% studied social sciences; 10% 
natural sciences, and 7% education. The next decade reflected much of the same. In a survey of 
1,969 students across 45 ALA-accredited library education programs, White and Macklin (1970) 
found “the large majority are from liberal arts backgrounds, with English and history being the 
two largest concentrations” (p. 12). 28% of students had undergraduate majors in English; 17% 
history and government; 13% education; 11% behavioral sciences; 10% foreign languages; 5% 
  
physical sciences and math; and 2% biological sciences (p. 12). “However,” they claim, “there is 
also a small, but growing, number who are coming from the sciences and this is likely to increase 
as information science gets more emphasis in the library school” (p. 13). Although White and 
Macklin were correct about the increasing influence of information science on library schools, 
their optimism seems to have been misplaced. It is also unclear how White and Macklin could 
lay claim to any changes since they only collected and analyzed one year of data. Denis (1970) 
reported similar findings for public and academic librarians in Canada at the time, with no 
significant differences between the two types of librarians: “the educational background of the 
vast majority of respondents is in the humanities and to a lesser extent the social sciences” (p. 66, 
183).   
 
By the 1980s, it was well-established that librarians across the board came from predominantly 
liberal arts educational backgrounds. Although not universally representative, a survey of 440 
students enrolled in three ALA-accredited master’s programs at the time—Atlanta University, 
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and University of South Carolina—showed that 51.9% 
held undergraduate degrees in the humanities; 6.6% in library science; 5.0% in the sciences; 
2.7% in business; and 2.0% in agriculture, nursing, etc. (Brown, 1988, p. 65). Studies began to 
focus on narrower slices of librarianship, such as one’s role or position in the library, or 
librarians in subject-based libraries, but little changed in librarians’ educational backgrounds. 
Across 300 college libraries, Reynolds (1982) found the educational backgrounds of the staff as 
follows: 44% humanities (including English, classics, foreign languages, literature, linguistics, 
philosophy & religion); 16.7% education; 5.2% library science. No information for any other 
major areas of study was mentioned (p. 17). Karr (1983) profiled average public and academic 
library directors in 1981 as a 51-year-old male from the northeastern United States who had 
majored in the liberal arts. Library directors at the time majored mostly in English (28%) and 
history (21%), followed by other humanities (13%), social sciences (13%), science and 
engineering (9%), education (6%), library sciences (5%), and business (4%) (p. 344). Mech 
(1985) also found library directors at small Midwest colleges majored “mostly in the humanities 
and liberal arts”: again a predominance of English (26%) and history (22%), followed by 
education (14%), other humanities (9%), foreign languages (8%), non-social sciences (7.5%), 
social sciences (6%), library science (3%), and business (2.5%) (p. 9). Cain (1988) was one of 
the first to also look at trends in further graduate education in addition to undergraduate area of 
study. Using demographic data sourced from the Vita Bank, Cain found that 50% of librarians 
(with or without MLS or equivalent degrees) have at least one graduate degree other than the 
MLS. After coding the degrees by discipline, humanities again stands out. The highest 
percentage of undergraduate degrees (32.3%) and non-MLS master’s degrees (25.4%) were 
coded as humanities subjects (p. 294). These are significant percentages on their own, but Cain 
categorizes history as a “humanities social science,” meaning that history is not included in the 
numbers for humanities. When broken out by specific subject, history leads both undergraduate 
and non-MLS master’s degrees, followed, predictably, by English and education (p. 294). Cain 
finds the fact that nearly 60% of undergraduate degrees are in the same four fields “disturbing” 
and laments the poor representation in the hard sciences: “they indicate that we have a fairly 
narrow educational perspective from which to examine issues or approach problems” (p. 296). 
 
This concern seemed to lead into investigation of academic and education backgrounds of 
librarians specializing in science and related fields (what today we might call STEM, or science, 
  
technology, engineering and mathematics). Responses from 100 academic science librarians 
engaged in bibliographic instruction showed that nearly two-fifths (37%) had a degree at any 
level—undergraduate, master’s, or doctoral—in a scientific discipline (Thomas, 1988, p. 253). 
Another survey of “sci-tech librarians” asked whether or not they “had either an undergraduate 
degree or extensive coursework in a field of science or technology.” 59 respondents (67%) said 
they did (Sandy, Lembo, & Manasco, 1998, p. 16). Another survey of 56 engineering librarians 
revealed that 11% had been social science majors; 10% English, 9% liberal arts, 9% education, 
9% fine arts, 9% biology, 7% engineering, 7% chemistry, 7% history, 5% natural sciences, 4% 
math, 4% journalism (Mosley, 1995, p. 57). Of 119 science and engineering librarians who were 
members of the science and technology section of ACRL, 20% had majored in biology; 12.2% in 
physics/chemistry; 11.1% in history; 7.8% in English; and 5.6% in foreign languages (Winston, 
2001, p. 17). Winston acknowledges the propensity toward humanities backgrounds and the 
difference from this in his population, yet acknowledges that issues of representation still exist: 
“In a profession in which English and history majors are the most predominant, the academic 
science and engineering specialty includes more science majors, as well as those with more 
traditional backgrounds. However, there were very few reported engineering majors” (p. 22). A 
subsequent study showed the continuing trend for science librarians to have science 
backgrounds. Of 72 physical science librarians, 63% majored in a science field as 
undergraduates and 18% earned a master’s degree in a science. “The data collected suggest that a 
greater number of physical science librarians have an undergraduate science degree than do 
science librarians in general” (Ortega & Brown, 2005, p. 75). 
 
The pattern of educational backgrounds of STEM librarians seems to be anomalous. Other 
studies focusing on specific types of librarians follow the general overall trend of favoring the 
humanities. A survey of 162 academic business librarians found 23.5% majored in history; 19% 
in English; 6% in education, and less than 5% for all other identifiable majors. In terms of 
additional master’s degrees, 17.3% of the respondents had an MBA, followed by 9% history and 
3% English (Kendrick, 1990, p. 395-396). A demographic survey of 198 children’s librarians 
found 23.2% had an undergraduate major in English; 18.7% in education; 10.1% in history; 5.1% 
in fine arts; 5.1% in psychology; 3.5% in sociology/social work; and 3.0% in 
communications/journalism (Winston & Dunne, 2001, p. 31-32). 12.6% reported having “double 
majors,” but no data was included about what subjects those might entail. Of business librarians, 
only 15% hold a bachelor’s degree in a business field (Perret, 2011, p. 50). A survey of librarians 
dealing with “media” (such as videos, film, audiovisual, and other non-print materials) noted that 
out of 98 respondents, “the only degree held by a significant number of respondents [17] was a 
Bachelor’s degree in English” (Laskowski, 2010, p. 394). And out of 280 art librarians, 35% had 
a degree in art history and 12% in art/studio art (Tewell, 2012, p. 37). 52% of respondents had a 
second masters; of those, the most frequent areas were art history (52%), fine arts (16%) 
architecture (11%) and history (4%) (p. 37). Interestingly, with the exception of Denis, this is the 
only study of the ones discussed that addresses an international audience; all other studies were 
focused on librarians in the United States. 
 
In recent years, some librarians have found their way to the profession after completing doctoral 
education in another field. Of academic librarians with subject doctorates (other than LIS) earned 
between 1965-2006, 72% chose to pursue librarianship either during or after their PhD studies 
(Lindquist & Gilman, 2008, p. 36). Although the fields of study varied, doctoral degrees earned 
  
prior to librarianship still skew significantly toward the arts and humanities (59.9%), trailed by 
professions/applied sciences (24.4%); social sciences (8.8%); and natural sciences (5.4%) (p. 40-
41). 
 
While we acknowledge that differences exist across various library settings making the data from 
these previous studies seem disparate, all librarians are required to complete the same master’s 
level degree as professional qualification regardless of what type of library (academic, public, 
school, etc.) they find themselves working in. While some librarians have specific goals 
regarding organizational placement, other librarians may change from one library type to another 
(e.g. academic to public) in the course of their career. The data reviewed here from these 
historical studies offers a broad picture of librarianship at large. 
 
Methods 
 
Studies throughout the past 75 years clearly show librarians skewing heavily toward 
backgrounds in English, the humanities, and social sciences. But contemporary librarianship is 
increasingly emphasizing support for STEM fields in library activities such as teaching, 
information literacy, collection development, outreach, research and publishing (Gubnitska & 
Smallwood, 2014; Mardis, 2015). Outreach and other instructional endeavors, such as the “Big 
Orange STEM Saturday” at the University of Knoxville (TN) have increased in popularity and 
offerings (Flash et. al., 2017). Scientific-focused information literacy instruction is increasingly 
incorporated into academic curricula and requires the support of academic librarians 
(Scaramozzino, 2008; 2010). Laherty (2000) emphasizes the need for librarians incorporating 
information literacy into science education programs to be competent in the theories, pedagogies, 
and standards of scientific fields. But academic libraries are not the only libraries emphasizing 
STEM learning. STEM activities and programs, such as science fairs, non-fiction book clubs, 
and other programming strategies are popular in public libraries, as are displays, reading lists and 
other readers’ advisory services promoting STEM topics (Hopwood, 2012; Myers, Spencer, & 
Huss, 2013; Roberson, 2015). School libraries support STEM curriculum through similar 
techniques (Duff, 2012; Lamb, 2016). As contemporary librarianship increases support for 
STEM fields, one might think that the backgrounds of librarians might also be shifting in this 
direction. Is this truly the case? What actually comprises the educational and disciplinary 
backgrounds of contemporary librarians? In what ways, if any, do contemporary librarians’ 
educational and disciplinary backgrounds differ from those of the past, or from the general 
population at large? 
 
To ensure the most current and up-to-date information for this study, contemporary librarians 
were considered those on the cusp of their library careers—i.e., current and recent master’s level 
students in librarianship over the previous 5 years (2012-2016). Although previously the ALISE 
Annual Report included data about prior areas of study, they discontinued collecting 
undergraduate major data in 1980 (Saye & Lan, 1997, p. 74). Instead, anonymous de-identified 
data about matriculated students’ year of enrollment, previous undergraduate and graduate 
degrees and the areas of study for those degrees was solicited from every ALA-accredited 
master’s programs in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. (See Appendix A for the letter 
soliciting participation.) Although many of the previous studies reviewed above solicited data via 
survey questionnaires, this form of data collection was chosen over a survey in an attempt to 
  
collect a more thorough and representative set of data, not reliant on individual personal 
responses. 
 
Requests for data were sent in January 2017 to the 60 institutions with ALA-accredited master’s 
degree programs. Of these, 7 U.S.-based institutions (12%) agreed to provide program data for 
the study. Thirty additional institutions (50%) responded but opted not to participate. While 
reasons for non-participation varied, most reflected the unavailability of the data in a readily 
sharable format and/or the labor-intensive nature of data collection and the program’s inability to 
devote staff time or resources to the task. The requests stated a preference for de-identified data 
but also stated that special arrangements could be made to collect identifiable data while still 
protecting students’ information, an offer extended after consultation with Syracuse University’s 
Institutional Review Board. Despite the assurance of IRB compliance several institutions 
declined to participate because of concerns over student privacy, with one institution going so far 
as to seek counsel on the matter from their legal department before declining to participate. To 
encourage participation in the study, data was collected in whatever format was most convenient 
for the institution, resulting in a variety of formats from spreadsheets to simple lists. The data 
were standardized and aggregated, and then coded based on a scheme developed during a pilot 
study with admission data from the University of Washington Information School (Clarke, 
2016). The coding scheme was revised and expanded to accommodate the data from additional 
schools (See Appendix B for the full coding scheme).  
 
Every degree subject was normalized; for example, degrees listed with subjects in Classics, 
Classical Studies, and Classical Civilization were all synonymized to Classics. In addition, every 
normalized subject was hierarchically classified under a broader discipline code (e.g., History 
was classified as a humanities discipline). Although many subjects are well-recognized as falling 
into certain disciplinary categories some classifications, especially for new and emerging 
subjects, proved challenging. Whenever possible, we investigated the subjects and degrees and 
attempted to represent their actual nature. If the degree-granting institution was known, we 
examined web pages and other information about the degree to determine which discipline might 
be appropriate. We consulted established classifications and definitions, such as the National 
Endowment for the Humanities, to guide our classification. When subject and disciplinary 
classification was complete, descriptive statistics were used to understand the landscape of 
educational backgrounds in contemporary librarianship, as well as to compare with historical 
data. After presenting preliminary results at the American Library Association’s annual 
conference (Clarke, 2017), we also coded every undergraduate degree a second time based on the 
IPEDS Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomic scheme, based on external feedback 
and suggestions. This allowed us to compare the distribution of subjects among librarians’ 
undergraduate degrees with that of undergraduate degrees in the American population at large. 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Current overall educational and disciplinary profile of contemporary American librarians 
 
Based on the data from 7 institutions with ALA-accredited master’s programs, contemporary 
librarians predominantly hail from disciplinary backgrounds in the humanities, with 41% of 
previous degrees having been awarded in this discipline. This is followed by social sciences 
  
(22%), professions (17%), then STEM (11%), the arts (6%), and miscellaneous/interdisciplinary 
studies (3%) (see Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1. Disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary librarians. 
 
In addition to overarching disciplines, we also tabulated counts for specific areas of study (e.g., 
the “major” or topic of study of each degree). The predominant areas of study reflected in 
previous degrees held by matriculating MLIS students also emphasizes subjects in the 
humanities, with English and history topping the list (see Table 1). These subjects rose to the top 
even without including counts for more specific topics in those areas, such as English literature 
(6th most common), art history (10th), or creative writing (22nd). Degrees in education were the 
third most common, but they represent a very distant third place compared to the top two 
subjects.

While this table reflects the subjects of previous degrees earned by matriculated master’s 
students, it does not delineate the levels of those degrees. Some students entered into a master’s 
level library education program with only a single undergraduate degree, while others entered 
with an undergraduate degree as well as a master’s degree, or some other combination of degrees 
(e.g., multiple bachelor’s and/or master’s degrees; associate degrees; law degrees, doctoral 
degrees, etc.). No attempt was made to distinguish the level of education a student received 
based on the level of degree; that is, no assumption was made that a graduate degree conferred 
more expertise or education in a particular subject than an undergraduate degree. Only the 
subjects were noted. 3,191 students recorded 4,380 degrees, giving an average of 1.37 degrees 
per student. 
 
Current undergraduate educational and disciplinary backgrounds  
 
While all entering MLIS students are required to have earned an undergraduate degree, not all 
have earned additional graduate or other degrees. Including all degrees, as we did above, offers a 
holistic picture of focus of study by discipline, but it also may skew the results toward subjects in 
which additional degrees were earned. It also makes comparisons with other data sets, both 
historical and contemporary, more difficult.      
 
For instance, based on the above data, librarians seem to over-represent humanistic disciplines. 
But perhaps humanistic courses of study are popular across the board, not just in librarianship. 
To determine whether or not the undergraduate degree subjects of librarians differ from the 
population at large, we compared the subjects of the undergraduate degrees in our data set to 
national data from the U.S. Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data 
  
System (IPEDS). IPEDS is a system of annual surveys conducted by the National Center for 
Educational Statistics. Every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that 
participates in federal student aid financial programs are required to self-report numerous pieces 
of institutional data, including data related to institutional characteristics and prices, admissions, 
measures of enrollment and access, and degrees conferred, among others” (National Center for 
Education Statistics [NCES], n.d-a). 
 
We took several steps to prepare our study data for comparison with national data from IPEDS. 
First, all non-undergraduate degrees were removed from our data set as IPEDS only collects data 
relating to post-secondary, non-graduate studies. Next, each degree from our original coding 
scheme was checked against IPEDS’ Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) searchable 
site (NCES, n.d.-b) in order to crosswalk our data. CIP is the taxonomic scheme utilized by 
IPEDS, a scheme that organizes degrees into fields of study and sub-fields. Our data was 
crosswalked at the higher field level in order to compare it to national numbers reported in the 
Digest of Education Statistics, an annual compilation of American educational statistical 
information with data drawn from many sources, including IPEDS. Our data set was then re-
coded to match the CIP scheme. Table 322.10 (NCES, 2016) from the Digest contains data for 
bachelor’s degrees conferred by all reporting institutions between 1970-71 and 2014-15, the 
latter being the most recent year for which complete IPEDS data is available. Numbers for the 
2012-13, 2013-14, and 2014-15 academic years were aggregated across our data set and IPEDS 
data for comparison purposes. These academic years were selected because complete data for 
these years was available across both data sets [It should be noted that data from one program 
was dropped for this particular comparison, since their data was provided to us in aggregate form 
and we were unable to isolate the years in question]. 
 
Our comparison shows a number of stark differences in patterns of undergraduate study (see 
Table 2).

IPEDS classifies history with social sciences, making social sciences the highest percentage 
(21.37%) of undergraduate degrees earned by MLIS students between 2012-2015. However, 
English language, literature and letters is also a large percentage (20.33%), and would likely be 
the highest percentage were history not conjoined with social sciences. Both social sciences and 
English are much more concentrated in librarianship than the U.S. population at large, which saw 
only 9.24% of undergraduates completing degrees in social sciences and 2.65% in English. 
Conversely, the largest category of degrees earned in the U.S. population were in business 
subjects (19.32%), followed by health professions at 10.64%. In librarianship, 4.12% and 0.19% 
of MLIS students earned undergraduate degrees in these subjects, respectively. There is 
obviously a significant disconnect in librarians’ representation of the population at large. 
 
Although IPEDS does not present a unified category for STEM as an overall discipline, we can 
identify individual subjects representing the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
to present a more holistic picture. We identified the following IPEDS-designated fields as 
STEM-relevant fields (see Table 3):

Most of the subjects in the STEM disciplines--agriculture; biology; engineering; health; and 
physical sciences--show a higher rate in the overall population than in librarianship. In contrast, 
the percentage of MLIS students holding undergraduate degrees in computer & information 
science (6.54%) is twice as high as the overall rate (2.96%). This may be due to the inclusion of 
information science alongside computer science in the IPEDS classification; MLIS students 
often have undergraduate degrees in library and information science (LIS). This could also be 
due to data from programs offering a broader graduate level degree in information with tracks or 
specializations for LIS, computer science, information management, user experience (UX) and 
other cognate fields. IPEDS does offer a separate category specifically for library science, and 
that is where we classified undergraduate LIS degrees from our dataset. However, other non-
library information-related degrees, such as information administration and management were 
assigned to the IPEDS category of computer & information sciences. Computer science degrees 
may also be more highly represented due to the types of MLIS programs that responded: several 
contemporary degree programs now admit students to a general information-based course of 
study, where students subsequently may select to pursue a specialization or track in library 
science and librarianship. Therefore, some degrees in our dataset surely represent matriculated 
students who went on to pursue information degrees exclusive of the MLIS.  
 
A similar issue arises in the area of law. At least one of the MLIS programs that contributed data 
offered a specialization in law librarianship, thus attracting people with previous experience in 
that area. Although this may not be evident in the undergraduate data (0.14% in librarianship 
compared with 0.24% overall), 1.78% of all previous degrees (undergraduate, graduate, and 
post-grad) earned by incoming MLIS students were in law. This likely reflects the fact that the 
juris doctor (JD), a degree earned only after already earning an undergraduate degree, is 
considered the first degree in law in the United States (Law School Admission Council, n.d.). 
 
Surprisingly, the percentage of MLIS students with undergraduate degrees in mathematics and 
statistics is nearly identical to the overall rate (1.23% in librarianship vs. 1.13% overall). The 
  
only other categories with similar distributions were architecture, communications/journalism, 
and multi/interdisciplinary studies.  
The ways in which this profile compares to previous studies 
 
Librarianship clearly reflects a different distribution of undergraduate degrees than the U.S. 
population at large. To investigate whether this distribution is a new trend reflecting 
contemporary needs, or has remained constant over time, we compared undergraduate degree 
data from our dataset to similar data reported on in previous studies (see Figure 2). Data from 
Douglass (1957), White & Macklin (1970) and Cain (1988) were used for this comparison as 
they all offered a similar level of specificity to the IPEDS classification of undergraduate majors. 
Two of the studies gleaned data from questionnaire responses of undergraduate students 
(Douglass and White & Macklin) while Cain relied on data from Vita Bank, an attempted census 
of practicing librarians. Not all subject designations were reflected in each study; notably White 
and Macklin did not specifically report library science, business, or arts undergraduate degrees as 
individual categories. Totals do not add up to 100% due to additional subject area designations 
not consistently reported across all four studies, as well as accounting for other/miscellaneous 
degrees. It should be noted, as per the previous discussion of IPEDS classification, history is 
categorized as a social science rather than with the humanities subjects. 
 
Figure 2. Undergraduate degrees across four studies. 
 
 
 
Despite still comprising a near-majority, earning an undergraduate humanities degree prior to 
librarianship appears to be on the decline. Social sciences are represented in higher numbers in 
more recent years, however this could possibly be attributed to a number of reason. The 
  
classification of history as a social science certainly affects these results in a significant way. But 
a higher number of social science undergraduates pursuing librarianship could also correspond 
with the evolutionary alignment of librarianship to information science, which is often positioned 
as a social science. Or perhaps more options for social science degrees have become available in 
recent years. 
 
Some professions, such as education, library science, and business, were called out individually 
in most of the studies, while other professions determined by our own original inductive coding 
were not. Again, this may be an artifact of an evolving education space, which now includes 
degrees in subjects that were previously not offered in the academy. Of the specific professions 
highlighted in three of the four studies compared here, education seems to have peaked in the 
1970s and declined since then. Although librarianship is still often affiliated with an educational 
bent, especially when considering its historical foundations and core values, a decline in this 
focus has been noted as a result of the field’s alignment with information science (Dali, 2015). 
When compared with the contemporary IPEDS data, librarianship actually slightly lags the 
nation in undergraduate education degrees (5.27% nationally vs. 4.08% in librarianship). 
Business, on the other hand, has seen slight rise, from 1.36% of undergraduate degrees in 1957 to 
4.12% today, but as previously noted, this is starkly out of proportion from the national figure of 
19.32%. 
 
Interestingly enough, degrees in the visual and performing arts appear to be on the rise, perhaps 
due to graduates of those degrees facing increased challenges in securing jobs in fields directly 
related to their studies. 
 
Implications and Conclusions 
 
This work set out to investigate the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary 
librarians, as well as to understand how these backgrounds compared to librarians of the past as 
well as the general population. Unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary librarians, 
represented by MLIS students on the cusp of their career so as to reflect the future landscape as 
much as possible, still hail predominantly from humanities backgrounds, especially English. 
History is also a strongly represented area of study. The large number of people with humanities 
backgrounds may have made sense when libraries were focused on books, literature, and reading. 
However, by the time library education shifted to the graduate level in the United States, 
librarianship itself had also already begun the shift toward becoming the social science field it is 
considered today. Yet the undergraduate backgrounds of people pursuing librarianship do not 
seem to have shifted at the same rate. This leaves library educators with the difficult task of 
training people with humanities backgrounds to do social science work--a fundamentally 
different approach that risks mismatches in disciplinary norms. While most students with 
humanities backgrounds are more than capable writers, their unfamiliarity with the research 
methodologies and genre conventions often found in MLIS curricula, which is more closely 
aligned with the social sciences, leaves many of these students struggling to understand 
expectations. Mandel (2017) reports that this same skill set is especially valuable in post-MLIS 
employment, where “the ability of library and information professionals to responsibly consume 
and competently produce research is critical to the growth of the field and to the way other 
disciplines view LIS” (p. 200). This is true for academic librarians who may be required to 
  
engage in primary research as part of their tenure obligations, and for librarians in the field in 
general, who are increasingly called upon to demonstrate the value and impact of their work 
through evidence-based practice (Oakleaf, 2010, p. 6).    
 
The backgrounds of librarians are quite different from those of the college-educated American 
populace at large, where 33% of adults 25 years and older by age have bachelor’s degrees or 
more (United States Census Bureau, 2015), with especially noticeable differences in business 
and health fields, as evidenced in the most recently available IPEDS data. Additional emphases 
on STEM in American society calling for increased research, resources, and education in these 
fields implies the needs for librarians to support these services. But the small number of people 
with STEM backgrounds going into librarianship leaves a disconnect. For future librarians to 
serve patrons in these areas, MLIS programs must recruit more people with undergraduate 
education in these areas, and/or integrate education regarding services for these populations in 
graduate level library education curricula. We are not claiming that STEM librarians who have 
an undergraduate background in the humanities or social sciences are unqualified and unable to 
fulfill their professional duties, only positing that an increase of librarians with STEM 
undergraduate education can help serve the profession’s increased need for STEM support and 
contribute to more diverse perspectives in MLIS education.  
 
Although they are still a small percentage overall, librarians with undergraduate education in the 
arts are on the rise. While perhaps not as concrete as the needs in STEM fields, people with arts 
backgrounds may be able to offer some of the skills necessary for 21st century librarianship, 
such as creativity, flexibility, innovation and risk-taking (Bertot, Sarin, & Percell, 2015). 
Undergraduate art education, especially the studio arts, explicitly offers instruction that fosters 
creativity (Clarke & Cripps 2012). Undergraduate studio art education includes learning how to 
take risks, view topics from multiple and flexible points of view and appreciate various 
perspectives (Salazar 2013). Innovation--even in scientific fields--has long been linked with 
creative pursuits like the arts. For example, Gurnon, Voss-Andrae and Stanley (2013) show how 
including visual arts in undergraduate science curriculum can help develop scientific 
imagination. Such integration underlies the revision of STEM to STEAM (science, technology, 
engineering, arts and mathematics), a movement encouraging the inclusion of art and design as 
integral aspects of STEM (Rhode Island School of Design, 2018). Although skills derived from 
art and design are certainly used by librarians, Clarke’s (2016) historical research shows that 
they have been implicit and underdeveloped in American librarianship and have yet to be 
explicitly taught in library education. Given the argument that library work is actually more 
aligned with the discipline of design than social sciences (Clarke, 2016, 2018), people with art 
and design backgrounds may be better equipped with the creative skills necessary for 21st 
century library careers. Yet until MLIS education embraces a design approach, these students 
may find themselves trapped in similar patterns as those mentioned for humanities students 
above, and risk the inability to apply the skills learned in their design educations to librarianship. 
 
These findings may be useful, but like all studies of this nature, they are not without flaws. 
Despite our attempt to collect census data from all 60 ALA-accredited degree programs, only 
seven cooperated. The schools from which we collected data varied in program structure, size, 
ranking, and other characteristics. Some schools offered multiple degrees (both ALA-accredited 
and not); some offered specific focus areas or concentrations that surely affected our findings. 
  
Hence our attempt to collect census population data. While we understand and respect the 
reasons why programs did not share their data, we remain unsatisfied. Data on undergraduate 
degrees was systematically collected in the past for the ALISE statistical report until 1980. We 
could find no reason for this decision and the motivation for no longer collecting such data 
remains a mystery, when it could surely assist with recruitment and outreach for a more 
educationally diverse profession. Perhaps given some of the challenges faced by library 
programs in the late 20th century, such data became a kind of “competitive intelligence,” making 
sharing prohibitive and reflecting a change from the traditions of cooperation so commonly seen 
in librarianship to a more competitive landscape where MLIS program sought various means of 
staying afloat. Despite these limitations, this study still illustrates trends in librarians’ educational 
backgrounds in the 21st century, which can help shape MLIS education in this contemporary 
evolving space.

Appendix A 
Request for Data Sent in January 2017 
 
Subject: Request for Data Related to Educational Backgrounds of Graduate LIS Program 
Applicants 
  
Dear [NAME], 
  
You are receiving this email because you appear to be the person in your department who 
handles data related to the LIS program at your institution. 
  
We are conducting a study examining the educational backgrounds of graduate LIS program 
applicants. To that end we are reaching out to all ALA accredited master’s programs in library 
and information science across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico with the hopes of 
collecting relevant program data to assist with this study. 
 
We are seeking the following information, ideally for at least the last 5 years. For each 
matriculated MLIS (or equivalent) student, we would like to have the matriculation year, the 
student’s previous academic degrees (undergraduate and graduate), the major areas of study 
for those degrees, and, if possible, the schools which awarded those degrees. For example, a 
specific student that matriculated in 2015 might have a bachelor of arts in English from 
California State University Long Beach and a master’s degree in history from the University of 
Florida. 
  
We understand that this data may exist in a variety of formats, and in an effort to make this 
process as easy as possible, we will accept data in whatever format you have on hand and we are 
happy to provide support in any way. Ideally we would prefer data that has been de-identified 
(that is, data that does not include names, Social Security numbers, or other identifying 
information), but if your data cannot be de-identified or you don’t have the time or resources to 
de-identify it yourself, please let us know and we can make arrangements to collect your 
identifiable data while still protecting students’ information. If we have reached you by mistake 
and you are not the person who handles data related to the LIS program, we would appreciate it 
if you could please forward this email to the appropriate person.  
  
We appreciate the time involved in gathering this data and are grateful for any assistance you can 
provide. Please reply to this email with any data you are able to share or if you have questions or 
comments. 
 
Sincerely,  
 
Rachel Ivy Clarke & Young-In Kim, Syracuse University, The iSchool

Librarians traditionally hail from the humanities, especially English and history. But as current educational attention shifts to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, are librarians reflecting this change? Anonymized data from ALA-accredited graduate programs from the last five years was collected, coded, and classified to determine librarians’ educational and disciplinary backgrounds and in what ways, if any, they differ from the past 65 years and from the contemporary U.S. general population. Unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary librarians still hail predominantly from English and history—a stark contrast from the business and health undergraduate degrees earned by the general U.S. population. Backgrounds in STEM fields remain lacking in librarianship, but librarians with undergraduate education in the arts are on the rise, perhaps supporting the creativity, flexibility, innovation and risk-taking necessary in 21st century libraries","['text', 'LIS education', 'undergraduate education', 'bachelor degrees', 'educational diversity', 'academic disciplines', 'Library and Information Science']",disabled
