This thesis is quantitative research of the market potential for virtual reality as a marketing 
communication tool targeted at McCann Finland Oy’s clientele and other potential clients of 
different lines of businesses.  
 
Virtual reality has been around since late the 1980’s but has taken leaps during the past few 
years. Virtual reality as a marketing communication tool has not been used considerably 
much and is likely at a so-called early adopters stage. The research studies virtual reality as 
an innovation looks into its attributes and examines the characteristics of potential target 
markets.  
 
The theoretical framework consists of technology adoption, disruptive innovations, and diffu-
sion of innovations. To identify the potential users, the author delved into the characteristics 
of different technology adopter classes. As virtual reality is disrupted innovation by nature, the 
most probable users are early adopters. Early adopters are visionaries by their characteristics 
and have the readiness to take the risk of being first to use the technology to get strategic 
leverage over the competition.  
 
The research method was primary quantitative research implemented as an online question-
naire and secondary research that consisted of scientific articles, websites, surveys, and 
books. The results present key findings and conclusions in the thesis. 
 
The study revealed that knowledge of virtual reality was rather comprehensive as more than 
half of the respondents had personal experiences of it and most knew the concept. Most re-
spondents also saw the potential of virtual reality in marketing and the majority believes in 
virtual reality as a part of people’s everyday lives.  
 
Based on primary research the organizations’ technology adoption habits among the re-
spondents were divided mostly between early adopters, visionaries and early majority, prag-
matists. Pragmatists are not likely to adopt virtual reality as a marketing communication tool 
in a first stage due to lack of references. The significant difference between early adopters 
and early majority is that the latter one is reference driven. 
 
Overall, there is distinct interest in virtual reality as a marketing communication tool. Howev-
er, not all respondents were ready to engage virtual reality in their marketing efforts, at least 
not before it has proven efficient. It is recommended to commence virtual reality marketing 
efforts and establish a reference base for majority markets. It would be recommendable to 
established efforts with similar clients to gain expertise in the narrow field first, due to a learn-
ing curve and possible up-scale after that. 
 
The study also revealed that organizations are interested in more targeted marketing overall.

1 Introduction 
The first chapter explains the background of this thesis and shortly introduces the case 
company. The topic describes, research question with investigative questions are pre-
sented in this part as well. The demarcation, international aspect, expected benefits; key 
concepts are explained in introduction part too.  
 
1.1 Background  
New technologies such as virtual reality, big data, Internet of things, augmented reality; 
mixed reality and many others have developed to a point where they can be applied. Of-
ten technologies may feel utopist and take the first step or be pioneers may feel intimidat-
ing and may be underutilized despite advances in hardware and software capabilities 
(Venkatesh and Davis 2000, 186). However, many companies are interested in new tech-
nologies and would benefit from understanding the potential and possibilities the new 
technologies reveal. Michael Porter (1985, 63) claims that technology gives a competitive 
advantage if it has an essential role in designating relative cost position or differentiation. 
Technological advancements are developing at fast pace and companies must keep up to 
stay competitive. Smart devices with applications and their accessories bring intriguing 
possibilities in many fields, such as marketing. Augmented reality and virtual reality survey 
report (2016) predict that virtual reality and augmented reality are within 10 years tens of 
billions of dollars. Also, Mark Zuckerberg is planning to spend 3 billion dollars to imple-
ment virtual reality in Facebook even though general public has not yet adopted the tech-
nology (Fortune 2017). The advertising company, McCann Helsinki Oy as a commission-
ing company for this thesis seeks to map the potential clients from their current customer 
base to establish new virtual reality marketing communication tool. The samples are col-
lected from McCann Helsinki Oy’s clientele and other potential clients to utilize virtual real-
ity as a marketing communication tool. McCann Helsinki Oy may provide a broader portfo-
lio of services with the new marketing tool. In the best-case scenario, the early adopters 
may get distinct strategic leverage of being the pioneer in using virtual reality as a market-
ing communication tool. 
 
1.2 Research Question and Investigative questions 
Research Question: 
How to identify potential B2B clients to utilize virtual reality as a marketing commu-
nication channel? 
  
2 
Investigative question 1. What is the level of awareness of the clients of virtual reality in 
general? 
The question relates to B2B clients’ general knowledge of the virtual reality.  
Investigative question 2. What are the challenges in marketing and benefits of virtual reali-
ty in marketing? 
 
This part identifies the difficulties the B2B clients are facing in marketing in general and do 
they see virtual reality beneficial. Disruptive innovation adoption, diffusion of innovations, 
and innovation lifecycle are the applied theories in this question. 
Investigative question 3. Is B2B client ready to utilize the new marketing technology (virtu-
al reality)? 
The question includes clients’ receptivity towards new technology. This part includes 
which B2B clients’ are most responsive to new technology and their characteristics in 
technology adoption process. The question may indicate the psychographic group of the 
respondent. Theories applied to this question are innovation lifecycle, organizational buy-
ing behavior and diffusion of innovations. 
 
Investigative question 4. Recommendations based on results and analysis.  
 
As the investigative questions are leading to answer the final research question, the rec-
ommendations of the author by analyzing the results of theoretical research are final steps 
to reach the conclusions. The recommendations include what the commissioning compa-
ny should focus on next. The study should reveal the market potential for virtual reality as 
marketing communication tool.

1.3 Case company 
McCann is one of the biggest advertising companies in the world (Ad Age, 2017). The 
world’s first advertising trademark “Truth Well Told” was registered by McCann in 1912 
(McCann 2017). During 100 years the McCann has made some of the world’s greatest 
brands most renowned (McCann 2017). McCann Helsinki Oy is part of the Scandinavian 
group (Finland, Sweden, Norway & Denmark). McCann has won several advertising priz-
es and has tens of different sized clients. McCann Helsinki Oy was founded in 2015. 
McCann’s core belief is – Creativity is the only way to survive. McCann’s vision is to help 
brands play a meaningful role in people’s lives. The company uses its belief as a guideline 
in their business ventures. The company’s portfolio of services is comprehensive from 
brand strategy planning to creative technology and 3D animation. 
  
1.4 Demarcation  
The author is sampling McCann’s clients and other potential companies to utilize virtual 
reality as a marketing communication tool. The companies are both Finnish and interna-
tional, bigger and smaller. The survey will also be sent to McCann Sweden’s clients to get 
a broader perspective from other Nordic countries. McCann is a global company and get-
ting samples worldwide would be interesting in comparing results with Finnish clients or 
  
4 
Finnish representatives. However, as Finnish and Swedish business cultures have a re-
semblance, the results may be alike. There are other technologies abreast with virtual 
reality with similar potential. However, not all of them are disruptive by nature like virtual 
reality is.  
 
1.5 International Aspect 
McCann is a global operator with multinational clients. Many clients operate in multiple 
countries implementing marketing projects often internationally. Many companies have 
joint campaigns in neighboring countries. McCann Finland is part of the Nordic group with 
branches in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and same questionnaire will be sent to Swe-
den as well. Sweden yields useful data of attitudes in general level and comparison be-
tween Swedish with Finnish attitudes towards new marketing innovations due to the simi-
larity of business cultures. The results from Finnish clients can be benchmarked for inter-
national clients. 
 
1.6 Benefits 
McCann is interested in new marketing communication tools, methods, and solutions that 
innovations uncover. Hence, it may provide a broader range of services to their clients 
and may give leverage in their industry with a wider assortment of services for their cli-
ents. The primary data indicates the attitudes of McCann’s clientele and other companies’ 
towards virtual reality as a marketing communication tool and their typical practice in 
adopting new technologies, which is beneficial for McCann to discover the virtual reality’s 
market potential. 
 
The author gets credibility and experience from the field, which will revolutionize market-
ing in next 2-3 years assumed by the author. By being a pioneer in marketing with under-
standing new technologies and their potential will benefit the author significantly by being 
a specialist in the field. After the research, the author is specialized in disruptive innova-
tions and technology adoption categories and their characteristics. 
 
1.7 Key Concepts 
Innovation 
  
5 
“The word innovation comes from the Latin, innovare, and is all about the change. Per-
haps a more helpful definition in terms of what we actually have to manage is that innova-
tion is a process of creating value from ideas.” (Tidd and Bessant 2014, 3) 
 
Disruptive innovation 
“..a process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the 
bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves up market, eventually displacing estab-
lished competitors.” (Clayton Christensen 2017). 
 
Innovation adoption life-cycle 
“..Technology Adoption Life Cycle, a model for understanding the acceptance of new 
products”. “It turns out our attitude toward technology adoption becomes significant – at 
least in a marketing sense – any time we are introduced to products that require us to 
change our current mode of behavior or to modify other products and services we rely on.” 
(Moore 2014, 11-12).  
 
Marketing communication 
“Today, marketers are moving toward viewing communication as managing the customer 
relationship over time.” “..the communication process should start with an audit of all po-
tential touchpoints that target customer may have with the company and its brands” (Arm-
strong and Kotler 2012, 438) 
 
Organizational buying behavior 
“Business buying decisions can range from routine to incredibly complex, involving only a 
few or very many decision makers and buying influences” (Armstrong and Kotler 2012, 
194).

2 Virtual reality as an innovation and characteristics of potential tar-
get markets 
This part introduces the reader to different concepts and theories applied to this thesis. 
Introducing first, the concept of virtual reality, variants of virtual reality, virtual reality appli-
cations and virtual reality as a marketing communication tool. Also, the nature of disrup-
tive innovations and diffusion of innovations is explained and how virtual reality is related 
to them. The theories lay the foundation for the study to understand the nature of virtual 
reality as a technology and innovation, what are the characteristics of most potential cli-
ents, and how to target for currently most befitting markets. 
 
By understanding the stimuli for organizations to implement new marketing technologies, 
it is vital to understand the key theories, which unfurls a base of research at hand. Devel-
oping a new product concept derives from an idea and is a detailed version stated in 
meaningful consumer terms according to Armstrong and Kotler (2011, 276). The book 
Crossing the Chasm (Moore, 2014) introduces the stages of product (disruptive by nature) 
throughout from niche markets to mainstream markets through so-called Chasm. The 
""Chasm"" is a gap between early adopters stage (latter part of the early markets) and early 
majority stage (first half of the mainstream markets). According to Moore (2014, 170), 
many innovations never cross the “chasm” due to lack of reference base gained from ear-
lier adopter stage and without support base to next market stages, which are by high pref-
erence orientated.  
 
2.1 Virtual reality and virtual reality variants 
Virtual reality’s only goal is to convince a person to be somewhere else by tricking human 
brain with illusion by a variety of technologies, claims Tony Parisi (2015, introduction). 
Virtual reality consists of a set of technologies, such as 3D stereophonic displays, motion 
tracking hardware, new input devices, computers and mobile phones. The key innovations 
to create immersion and illusion is actualized when stereoscopic rendering and motion 
tracking is appropriately combined (Parisi 2015, Chapter summary).  
 
According to Kishino and Milgram (1994, 2), a conventionally held view of virtual reality is 
an environment in which observer is completely immersed in and able to interrelate in the 
artificial world, which is not limited by physical laws of nature. Jonathan Steuer (1993, 4) 
points out that virtual reality is typically described as a medium a breast with radio and 
television. Today there are multiple areas the virtual reality may be applied. Virtual reality 
can be utilized for educational and entertaining purposes (Liou, Yang, Chen and 
  
7 
Wernhuar 2017, 110). In this thesis, the author is focusing on virtual reality as a potential 
marketing communication tool or medium. 
 
Today the developments of the computer industry, especially mobile technologies and 
various affordable devices have paved the way for virtual reality to become available to 
the broader audience. Hence, establishing possibilities for virtual reality to penetrate the 
significant markets in various fields, such as in marketing. Virtual reality hardware for con-
sumers is still young but an evolving domain. Oculus Rift is probably most known headset, 
but there is also Google’s cardboard bulk version that turns a smartphone into virtual reali-
ty device. Parisi (2015, device chapter summary) reminds that as virtual reality display cut 
users from outside world, there is a need for other solutions for devise input systems in-
stead of keyboards, mice and touchscreens.  
 
Augmented reality is introduced in this chapter as a part of virtual reality entity. The aug-
mented reality allows the user observe real world, with virtual objects depict on top of it 
(Azuma 1997, 356). Nowadays it is often used in smartphones by specific mobile applica-
tions (such as IKEA catalog). It may be used with smart phone’s camera with a traditional 
view through the lens, but having an additional animation(s) added to the monitored 
screen. The augmented reality can be used and has been used already by 1997 in follow-
ing fields: Doctors may use augmented reality in visualization and training in surgery (Ha-
chach-Haram, 2017). In assembly, maintenance and repair of sophisticated machinery the 
augmented reality may be utilized in manuals. Annotation and visualization, robot path 
planning, entertainment and military aircrafts have utilized augmented reality (Azuma 
1997, 356). Pokémon Go introduced augmented reality to masses in 2016 July according 
to Samuel Gibbs (The Guardian 2017). The augmented reality separates from virtual reali-
ty as an innovation by not needing additional devices to access virtual or augmented reali-
ty, assuming that smartphones may be considered commodity today. Hence, it may be 
considered not a disruptive 
 
Mixed reality is another alteration of virtual reality and also part of the virtual reality entity. 
Milgram and Kishino (1994, 2-3) describe mixed reality as a subclass of virtual reality re-
lated technologies that merge both virtual and real world along the virtual continuum by 
connecting the entirely real world with utterly virtual one (see figure 1.). Billinghurst and 
Kato (1999) define mixed reality as it allows the user to view both virtual and real worlds 
and at the same time “facilitating a high bandwidth of communication between users and 
intuitive manipulation of virtual information” (see figure 1). In other words, real and virtual 
content may react to each other.

There is a variety of applications in virtual reality for consumers. According to Parisi (2015, 
Virtual applications), there are several potential fields in virtual reality. Video games are 
most common domain people think when they hear about virtual reality. Several compa-
nies are creating social virtual worlds. In education, 3D visualization can be a beneficial 
tool for interactive learning. Some researchers and companies are exploring virtual reality 
as a workspace with personal information, work projects, etc. There are several examples 
of tourism using virtual reality with stereoscopic 360-degree panoramas. Architecture and 
real estate companies are using a virtual reality by using videos and interactive graphics. 
Paul McCartney and Jack White have broadcasted virtual versions of their live shows. 
Mozilla and Google are creating virtual reality features for web browsers. Mozilla is explor-
ing visual and interface designs for navigating internet in virtual reality. Then there are 
many possibilities in simulation and training for military use, medical diagnostics with train-
ing, engineering, and design. Paris’ opinion is that only imagination is the limit by looking 
back few decades of technological development.  
 
2.2 Virtual reality as marketing communication channel 
As explicated in earlier paragraphs the virtual reality may be applied in various ways. This 
thesis concentrates on virtual reality marketing in advertising and more specifically as 
marketing communication channel. Hence, in this thesis, virtual reality marketing is refer-
ring to virtual reality marketing communication due to convenience for the reader.  
 
Armstrong and Kotler (2011, 405) explain the concept of promotion mix or marketing 
communication mix, which is a blend of advertising, public relations, personal selling, 
sales promotion, and direct marketing tools that company seeks to communicate custom-
er value to build a customer relationship persuasively. Armstrong and Kotler (2011, 405) 
define advertising of the promotion mix as “any paid form of nonpersonal presentation and 
promotion of ideas, goods, or services by an identified sponsor.” The landscape of mar-
keting communication has been changing over digitalization and consumers are more 
  
9 
communication empowered than before. Also, the marketers are shifting from mass mar-
keting to more accurate and narrower micromarketing. Changes in communication tech-
nologies are changing ways for companies and customers to communicate with each oth-
er. New communication tools present companies’ new ways to interact with customers 
(Armstrong, Kotler 2011, 405-406). The author of this thesis assumes that virtual reality 
will play a significant role as a new medium of customer interaction in the near future. 
 
 There are various industries, which are utilizing virtual reality in marketing such as real 
estate industry, architects, interior designers and sports industry. Retailers with show-
rooms are the only small portion of sectors that are already utilizing virtual reality in a 
marketing communication channel. By reflecting the list, one understands that the bound-
aries are within the imagination. IKEA Company has an application using augmented re-
ality technology in a catalog of furniture.  
 
The fascination in virtual reality is the interactivity and intensive participation in the virtual 
world. According to Woodside, Sood and Miller (2008) storytelling plays an explicit role in 
marketing. The virtual reality allows its user experience the stories from a much more ex-
tensive perspective as in the original way of watching a screen, reading or listening. Ac-
cording to Marie-Laure Ryan (2001, 89), the virtual reality theorists Pimentel and Teixeira 
define immersion in the virtual world as a metaphor that positions itself with the most sig-
nificant requisite in the reading experience. Ryan (2001, 1) as a literary theorist proposes 
to transfer immersion and interactivity from technological to a literary domain and develop 
them into cornerstones of a phenomenology of reading or art of experiencing. According 
to a pilot study, the virtual reality increases emotional responses; the virtual reality gener-
ates stronger emotions and higher activation values than regular computer setting 
(Estupiñan, Rebelo, Noriega, Ferreira and Duarte, 2014). In other words, virtual reality 
amplifies the experience of the story being told.  
 
2.3 Innovation diffusion and disruptive innovations 
Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, Angwin, and Regnér (2014, 306) represent the innovation 
diffusion a process for innovations to spread or diffuse among the users. The pace of dif-
fusion can be presented with S-curve (see figure 3), which reflects a process of slow 
adoption of innovation resulting rapid acceleration (tipping point) to “plateau” suggesting 
the limit to demand. According Moore the tipping point comes after crossing the chasm in 
penetrating into majority markets. The tipping point is a situation where the demand for 
product or service abruptly takes off with explosive growth. When the value of the product 
or service is increased, the more people will use them. Malcolm Gladwell (2007, 33) men-
  
10 
tions rules for epidemic growth, which may be applied in this thesis. The law of the few 
has three unique groups of people to transmit the spread. First are the connectors, who 
have an extensive social network. As Gladwell (2007, 43) puts it: someone who knows 
everybody. The second group is called the mavens are experts who like to help and edu-
cate others (Gladwell 2007, 75). The third group is salesmen who have a talent for per-
suasion, to convince others of their needs, which even may not exist. However, the mes-
sage needs to be strong to enable epidemic growth (Gladwell 2007, 99-100). 
 
The stickiness is a rule of how well an idea or product stays in mind. We see many things 
in our daily lives, and there are things that “sticks” to mind better than others. There is an 
easy way to bundle information, which in right circumstances can make it irresistible. The 
trick is to find it (Gladwell 2007, 140). 
 
Regarding this thesis, the tipping point becomes evident when the McCann Helsinki Oy’s 
clients’ goals are demonstrably met, and organizations start virtual reality marketing ef-
forts in masses. In theory, the successful marketing efforts with earlier clients should gen-
erate more clients to use virtual reality as a marketing communication tool. There lies a 
danger of underestimation of demand by failing to anticipate the tipping point, which may 
lead to missed sales and may open a point for competition to capitalize situation. Hence, 
McCann should be ready to commence multiple projects and not lose their clients to com-
petition. During the “plateau” (see figure 2) the demand growth slows down. Johnson, 
Whittington, Scholes, Angwin, and Regnér (2014, 306-307) suggest avoiding heavy in-
vestments before growth turns down to avoid over-capacity and extra costs. The S-curve 
does not mean necessarily full extent of diffusion. Innovation does not always replace the 
older generation products. Virtual reality may not suffuse the older mediums, at least not 
in the near future. The tripping point (see figure 2) is the opposite for tipping point describ-
ing the declining of demand. Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, Angwin, and Regnér (2014, 
306-307) share the idea of “the Chasm” with Moore.  
 
According to Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, Angwin, and Regnér (2014, 308) being one 
of the first-movers allows the company to savor certain advantages, such as experience 
curve benefits, scale benefits and pre-emption of scarce resources, which refer to cost 
advantages. Reputation and buyer switching costs allow first-movers to charge high pric-
es. Being late-mover has few advantages as well. Free riding enables companies to imi-
tate innovation by 35 percent fewer expenses than the first-movers. By learning the late-
movers may monitor the functionalities of features of innovations, thus avoiding mistakes. 
Paul Geroski argues that most appropriate response to - radical – innovation is to be the 
“fast-second” instead of first-mover. The strategy behind this lies in imitating the original 
  
11 
innovator. Hence, the second-mover will not be the actual second company in markets but 
rather dominate the second wave of competition (Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, Angwin 
and Regnér 2014, 308-309). There are factors to consider whether to innovate or imitate. 
The importance of “capturing” the profits of own innovation depends on the ease of how 
the followers can imitate the original. Imitation is likely if the innovation itself is easy to 
duplicate. Also, the weak intellectual property rights of the innovation or difficulty in de-
fending them may facilitate emulation. Possessing the assets or resources to up-scale the 
production is critical. Such assets are called complementary assets. In fast-moving arenas 
where markets and technological development are moving fast, the first-mover is unlikely 
to gain a permanent advantage (Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, Angwin and Regnér 
2014, 309).

Figure 2. Diffusion of innovation (Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, Angwin and Regnér 
2014, 306) 
 
Innovation is usually an extended process of selection of ideas for change and converting 
them into successful reality according to Tidd and Bessant (2014, 16). The core consists 
of searching, choosing, implementing and capturing value. To remain organized and to be 
able to repeat it is the most significant challenge claims Tidd and Bessant (2014, 16). Fac-
tors the innovation needs to succeed are clear strategic leadership with direction, innova-
tive organization with structure and climate for people to share knowledge and creativity of 
the change. Proactive links across boundaries inside the organization and to external 
  
12 
agencies with a role in a process, which can be fathomed by a multidisciplinary network 
(Tidd and Bessant 2014, 76). The sources of innovation may be distributed into two broad 
classes: knowledge push and need pull, which usually are acting abreast. Innovation aris-
es from those two’s interaction. The need may indicate social or market needs. Regula-
tions are a shaper of innovations, which may establish new trajectories for change that 
may be exploited by entrepreneurs. Tidd and Bessant (2014, 156) remind that extrapolat-
ing on past trends, feedbacks from market segments and customers are desirable short 
and medium term forecasting method but fail to identify longer-term opportunities and con-
tingencies. 
 
Clayton Christensen introduced the term disruptive innovation in Harvard Business Re-
view 1995 (Bower and Christensen 1995). According to Christensen (2017), most estab-
lished companies are ahead in development and commercializing next-generation tech-
nologies to customers. Such organizations end up producing too complicated, sophisticat-
ed and expensive service and products in their markets. The virtual reality as a marketing 
communication tool may be a too complex entity for McCann Helsinki Oy’s clients and 
their (clients’) consumer customers. Customers’ needs may not be met due to emerging 
markets or niche markets and not being familiar with mainstream markets (Bower and 
Christensen 1995). According to Schmidt and Druehl (2008, 347), a disruptive innovation 
is a “new product is de-rated with regard to the primary performance dimension most ap-
preciated by mainstream customers of the old product.” A new product may perform better 
on optional dimension opening a new market. Sustaining innovation is the opposite. The 
new version, improvement or next tier product is called sustaining innovation. Moore 
(2014, 12) explains disruptive innovation as a situation where one needs to change cur-
rent behavior or to alter other products or services one is used to rely upon earlier. As an 
example, a flatscreen television in comparison to CRT television is a next tier sustaining 
innovation, whereas virtual reality as a disruptive innovation needs a headset and possibly 
other devices to use that are not customary for most people.  
 
The innovation may pose a threat to established companies, incumbents. According to 
Clayton Christensen, the problem for incumbents are that managers become too attached 
to existing assets or they become too close to their customers. The latter situation can be 
described as when current customers expect and prefer the incremental improvement of 
current technology and being unable to imagine entirely new technologies. Hence, incum-
bents may be reluctant to replace their existing business by introducing something pro-
foundly different (Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, Angwin, and Regnér 2014, 310). Disrup-
tive innovation creates new performance trajectory that may be substandard compared to 
existing technology but poses the potential to become evidently superior (see figure 4). 
  
13 
Such superior performance may generate substantial growth by creating customer seg-
ments and undercutting the cost base of competing already existing business models.  
 
 
Figure 3. Disruptive innovations vs. sustaining innovation timeline (chainreact.com 2017) 
 
Hence, according to Johnson, Whittington, Scholes, Angwin, and Regnér (2014, 310), it is 
hard for incumbents to adopt new technology due to poorer performance in early stage 
and usually need of changing the business model. 
 
2.4 Innovation-decision process and adopter categories 
Everett Rogers (2003, 168) describes the innovation-decision process as an information 
seeking and information-processing activity of an individual who is motivated to relieve 
contingency about the benefits and disadvantages of an innovation.   
 
Rogers (2003,169) mentions five stages of the innovation-decision process: Knowledge 
occurs when an individual is exposed to innovation and comprehends its functions. Per-
suasion happens when an individual forms an opinion towards innovation. Decision stage 
occurs when an individual engages the activities leading into choosing to adopt or reject 
the innovation. Implementation occurs when an individual sets the new idea in use. Con-
firmation takes place when individual reverse previous decision if exposed to conflicting 
messages after seeking reinforcements for decision (Rogers 2003, 169).  
 
  
14 
Knowledge includes three different subheadings: Awareness knowledge representing ac-
knowledging the existence of the innovation. How-to knowledge contains the correct use 
of technology, which according to Rogers (2003, 173) is essential variable in the innova-
tion-decision process. Last part is principle-knowledge, which describes how and why the 
innovation works.  
 
Persuasion stage appears when an individual has shaped negative or positive attitude 
towards an innovation after knowledge part (Rogers 2003, 174). All innovations carry 
some degree of uncertainty for individuals, who are typically indecisive of new idea's func-
tionality and looks for support from others to of his or her attitude toward innovation. 
Hence, an individual seeks social reinforcement from other individuals. The individual 
needs opinion of peers (Rogers 2003, 175). According to Rogers (2003, 176), the impact 
of either attitude does not always lead to adoption or desertion of innovation. Rogers dif-
ferentiates knowledge part as a cognitive-centered and persuasion stage more affective-
centered. Sahin (2006, 16) mentions that social reinforcements such as peers and col-
leagues, etc. affect on individual’s views towards the innovation.  
 
At decision stage individual either rejects or adopts the innovation. Adoption according to 
Rogers is adopting the innovation entirely “as the best course of action available,” and 
rejection is not adopting the innovation (Rogers 2003, 177). Sahin (2006, 16) says that 
partial trial basis of innovation speeds up the process due to an individual wanting to test 
innovation in their circumstances. Rogers stresses (2003, 177) that rejection may occur at 
any stage of the innovation-decision process. Rogers (2003, 178) mentions two different 
rejection models. Active rejection is an individual who considers of adopting the innovation 
but discards it later. Passive rejection is a situation when an individual is not even consid-
ering adopting an innovation. 
 
At implementation stage, an innovation is deployed. Sahin (2006, 17) mentions how the 
uncertainty of outcomes can be problematic at this stage. An individual may need tech-
nical assistance to reduce the uncertainty of results. Rogers (2003,180) mentions how 
reinvention often happens at this stage and is described as a degree to which innovation 
has been altered by adopter in the process of adoption and implementation. 
 
Confirmation stage is the last step, where a decision is made, but the individual is search-
ing looks for support for decision (Sahin 2006, 17). According to Rogers (2003, 189), the 
decision may be reversed if an individual is exposed to contradictory messages of innova-
tion. Sahin (2006, 17), however, mentions that individuals strive to stay clear of such mes-
sages and instead seeks approval and support to confirm their decision.

Rita Gunther McGrath (2013) wrote an article about how technology adoption rate has 
speeded up. The MIT’s technology review by Michael DeGusta (2012) explains how fast 
smartphones have spread during last ten years. People are adopting new technologies 
nowadays quicker than before. It means that even disruptive innovations are more easily 
adopted than before. 
 
Everett Rogers (2003, 22) refines adopter categories as “classification of members of a 
social system on the basis of innovativeness”. Adopter-classes are commonly used gen-
erally. The categories include innovators, early adopters, early majority, and laggards. 
“Innovativeness is the degree to which an individual or another unit of adoption is relative-
ly earlier in adopting new ideas than other members of a system” (Rogers 2003, 22). 
Rogers (2003, 282) dismisses the Moore’s (2014, 25) notion of “the Chasm” or “cracks in 
the bell curve” and emphasizes innovativeness as a continuous variable between the ad-
jacent adopter categories. Following paragraphs introduce the main characteristics and 
values of adopter categories as ideal types. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. The Bell curve – Adopter classes (Gearmark.com. 2013). 
 
Rogers (2003, 282) describes innovators with almost obsessive venturesomeness. They 
have a local circle of peer networks and have a cosmopolite social relationship due to 
their interest in new ideas. Hence, innovators are prepared to cope with a high degree of 
uncertainty about the innovation during the adoption.  Rogers (2003, 283) calls innovators 
as gatekeepers of innovations in bringing them in outside of the system. Innovators may 
  
16 
not be respected by other members of the social system due to their venturesomeness 
(Rogers 2003, 283). Moore calls (2014, 37) innovators technology enthusiasts, who adopt 
new technology for its sake. Moore (2014, 39) agrees with Rogers of innovators role as 
gatekeeper for new technology. Innovators do not pose significant markets (see figure 4.) 
but are taken heed in developing and testing innovations and technologies according to 
Moore (2014, 41).    
 
According to Rogers (2003, 283), the early adopters differ from innovators in being rather 
localities than cosmopolites and more integrated part of the local systems. Compared to 
other adopter categories they have the highest degree of opinion leadership in most sys-
tems. Rogers (2003, 283) describe early adopters as people who other adopters seek 
confirmation and acceptance before adopting new ideas. Gladwell (2007, 75) would most 
likely call such person a maven, whose motive is to educate and help others with their 
profound knowledge or salesman who persuades others (Gladwell 2007, 76). Sahin 
(2006) also points out that leadership of early adopter decreases the uncertainty of adopt-
ing innovation in the diffusion process. Also, the early adopter’s subjective evaluations 
about innovation of other members of the social system are reached via interpersonal 
networks (Sahin 2006). Moore calls early adopters visionaries, who seek dawning tech-
nology as a strategic opportunity (Moore 2014, 42). According Moore early adopters are 
not looking improvement but rather a fundamental breakthrough (Moore 2014, 43). Moore 
claims that early adopters are typically useful in promoting new technologies and ready to 
stand as a visible reference (Moore 2014, 44-45). The challenges the early adopters may 
pose can be unachievable expectations of an end product (Moore 2014, 45).  
 
Rogers (2003, 283) describe early majority deliberate, who adopt new ideas right before a 
typical member of the system. They frequently interact with their peers but rarely hold 
opinion leadership in a social system. Compared to innovators and early adopters the 
early majority innovation-decision period is proportionately long. They hardly lead in 
adopting innovation but follow with the deliberate willingness (Rogers 2003, 284). The 
early majority present the first half of the major markets and one-third of whole markets. 
Moore calls early majority pragmatists, who wish not to be the first in line to try innovation 
but instead seeks improvement and avoid taking risks. An improvement, which is possible 
to measure (Moore 2014, 54). Moore underlines that early majority is market-centric rather 
than product-centric by nature compared to early adopters, and are looking a whole and 
comprehensive product (Moore 2014, 170). A difference in communication between early 
adopters and early majority is that latter communicates vertically within their industry, 
whereas early adopter communicates horizontally throughout any sectors (Moore 2014, 
57). 
  
17 
 
Rogers (2003, 284) describe late majority as skeptical who adopts new ideas right after 
the average member of a system. They present the latter part of the majority markets, 
which contains one-third of the whole markets. Rogers (2003, 284) points out how the 
pressure of peers and economic compulsion leads them to adopt the innovation eventual-
ly.   Moore (2014, 59) calls late majority, conservatists. Moore describes late majority as 
people, who rather invest at the end of the technology life cycle in to complete product 
when the product is regarded commodity (Moore 2014, 60). Moore and Sahin share the 
notion of skepticism among the late majority. Moore points out that the late majority is 
focused on convenience rather than performance (Moore 2014, 62). Rogers (2003, 284) 
stresses the pressure of peers to motivate innovation adoption and how the weight of sys-
tem norms should favor an innovation before the late majority is assured. The most uncer-
tainty of a new idea should be removed before late majority feels safe to adopt due to their 
comparably scarce resources (Rogers 2003, 284).  
 
Rogers (2003, 284) describe laggards traditional who are the last to adopt an innovation in 
the social system without opinion leadership. They have the most local view and are se-
cluded in the social networks in their system (Rogers 2003, 284). As the points of refer-
ence are in the past, the laggards’ decisions are made according to previous deeds, and 
their interpersonal network consists mostly from the same members of the social system 
they are part of themselves (Rogers 2003, 284). By lacking the awareness-knowledge, the 
laggards wants to confirm the innovation functions before adopting it. Laggards’ innova-
tion-decision period comparably extended (Rogers 2003, 284). Moore calls laggards skep-
tics (Moore 2014, 66). Moore points out how skeptics are one-sixth of markets, thus pre-
senting small markets (Moore 2014, 66). According to Moore (2014,67), the laggards are 
skeptics because the product does not deliver what it promises at the time of purchase. 
As an example, the laggards would never use smartphones but rather rotary dial tele-
phones if they still existed. Rogers (2003, 284) argues that the “laggards” is bad name 
due to “non-laggards have a strong pro-innovation bias.”  
 
Reinhardt and Gurtner (2015) have researched the different characteristics of early 
adopters between disruptive and sustaining innovations. The results of the Reinhardt’s 
and Gurtner’s (2015, 137) study concludes that “early adopters of disruptive innovations 
possess in-depth knowledge of the product category”. Early adopters of sustaining innova-
tions are not more knowledgeable than late adopters. Early adopters are somewhat more 
involved in the product category (Reinhardt and Gurtner 2014, 138). The role of monetary 
resources is essential for two reasons according to Reinhardt and Gurtner (2014, 138). 
First, the disruptive innovation may be more expensive than the already existing product 
  
18 
but may introduce an additional execution dimension. Second, disruptive innovations sug-
gest a higher level of novelty to the market because of new performance dimension, which 
increases the risk for the adoption of consumers (Reinhardt and Gurtner 2014, 140). Re-
garding this thesis, the study of Reinhardt and Gurtner points out that characteristic of the 
potential client using virtual reality in marketing is a client who has some prior knowledge 
and possible experience of virtual reality. 
 
As Rogers (2003, 284) stated, laggards have the traditional view, and they are more skep-
tical about innovations and change agents than the late majority. As the most localized 
group of the social system, their interpersonal networks mainly consist of other members 
of the social system from the same category. Moreover, they do not have a leadership 
role. Because of the limited resources and the lack of awareness-knowledge of innova-
tions, they first want to make sure that innovation works before they adopt. Thus, laggards 
tend to decide after looking at whether other members of the social system successfully 
adopt the innovation in the past. Due to all these characteristics, laggards’ innovation-
decision period is relatively long. In addition to these five categories of adopters, Rogers 
(2003, 280-281) further described his five categories of adopters in two main groups: ear-
lier adopters and later adopters. Earlier adopters consist of innovators, early adopters, 
and early majority, while late majority and laggards comprise later adopters. Rogers iden-
tifies the differences between these two groups concerning socioeconomic status, per-
sonality variables, and communication behaviors, which usually are positively related to 
innovativeness. For instance, “the individuals or other units in a system who most need 
the benefits of a new idea (the less educated, less wealthy, and the like) are the last to 
adopt an innovation” (Rogers, 2003, 295). For Rogers, there was no significant difference 
in the age distribution of earlier adopters and later adopters, but this categorization and its 
characteristics are beyond this study.  
 
2.5 Target markets 
2016 Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality Survey Report (2016) predicts that virtual 
reality and augmented reality are within 10 years tens of billions of dollars businesses. 
Such claim indicates that virtual reality, not only in marketing but also in any sense has 
not yet penetrated the majority markets. However, there have been some marketing ef-
forts implemented with virtual reality already, such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, New York 
Times and Volvo only a few to mention. Assuming that the innovator stage has been 
passed and the early majority has not been reached yet, it may be assumed that the early 
adopter stage is most fitting at present (end of 2017) by reflecting these assumptions.  
 
  
19 
Assuming the virtual reality in marketing is at the early adopter stage or currently shifting 
there. The first stage has been the innovator stage who are only interested of the innova-
tions due to the technology itself (Moore 2014, 37), but they may have little use such in-
novations and pose small markets (Moore 2014, 41). The second stage is the early 
adopters that are a visionary type of people, who seeks an opportunity to find strategic 
leverage of technology. According to Moore (2014, 43) the key point is to understand that 
visionaries are not looking for improvement but rather a fundamental breakthrough. To 
fulfill the high expectations of visionary’s vision may prove difficult or even impossible. The 
company needs careful account management and high level of communication with the 
client. Hence, it is essential to have a project-orientated approach with milestones and 
phases to get small successes and show to a client the project is developing. Some mile-
stones may turn out valuable as desirable product extension, even though it is not the final 
product in the eyes of the visionary. The management of expectations is crucial. Often the 
expectations can be infeasible but controlling demands of visionary and keeping the 
phases within reason and provide at the end concrete return on investment to celebrate a 
leap of development. To succeed in bringing a product one needs to start the small niche 
and make them successful. By up-scaling too early, things may spread too wide to control 
without having the finished product (Moore 2014, 47). To understand how to market early 
adopters, one needs to comprehend their vision (Moore 2014, 43) 
 
Customers and clients do not buy products but instead, solutions for their problems or 
trying to mitigate hindrances as Justin Wilcox (2017) describe buying decisions. Therefore 
it is natural to find out clients with specific distress the client is facing and understanding 
whether the product relieves the problem. As Justin Wilcox (Wilcox 2017) puts it that the 
most potential early adopter customers are the ones that have the problem, know they 
have it and are continually seeking a solution for it. The ones that are seeking resolution 
are the most potential client’s (Wilcox 2017) and present opportunity to identify them. 
Those are client’s that are active on different forums (Wilcox 2017), such as different so-
cial media's (Twitter, LinkedIN, etc.). Regarding virtual reality in marketing as disruptive 
innovation, such behavior could be a B2B client, who is open-minded (in marketing), tech-
nology focused and ready to implement inconvenient marketing efforts.  
 
According Porter (1985, 63) technology gives access to competitive advantage if it pro-
vides a significant role in defining relative cost position or differentiation. According Porter 
(1985, 63) “technology will affect cost or differentiation if it influences the cost driver or 
drivers of the uniqueness of value activities.” Technology may turn out a policy cost driver 
for its sake, but it can also affect other drivers, such as scale and location. By achieving 
an advantage in differentiation, the technological development does not necessarily mean 
  
20 
scientific breakthroughs.  Mundane changes in activities may prove sufficient (Porter 
1985, 63). According to Porter’s five forces, which alter markets, the substitute part is the 
most commonly described effect of technology (Porter 1985, 65). Virtual reality could be 
considered as a substitute medium regarding, for example, TV and radio. Porter warns 
that not always new technology improve industry structure but may as well enough have 
an utterly opposite effect. To improve industry profitability the technological change needs 
to raise entry barriers, eliminate dominant suppliers or insulate the industry from substi-
tutes. On the other hand, if the technological change leads to more buyer power or lowers 
entry barriers it may as well destroy the industry attractiveness (Porter 1985, 66). As for 
technology strategy, which reflects the company’s approach to technological develop-
ment, there are three issues to address: what technology or which technologies to devel-
op, whether or not to seek technological leadership in those technologies and investigate 
to a possibility of licensing the technology. Each area should be based on an enhance-
ment of company’s sustainable competitive advantage (Porter 1985, 66). The company 
should discover the type of competitive advantage the company is trying to achieve. To 
figure this out according to Porter (1985, 66) the company should focus on the technolo-
gies that would most contribute to a company’s general strategy. 
 
According Moore (2014, 18) one cannot jump over any psychographic groups, and it is 
necessary to “capture” each group and use it as a reference base. Therefore each step 
should be processed accordingly. To reach majority markets one needs to get over “the 
Chasm” according to Moore, which is between the early markets and majority markets. To 
penetrate the majority markets of the early majority the characteristics of such clients 
Moore describes the pragmatists. Pragmatists need fully working and accomplished prod-
uct to stay as a top technology using company. Pragmatists need even stronger reference 
base than visionaries and usually are using preferably market leader with a proven prod-
uct. Pragmatist’s wishes are not to be the first in line to adopt new technologies but are 
rather following closely the development and adopting it if it proves functional Moore 
(Moore 2014, 55). In other words, the pragmatists avoid risks. They are ready to approach 
if it is measurably profitable according to Moore. Hence, the pragmatists are not expecting 
strategic leap as the previous psychographic group of early adopters – visionaries. The 
enhancement of innovation may turn out sufficient (Moore 2014, 55).  
 
A practical way to increase knowledge of technology and make it attractive according to 
the law of the few (Gladwell 2007, 35), is to get a so-called connector, maven or salesman 
interested and spread the idea of the issue at hand (virtual reality in this case). Such per-
son or organization should have good connections in a certain niche and convince others 
of superiority or practicality of issue at hand. Such could be an organization that is fore-
  
21 
run-ner or pioneer in utilizing technology and preferably unconventional marketing efforts 
successfully. A stickiness effect can utilize in understanding how to bundle virtual reality in 
context with marketing efforts and its potential. As Gladwell (2007, 140) mentions it clearly 
that information in right circumstances may become irresistible. Also, the power of context 
theory works best when virtual reality is associated with marketing and innovative way to 
utilize it. However, epidemic growth concerns penetrating in majority markets and is de-
pendent on references, which in this thesis’ case is next step after acquiring potential ear-
ly adopters.  Moore also mentions epidemic growth by calling it “bowling pin” theory, 
where one segment is targeted to “knock over” not just one segment but moving to next 
segment by creating a market expansion (Moore 2014, 50).  
 
Burns, Veeck, and Bush (2017, 38) describe how one needs to identify possible market 
opportunities. Which products and ideas generate a return on investment and can be ac-
complished? To determine the possibilities, one needs to understand them. In selecting 
target markets Burns, Veeck, and Bush (2017, 39) point out that understanding the evolu-
tion of the market segment and how competition is succeeding in fulfilling needs of a mar-
ket segment. In case notable segment has distinct needs according to Burns, Veeck, and 
Bush (2017, 39), it indicates the segment is growing and whether the demands are not 
sated or being met poorly by competition, the segment may grow an ideal prospect for a 
target market. Next question becomes how well the company can satisfy the segment's 
demand and does the company has enough required core competencies. As mentioned 
earlier the virtual reality has not been used seemingly much but it is neither unknown.  
Marketing channels are evolving and McCann Helsinki Oy is discovering ways to use vir-
tual reality in marketing. The competition is not intensive during this study. 
 
There are some significant contemporary challenges the marketers face during the year 
2017. The results are collected from Mimi An’s survey made for HubSpot (2017). The 
challenges are listed as most challenging first: 
−    Generating traffic and leads 
−    Proving return on investment (ROI) of marketing activities 
−    Securing enough budget  
−    Identifying the right technologies to use 
−    Managing website 
−    Targeting content for an international audience 
−    Team training 
−    Hiring top talent 
−    Finding an executive sponsor

Regarding this thesis the most viable challenges the author chose were generating leads, 
proving return on investment of marketing activities and targeting content for an interna-
tional audience. Outside the list, the author decided contacting new segments, which is 
rather close to targeting content for the international audience. The chosen challenges 
may be related to virtual reality as a communication channel assumed by the author. As 
an example, the leads and traffic, an international audience, new segments may be gen-
erated by creating interesting content by using virtual reality. Proving return on investment 
of marketing activities may be difficult and therefore turn out hindrance for adopting virtual 
reality as a marketing communication tool.

3 Research methods 
Burns, Veeck and Bush (2017, 34) describe marketing research as part of marketing. 
Over the past years, the idea of marketing is that companies should learn from their cus-
tomers and collaborate with them to adjust to their changing needs (Burns, Veeck and 
Bush 2017, 34). The focus on marketing research is to help McCann Helsinki Oy to make 
a decision, whether or not to pursue marketing communication via virtual reality to their 
existing clients and potential clients (Burns, Veeck and Bush 2017, 37).  
 
This study is mostly using quantitative research but also with qualitative elements. The 
qualitative method provides the context necessary to figure out individual’s actions, opin-
ions and emotions. Also, the qualitative research delivers the notion that cannot be found 
in quantitative research (Burns, Veeck and Bush 2017, 143). As the emphasis in qualita-
tive methods is in understanding the respondent's point of view, whereas the quantitative 
method is focused on facts or reason for the social event. Also, the research is structured 
and measurement is controlled, which are characteristics of quantitative research (Ghauri 
and Grønhaug 2010, 105). The survey result is oriented and trying to discover patterns of 
behavior in statistical sense, which can be measured (Ghauri and Grønhaug 2010, 104).  
The main reason to choose quantitative research method was that the author wanted to 
keep the survey as approachable as possible. The survey respondents were mostly exec-
utive-level managers who do not have very much spare time to use. Also. The author fig-
ured that most of the answers could be predetermined. Also, the purpose of research is 
specific, to discover the market potential for virtual reality for marketing communication 
and respondent’s technology adoption habits (Burns, Veeck and Bush 2017, 144).

Figure 6. Research design 
 
3.1 Descriptive research  
There are three different main research designs: explanatory, descriptive and causal re-
search. They vary from structured to unstructured research designs (Ghauri and 
Grønhaug 2010, 55-56).  
 
Descriptive research understands the problem well and is structured. Burns, Veeck, and 
Bush (2017, 98-99) point out that descriptive research is conducted when the need is to 
identify the customers, their buying habits (what brands, quantities, time of purchase and 
awareness).  The researcher prepares sampling plan, which includes the amount and 
segment of who to interview. Assuming there is a survey, the questions are measure-
ments. The measurements are the data to analyze in discussion part. According to Ghauri 
(2010, 57) and Grønhaug, the interviews should be conducted the same to avoid biases. 
Descriptive research may include plenty of variables. According to Burns, Veeck and Bush 
there are two basic types of studies. The first one is cross-sectional studies that “measure 
units from a sample of the population interest at only one point in time.” Sample surveys 
are cross-sectional studies that are sampled to represent specific population (Burns, 
Veeck and Bush 2017, 99). The second type is a longitudinal study that measures same 
units of population repeatedly over a specified period. The longitudinal research requires 
data from same members of a sample, which are called panels. Such panels should be 
committed contributing information at regular time frame (Burns, Veeck and Bush 2017, 
  
25 
99). For this particular study, the author chose a descriptive cross-sectional study due to 
the suitability of a research problem and market opportunity. 
 
3.2 Data collection 
There are two different forms of data to be collected: primary data and secondary data. 
Secondary data is information collected by others for possibly different purposes than the 
current project at hand. The secondary data has been collected from appropriate books, 
e-books, articles and surveys. A primary data is the actual data collected for this particular 
project’s problem at hand, which is implemented by a survey (Ghauri and Grønhaug 2010, 
90).  
 
3.2.1 Secondary data 
Secondary data is used to understand and solve research problem at hand. The re-
searcher seeks information about the topic and other studies regarding the research prob-
lem. For this particular thesis, the secondary data have issued innovation adoption life-
cycle, difference between disruptive and sustaining innovations, and innovation diffusion 
theories. Virtual reality as a marketing communication tool has quite minimal case studies. 
Most of the secondary data has been collected for different purposes than this particular 
study (Ghauri and Grønhaug 2010, 90). The secondary data has been helping to answer 
the investigative questions eventually leading answer to the research problem. Also, the 
secondary data have been the base for the questionnaire and helping to choose quantita-
tive research method (Ghauri and Grønhaug 2010, 91). The secondary data may assist in 
understanding and interpret the primary data. By combining the secondary and primary 
data the answer to research problem may be discovered. According to Ghauri and 
Grønhaug (2010, 94), many scholars recommend starting with secondary data sources, 
which was the order the author of this thesis chose to follow. 
 
3.2.2 Primary data 
The primary data of this thesis is collected from the McCann Helsinki Oy’s clients and oth-
er potential clients. The options to collect primary data are via communication or observ-
ing, which both have advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that it is ob-
tained for the designated project at hand. Hence, it yields consistent data for the research 
question. Especially in this study the attitudes and possible intentions towards virtual reali-
ty as a marketing communication tool, the primary data is only way to answer research 
  
26 
question (Ghauri and Grønhaug 2010, 99-100). The main disadvantages regarding this 
thesis are merely lack of time of respondents, possible negative consequences of their 
honest answers and anxiety of embarrassment regarding sensitive issues (Ghauri and 
Grønhaug 2010, 100). Hence, the questionnaire is rather short and it takes only from one 
to two minutes to answer. The respondents may also answer anonymously.  
 
The questionnaire is covering all types of primary data. Status data answers the age and 
gender questions. Psychological and lifestyle data answers personality and behavior. The 
study is concentrating on organizations, but the respondents are usually executive level 
decision makers, whose personality may affect on organizational behavior. Attitude and 
opinion data give inclination how the respondents feel towards technology adoption in 
general and also virtual reality. Awareness and knowledge data indicates how well are 
respondents familiar with virtual reality as a concept. The data of intentions and motiva-
tions is most interesting regarding the commission company due to their interest whether 
or not to commence marketing activities with virtual reality as a communication tool and 
what is the primary stimuli for the respondent. 
  
3.2.3 Questionnaire design 
Burns, Veeck, and Bush (2017, 205) explain about measurement that marketing research 
is based on mainly. It is “defined as determining a description or quantity of some property 
of an object that is of interest to the researcher.” Burns, Veeck, and Bush pointed out that 
properties are the one to measure and they describe properties as a particular attributes 
or characteristics of an object that may be differentiated from another object. Properties 
may be divided into objective and subjective features. Objective properties can be ob-
served and concrete, whereas subjective is the opposite. Both should be translated to a 
rating scale via a process of scale development (Burns, Veeck and Bush 2017, 206). The 
different measures are nominal measures, ordinal measures, scale measures. Nominal 
measures possess merely characteristic of the type. Such question types are often about 
gender, religion, dwelling, race and so forth. Ordinal measures allow a researcher to rank 
the order of the respondent or their reply. Such questions often include prioritizing sub-
jects (Burns, Veeck, and Bush 2017, 206). 
 
Scale measures include a number of different measurement types. Scale measures are 
measuring known levels between distances. First one is ratio scale, which includes true 
zero and allows constructing ratios to compare results. Second is the interval scale, which 
is used to measure subjective attributes. To measure individual properties of consumers, 
one needs to understand the direction and intensity of impression in an understandable 
  
27 
manner, which can be implemented by interval scales. Such scales are being called work-
horse scales due to majority part of the marketing research according to Burns, Veeck, 
and Bush (2017, 209).  
 
Likert scale is commonly used by marketing researchers and was also chosen into this 
thesis’ questionnaire. The Likert scale indicates the degree of agreement or disagreement 
with the statement. For this thesis understanding the attitudes and feelings towards virtual 
reality, marketing is essential, thus making Likert scale ideal part of the questionnaire. A 
semantic scale, on the other hand, does not suit as well as the Likert scale due to its suit-
ability for measuring companies, brands or store images. It works better in comparing two 
different objects (Burns, Veeck and Bush 2017, 209-210).  
 
The questionnaire is based on investigative questions and secondary data. The survey 
includes the familiarity of virtual reality in general, which involves respondent’s knowledge 
of the virtual reality. The nominal alternatives in question vary between unawareness and 
frequent or occasional user. This part answers to the first investigative question regarding 
respondent’s awareness of virtual reality. 
 
Next part answers to the second investigative question regarding the challenges in mar-
keting and possible benefits in virtual reality marketing. The questions regard organiza-
tions’ and respondent’s interest towards virtual reality, and whether or not virtual reality 
supports the organization’s brand and does respondent see virtual reality creating new 
opportunities in marketing, which are formed by both nominal measure and interval scale 
measure questions. Also, whether the respondents see virtual reality posing more threats 
than creating opportunities is conducted by nominal measure question. Following part is 
using Likert scale measure and it includes different scenarios of possible marketing chal-
lenges the organizations may face and how well they have succeeded with them.   
 
Last part answers to a third investigative question regarding readiness to use new market-
ing technology (virtual reality in this case). This part of the survey seeks to discover the 
organization’s technology adoption habits and respondents’ technology adoption category 
(see part 2.4). Also, this part includes the respondent’s opinion of virtual reality’s role in 
people’s everyday lives in general. The answer may indicate respondent’s receptivity to-
ward virtual reality. In this part, the nominal measure questions are applied. 
 
The questions regarding the specific organization and respondent’s title are not included 
due to the inconvenience of personal views of certain issues, which may be not in line with 
the organization’s policies. The virtual reality in the questionnaire regards to virtual reality 
  
28 
as marketing communication media. The questions about the age and gender are includ-
ed in the survey.

4 Results and analysis 
This part introduces the results of the survey with the interpretation of survey answers. 
The results are presented by each investigative question separately. 
 
4.1 Respondents 
The survey was sent to over 200 recipients of McCann Finland Oy and other companies 
potential to use virtual reality for marketing communication. The population was nearly 
sufficient for academic research, but as a number of responses were 38, the interpretation 
should be kept restrained. Hence, making clear implications is not possible. Careful indi-
cations may be performed due to generic nature of the survey to understand the general 
views of respondents towards virtual reality as a marketing communication tool. 
 
The companies’ lines of businesses and sizes varied a lot. To introduce some respond-
ent's lines of businesses the survey was sent to: 
Real estate, law, media companies, wholesale business’, interior design companies, fi-
nancial, HoReCa, Start Up’s, software companies, car dealers, human resource and labor 
hire companies, marketers, accounting companies, associations, insurance companies, 
waste management and logistics. The companies included companies that are interna-
tionally involved and some Swedish companies. 
 
Figure 7. Age distribution. 
76 percent of respondents were males and 24 percent females. The age distribution was 
following (see figure 7): 
  
30 
8% of respondents were 20-29, 58% were aged between 30-39, 26% were aged between 
40-49, 5% were 50-59 year old and 3% were over 60 years old. 
 
4.2 Awareness of virtual reality  
Over 60 percent have personal experiences and over 30 percent understands the concept 
covering 95 percent of the whole population (see figure 8). 
 
 
Figure 8. Question: How familiar are you with a concept virtual reality?  
 
Hence, the general awareness of the whole population of the survey is well aware. None 
of the respondents were completely unfamiliar with virtual reality and small share (5 per-
cent) had heard about the virtual reality but did not comprehend the overall view. 
 
4.3 Challenges in marketing and benefits of virtual reality 
The dispersion was apparent regarding the virtual reality supporting the organization’s 
brand (see figure 9). Hence, there were no strong indications in any direction to make a 
further assumption. However, the 39 percentages agreed virtual reality supporting their 
organization’s brand, which is notable amount. 
 
  
31 
 
Figure 9. Does virtual reality support the brand of your company? 
 
The 43 percent strongly agreed and 51 percent agreed on virtual reality as a gateway to 
access opportunities in marketing according to answers (see figure 10.).  
 
 
Figure 10. Do you agree? ”Virtual reality is a gateway to access new opportunities in mar-
keting?” 
 
The result indicated a strong market potential for virtual reality as a marketing communica-
tion tool (see figure 10). Hence, the population of the survey was rather small making ac-
  
32 
curate assumption impossible. However, reflecting results, the respondent’s saw virtual 
reality in beneficial by creating new opportunities in marketing. 
 
58 percent did not agree virtual reality was posing more threats than opportunities. 18 
percent both strongly disagreed or did not have an opinion.  
 
 
Figure 11. Do you agree? ”Virtual reality poses more threats rather than creates opportu-
nities?” 
  
Not having an opinion may be a result of not comprehending feelings toward virtual reality. 
All in all, respondents mainly saw virtual reality beneficial in creating opportunities rather 
than threats (see figure 11). 
 
An open question “If you answered strongly agree or agree (in question [Do you agree? 
”Virtual reality poses more threats rather than creates opportunities?”]), could you explain 
why shortly?”  
 
There were two valid open answers regarding attitudes towards virtual reality. One re-
spondent's answer indicated a positive attitude towards virtual reality as a next big ad-
vancement after Internet in using technology in peoples’ everyday lives. Another respond-
ent gave an impression that virtual reality is not at all important and does not wish to have 
a part in it. 
 
  
33 
The virtual reality may be medium that could help contacting new segments. 39 percent 
had a bit challenges in contacting new segments, whereas 34 percentage found it chal-
lenging. Different companies have different challenges, which may be a cause of diversity 
of segments. In some companies, the segmentation may be narrower than in others and it 
may also depend on the variation of products or services the organization provides. 11 
percent could not tell about challenges in contacting new segments, which may be a 
cause of respondent’s role in the organization; the person may not have access to actual 
data. The mean in challenges (1 stands for no challenges and 5 stands for major chal-
lenges) is 2.74, and 2.42 with success, which in both cases was situated close to midsec-
tion (see figure 12 and table 2).

Figure 12. How well your organization's marketing efforts have succeeded to overcome 
the mentioned challenges? 
 
Challenges regarding traffic and leads were following a similar pattern with previous chal-
lenges (contacting segments). The virtual reality may create traffic and by simply creating 
interesting content. 37 percent had a bit challenges in creating traffic and leads and 26 
percent found it challenging. 21 percent could not tell, which may be caused by respond-
ent's position in the organization or simply not knowing the matter. Organizations with ma-
jor problems and without any problems both were 8 percent (see table 2). The mean in 
challenges is 2.89, and 2.55 with success (see figure 12). 
 
39 percent of the population could not tell about the challenges in targeting content for an 
international audience, which may be a cause of the companies’ lack of international busi-
ness or the businesses may have independent branch offices in other countries. However, 
24 percent found it challenging and 5 percent very challenging, which may indicate diffi-
culties in creating enough international content or not understanding the international 
markets. The mean in challenges is 2.79, and 3.03 with success. 8 percent overcame the 
challenges very well, 16 percent quite well, 47 percent could not tell, 24 percent poorly 
and 5 percent very poorly (see table 2 and figure 12). 
 
4.4 Readiness to utilize new marketing technology  
The interest in virtual reality was quite dispersed (see figure 13). Hence, 50 percent of 
respondents answered virtual reality was bringing additional value to the company, and 21 
  
35 
percent mentioned their company being involved somehow with virtual reality already. 18 
percent were interested but could not fathom any additional value for the company. 11 
percentage were not interested at all in virtual reality. 
 
 
 
Figure 13. How interested is your organization about virtual reality? 
 
The 50 percent of the population answered being eager to benefit from new technologies 
(see figure 14) but not wishing to be the first to try them. By not wanting to be the first in-
dicates according to Moore (2014, 55) early majority, pragmatists, who seek references 
before shifting to new technology. 45 percent of the population claimed readiness in taking 
risks in getting strategic leverage, which according to Moore (2014, 42) indicates to early 
adopters, the visionaries. 5 percent of respondents mentioned being one of the last ones 
in adopting new technologies, which indicates to late majority. None of the respondents 
agreed to stay away from new technologies. 
  
36 
 
Figure 14. Question: How long does it usually take for your organization to use new tech-
nologies? 
 
The answers regarding general attitude towards the virtual reality and how did the re-
spondent fathom the role of virtual reality in people’s lives in near future were indicating 
positively towards virtual reality. 34 percent strongly agreed, and 55 percentages agreed 
virtual reality’s role in helping people in everyday lives, which inclined to readiness for 
people to use virtual reality in their personal lives (see figure 15). The small minority did 
not agree, which most likely shows lack of readiness to use virtual reality in their everyday 
lives in near future. 
 
 
 
  
37 
Figure 15. Question: Do you agree? ”Virtual reality helps people in everyday lives in near 
future” 
 
There were two joint questions, which should have followed a somewhat same pattern 
(see figures 14 and 16). Hence, they are not precisely similar. However, both questions 
tried to figure out the technology adoption habits. 24 percentage mentioned being among 
the first in adopting technologies. The average between questions 3 and 5 of early 
adopters was 34.5 percentage. The gap between answers was quite large, thus making 
accurate assumptions not possible. 66 percent claimed to adopt technologies after refer-
ences, which indicated pragmatists. The mean between question 3 and 5 regarding prag-
matists was 58 percent. The late majority of respondents were 8 percent who were happy 
with current technology and ready to move on after the next technology is proven, afford-
able and reliable. 3 percent answered not being interested and adopting after the technol-
ogy becomes necessary. The last part was described as laggards. 
 
The lines of businesses were affecting the answers the author assumed. As an example, 
start-up companies can be more accustomed to new technologies compared to law firms, 
which competencies are not directly related to technology.  
 
 
Figure 16. Question: Which of following types describes your organization best? 
 
Difficulties in proving return on investments may restrain the organization’s engagement 
for new operations, such as taking up virtual reality as a new marketing communication 
tool. 11 percent had no challenges, 32 percent of respondents had a bit challenges in 
proving return on investment in marketing efforts. 29 percent did not know or could not tell 
the issue, which may be a cause of their position in the organization. Such information 
  
38 
would probably need some expertise in analyzing the marketing efforts and having access 
to appropriate data. 21 percent found the return on investment challenging and 8 percent 
had significant difficulties. The mean in challenges is 2.84, and 284 (1 stands for no chal-
lenges and 5 for major challenges) with success of marketing efforts. 11 percent over-
came the challenges very well, 26 percent quite well, 37 percent could not tell, 21 percent 
poorly and 5 percent very poorly. 
 
An open question about other challenges the organizations are facing yielded 9 answers. 
 
”Channels” 
The answer may indicate challenges in choosing the most suitable marketing channels to 
optimize the success of marketing efforts. 
 
“Increasing the level of marketing expertise in own industry, so that a small marketing 
budget can be used as efficiently as possible” 
The answer is quite clear and emphasizes on optimizing small budget. 
 
“All the offered marketing is unqualified. The best solution would be an in-house profes-
sional, who stays up to date regarding technology and motivated.” 
The answer may indicate to the unsatisfied organization regarding external marketing ef-
forts and would prefer internal staff in managing marketing efforts with excellent know-
how.  
 
“Our marketing is very targeted, and we do not exercise so-called mass marketing.” 
It may be assumed that respondent refers to well-managed marketing efforts without mar-
keting to unwanted segments. 
 
“The goals of marketing vary, and often aim for a long period, thus proving return on in-
vestment challenging.” 
The answer indicates that proving return on investment may be challenging as well as 
goals in marketing. The key could be understanding the purpose of each marketing effort, 
thus figuring out the key performance indicators. 
 
“Our company is still young and on a search of identity both in marketing and products. 
Also, the market is still young and growing, so the work is still underway.” 
The answer may indicate to a start-up company that has not yet had marketing efforts. 
 
  
39 
“Targeting of marketing efficiently to the right target group is still relatively challenging, 
although social media has greatly improved the situation.” 
The answer is rather clear and leaves very little analysis. 
 
“Lack of motivation.” 
The answer is clear and leaves very little analysis. 
 
“Marketing is shifting into social media.” 
The respondent view is clear. 
 
Open question: “You can write here anything else you wish to say regarding virtual reali-
ty.” 
The question is open and answers indicate readiness to adopt virtual reality in marketing. 
N 6. 
 
“Very good possibilities.” 
The answer possibly indicates virtual reality posing good possibilities regarding marketing 
efforts. 
 
“It (virtual reality) comes when comes and it does not revolutionize my world.” 
The answer indicates indifference towards virtual reality. 
 
“I believe in VR's possibilities, but high-quality production is still too expensive for the ver-
satile use.” 
The respondent considers virtual reality marketing efforts too expensive. 
 
“AR (augmented reality) will probably be a bigger thing than virtual reality.” 
The answer is clear. The author regarded augmented reality in this study as a sub-class of 
virtual reality. 
 
“The closer to this practice is our business google’s my business application the ""walk in 
the possible."" 
The respondent possibly prefers Google’s My Business application over virtual reality. 
 
“Virtual unreality.” 
The respondent may not be interested in virtual reality by any means.

5 Discussion 
This part includes key findings of the research, recommendations for the commissioning 
company, challenges and limitations of the study, and self-evaluation. 
5.1 Key findings 
Respondents were well aware of virtual reality, and the majority had used it already. Re-
spondents’ attitudes towards virtual reality were positive and many approved virtual reali-
ty’s role as part of peoples everyday lives.  
 
Most of the respondents concur with a notion of virtual reality creating opportunities in 
marketing. However, not all agreed virtual reality to support their organization’s brand. 
Half of the organizations were interested in virtual reality and found it bringing additional 
value to their organization. One fifth was already using virtual reality in some way. 
 
Half of the respondents were eager to benefit from new technologies but does not wish to 
be among the first. In other words, those respondents are reference oriented, thus not 
potential early adopters but rather potential early majority. A bit less than the other half 
claimed to have the readiness to take a risk in getting strategic leverage over the new 
technology. Those answers may indicate desire rather than actual deeds.  
 
Two-thirds answered that their organization wants to use newest technologies but only 
after references. One forth mentioned their organization to be among the first in acquiring 
the innovations and technologies, which may be the actual technology adoption habit.  
 
The challenges in marketing efforts were diverse. Most had challenges and a bit challeng-
ing in contacting new segments, and generating traffic and leads. In proving return on 
investment, the majority had a bit challenges and no challenges at all. However, one-third 
could not tell. One open comment regarded how measuring return on investment may be 
challenging due to different purposes of marketing. 
 
Open answers indicated that some respondents strive to target marketing more efficiently 
and how social media has been helping with it. Also, that marketing is shifting towards 
social media. The augmented reality was mentioned to be a bigger thing that virtual reali-
ty. The high costs of virtual reality productions were mentioned and may be an obstacle to 
utilize virtual reality.  
 
  
41 
Interestedly the most potential clients are close to 13,16 percentage, which is close to the 
percentage of the early adopters of the whole population in Bell curve (see figure 4). 
Those respondents were most receptive towards virtual reality and their technology adop-
tion habits were in line with early adopters characteristics. 
 
There was little opposition towards virtual reality but rather marginal altogether.  
 
5.2 Recommendations 
The secondary data gave a good base for the thesis and the author figured out that virtual 
reality is most likely at early adopters stage or shifting there. That indicates that markets 
for virtual reality as a marketing communication tool exists and people are aware and in-
terested in it. Also, people feel in general that there is good potential for virtual reality in 
marketing and it may also have quite a large role in people’s lives. That means people are 
ready to engage virtual reality in theory, even though it is at this point (years 2017-2018) 
disruptive innovation by nature. There are implications that people are more ready to 
adopt new technologies these days compared before (McGrath 2013).  
 
The most likely market segment is early adopters who seek strategic leverage despite the 
risks. Many of respondents mentioned having traits that may be interpreted as distinctive 
behavior for early adopters. 50 to 66 percent of respondents are interested in engaging 
new technologies but only after it has proven. As the bell curve (see figure 5) shows that 
early majority is about one-third of whole markets; there may be massive opportunities 
after succeeding with early adopters and using them as preferences. 
 
People seem to be interested in more accurate segment targeting and are using social 
media quite much. Also proving return on investment is challenging and this may pose 
difficulties to engage new mediums. The author believes that carefully planned virtual real-
ity marketing efforts may be efficient in targeting different segments, both domestic and 
international. The return on investment should be proven to lower the engagement factor 
to justify the new marketing medium for organizations.  
 
The author strongly recommends the commissioning company to commence marketing 
efforts for virtual reality as a marketing communication tool. There is considerable interest 
towards virtual reality and there surely will be a prominent rivalry. However, people’s ac-
tions are not always following their desires, which in this case mean their answers. Virtual 
reality and all its parallel or subclasses are likely to be part of people’s lives in some form 
during next years, and marketing usually follows those trends.  
  
42 
 
5.3 Challenges and limitations 
The main difficulty during the thesis process has been the novelty factor of the virtual re-
ality. Virtual reality has been around for a long time but is showing some potential as me-
dium lately. Therefore there has been very little material and case studies regarding virtual 
reality in marketing. Even though the same theories may be applied in virtual reality like in 
old mediums the virtual reality is disruptive by nature. Hence, the theories should be used 
differently compared to older mediums. 
 
The original plan of the survey was to execute it during virtual reality and other marketing 
technology introduction events provided by the case company, but preparations did not 
make it in time for this thesis. The population of the survey would most likely have been 
higher. The survey was executed via the Internet, but the total population stayed rather 
low, not making possible to make accurate conclusions by primary research. 
 
The survey itself was satisfactory, but it could have been conducted even better. Some 
questions could have been better formulated. For example, threats and opportunities are 
not opposites and therefore may be challenging to answer. Also, marketing challenges 
and success in overcoming them as separate questions could have been confusing in the 
quantitative survey. The question about gender could have included one more alternative. 
Nowadays there are so-called trans-genders and other variations of genders, which could 
have had an option to choose from, for the sake of the sexual equality. The author would 
have wanted to ask more questions, but after considering that segment of the population 
as executive level managers, the author decided to keep the survey short and easy to 
engage. The author also considered the possibility of changing the research method from 
quantitative to qualitative after discovering that the population will stay low. However, the 
author discarded the idea and stayed in the original plan because many executive level 
managers are too busy to give thorough interviews as qualitative interview usually takes 
more time than a quantitative survey. Also, the author did not want to postpone the gradu-
ation. 
5.4 Self-evaluation 
The process was one significant challenge and seeing it through the author had to put all 
his energy to complete it. The author asked many times why did he not choose something 
more straightforward project, but could not fail himself by giving up. Instead, the author 
decided to continue despite the challenges. He studied fascinating theories and collected 
  
43 
a vast knowledge of innovations and adoption of innovations. The enormous learning ex-
perience has paved way for authors career plan of being involved in marketing especially 
in start-ups, which often include disrupted innovations.

Appendices 
Appendix 1. Cover letter for the thesis (Finnish) 
Hei, 
 
Olet varmaan kuullut mainittavan virtuaalitodellisuudesta. Virtuaalitodellisuus saattaa mul-
listaa maailmaa monin tavoin. Markkinoinnin saralla virtuaalitodellisuus voi synnyttää uu-
sia mahdollisuuksia mm. kommunikoida erilaisten kohderyhmien kanssa. 
 
Osallistuthan lyhyeen markkinointiteknologia-aiheiseen kyselyyn tästä, joka on osa 
opinnäytetyöprojektia. Vastaamiseen menee 1-2 minuuttia. Osallistujien kesken arvotaan 
kaksi 20€ lahjakorttia Freshstop Elielin kahvilaan, josta voit napata mukaan vaikkapa vi-
hersmoothien, cappuccinon ja raakasuklaan rautatieasemalta. 
 
Ystävällisin terveisin, 
 
Juho Ryynänen 
 
 
Appendix 2. Cover letter for the thesis (English) 
 
Hi, 
 
You have probably heard about virtual reality. Virtual reality may change the world in 
many ways. In marketing, the virtual reality may develop new opportunities i.e. in com-
municating with different segments. 
 
Please participate in a short survey regarding marketing technology here. The question-
naire is part of a thesis project in Haaga-Helia University of applied sciences in Helsinki. 
Answering to survey will take only 1-2 minutes. 
 
Thank you in advance! 
 
Best Regards, 
Juho Ryynänen

   Yrityksemme pysyy kaukana uusista teknologioista 
 
   
Yrityksemme on yleensä viimeisten joukossa ottamassa käyttöön uusimpia 
teknologioita 
 
   
Yrityksemme on innokas hyötymään uusista teknologioista, mutta ei halua olla 
ensimmäisten joukossa kokeilemassa niitä 
 
   
Yrityksemme on yleensä valmis ottamaan riskin saadakseen maksimaalisen strate-
gisen hyödyn uudesta teknologiasta

käytännössä testattu toimiviksi 
 
   
Yrityksemme on tyytyväinen nykytilanteeseen ja siirtyy seuraavaan teknologiaan 
vasta kun siitä tulee edullista ja on yleisesti käytössä 
 
   
Yrityksemme ei ole lähtökohtaisesti kiinnostunut uusista teknologioista ja 
pitäydymme mieluiten vanhassa niin pitkään kun vain mahdollista 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Tukeeko virtuaalitodellisuus yrityksenne brändiä?

Appendix 5. Open comments  
 
Jos vastasit vahvasti samaa mieltä TAI jokseenkin samaa mieltä, voisitko selittää 
lyhyesti miksi? 
− En näe mitään uhkia virtuaalitodellisuudessa.  
− VR tulee olemaan internetin jälkeen seuraava iso kehitysaskel teknologian 
hyödyntämisessä ihmisten arjessa.  
− Höpöhöpö jargoniaa. Mikä on todellista? Minä? Sinä? Tämä luuri? Kaikki 
turhakesanasto kuullostaa niin naivilta,sori.  
 
Tähän voit kirjoittaa lyhyesti millaisia muunlaisia haasteita yrityksenne on kohdan-
nut markkinoinnissa? 
 
− Kanavat  
− Markkinoinnin täsmäosaamista omalla alalla voisi lisätä, jotta pieni markkinointibudjetti 
voidaan käyttää mahdollisimman tehokkaasti  
− Kaikki tarjottava markkinointi on laadutonta, parasta in in-house ammattilainen - joka 
vielä pysyy teknologian aallonharjalla ja motivoituneena.  
− Markkinointimme on erittäin kohdennettua, emme harrasta ns. massamarkkinointia.  
  
59 
− Markkinoinnin tavoitteet vaihtelevat ja tähtäävät usein pitkälle aikavälille, jolloin 
pääoman käytön todentaminen on haastavaa. 
− Olemme vielä nuori yritys, joka etsii vielä identiteettiään niin tuotteen kuin markki-
noinnin osalta. Lisäksi markkina on vielä nuori ja kasvaa, joten työ on vielä kesken. 
− Markkinoinnin tehokas suuntaaminen oikealle kohderyhmälle on edelleen suhteellisen 
haastavaa, vaikka sosiaalinen media parantanut tilannetta huomattavasti  
− Motivaationpuute. Nämä ovat täysin triviaaleja kysymyksiä. Menkää pysättämään 
tehokalastus tai yrittäkää kieltää muovin turha käyttö. 
− Markkinointi siirtymässä someen 
 
Tähän voit kirjoittaa muita virtuaalitodellisuutta koskevia ajatuksia 
 
− Erittäin hyvät mahdollisuudet.  
− Se tulee kun on tullakseen, ei mullista omaa elämääni  
− Itse uskon VR:n mahdollisuuksiin, mutta laadukas tuotanto on tällä hetkellä vielä liian 
kallista monipuoliseen käyttöön.  
− AR tulee olemaan todennäköisesti suurempi juttu kuin virtuaalitodellisuus.  
− Lähimpänä tätä KÄYTÄNNÖSSÄ on meidän yrityksen google my business sivuilla 
""walk in mahdollisuus""  
− Virtuaaliepätodellisuus.

Virtual reality has been around since late the 1980’s but has taken leaps during the past few years. Virtual reality as a marketing communication tool has not been used considerably much and is likely at a so-called early adopters stage. The research studies virtual reality as an innovation looks into its attributes and examines the characteristics of potential target markets. 

The theoretical framework consists of technology adoption, disruptive innovations, and diffusion of innovations. To identify the potential users, the author delved into the characteristics of different technology adopter classes. As virtual reality is disrupted innovation by nature, the most probable users are early adopters. Early adopters are visionaries by their characteristics and have the readiness to take the risk of being first to use the technology to get strategic leverage over the competition. 

The research method was primary quantitative research implemented as an online questionnaire and secondary research that consisted of scientific articles, websites, surveys, and books. The results present key findings and conclusions in the thesis.

The study revealed that knowledge of virtual reality was rather comprehensive as more than half of the respondents had personal experiences of it and most knew the concept. Most respondents also saw the potential of virtual reality in marketing and the majority believes in virtual reality as a part of people’s everyday lives. 

Based on primary research the organizations’ technology adoption habits among the respondents were divided mostly between early adopters, visionaries and early majority, pragmatists. Pragmatists are not likely to adopt virtual reality as a marketing communication tool in a first stage due to lack of references. The significant difference between early adopters and early majority is that the latter one is reference driven.

Overall, there is distinct interest in virtual reality as a marketing communication tool. However, not all respondents were ready to engage virtual reality in their marketing efforts, at least not before it has proven efficient. It is recommended to commence virtual reality marketing efforts and establish a reference base for majority markets. It would be recommendable to established efforts with similar clients to gain expertise in the narrow field first, due to a learning curve and possible up-scale after that.

The study also revealed that organizations are interested in more targeted marketing overall","[""fi=AMK-opinnäytetyö|sv=YH-examensarbete|en=Bachelor's thesis|"", 'Global Customer Relationship Management and Communication', 'fi=Liiketalous, hallinto ja markkinointi|sv=Företagsekonomi, förvaltning och marknadsföring|en=Business Management, Administration and Marketing|', 'Degree Programme in International Business']",disabled

INTRODUCTION  
 
 
 
HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF VIRTUAL REALITY  
 
Seemly associated with science fiction and the futuristic, virtual reality continues to push the 
boundaries of human imagination. The work of Ivan Sutherland with the Sketchpad created a 
foundation for the next decades of research and development in computer-generated animation 
(Sito, 2013). The decades that follow seem to have led to the development of various gadgets 
which showed the possibility for future growth. For example, the design of the View-Master in 
the 1930’s brought new ideas regarding options for interactive content.

The 1950’s had the creation of the Sensorama, which would be the first major move toward 
applying a multiple-sensory approach to the delivery of content. However, given the scalability 
and cost of the Sensorama, the company was forced to stop production (Goldmeter, 2009). The 
invention of the personal computer in the 1960s seems to have somewhat shifted the focus from 
virtual reality as many companies focused on getting into the market space for personal 
computers. For the next four decades, there would be an increasing demand for personal 
computers. However, by 2013 the need for personal computers would reach a 10% decline, and 
this was to be the worst drop in the demand for these items in personal computer history 
(Evangelho, 2014). This decline seemingly influenced consumers to select smaller and more 
compact devices, and soon the competition ensued among personal computers, tablets and 
smartphones. As manufacturers captured their various markets, they considered the best ways to 
integrate software that would lead to greater interaction and engagement within a virtual reality 
experience. The military, health, and aviation fields seem to be the entities who have set the 
stage for the developers to take virtual reality to the next level. By 2013 there seemed to be a re-
emergence of global interest in virtual reality.  
 
It is estimated that by 2021, revenue from virtual reality systems could reach two hundred and 
fifteen billion dollars (Reyes, 2017). Microsoft, Oculus Rift, Sony, HTC, and others are the 
leading spenders on virtual reality initiatives. The reality is, while these companies continue to 
develop systems, it will be essential for educators to carefully consider the cost, affordances, and 
value of these systems for teaching and learning. These systems can be considered high cost and 
many institutions will need to upgrade their hardware to be operational. The latest advances 
seem to have focused on engagement and physical interaction, and within these interactions is 
the need to address the issues of health and safety during the operation of these devices.

CURRENT TRENDS  
 
In the last decade, the landscape of teaching and learning has changed drastically with the 
introduction of new and emerging technologies. Today’s teachers must respond to the 
technology natives as new technologies emerge. It is also essential that as new technologies are 
introduced that there is a balance between these new technologies and pedagogy. Recently, there 
has been a renewed interest in the areas of virtual reality within the K-12 environment. However, 
bringing quality and effective VR course material into the classroom in a way that is 
pedagogically impactful remains challenging. For many companies, virtual reality could be the 
next possible exploration for profitability.  It is estimated that by 2021 revenue from virtual 
reality systems could exceed two hundred billion (Reyes, 2017). 
 
Finding a definition for virtual reality is somewhat complicated based on contentious debatable 
definitions. However, according to Fuchs et al. (2011, p.5), “The purpose of virtual reality is to 
make possible a sensorimotor and cognitive activity for a person (or persons) in a digitally 
created artificial world, which can be imaginary, symbolic or a simulation of certain aspects of 
the real world.” The digital interaction based on computer technology allows for a ‘sensory 
interface’ which includes seeing, hearing and touch (Fuchs et al. 2011, p.15; Serrano et al. 2016). 
Furthermore, the evolution of haptic technology will offer greater personal sensory interactions 
as users engage in a virtual world (Hamilton 2018). Hamilton (2018) also views the move 
towards a wireless headset as a vast improvement for VR.  
 
The leading investors in virtual reality systems include some of the largest technology 
companies: Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. In fact, one of the forerunners in bringing virtual 
reality to the K-12 environment is Google. Google has created the Expeditions Pioneer Program. 
This program is limited to use in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, 
Brazil, Canada, Singapore, and Denmark (Lardinois, 2015). One major drawback of this program 
is the geographical limitation by Google on where Google will allow its expedition team to go. 
The team visits selected schools and provides the equipment for students and teachers to 
experience their virtual encounters. As Google and others consider the sharing of virtual 
encounters and other technologies, it will be imperative that they seek opportunities to engage in 
dialogue with policymakers, educators, curriculum developers, and instructional designers 
regarding the best practices for the use of virtual reality. Too many times enjoyment and 
gamification seem to be at the forefront of the developers’ agenda at the expense of teaching and 
learning (Jowallah and Bennett 2017).  According to Vasquez et al. (2015), researchers must use 
evidence-based practice to lead the way for the inclusion of technology in learning 
environments.    
 
While it is safe to assume that virtual reality has found renewed interest, it should be noted that 
this renewed interest is not isolated to the K-12 environments and the gaming industry. Current 
research has highlighted virtual reality being used now to prepare astronauts for space walks, 
treat people with phobias, identify illness such as Alzheimer, prepare the military for battle, and 
other training.  Consequently, from an educational perspective, virtual reality should be seen as a 
distinct modality of teaching and learning. The virtual modality of teaching and learning can be 
combined with other modalities of teaching and learning which includes: face-to-face, online, 
and blended or hybrid.

 The purpose of this article is to examine the affordances of virtual reality systems in K-12 
education. In this article, the writers will: (1) focus on the latest and future technological 
advances in virtual reality systems; (2) connect virtual reality advances to innovative and 
scaleable encounters in the K-12 space; (3) provide readers with a toolkit of resources for 
planning and implementing virtual reality encounters at the K-12 level; (4) share current 
literature on the implementation of virtual reality systems, and (5)  highlight aspects of the 
authors’ current research on virtual reality encounters in one Caribbean country. 
 
VIRTUAL REALITY ANOTHER TEACHING AND LEARNING MODALITY    
 
The reemergence of interest in virtual reality is based on natural progression about technological 
advancements. Advancements in technology have led to users needing additional immersive 
engagement as the visual interface improves. The new improved screens interface can block out 
another stimulus to improve engagement and interaction. VR, therefore, must be considered as 
another learning and teaching modality. Accepting VR as another form of teaching and learning 
modality is inevitable based on the emerging current research about the pedagogical benefits of 
VR. As the research is conducted, it will be important to consider: learning and teaching within 
3D (virtual learning spaces); the affordances of VR; theoretical construction of learning; working 
models for practice; basic standards for the implementation of this modality; and guidelines that 
take into consideration issues of ethics and policy (Fowler, 2015).  
 
Despite the advantages of virtual reality within K-12 education, there are several limitations for 
consideration which include: the cost factor; the need to balance pedagogy with technology; 
possible health and safety issues when engaging virtual reality encounters; gaps between the 
technological divide; and the acknowledgement that virtual reality will not replace the physical 
experiences. The development of the virtual reality modality will require additional research and 
consciousness of those involved to recognize that this modality should not replace physical 
encounters.  
     
 
WHAT IS NEEDED FOR A LOW TECH VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCE 
 
Historically, virtual reality systems have been extensive and financially out of reach for 
educational institutions on a budget. Recent product releases, as well as the prevalence of 
smartphones, has led to a new breed of virtual reality systems that allow for a low-cost virtual 
reality experience. The hardware involved in creating such experiences is relatively simple. All 
that is needed to provide a virtual reality experience is a virtual reality headset and a device, such 
as a smartphone, that can be placed within the headset.  However, it should be noted that 
standalone headsets are being developed. For a smartphone to operate, the user will need to 
download software to the smartphone. Presently users can download the Google Cardboard app 
for free. However, it is important to note that not all smartphones are compatible with the Google 
Cardboard app.  
 
4
FDLA Journal, Vol. 3 [2018], Art. 7
https://nsuworks.nova.edu/fdla-journal/vol3/iss1/7
Concerning standalone virtual devices, it should be noted that several manufacturers have 
released virtual reality headsets that are built from a variety of low-cost materials. The cost 
ranges anywhere from single digit dollars to three digits or more depending on the quality of the 
unit. The software varies, but most use an app that essentially splits the smartphone screen into 
two images. The smartphone is then attached to the virtual reality headset. If the virtual reality 
experience includes sound, then headphones can be used as well.  
 
As with most technologies, lower cost means limited capability when compared to high-cost 
systems. Even so, the low-cost experience can provide great benefits to students when added to 
learning experiences. There are also minimum technical requirements that should be considered. 
Current compatibility is congruent with most of the upper level mobile operating systems. 
However, there are phone size requirements, and some of the older mobile operating systems can 
cause the experience to be problematic or altogether inoperative. Furthermore, if one hopes to 
use a PC for less limited experience, only 1% of PCs meet the technical requirements for running 
basic virtual reality programs (CES 2016). 
     
 
VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCE   
 
The future of virtual reality systems will offer enormous opportunities for teaching and learning. 
Virtual reality has expanded to now include movement within a space. The recent development 
of a virtual environment called The Void provides a look into the virtual reality pathway of the 
future. The experience within The Void is virtually immersive and also allows users to physically 
walk around while virtually navigating the environment. Differentiating from previous 
experiences, physical movement interacts with virtual movement to create a more complete 
immersive experience (TED 2016).  While The Void offers an enhanced immersive experience, 
we have other experiences that are targeted for personal use. For example, one company VRSE 
has offered storytelling when using a 3D virtual reality experience. These stories are culturally 
and socially relevant and have dominant themes that address contemporary global issues. One 
particular story, The Displace, highlights the story of four children who are located in different 
parts of the world. These children have been affected by war or persecution. The story allows 
viewers to have a face-to-face experience with the characters in the film. As viewers view the 
film, they are surrounded by moving images which give them an immersive experience. The 
viewers are also given the opportunity to hear the audio of the surroundings which enhances the 
presentation. Viewers of these stories have indicated that this experience provides such realism 
that they believed that they were at the actual location. VRSE also has other films. Additionally, 
another virtual experience worth mentioning is called, Wave of Grace. This 3D virtual reality 
experience focuses on the Ebola outbreak which began in West Africa in 2014. The rich 
narrative, by Grace, the main character, gives the view a close encounter within an Ebola 
outbreak zone. Viewers of Wave of Grace can get a front-row view of what it was like in West 
Africa during the Ebola outbreak. These and other virtual experiences allow viewers to: have a 
greater connection to global events; engage in a multi-sensory learning experience; develop 
literacy skills; explore the issue of social justice, and critically evaluate their position about the 
characters in these environments. As companies continue to develop similar virtual engagements, 
it will be essential that K-12 teachers explore teaching opportunities within their restrictive 
curriculum. The benefits of virtual reality engagement will be further discussed in this paper. The

HOW TO PLAN YOUR LESSON WITH A VIRTUAL REALITY COMPONENT  
 
As with any learning experience, planning is a key component and a requirement if the 
experience is to go smoothly and students are to learn from it. The planning process should begin 
outside of the technology considerations entirely and incorporate sound planning and design 
principles. Because virtual reality has become accessible to classrooms where it historically was 
not given any thought, the planning process has to account for new angles and considerations. 
The planning points that follow will outline and explain each step that should be included in the 
planning process when using virtual reality as part of an educational experience. 
 
OVERALL UNIT TITLE 
 
A virtual reality experience should be seen as one part of a quality unit plan. While virtual reality 
can be an immersive component of content deliver within a plan, multiple methods should be 
used to present content topic that is a smaller part of a larger unit. Although it may seem of 
minor relevance, choosing the title of the unit will help frame the virtual reality experience as a 
key piece of a larger cohesive product. 
 
LESSON PLAN TITLE 
 
The lesson plan title is again an area that is easy to overlook. Planning the lesson plan title 
provides context to the virtual reality experience. Furthermore, planning the title as part of the 
overall unit allows for checks in alignment with the other lessons that fall into the unit.   
 
ACADEMIC CONTENT 
 
6
FDLA Journal, Vol. 3 [2018], Art. 7
https://nsuworks.nova.edu/fdla-journal/vol3/iss1/7
The academic content section of the plan is simply a brief overview of the actual academic 
content that is going to be covered during the lesson. Listing the academic content also allows 
for checks in the alignment and articulation of the lesson.  
 
RATIONALE 
 
The rationale answers the question, why is this important in either the well-aligned education of 
the students or their current or future lives? The rationale could also further explain why such an 
immersive experience is necessary.  
 
STANDARDS/LEARNING GOALS 
 
Articulation of quality standards/learning goals outcomes are the foundation of a quality learning 
experience that includes the use of technology. The standards/goals will define what the students 
are expected to learn by the end of the lesson. When integrating an immersive virtual reality 
experience into a lesson plan, the standards/goals have to be considered. The virtual reality 
experience should support the students in reaching the learning goal. Virtual reality experiences 
are no doubt engaging and interesting to students, but if the experience does not help the student 
reach the standard/goal, then it does not serve the students in the process of their education.    
 
OBJECTIVES 
 
Once learning outcomes have been defined, objectives should be established that outline who the 
learning experience is for, what the students should be able to do at the end of the learning 
experience that show that they have met the learning outcomes, under what conditions the 
students are expected to perform the task, and to what degree they are expected to perform the 
task in order to prove competence or mastery of the skill (Mager, 1984). The objectives can 
either show outright that the student has met the learning outcomes or can be incremental steps 
on the way to meeting the total learning outcomes (Wiggins & McTighe, 1998).  
 
It is only after outcomes and objectives are built that technological delivery mediums should be 
considered. Figure 3 illustrates the technological thinking needed when using technology to 
enhance learning experience. Those building learning experiences should decide if the features 
and functions of a given technology, in this case, virtual reality, help support the cognitive 
functioning of the student as they move towards the desired learning outcomes.

Figure 3: The Arch of Technology and Pedagogy frames how teachers should consider 
technology additions to their classrooms. In the process of delivering content and moving 
students towards the desired learning outcomes, the technology choices should support student 
cognition throughout the process.  
 
PROCEDURES 
 
The procedures section of the plan should read as a set of directions. It should provide clear steps 
to how the experience will manifest itself in the classroom setting. Essentially, the procedures are 
where the rubber meets the road. Up until the procedures section, we have discussed the goal of 
the lesson, the topics the lesson will cover, and what we want to see from the student. The 
possibility of virtual reality to support the student in reaching the learning outcome has also been 
discussed. All of the topics above fall under the categories of what and the processes of planning, 
while the procedures are where the how is explained. The procedures should contain all activities 
and assessments that will take place. Furthermore, allotted time for each activity should also be 
included. The more depth of explanation that is given within the procedures, the higher  the 
likelihood of a smooth lesson within the classroom. When part or all of the procedures include 
technological experiences such as a virtual reality experience, the procedures may need to be 
broken into three parts. Major subtopics within the procedures section should include: 
 
• Foundational skill building- What skills/knowledge will the students need to currently 
possess to fully understand the virtual reality experience that is about to take place. If the 
students do not possess the foundational knowledge, what should be done to help them 
get to where they need to be? It is possible that students can participate in an amazing 
virtual reality experience yet have no idea why they participated in the experience. They 
may not possess the foundational knowledge by which to bridge concepts and ideas to the 
immersive experience. It is possible that students will have developed connections 
through previous lessons. However, it is also possible that students may not have the 
8
FDLA Journal, Vol. 3 [2018], Art. 7
https://nsuworks.nova.edu/fdla-journal/vol3/iss1/7
background knowledge needed to bridge the gaps. The questions that have to be 
answered in this section are:  
1. Have the students been taught the background knowledge needed to navigate the 
immersive virtual reality experience successfully?  
2. What should be done to pre-assess prior knowledge?  
3. What support activities need to be planned if the students do not have the 
knowledge needed? 
4. How can I differentiate instruction if some students have the necessary 
background knowledge and some students do not? 
5. How will it be known that students have the knowledge needed to continue on to 
the immersive experience?  
 
• Immersive experience- this is where the actual immersive virtual reality experience is 
planned. Clear directions for the experience are developed as well as clear procedures for 
how the students will proceed through the experience should be a priority. At this point in 
the process, the experience has been chosen. Now, the focus should shift towards the 
development of clarity for students in participating in the experience while keeping in 
mind the learning goals towards which the students will progress.  
• Conclusion- The conclusion is the culmination of the experience. Once students have 
completed the virtual reality experience, a debrief, wrap up, or some teaching point has to 
be presented to them. The conclusion allows the teacher to assess whether or not the 
students fully understand why they went through the immersive experience. Further, 
some virtual reality experiences can trigger thoughts and emotions among students that 
need the guidance of a teacher.  
 
MATERIALS/SUPPORT 
 
The Materials/Support section is vastly different from a non-technology aided lesson plan. The 
instructor is required to plan for what items will be needed for the experience to take place as 
well as what to do if possible technological failures occur. Beyond the materials, the instructor 
needs to know who to contact if technical support is needed or what they need to do if they plan 
to provide support themselves.  
 
ACCESIBILITY NEEDS 
 
Within the accessibility needs section, any possible restrictions of the experience that may 
prohibit a student with a physical, learning, or other impairment from participating must be 
reflected upon. The instructor is required, either lawfully or morally, to provide accommodations 
for students who may need them.  
 
REFLECTION 
 
After the lesson is complete, pedagogically strong teachers honestly reflect on the lesson. 
Deliberate reflection requires asking and answering the questions: What went well? What did not 
go well? And what changes should be made next time the lesson is taught? Furthermore, both 
before and after the lesson, instructors should consider the age appropriateness of the experience, 
9

Published by NSUWorks, 2018
the quality of the virtual environment, the layouts of both the brick and mortar classroom and 
virtual environments, the user experience of the virtual portion of the lesson, the adequacy of 
support mechanisms, and how well the accessibility needs of students were met.   
 
Providers of educational experiences can too easily use technology with no consideration about 
the actual functionality of the technology as it relates to sound pedagogy and content delivery. 
The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework (Mishra & Koehler, 
2008), explains that in order for a learning experience that uses technology to be effective, make 
sense to the learner, and be aligned with the desired learning outcomes, the designer of the 
experience has to have a special set of skills where they are expertly knowledgeable about their 
content, pedagogically strong, and understand technology in such a way that they see educational 
crossover with how technology functions. Furthermore, the three knowledge bases, content 
knowledge, technological knowledge, and pedagogical knowledge have to seamlessly overlap for 
an individual to possess the attributes needed to effectively integrate technology into learning 
experiences (Figure:4).

Consideration should also be given to how the content is to be delivered through the virtual 
reality experience. Virtual reality allows for the student to interact to some degree with an 
immersive environment. Careful consideration should be given to the level of teacher interaction 
needed throughout the experience. In short, will the students need guidance as they navigate the 
immersive environment or does the immersive environment provided in a virtual reality 
experience allow the student to be completely self-guided. Further, individual interactions need 
to be planned as well. Student-to-student, student-to-teacher, and student-to-content interactions 
are all possibilities in the immersive environment and planning should consider which 
10

https://nsuworks.nova.edu/fdla-journal/vol3/iss1/7
interactions might work best for each individual experience. Figure 5 illustrates possible models 
of virtual reality delivery specifically denoting information flow and differentiating between 
strategically teacher-centered and student centered experiences. The figure simply illustrates the 
possibilities and the fact that as educators, we should ultimately understand the information flow 
possibilities in a virtual reality system. Understanding how the information will flow to students 
is a critical piece of planning process.

BALANCING PEDAGOGY AND TECHNOLOGY  
 
The proliferation of technological advances has changed the education landscape. In many 
instances many seminal theorists for teaching and learning seem to have been forgotten. This is a 
travesty since these technological advances can be directly aligned with some of the key theorists 
of teaching of learning which include but are not limited to: Vygotsky, Piaget, Dewey, and 
Gardner. For virtual reality to be successful designers must go back to the basics and develop 
encounters that make connection to how young children and adults learn. Also, key issues of 
methodology of teaching and learning must be addressed in the design stage. In addition, 
consideration should be given to learning objectives and outcomes. The fusion of pedagogy and 
technology will create sound articulation for the inclusion of virtual reality in K-12 education. 
The absence of this balance will limit the validity of virtual reality in K-12 education. 
Furthermore, having this balance will allow for the diversity of the virtual learning experience to 
maximize learning opportunities. According to Fox and Laum (2012), learning environments 
must be designed to ensure the greatest opportunities to students and their development of 
knowledge within the context of a changing curriculum.

SUMMARY 
In summary, the latest and future technological advances in virtual reality systems show a 
prosperous future for designing scalable virtual reality encounters in K-12 education. Also, 
resources for planning and implementing virtual reality encounters at the K-12 level and current 
literature show that virtual reality is the next learning modality. Therefore educators must begin 
to consider appropriate ways for the inclusion of this modality in their classrooms. The strength 
of this implementation to take place will rely on the fusion of pedagogy and technology within a 
balanced framework. While the authors tried to articulate the affordances of virtual reality 
systems within K-12 education, it should be noted that virtual reality should not be seen as a 
replacement for physical face-to-face interaction but as an enhancement. While the literature on 
virtual reality is emerging, additional research needs to be undertaken. Also, there is a need to 
explore lower-cost devices to allow wider use of this modality in K-12 education. The inclusion 
of virtual reality systems will revolutionize teaching and learning within the next two decades.

Introduction: Virtual reality is a new method for training 
different medical groups. Based on this technology, professionals 
and students of various medical sciences can determine their level 
of competence for medical treatment before any performance on 
the patient. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the 
applications of virtual reality technology for training the medical 
groups.
Methods: This is a scoping review study conducted in 2016. 
Articles were retrieved through the search of related keywords in 
databases such as Pub Med, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Springer, 
and Google scholar. Then, after applying the entry criteria, 21 
papers were selected from a total of 1343. Data extraction was done 
by a data collection form. The collected data were summarized 
and reported using content analysis technique according to the 
study purpose.
Results: The findings of the study indicated that 11 cases (48%) 
have used virtual education technology for laparoscopic surgery 
training. Using virtual reality has improved learning in 17 (74%) 
studies. A higher accuracy in medical practice by people trained 
through VR has been reported in 20 (87%) studies.
Conclusion: The results indicate that the application of virtual 
reality capabilities plays an important role in improving the 
performance of different medical groups. According to the results, 
it can be suggested that virtual reality capabilities should be used 
to train different medical groups based on their individual and 
collective needs.

Introduction
Virtual reality is a new technology that has been widely used in the health field in 
recent years and it is applied in a wide range 
of diseases. In fact, this technology is the 
simulation of the peripheral world through a 
computer as well as communication through a 
receiver (1). Virtual reality consists of output 
tools (vision, hearing, tactile and power 
transmitter), input devices (mouse, chaser, 
gloves, etc.), a virtual environment’s graphical 
manufacturing system as well as an information 
software. In a virtual environment, all the 
features of activity such as duration, severity 
and type of feedback can be adopted based on 
the type of treatment and individuals’ ability (2, 
Samadbeik M et al.The applications of virtual reality in medical groups teaching
J Adv Med Educ Prof. July 2018; Vol 6 No 3124 
3). In addition, individuals can see their motor 
results and correct them if necessary.
One of the most important applications of 
VR in medical science is in medical education, 
which has been widely used in the last decade. 
Many studies have paid attention to various 
VR applications in medical education (4, 5), 
including the understanding of fracture anatomy 
by orthopedic residences (6), improving the 
knowledge and skills of clinical residences in 
the MICU and as an adjunct complement for 
standard clinical education if internal residences 
in MICU, as well as general objections regarding 
the patient safety, ethical concerns and financial 
constraints for education of medical students 
have led to a widespread application of non-
human and inanimate models for training the 
laparoscopic skills because simulation-oriented 
syllabus is very effective in transferring skills to 
the operating room (7-13).
The American Board of Internal Medicine 
(ABIM) has announced that it is better for 
residents to be trained by simulation tools 
before attempting any interventions on patients 
because it has been effective in performing 
invasive hemodynamic monitoring, mechanical 
ventilation, and standardized educational 
intervention (14).
Stefanidis et al. concluded that suture training 
using simulator improves the speed and mobility 
of practitioners in the operation room (15). In the 
same line, Lin et al. found that given the fact that 
performing bone cut or bone surgery requires high 
experience and sensitivity, training the simulation 
of virtual and tactical surgery with feedback can 
be a safe, repeatable and cost-effective method 
compared to traditional methods (16).
Given the importance of medical education 
using the virtual reality tools and its role in 
improving the quality of medical education 
in various medical specialties, many papers 
examined this field in recent years. Although 
Walsh et al. instead of using conventional methods 
systematically reviewed education of endoscopy 
using virtual reality, but there was no systematic 
study regarding its applications (17). Therefore, 
the present study was a systematic review that 
aimed at identifying the applications of virtual 
reality in training various medical groups.
Methods
This study is a scoping review which aimed 
to identify virtual reality applications in training 
the medical groups in 2016. The research question 
was identified based on the PCC (Population, 
Concept and Context) elements. This particular 
question includes: medical groups that use VR 
for training (Population); the effect of Virtual 
Reality in Medicine Groups training (Concept); 
use of Virtual Reality in medical teaching centers 
(context).
Consistent with Best Evidence Medical 
Education (BEME) recommendations, the 
search was performed on valid databases as 
well as PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science 
and Springer. During the search, the restrictions 
and related keywords were retrieved. To search 
for related papers, the combination of keywords 
(Table 1), with the English language and 5-year 
period restrictions were applied. Also, a search 
expert helped us to improve the quality of 
searches.
The inclusion criteria were clinical trial 
and exclusion criteria were commentary non-
randomized trials and non-clinical trials. Erratum 
Review, Commentary, contact with Editor and 
available Studies were considered. The process 
of selection of articles was based on the PRISMA 
chart (Figure 1), and 24 articles were selected 
out of 1343 retrieved articles. In accordance with 
BEME, all stages of the selection and evaluation 
of the quality of the articles were done by two 
researchers and in the case of disagreement, a 
third person was available to help.
Considering BEME, to assess the quality of 
the studies, we excluded Consortium Assessment 
Tool 2010 (was used) and 3 papers with 
undesirable quality from the study. Finally, 21 
qualified papers of clinical trials were selected.
Consistent with BEME, the required 
information of the selected papers was collected 
using a data collection form (including items 
of the type of study, the year of the study, 
the sample number, the country where the

study was conducted, first author, the most 
important findings, the proposed solutions and 
the limitations of each study) and the data were 
summarized and reported in Tables according to 
the objectives of the study.
Results
All of 21 clinical trials with inclusion criteria 
were selected for the current study. 2013 had 
the largest number of studies (9). Studies were 
conducted in Denmark (4 studies), Canada, the 
United States and Germany (3 studies for each), 
England and Australia (2 studies for each), and the 
Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, and Austria, 
(each with 1 study). Using pre-test and post-test 
was the most common method for data collection. 
Based on the other results, the effect of 
using virtual reality was ranked from 1-4 (very 
effective, effective, ineffective, and negative); 
only two studies reported the negative effect 
on the use of virtual reality in training medical 
groups. In addition, two studies have reported 
the ineffectiveness of the use of virtual reality 
in medical education.
The findings of the present study indicated 
that the average period of training different 
medical groups using virtual reality was between 
six months to one year. In addition, according to 
the findings of the present study, the application 
of virtual reality reduced the time required for 
training medical groups. The secondary results 
of this study are shown in Table 2 to address the 
advantages and disadvantages of virtual reality 
in teaching medical groups.
Other secondary results of the current study 
include suggestions for improving the application 
of virtual reality that are presented in Table 3.
Discussion
The results indicated that all studies were 
conducted in developed countries. 95% of the 
studies that have been studied emphasize the 
improvement of the skills of trainees (various 
medical groups) using virtual reality although a few 
studies noted the ineffectiveness of virtual reality 
on medical education. Julie Enne et al. proposed 
Figure 1: The PRISMA flowchart for the paper selection process
Samadbeik M et al.The applications of virtual reality in medical groups teaching
J Adv Med Educ Prof. July 2018; Vol 6 No 3126 
the implementation of virtual reality training 
courses for the acquisition of hysteroscopic skills 
for clinical professionals who are interested in 
learning sterilization techniques (36).
The application of virtual reality in training 
different medical groups includes different effects. 
That is, in some specialties virtual reality is very 
effective, and in several studies and specialties 
no positive effects are noted regarding the use 
of virtual reality compared to the control group. 
A recent study on gynecology and obstetrics 
reported the impact of VR application on the 
enhancement of infant and maternal health (35).
A study conducted in 2012 concluded 
that simulation-based education significantly 
increased the skills and knowledge of residents 
in the intensive care unit. It is an invaluable 
approach for standard medical education (28). 
However, Brydges et al. indicated that “contrary 
to expectations of researchers, intervention group 
did not have more advantages over self-regulated 
learning (SRL), and in fact they spent more time 
on doing it” (20). However, most studies reported 
the positive impact of the application of virtual 
reality for training the medical groups. Given 
that a small number of studies reported the lack 
of effectiveness of the virtual reality application, 
further studies are required to be conducted in 
this area.
In addition, Bongers et al. noted that “this 
study proposed that multitasking could be taught 
using virtual reality simulator equipment. But the 
effectiveness of surgery reduced in trainees with 
multiple trainings and this level of skill requires 
more research” (18).
The results emphasize a better understanding 
Table 2: Advantages and disadvantages of training various medical groups using virtual reality
Disadvantages Advantages 
The high cost of the simulators 
The long nature of some studies in the field of 
virtual reality
The high cost of these studies (high cost of 
monitors, programming, implementation 
environment, participants, etc.)
It can never replace the real environment 
training
Its implementation requires identification of the 
effective factors and conditions of that society
Additional training using VR without 
supervision can cause extra stitching, and lead to 
damages to tissues, and more
The course of studies is very limited; therefore, 
further studies and more accurate evaluations 
are necessary
Some studies have also pointed to the increase in 
training time (18-21)
Decrease in the frequency of training and the ease of training using VR 
(22-28)
Decrease in the time of surgery in the real environment (23, 29, 30)
Positive psychological effect on learners (23)
Increase in accuracy and accuracy of trainers and reduction of errors (21)
Improving the teamwork in the medical team (31)
Increase in self-confidence in learners using VR compared to other groups 
(23, 32)
Decrease of harm to those being treated by people who are trained by VR, 
decrease in mistakes and more successful surgeries (29, 33-35)
Increase in skills of learners (18, 21, 24, 28, 36)
Better learning of anatomical positions (27)
Better understanding of the exterior and interior space relationships 
between the organs (27)
Valuable approach for Standard and unified education of medical groups 
(28)
Increase in the skill of surgeon (21)
Increase in the safety of the physician and patients (21, 33, 34)
Decrease in the costs and increase in the efficiency (18, 22, 26, 37)
Overall performance improvement (32, 35, 38)
Table 3: Proposals for the improvement of the application of virtual reality for training various medical groups
No Proposals 
1 The use of virtual reality simulator automatic feedback combined with educational feedback during laparoscopic 
training in simulated way (17)
2 The divergence between educational concepts of students is decreased. Perhaps significant implications can be 
stablished for learning using virtual reality technology (20)
3 The presence of an instructor is very influential (guided- education), and in the absence of such a person there may be 
distortion and in the training process and the performance can be reduced (22, 26)
4 The application of virtual reality equipment for training than traditional medical education (39)
5 Using Portable Learning equipment by virtual reality (23)
6 Application of virtual reality is appropriate for midterm training in medical groups and it is not recommended for 
long-term education (17, 24)
7 Retraining courses alongside learning using virtual reality (24)
8 The use of VR for the training the medical groups should be considered as an additional training and it cannot replace 
the main method (25, 29)
9 Understanding the general and specific parameters of the participants in the training will lead to identification of the 
effective factors in the implementation of more precise laparoscopic surgeries (30)
10 Using feedback during the training using virtual reality (17, 26, 32, 37, 38) 
The applications of virtual reality in medical groups teachingSamadbeik M et al.

of the exterior and interior spatial relationships 
of the organs and development of the anatomical 
knowledge of students through the application of 
VR. Yanping et al. emphasized the improvement 
of the skills of beginners and experienced 
bone sawing rescuers because the application 
of surgical simulations helps the trainees to 
increase their recognition skill of the anatomical 
positions (16). Therefore, virtual reality can 
be used for training the anatomy courses of 
different medical groups.
Other results showed that virtual reality should 
be used as a complementary training along with 
main training and it can never replace the training 
in the real environment. A study in the field of 
software development of virtual reality used for 
education of nursing emphasized  guidance in  the 
objectives of simulation training software and its 
combination with conventional trainings (40). In 
addition, some studies pointed the effective and 
positive effects of simulation-oriented syllabus on 
transferring skills to the operating rooms (8-13).
The results revealed that the presence of an 
instructor is very influential (guided-training) 
since his absence may lead to disruption in the 
learning process and the performance can be 
reduced (22, 26).
One of the issues of conducting this area is 
the high cost of these studies, such as the high 
cost of monitors, programming, implementation 
environment, participants, and so on. A higher 
number of student were proposed in a study to 
cover the high cost of using virtual reality (39).
Given the importance of continuous 
monitoring of education, the use of feedback 
during training is recommended (17, 26, 32, 37, 
38). Also, the use of virtual reality is suggested 
for holding retraining courses to increase the 
quality of the educations.
The results showed that people trained by 
virtual reality had lower performance errors 
and higher accuracy compared to those trained 
by conventional approaches. For example, 
many studies in the area of education using the 
simulator indicated that inexperienced residents 
who learned colonoscopy and endoscopy in the 
simulator before doing them in real-case (on the 
patient and in the operating room) did much better 
and with less errors than other residents who 
learned it directly in the real environment (41-44).
Conclusion
The application of virtual reality, as a 
complementary method, plays an important 
role in improving the performance of different 
medical groups. Therefore, given the results, 
it is suggested that it should be used as a 
complementary educational tool along with 
main education. Considering that laparoscopic 
surgery is one of the most important surgical 
procedures that is taught using virtual reality, 
individual and general factors affecting its exact 
implementation should be identified. In addition, 
given the importance of the issue, it is suggested 
that more studies should be carried out on the 
training of medical groups using virtual reality 
to determine the type and extent of its impact on 
the performance and efficiency of the students. 
With respect to the results of the present study, 
it is suggested that virtual reality should be used 
in training such skills as laparoscopic surgery, 
education of orthopedic residents, Gynecology 
residents, suturing, ultrasound, nursing 
procedures and paramedical interventions. In 
addition, it seems necessary to do studies to 
determine the effectiveness and usefulness of 
the method and satisfaction of the trainees and 
patients. Furthermore, considering the needs of 
trainees, designing virtual reality tools can be 
an appropriate solution for its effective use for 
training the medical groups.

ABSTRACT
We propose a framework called inverse augmented reality (IAR)
which describes the scenario that a virtual agent living in the virtual
world can observe both virtual objects and real objects. This is
different from the traditional augmented reality. The traditional
virtual reality, mixed reality and augmented reality are all generated
for humans, i.e., they are human-centered frameworks. On the
contrary, the proposed inverse augmented reality is a virtual agent-
centered framework, which represents and analyzes the reality from a
virtual agent’s perspective. In this paper, we elaborate the framework
of inverse augmented reality to argue the equivalence of the virtual
world and the physical world regarding the whole physical structure.

1 INTRODUCTION
The basic framework for augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR) and virtual reality (VR) was proposed by Milgram et al. [8].
These paradigms are designed for the human-centered world. As
the artificial intelligence develops rapidly, a virtual agent will finally
possess an independent mind similar to that of humans. Based on
Minsky’s analysis of the human’s mind [9], a virtual agent could
develop its own independent mind and live successfully in the virtual
world as humans can do in the real world. For this reason, a virtual
agent can have an equal status with real humans. The well-known
augmented reality can transfer from a human-centered framework
to a virtual agent-centered framework. When the virtual agent is
the center of the system, it can observe both virtual objects in the
virtual world and real objects in the real world. This is called
inverse augmented reality (IAR), because it uses an exactly opposite
observing direction compared to the traditional augmented reality.
The idea of IAR is originally inspired by the concept of the paral-
lel world in the discipline of physics [1]. Based on the consideration
of physics, IAR requires that the virtual world exists with similar
structures and interaction roles to that of the physical world. These
similar structures and interaction roles have been applied to virtual
reality in order to define inverse virtual reality (IVR) [13]. In this pa-
per, we would talk about inverse augmented reality using the similar
methodology.
The study about IAR is significant for two following reasons.
First, it figures out the relationship between the virtual world and
the physical world under the background of IAR, promoting the
development of the scientific architecture of virtual agent-centered
inverse augmented reality. Second, it lays the foundation of inverse
augmented reality applications which do not treat the human as
the system center, increasing the diversity of augmented reality
systems. For these reasons, the proposed IAR is expected to make a
breakthrough in both theory and practice.

Figure 1: A typical scene of inverse augmented reality. In the left side,
the virtual agent is represented as an orange avatar. A real chair is
registered into the virtual world, so that a virtual one corresponds to
a real one. Meanwhile, the virtual yellow table in the virtual world
can exist independently with no relationship with the desks in the real
world. The real world can be observed by the virtual agent, but only
the registered real objects are available data which can augment the
virtual world.
This paper proposes the concept of IAR, and concretely shows
the relationship between the virtual world and the physical world.
As shown in Fig. 1, it is a typical scene of IAR.
1.1 Related Work
In the past, a lot of related researches about augmented reality have
been presented. Before IAR, some novel styles of reality have
been proposed. For example, Lifton et al. [5] proposed the “dual
reality” system to make the virtual world and the physical world
be corresponding to each other. Roo et al. [10] proposed the “one
reality” system, which contained a 6-level mixture of virtual and real
contents ranging from purely physical to purely virtual world. But
they all describe the mixed reality from the perspective of humans,
ignoring the view from the virtual world.
Since the virtual environment is expected to be the same intel-
ligent as our natural environment in the physical world, it should
be created with some virtual smart brains using current techniques
in artificial intelligence. Luck et al. [6] applied the artificial intel-
ligence into virtual environments to make the virtual environments
become intelligent. This work inspires us to add some intelligence
to IAR, making the virtual world be driven by intelligence besides
human’s manual design. The intelligence of the virtual world can
be accumulated by learning from the human’s behaviors [3] in some
special cases. Note that the intelligence plays an important role
in constructing IAR for the reason that the intelligence-driven self-
development can make the virtual world act as the physical world
does. If the intelligence is missing, the virtual world may suffer
from low spontaneity, which can be harmful to the equivalence of
the virtual world and the physical world.
To make the virtual world intelligent, Taylor et al. [12] discussed
the possibility of making a virtual world evolve by itself. The
evolution of the virtual world took advantage of the principle of
biological evolution in the physical world. Though the self-learning
is not simple, there are still many learning frameworks that can
be used to obtain the self-learning ability, such as evolutionary
computation [2], reinforcement learning [11] and deep learning [4].

Figure 2: Relationship between AR and IAR. In the right rounded
rectangle of the figure, it shows the typical scene of the traditional
augmented reality, which can be observed by humans. In the left
rounded rectangle of the figure, it shows the typical scene of the
inverse augmented reality, which can be observed by virtual agents.
Augmented reality and inverse augmented reality share the same
structure except that they have opposite observing directions and
different observers.
1.2 Contribution
In this paper, our main contributions are listed as follows.
• Propose the concept of inverse augmented reality and elaborate
the formulations according to physical properties.
• Show the typical structure of inverse augmented reality systems
and present the proof of concept for IAR.
2 FRAMEWORK OF INVERSE AUGMENTED REALITY
2.1 Dual-World Structure
The proposed inverse augmented reality and the traditional aug-
mented reality, as shown in Fig. 2, are under the unified dual-world
structure. The traditional augmented reality (human-centered obser-
vation) is to augment the physical world with virtual objects, while
the inverse augmented reality (virtual agent-centered observation) is
to augment the virtual world with real objects.
There might be a misconception between the proposed “inverse
augmented reality” and another well-known concept called “aug-
mented virtuality”. Even though the two concepts are all describing
using real elements in the physical world to augment virtual ele-
ments in the virtual world, their positions are definitely different.
The augmented virtuality means that it is the human who can see a
scene where the virtual elements are augmented by real elements,
and the human himself is located in the real world. Conversely,
the inverse augmented reality means that it is the virtual agent who
can see a scene where the virtual elements are augmented by real
elements, and the virtual agent itself is located in the virtual world.
2.2 Mathematical Model
Take the visual AR and IAR as the example, the formulation for AR
and IAR can be as follows.
Let OR denote the real objects, OV the virtual objects, H the
humans, A the virtual agents, then we get{
AR⇔ SH(OR,OV ,A)
IAR⇔ SA(OR,OV ,H) (1)
where SH denotes the observation function of humans, and SA
denotes the observation function of virtual agents.
3 PHYSICAL PERSPECTIVE OF INVERSE AUGMENTED RE-
ALITY
In this work, we emphasize the equivalence of the virtual world and
the physical world regarding the structure in physics. The referred
physics here contains both the physical world and the virtual world,
i.e., the virtual world is treated as a kind of existence in physics,
which possesses the same structure with the physical world. In this
way, IAR has the same important role as the traditional AR. We use
a definition called physical equivalence to elaborate the equivalence
of the physical world and the virtual world. This means the two
worlds should be the same when talking about the physical structure,
which can also be seen in Equation 1.
3.1 Spatial Structure
In the traditional augmented reality, there are three key components,
i.e., the humans, the physical world and the virtual contents added to
the physical world. As a correspondence, the same structure applies
to inverse augmented reality. Concretely, inverse augmented reality
also contains three key components, i.e., the virtual character, the
programmable virtual world and the physical contents added to the
virtual world. We emphasize the spatial structure rather than the
appearance, because the difference regarding appearance is obvious.
For example, all objects in the virtual world are data that are first
created by human and then develop independently. Though the
appearance is different, the spatial structure can be similar, especially
the physical roles and interaction ways.
3.2 Self Development
As a common knowledge, the physical world we live in is keeping
developing all the time. It seems to be driven by a kind of energy
with the form of physical roles. Meanwhile, humans are born with
intelligence, so they can actively interact with the physical world.
Since the virtual world is expected to be developing by itself, it
should have two kinds of agents, i.e., the character agent and the
environment agent [7]. The character agent can be treated as a
virtual human in the virtual world, while the environment agent
determines how the virtual environment can develop automatically.
The two agents are created by our physical world, then they construct
the virtual world and develop independently without being directly
controlled by the physical world. The agents can not only learn from
physical world but also evolve by themselves. Notice that only the
character agents can observe things in the proposed framework of
inverse augmented reality.
3.3 Equal-Status Interaction
Considering the traditional AR and the proposed IAR, the physical
world and the virtual world are equal to each other regarding inter-
action. As we often see in the traditional AR, a human can interact
with both real and virtual objects that have been observed by him.
Similarly, the character agent in the virtual world can interact with
both virtual and real objects that have been observed by the agent.
The two interaction processes are dual processes with the exactly
symmetrical interaction style, as shown in Fig. 3. The interaction
from virtual world to physical world means the virtual agent can
control some physical power in order to change the physical state
of real objects, e.g., if the virtual agent want to put a real box on a
virtual table, it is required to find a certain physical way to support
the real box so that it seems to be on the virtual table. And the
physical way to realize this physical effect is expected to be con-
trolled by the virtual agent. This is surely very hard for the current
technology, but it is an essential part for IAR to support an equal
interaction process compared with the traditional AR. Therefore, the
equal-status interaction may need to be further studied and realized
in the future.
4 PROOF OF CONCEPTS
4.1 System setup
We utilize Microsoft HoloLens as the basic platform to demonstrate
the concept of IAR. Both AR and IAR are implemented by Unity3D
and the Vuforia software development kit.

black arrows denote the direct control stream. Hollow arrows denote
indirect control stream. The big arrows with orange color denote the
registration from virtual world to real world, while the big arrows with
blue color denote the registration from physical world to virtual world.
4.2 Framework Representation
Since the basic framework has been illustrated above, we present a
typical demonstration of IAR using an office environment. We add
a virtual cube floating above the table, which is located by a small
photo. The small photo is fixed on the top of a table, which serves as
a bridge connecting the physical world and the virtual world. After
the environment is constructed, two views from the different worlds
are shown in Fig. 4. In the traditional augmented reality, the user
can see the physical environment and the virtual element (a cube
with the checkerboard pattern), and she can also interact with the
virtual element. In the inverse augmented reality, a virtual agent
is constructed, and it can behave like a physical human. Though
what can be “seen” by the agent is absolutely some data, we can still
figure out the meaning of these data. Usually, these data include the
virtual cube that is connected with the physical world, the virtual
table that corresponds to the real table in the physical world, and
some other virtual objects that do not exist in the physical world.
5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The equivalence between the virtual world and the real world is
proposed regarding the structure. As for the structure, it is already
illustrated by introducing all essential parts of the traditional aug-
mented reality and the inverse augmented reality. Though the spe-
cific expression forms are different, the two paradigms possess the
same structure with each other. Our demonstration is about the
concept verification, and all the results are shown directly by images
observing from different worlds. This is a clear way to show the
concept of IAR.
In this paper, we propose the big framework of the traditional aug-
mented reality and the inverse augmented reality. Then we illustrate
the main properties of this framework. Under this framework, we
emphasize that the self-intelligence would play an important role in
the virtual world, which contributes greatly to building an inverse
augmented reality system. We also present a typical implementation
of an inverse augmented reality system, which shows the inverse
augmented reality can be realized with most current techniques.
The remaining challenges in the field of inverse augmented reality
mainly include three aspects:
(1) Physical construction of virtual objects in the physical world.
(2) Specific design of virtual-to-physical bridges.
(3) Intelligence and knowledge for the self-driven virtual world.
Future work will be unifying the proposed IAR and the previous
IVR into a more general framework in order to represent the reality
at a higher level than what we have done currently. In this way, what
the virtual agent could experience in both the virtual and the real
world can be well illustrated.
Figure 4: Concept demonstration. The left side is the view from
the virtual world, while the right side is the view from the physical
world. Some objects exist in both worlds, such as the cube with yellow
dashed circle and the table with green dashed rectangle. Some
objects only exist in one world. For example, some colorful cubes only
exist in the virtual world, while a chair and a laptop only exist in the
physical world.

CHAPTER ONE 
Making friends and keeping friends are important skills for high school students to 
learn. When there are issues with communication, it can affect a students’ ability to socialize, 
which in turn, can affect their ability to make and keep friends. When working with students 
with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), you often see that they have challenges socially. The 
behaviors they exhibit, and their verbal or nonverbal communication skills can cause them to 
have deficits in all areas of social interaction (Jeffs, 2009). Building socialization and 
communication skills both in school and in their daily lives can allow students to build 
relationships.  
General Problem/Issue 
Examples of deficits students with ASD may have are a lack in social skills, such as, 
communication skills. These students do not develop social skills like developing peers. Their 
use of repetitive language, hand flapping, or repetitive behaviors in daily activities can create 
barriers for socialization. Being able to communicate effectively is an important part of school 
life, especially in high school.  
Many instructional strategies have been studied and utilized to determine which 
provides the best fit for ASD students. It is important that the use of instructional approaches 
and strategies are part of treatment. Strategies such as video modeling, social stories, and peer 
mentoring have been used and are part of a promising practice (Ogilvie, 2011). In recent 
years, the idea of using virtual reality has been making an entrance into the world of 
education. This study involves the use of virtual reality for the instruction of social 
communication skills with ASD students in high school. The goal is to use the virtual 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES

environment as an instructional tool to practice social skills. The result of this study will add 
information to existing research on social skills instruction.  
Virtual reality is not a new technology or a new idea in education for that matter. John 
Woodward, the author of a study done in 1992 stated “The use of virtual reality systems for 
special education would seem to be limitless” (p. 8). More recent studies have shown that 
when using virtual reality, it can provide a “supportive environment” (Jeffs, 2009, p. 253) for 
those with special needs.  
In my years of experience, I have learned that each ASD student has their own specific 
communication needs. Communication cues that work for one students may not work for all. 
It is hard to find a communication system that works for all ASD students in my classroom. 
After researching different instructional methods for communication, I determined that using 
virtual reality is an effective instructional strategy. I plan to research the effects of using 
virtual reality on the social skills of ASD students. By using the virtual reality technology, I 
hope to see an increase in social skills by monitoring the frequency of the students’ initiation, 
responses to questions, comments, maintaining conversation, and closing conversation.  
Subjects and Setting 
Participants in this study were selected from the population of students at a public high 
school in Thief River Falls, Minnesota. There are approximately 570 students in grades 9-12th 
attending the school. Students range between the ages of 14 to 21 years.  They start at the high 
school in 9th grade, and can continue past 12th grade, until the school year in which they turn 21 
years old. There are eleven students who participate in the high school’s resource classroom. Of 
those eleven, there are two diagnosed with severe autism spectrum disorders and who are in the 
moderate/severe category of disabilities.  
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES

This study focused on two students who participated in the high school’s resource 
classroom. These students are in the resource room at least 45 minutes daily to learn and practice 
social communication skills.  
Participants. There were two high school students that participated in the study. One 
student was a junior and one was a sophomore, both being males. The boys’ ages were 15 and 
17. According to the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS) and the Autism Spectrum Rating 
Scales (ASRS), both of these students have moderate to severe delays with critical thinking skills 
as well as social language skills. They also have delays in their ability to develop conversational 
skills, with their peers and to interact with others. Thus, they attend a class to learn social 
communication skills.

manager and resource room. Two ASD students out of this group participated in the study.  The 
group of selected students received social skills instruction using a simulated learning 
environment, and checklists were used to collect data prior to and after the instruction.  
 Description of setting.  This study took place in a high school in a rural Northwestern 
Minnesota town with a population of about 8,000. In the school district, 27.3% of students 
receive free and reduced lunches, 1.6% are English learners, 16.3% qualify for special education 
services, and 0.3% are homeless. Within the district population, 87.4% are Caucasian students, 
1.5% are Black/African American students, 6% are Hispanic/Latino students, .8% are Asian 
students, 1.5% are American Indian/Alaska Native students, 0% are Native Hawaiian/Pacific 
Islander students, and 2.8% report two or more races (Minnesota Report Card, 2017). 
Informed consent.  Permission was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
at Minnesota State University Moorhead and from the school district in which the study took 
place. The school district’s IRB procedure was followed to obtain permission to conduct 
research.   
 Permission was obtained from all parents/guardians of the students involved in the study.  
There was a written form, outlining the exact procedures, along with any risks or benefits.  
Confidentiality was maintained throughout any written reports, data sheets, and verbal 
information. All students involved were protected at all times during the study.  
Parents/guardians were able to withdraw their consent at any point; they were aware of this 
through verbal and written notification.   
Review of Literature 
 Research topic. Teachers in the high school DCD setting often spend a lot of time 
working with ASD students and teaching them in the areas where they have deficits. One of the 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
6 
biggest areas that seems to be a common skill deficit is in the area of social skills. There are 
many instructional interventions available that can be used, however, teachers are often looking 
for a social skills program that is general enough to be work for each ASD student’s needs. For 
the purposes of this study, the focus will be on the use of virtual reality devices (virtual reality 
head mounted display, virtual immersive environment) with autistic students in high school to 
teach social communication skills. 
Definition of Terms  
For the purpose of this study, the following terms are defined: 
Autism Spectrum Disorder-A broad continuum of cognitive and neurobehavioral  
conditions that typically include impairments in socialization and communication coupled 
with repetitive patterns of behavior (Salend, 2011). 
Peer based strategies-A type of cooperative learning arrangement where one student 
assists another in learning a new skill (Salend, 2011). 
Virtual reality-A technology-based application that allows individuals to experience 
what it feels like to see, touch, smell, and move through artificial, three-dimensional, 
interactive environments that present computer-generated images and accompanying text 
depicting real or imaginary environments (Salend, 2011). 
Social stories-Short, straightforward description of a social situation that gives the 
student accurate information about the situation, including (a) what to expect from the 
situation, (b) what may be expected of the student, and (c) how the student can respond to the 
situation in the socially appropriate way (Pankaskie & Chandler, 2010). 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES

Video modeling-An instructional method that utilizes video footage of a model 
engaging in a target behavior in order to teach a new behavior or promote the occurrence of a 
new behavior (Clinton, 2016). 
Instructional Strategies  
There have been many studies done showing the effects of various different 
instructional strategies when working with students with autism. There are three common 
interventions that have been used to teach the social skills that ASD students may lack. These 
three are the most well-known interventions, and they include video modeling, social stories, 
and peer modeling. A more recent addition to the intervention tool box is virtual reality.  
Instructional Strategies-Video Modeling.  Video modeling consists of students 
watching videos that show positive examples of people engaging in the behavior that is 
attempting to be taught. One study stated that video modeling was a promising intervention 
for improving social skills. There are many advantages to using video modeling, including the 
modeling of targeted skills (Clinton, 2016). This study was done to review other existing 
literature on video modeling and its use in social skills training. Results from the studies 
reviewed showed that when using video modeling, moderate to strong effects were seen in 
over half the studies (Clinton, 2016).   
 Delano (2007), examined various studies that used video modeling as interventions. 
The research paper reviewed studies that used two different methods of video modeling. One 
type used other people as video models (adults or peers), and the second type used video self-
modeling. There were also some comparison studies reviewed as well. Nineteen studies were 
identified and used for review and inclusion in this study. 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES

 Delano (2007) tells us that after reviewing the nineteen studies, the overall data 
suggests that video modeling interventions created positive gains in not only social-
communicative skills but also functional skills, perspective-taking skills, and problem 
behavior. There were a few mixed results in several of the studies, however, overall results 
showed that video modeling can facilitate rapid skills acquisition, maintenance, and 
generalization across settings, people, and materials (Delano, 2007).  
 Another study done by Parsons (2006) used videotaped role-play with ASD students at 
the secondary level. There were eight ASD participants ranging in age from 14 to 21. These 
students participated in an after-school program, where they participated in a social skills 
class, physical education, game time, and computer time. Arguments that occurred or conflicts 
that arose during the physical education, game time, or computer time were used to teach 
those social skills during role-play. Parent, peer, and student surveys were used to collect 
data.    
 Parent surveys gave information on students’ behaviors at home, which included self-
isolation, attitudes toward socialization, anxiety over change, conversation skills, and attitudes 
toward the social skills class. Peer surveys gathered information regarding classmate 
evaluations and if students were learning from the actions of others. Finally, the self-reflective 
survey had ASD students examine themselves and provide information about their attitudes 
and their feelings.  
 The study was done in three phases: Phase 1) Student Descriptions, Phase 2) Job 
Interview Practice, and Phase 3) Student Interviews. During the first phase, each student’s 
needs were evaluated and addressed using video role-play. During the second phase, students 
practiced job interview skills, which included requesting a job application, selecting a job, and 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
9 
going through a mock interview. During the third phase, students were interviewed by 
teachers on autism. There were many observed positive changes seen as a result of the 
videotaped role-plays. Some of the changes in behavior that were seen were fewer conflicts 
during game time, students holding the doors for others after they had passed through, and 
students apologizing when making negative comments to others. Results indicated many 
positive strides that were made on social skills through the use of video modeling.  
Instructional Strategies-Social Stories.  The use of social stories can be done in 
classrooms to describe a social situation or social events. It uses social cues and defines the 
responses that are appropriate for the social situation (Gray & Garand, 1993). A social story is 
usually made up of different kinds of sentences, either descriptive, directive, or perspective 
and each has a purpose (Gray & Garand, 1993). They should be written from the perspective 
of the student and also written at the comprehension level of the student so vocabulary is at 
their ability level (Gray & Garand, 1993). And social stories are most effective when written 
for specific students and with specific situations in mind (Pankaskie & Chandler, 2012). 
A study done in 2006 used social stories with three elementary students with a goal of 
increasing verbal initiations (Delano & Snell). The three students were given informal 
assessments prior to the study to determine their preferred activities and their academic 
comprehension and social skills. The students were also observed during classroom activities 
and play activities. Each student’s reading comprehension level was evaluated to identify the 
appropriate level for presenting social stories. Then based on their reading level, two 
participants were given the picture symbol story and the third was given text + read aloud. 
Generalization probes were used to assess the student’s ability to transfer skills they 
learned to a general education classroom. Results showed that all participants had made 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
10 
improvements in the resource setting. After the interventions, social engagement also 
increased during play sessions, showing a higher rate of target social skills. Probes showed 
that only two students generalized their social behaviors to the general education classroom.  
The findings suggest that using social stories can be an effective intervention for increasing 
social engagement. 
Instructional Strategies-Peer Based Strategies.  A third area of intervention that 
may be used are peer based strategies, which can include peer mentoring, buddy systems, and 
partner systems (Salend, 2012). This involves the increasing of social and/or academic 
interactions between students with and without disabilities. It can be done in many different 
ways and in combination with other instructional strategies. Pankaskie and Chandler tell us 
that “peer support has been used successfully to assist students with autism develop social 
skills” (p. 306).  
A study done in England showed that peer mentoring has led to enhanced social and 
communication skills (Bradley, 2016). To be included in the study, the participants needed to 
have a diagnosis of autism made by a psychiatrist or pediatrician and be attending a 
mainstream secondary school. A total of 48 students participated in the study with twelve 
students diagnosed with autism and 36 students without autism. All students ranged in age 
from 11-12, with 16 of the students being female (four with a diagnosis of autism) and 20 of 
the students being male (eight with a diagnosis of autism). Students came from five different 
secondary schools that were located in the south-east of England. 
Students were divided into peer mentoring groups, each of which had four students 
from the same class and one student with autism. Mentors were given an induction session to 
learn their roles, learn about confidentiality, learn when to withdraw from mentoring, and the 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
11 
focus of the program. The students established the focus and content of the sessions with the 
help of the coordinator. Issues such as friendships, work skills, bullying, interests, and 
behavior were discussed. Students individually completed a self-report questionnaire both 
prior to and after their involvement in the peer mentoring program.  
The study was designed to investigate a new peer mentoring program and see what 
impact it would have on students with autism who attended mainstream secondary schools. 
Results of the study show several key points. First, results showed a positive impact on self-
esteem levels, decreases in bullying, and increases in social satisfaction for the students with 
autism. Second, the peer mentors also had a positive impact on student’s social life and the 
feeling of being included. Third, there was an increase in the fact that students saw their peers 
as being a source of support. And fourth, being a peer mentor increased the likelihood that 
students with autism recognized that they could be a source of support for their peers. 
This research study established that the peer mentoring program can be a way to 
enable both cooperation and social support in a school setting. Their approach of creating an 
equitable and inclusive environment for every student led to more understanding and 
acceptance between students with autism and students without autism.  
Combining Instructional Strategies.  All of these strategies have proven to be very 
effective for educators. The reduction of inappropriate behavior, the acquisition of skills 
and/or the increase of appropriate social interactions have been the goals for many of the 
studies using social stories. An early study was done by Thiemann and Goldstein (2001) 
which studied and evaluated the effect of using written text in the form of social stories and 
picture cues along with video feedback on the social skills of five students with autism. Two 
of the student’s peers were also included and grouped with the autistic students. A multiple-
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
12 
baseline design across two or three skills was used. The study used the targeted skills of 
securing attention, initiating comments, initiating responses and making contingent responses. 
After starting the intervention, the students showed improved rates of appropriate social 
behavior. The study also stated that two students also showed increases in initiation for 
requests and responses in the general education classroom. The study stated that there were 
some generalized results within the classroom. Results were shown when using a combination 
of visual cues but did not clarify the effects of using the social stories alone. 
 An article by Christine Ogilvie (2011) discussed the idea of using video models and 
peer mentors in social skills instruction. Again, the idea of combining the methods was 
addressed and the article stated that when using video modeling with peer mentoring, one can 
provide a “greater impact” (Oglivie, 2011). This article addressed different types of video 
modeling including video prompting, in-vivo modeling, video modeling and video self-
modeling. It also listed the ten steps to video modeling. A key first step for teachers to create 
effective videos is making sure that the behavior that is being introduced or modified is 
identified. The next step would then be to find out where the student’s skill level is for that 
behavior. The third step would be to choose student peers who can help in creating the video 
models. Then the task of creating the video is next. Once the video model is created, it is time 
to start the intervention. This is another time where peer mentors can be used. Together the 
students can review the video model and practice the skill. This combination can be a very 
effective tool to use with ASD students. Ogilvie did, however, state that “the more frequently 
students watch the video and practice the skills with their peer mentors, the more likely they 
will be to learn, maintain, and generalize the skills (2011, p. 26).”

Virtual Reality (VR)  
As technology has increased and changed, so have the options for educators when 
dealing with instructional strategies. One method is the use of virtual reality. The Merriam-
Webster’s online dictionary defines virtual reality as an artificial environment which is 
experienced through sensory stimuli (such as sights and sounds) provided by a computer and 
in which one’s actions partially determine what happens in the environment. In this computer-
generated environment, the user can be exposed to many situations in a real-world 
environment.  
There have been many studies done regarding the use of virtual reality since its 
creation. One of the earliest studies was done to identify new trends in technology and also 
identify the potential these technological finds may have. This study done by John Woodward 
(1996) stated that while the use of virtual reality is “seductive”, the reality is that the success 
of virtual reality in learning depends on many factors, most importantly that the systems used 
are based in instruction methods that are supported (Woodward, 1996). Another study done in 
1996 used virtual reality with ASD students as a tool for learning. This study was done to test 
the tolerance of the VR equipment and also to see how ASD students would respond to the 
computer-generated environments (Strickland, Marcus, Mesibov, & Hogan, 1996). The study 
involved two students and the goal was to have the students accept and wear the helmets, 
which would help them identify safety signs in the virtual reality environment. The goal was 
for this skill to generalize into the real world so that these students would be able to recognize 
real world safety signs. The introduction of this technology showed that virtual reality can 
lead to success as a teaching tool.  
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES

 A newer study done by Parsons, Mitchell, & Leonard in 2004 sought to determine 
whether ASD students, using virtual reality as a representation of reality, could generalize 
skills of social appropriateness to their environment. There were 36 participants in this study, 
12 of which had a diagnosis of ASD. All participants demonstrated a full-scale IQ of 70 or 
greater with the exception of one who’s full-scale IQ was 66. The 12 ASD participants were 
between the ages of 13 to 18 and were considered high functioning. Each ASD participant 
was grouped with two other participants and matched by age, gender, verbal IQ (VIQ) and 
performance IQ (PIQ). 
 The participants were given training virtual environments to begin with to make sure 
that the students were comfortable with navigating and using the VR equipment. Once they 
completed four training trials, the Virtual Café environment was used to work on daily skills. 
This environment was more complex than the training environment with a more realistic look. 
Participants were given a checklist of tasks to perform while in the Virtual Café.  Minimal 
prompting was given to students and when participants ask about upcoming tasks, they were 
directed back to the checklist that was provided. Some results from the study: for each task 
given in the Virtual Café, the ASD group scored lowest (except for the card shift test) and the 
PIQ group scored the highest. In general, the PIQ groups scored higher on tasks that either the 
ASD group and the VIQ group. Overall, the PIQ group seemed to be quickest in the areas of 
completing trials and navigation while the VIQ group had an uneven profile and the ASD 
group seemed to show improvements across the trials. One finding that was discussed was 
that ASD participants in this study, with lower IQ’s, were more likely to err on tasks 
involving social judgement, which may suggest there is a link between social understanding 
and IQ.  
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
15 
 Studies have also been done to test the acceptance and willingness of participants with 
ASD to use VR equipment. A study was done in 2016 with 29 participants, all of which had a 
previous diagnosis of ASD and IQ’s ranging from 45 to 138. The purpose of the study was to 
investigate the willingness and acceptance of people with ASD to use VR head mounted 
displays. It also explored the sense of presence and the immersion of ASD participants 
(Newbutt et al., 2016). Of the participants of this study, the mean age was 32.02 and the 
majority of them were males. 
 A basic questionnaire about demographics was administered first as well as the 
Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Once these were completed, subjects 
participated in Phase 1 experimental session where they used a head-mounted display (HMD) 
virtual reality technology (VRT). During Phase 1, participants were to navigate three simple 
VR scenarios, for approximately 10 minutes. Participants were asked after Phase 1 if they 
would like to return for the second phase and of the 29 participants, 23 chose to return. From 
those 23, eleven were chosen to participate in the next session, Phase II, which consisted of 
two longer VR experiences (about 25 minutes) which were more intense. After Phase II was 
completed, another questionnaire was given to participants about the immersion experience. 
 Here are some of the results from this study. During both phases, all participants were 
willing and able to wear the HDM. From the WASI, the participants were divided into two 
groups (IQ’s less than or equal to 69, IQ’s greater than or equal to 70). Results showed that IQ 
did not affect the acceptance of wearing and using the HDM. This study revealed, from the 
questionnaires given and observations, that ASD participants accepted the HMD and were 
willing to complete the VR experiences. These findings were important because they provided 
initial evidence that for this group of ASD participants, there was minimal negative effects 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
16 
from wearing a HMD. These results help to shed light on how people with ASD react to and 
accept the use of HDM.  
Summary.  All of the literature that was reviewed and discussed points to a 
conclusion. This conclusion is that social skills intervention is needed for ASD students and 
while there are many different methods that have been used, there are very few that have 
incorporated the use of virtual reality.  
 Many of the studies showed a greater positive impact on students when using methods 
in unison with each other verses independently. And programs that incorporate virtual reality 
allow instruction to be done in a safe controlled environment where students are able to 
practice the skills they have learned. These studies have shown that virtual reality can be an 
effective method for teaching social skills to students with ASD.   
Hypothesis Statement 
Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder who are instructed using virtual reality will 
show a significant change from pre-test to post-test scores in social communication skills.

CHAPTER TWO 
Research Questions 
Teachers in the high school DCD setting often spend a lot of time working with ASD 
students and teaching them in areas where they have deficits. One of the biggest areas that seems 
to be a common skill deficit is in the area of social skills. And while there are many instructional 
interventions available that can be used, teachers are often looking for a social skills program 
that is general enough to be work for each ASD student’s need. Here are two questions that I 
formulated regarding a less common intervention method.  
1. Will high school students with ASD improve their social conversation skills through 
the use of virtual reality?  
2. Will the high school students with ASD generalize the social skills learned in the 
virtual world into the classroom with their peers? 
Research Methods 
The social communication skill levels of the ASD students were reviewed using the 
student’s current IEP data with a review of assessments used to determine what level of delays 
they possess. Due to the delays in critical thinking skills, and their ability to develop 
conversational skills, each ASD student in this study attends a class to learn social 
communication skills. Through the review of various studies, it is shown that virtual reality is an 
effective social skills intervention method.  
Research Design.  A single subject design across students with A B phases was used. 
During Phase A, each student’s social conversation skills were recorded. Then during Phase B, 
instruction was provided 3 days a week for 4 weeks. After instruction, student interaction and 
performance were observed and recorded by the teacher using observation checklists.  
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
18 
Measurement Materials.  This study involved the use of virtual reality for social skills 
instruction on the conversation skills of high school students with ASD. The goal was to use the 
virtual reality world to demonstrate appropriate social conversation skills. Therefore, data 
collection tools were specifically designed, and observable data was used.       
 Observation checklists were used during the study to collect data, recording student 
performance prior to and after the instruction. Prior to the first lesson, informal conversation 
skills were observed and recorded for 5 consecutive days using the Classroom Conversation 
Skills Checklist. This first checklist was used prior to instruction in the virtual world. It recorded 
student performance on greeting, conversation and closing. Each category included: 1) verbal 
greeting: including eye contact, personal space, and volume; 2) conversation: including asking a 
question, making comment on the topic, and asking a follow-up question; and 3) verbal closing: 
closing comment to end the conversation, saying “good-bye”. The prompting hierarchy was rated 
as follows: No Response, 1 point; Direct verbal prompt, 2 points; Indirect verbal prompt, 3 
points; No Prompts (independent), 4 points. Table 2 presents the checklist.

Once the lessons in the virtual world were completed, informal conversation skills were observed 
and recorded for 5 consecutive days using the Conversation Skills Checklist after the Virtual 
World. This second checklist was used to evaluate the independent skills that students showed in 
social situations after being in the virtual world. The skills evaluated included: 1) greeting; 2) 
asking a question; 3) making a comment; 4) asking a follow-up question, 5) closing comment, 
and 6) closing. These tools were valid because the content being measured were the specific 
variables listed for the research. Same prioritizing points (1-4) were recorded, (See Figure 1).

In addition, a teacher checklist was also used to record data during the student’s day in a class 
other than the student’s social skills class. The teacher checklist was presented to general 
education teachers to record information about the student’s social functioning in the general 
education classroom. The teacher checklists were completed prior to and after entering the 
virtual world.

6. Student is comfortable talking with friends. 
Schedule.  This research study was administered over a 4-week time period. Prior to 
the start of the study, the high school ASD students were taught how to navigate the virtual 
world for 20 minutes, twice a week for two weeks. Students were then taught appropriate social 
communication skills in lessons. Each lesson was delivered in class followed by a discussion on 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
21 
the specific social situations. Then, the ASD students applied what they had learned in the virtual 
world. Teachers monitored the students’ social interactions after being in the virtual world to 
record performance using a checklist.  
Ethical Issues.  An ethical issue anticipated was the possible stress on the ASD students’ 
due to changes in their routine and the incorporation of the virtual reality devices. Many students 
in the classroom rely on their daily routines to be the same. Adding a new stimulus could have 
added undue stress onto the student. Another possible ethical issue could be the long-term effects 
of using virtual reality. There is limited research on the effects of students using virtual reality, 
especially ASD students. Exposure to the virtual reality environment should be limited in time. 
Anticipated response.  When any of the previously stated ethical issues transpired, they 
were dealt with on an individual basis. The use of social stories worked with the ASD students to 
help them anticipate the change to their routine and the addition of the use of virtual reality 
devices. The shorter lesson times helped shorten exposure time to the virtual reality device and 
environment, which was done as well to assist the ASD student with their anxiety. Parents were 
assured that confidentiality was to be maintained throughout the study and in any reports 
generated.

CHAPTER THREE 
Description of Data 
 The results from the study are presented in Chapter 3. A visual graph is used to compare 
each students’ performance in Phase A and Phase B. Also, a visual graph is used for each student 
to compare their Phase A against their Phase B. The effectiveness of this study was assessed on 
the social communication skills of each student by measuring their verbal communications. 
Results.  Each student’s performance was evaluated using the observation checklist to 
record their six social communication skills: greeting, asking a question, making a comment, 
asking a follow up question, closing comment, and closing conversation.

Results of teacher rating showed some improvement with post survey scores being larger than 
pre. An example of increase was item 5, “Student communicates well with his/her peers.”. The 
score was 0 in the pre-survey and 10% in the post survey. Another example is item 2, “Student 
does not interrupt others when engaged in conversation”. Students scored 0 in the pre-and 15% 
in the post. Overall, most of the teacher responses indicate small successes. Thus, the study 
evidenced that the students were able to increase social communication skills through the use of 
virtual reality.  
Instructional Materials 
The Conversation Train and Speech Everyday Social Skills program. This book and 
video/worksheet program (www.everydayspeech.com) was used in Lessons 1 through 6, which 
were done prior to entering the virtual reality phase. The Conversation Train book created a 
visual approach for students to learn some of the basics of conversation by relating these steps to 
a train. Trains were used as metaphors for the elements of conversation. The book gave six areas 
of conversation skills to teach and to review which included: (1) starting a conversation; (2) 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
26 
taking turns in conversation; (3) staying on track; (4) changing topics; (5) ending the 
conversation; and (6) putting it all together (Shaul, 2014).  
Speech Everyday Social Skills program. This is social skills material using social skills 
videos, apps, and worksheets, which features middle and high school-aged children. This 
curriculum uses video modeling to demonstrate conversation skills like how to start a 
conversation by introducing yourself, listening with your body, making connected comments, 
and seeing someone else’s side. The series uses demonstration of skills in different environments 
to help with generalization of skills. 
Q Moment AR and Merge Cube. This is the virtual reality program and device used to 
practice social pragmatic skills. The Q Moment AR app is an Augmented Reality (AR) tool that 
is used to increase the emotional responsiveness in children with autism. The Merge Cube is a 
holographic toy. This allows a student to interact with 3D objects and not only uses virtual 
reality technology but also augmented reality (AR) technology. To activate the Q Moment app, 
the student needs the Merge Cube. The Merge Cube can be used with VR goggles and a 
smartphone or without VR goggles with the use of a smartphone or tablet. Learners see animated 
characters that help them navigate the virtual world, while figuring out social situations. In the 
social module, students view various roleplay situations and scenarios. Students and teachers are 
able to discuss and talk through to determine what the situation is about and what action should 
happen.  
Instructional Procedures.  Prior to participating in this study, students were taught how 
to place the virtual reality devices on their heads and how to work with the Merge Cube to be 
able to see the virtual characters. The students were exposed to the Merge Cube using various 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
27 
free game apps and the VR device. Students were exposed to the virtual world using the Merge 
Cube for 15 minutes, three times a week, for two weeks.  
The students were taught appropriate social communication skills in 6 lessons to review 
appropriate communication skills. Each lesson was delivered in class using videos and 
worksheets, which was followed by a brief discussion on the specific social scenarios they saw 
and then they participated in some role play. Then, students applied their social communication 
skills when participating in a virtual environment.  
The topic of the first lesson was the conversation train. This lesson included: the teacher 
reading the Conversation Train book, followed by discussion and class activities on the areas of 
conversation skills to which included: (1) starting a conversation; (2) taking turns in 
conversation; (3) staying on track; (4) changing topics; (5) ending the conversation; and (6) 
putting it all together. Lessons 2 through 6 followed the video/worksheet program from 
Everyday Speech. In these lessons, the students watched a video demonstrating a group of 
students with appropriate and inappropriate conversations. These videos segments allowed 
students to view appropriate communication scenarios and showed them topics like introducing 
themselves, listening with their bodies, approaching a group, making eye contact, making 
connected comments, and seeing someone else’s side. After the video presentation, the teacher 
led a class discussion to further clarify the skills by questions and answers. A worksheet was also 
used to expand knowledge and practice the skills. This was followed by applying the skills 
learned in the virtual world. Table 3 presents the lessons, topics, and procedures. Teachers 
monitored the students while in the virtual world and then recorded individual student’s 
performance after practice in the virtual world using the checklist presented in Figure 2.

Measurement Procedures.  The observation checklists and teacher checklists were used 
both at the beginning and the end of the study. The Classroom Conversation Skills Checklist. 
Prior to the start of the study and the first lesson, the students were observed on five consecutive 
days while their conversation skills were observed and recorded using the Classroom 
Conversation Skills Checklist by the teacher. These were used to assess the students’ social 
conversation abilities in the classroom. The students were observed in a Communications class 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
29 
with their peers to identify their social communication skills. They were observed during 
classroom activities when they were in group work with peers.  
Conversation Skills Checklist after the Virtual World. Each student’s face to face 
communication skills were recorded in class after going through all sessions in the virtual world. 
The students’ ability to ask a question, make a comment, stay on topic, ask a follow-up question 
and respond to questions was recorded. Observations after the virtual world provided 
information on student responses to different social scenarios, such as greeting a person, 
introducing a topic, commenting on topics, asking questions, making appropriate sentences for 
high school, and closing a conversation.  
Teacher’s Checklist. The teacher checklist was used to record a students’ social 
communication skills such as; ability to start conversation, not interrupting, remaining on topic, 
and forms of communication. The students’ social communication skills were assessed in an 
academic setting using the checklist prior to virtual instruction and also after virtual instruction.  
Research Questions 
Will high school students with ASD improve their social communication skills 
through the use of virtual reality? The results showed that after the use of virtual reality 
teaching social skills, there was a small increase in most areas of student social communication. 
Students practiced using real world social scenarios in a virtual world. Because students with 
ASD are visual learners, practicing appropriate social behaviors through the use of imitation and 
viewing the models in the virtual world lead to some success.  
Will the high school students with ASD generalize the social skills learned in the 
virtual world into the classroom environment with their peers? The results showed that the 
students increased minimally in scores after being in the virtual reality scenarios and 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
30 
demonstrated the skills they learned with peers in the classroom. The teacher pre-and post-rating 
scores indicated that students were able to generalize some of the social communication skills in 
the classroom. The virtual world allows for the practice of high school social scenarios which 
increases the potential for generalization in the classroom and also in the real world.  
Conclusions  
The purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of virtual reality when 
teaching social communication skills to high school students with ASD. The study attempted to 
evaluate the application of virtual reality to improve these students’ conversational skills in 
social communication with their peers. The six target social skills were evaluated by student 
conversation scores across phases A and B, and teacher ratings. The results showed that students 
had small increases in their social communication skills after using virtual reality social 
communication scenarios. These scenarios contained examples of appropriate conversations as a 
model for students. Thus, the students’ social communication opportunities increased compared 
to their performance in the baseline. 
The purpose of virtual reality is to provide students an opportunity to learn appropriate 
social communication behaviors in certain social situations. It may create another social 
communication environment for some learners who are not feeling comfortable to face real 
persons, but like to practice in a situation in a virtual world. Teachers should make every effort 
to obtain information regarding the social skills training for their students. Intervention strategies 
(e.g., social stories and video modeling) implemented along with virtual reality may be necessary 
to increase the opportunities to teach social communication skills. Virtual reality intervention can 
provide a chance for students to learn appropriate social skills that lead to their success in school.  
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
31 
Students with ASD struggle to develop, build, and maintain social relationships; virtual 
reality provides an opportunity to improve social engagement as well as social communication in 
school. The findings of this study support previous research (e.g. Parsons, 2006.) recommending 
social skills training for students with ASD. Future research is needed to validate the findings 
and also to expand to students of different ages and even different disabilities.

CHAPTER FOUR 
The use of technology in school provides an effective way for teachers to teach and 
students to learn. One example is the use of virtual reality. This study attempted to teach social 
communication skills to high school students with autism by use of virtual reality, and created 
another option for teachers for social communication skills instruction. I believe that the use of 
technology provides more options for teachers in instruction and this in turn is very beneficial for 
students. 
Action Plan 
Although each student demonstrated some positive outcomes, there are some areas of 
improvement that need to be considered in order for virtual reality to be established as an 
evidence-based practice. There are very limited curriculum choices for teaching ASD students’ 
social communication skills. The use of different programs to find out which is the most 
effective for teaching social skills to students with ASD is needed. It would be important to 
compare the Q Moment AR social pragmatics program with other VR programs that focus on 
teaching social skills to students with ASD.  
It would also be beneficial to study the use of virtual reality for students of different ages, 
such as middle school students. Further, other skills and behaviors can be taught through the use 
of virtual reality in addition to the six specific communication skills. This study used the Q 
Moment AR and Merge Cube as the only program for the social skills training in the virtual 
world. Virtual reality programs teaching social communication skills are limited. Given the 
lifelong social communication difficulties associated with ASD, more information needs to be 
explored in terms of social communication skills taught through the use of virtual reality. This 
study demonstrates the effects of virtual reality on the social communication of high school 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
33 
students with ASD in a resource room setting. Future research may extend beyond the 
intervention phase in order to determine the long-term benefits of virtual reality for students with 
disabilities. Further information is needed regarding the use of virtual reality with students with 
ASD as well as with students with other disabilities.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
34 
CHAPTER FIVE 
Social experiences and relationships can be difficult for students with ASD. Using virtual 
reality provides opportunities for these students to practice social communication skills in a 
comfortable and safe environment. This opportunity should be considered by administration and 
school personnel in order to provide such an environment for students with disabilities. Teachers 
should be exposed to this virtual world to search for resources for their students. 
Plan for Sharing 
The school where this research study was conducted has monthly sessions called 
Common Prep. Once a month, teachers are expected to attend a learning session during their 
prep class period that is typically put on by administration. The focus of these sessions is 
creating a relaxed atmosphere to share new information and to provide a small group arena for 
learning. The results of this study will be shared with staff during a common prep session.  
This common prep session was created for teaching staff as well as for administration and 
it will present an overview of autism as well as some evidence-based intervention approaches. 
The objectives for this session for attendees are as follows: to gain a basic understanding of the 
diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, to learn some of its characteristics, to gain an overview of 
some key strategies for educating students with ASD specifically in the area of social skills, to 
gain an overview of current evidence-based approaches to intervention when working with ASD 
students, and to explore the use of virtual reality as an intervention method.  
As the definition told us, Autism Spectrum Disorder is a “broad continuum (Salend, 
2011)” which means that each student is different. When designing instruction or interventions, 
an individuals’ needs must be carefully considered. The primary focus of any instructional 
method, strategy, or intervention should be on improving communication skills, social skills, and 
USING VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICES 
 
35 
academic skills. By focusing on these ideas, you are focusing on quality-of-life outcomes for 
these individuals and the hope for a successful future.

Einleitung                                                                                   1 
 
1. Einleitung 
In den folgenden Abschnitten geht es darum, erste Eindrücke zu dem Thema der 
vorliegenden Arbeit zu gewinnen. 
Die Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit dem Thema „Virtual Reality als Marketinginstrument im 
Tourismus“ und wurde im Rahmen des Bachelorstudiums Business Management mit 
Schwerpunkt Tourismus, Hotel und Event Management erstellt. Die Wahl des Themas 
wurde aus verschiedenen Gründen getroffen. 
Ein Grund für die Wahl dieses Themas waren die ersten Berührungspunkte mit dem 
Thema Virtual Reality. Die Verfasserin kam bereits in ihrem vorhergehenden Studium 
der Informationswirtschaft am Karlsruher Institut für Technologie das erste Mal mit 
diesem Thema in Berührung. Schon damals war die Verfasserin von dem Thema Virtual 
Reality fasziniert und konnte sich auch zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits vorstellen eine Arbeit 
über dieses Thema anzufertigen. 
Eine Verknüpfung der beiden Studienrichtungen kam der Verfasserin jedoch erst in den 
Sinn, nachdem sie eine Dokumentation über den Einsatz von Virtual Reality im 
Europapark Rust gesehen hatte. Nach verschiedenen Überlegungen und Recherchen in 
den diversen touristischen Bereichen, kam die Verfasserin von der ursprünglichen Idee, 
die Arbeit über Virtual Reality in Freizeit- und Themenparks zu schreiben, ab und 
entschied sich für die Variante des Marketinginstrumentes im Tourismus, denn in diesem 
Bereich sah die Verfasserin viel Potential das in den nächsten Jahren noch weiter 
steigen wird. 
 
 
1.1. Hinführung zur Thematik 
Heute haben wir fast überall Zugang zum Internet und fast jeder besitzt mittlerweile 
ein Smartphone oder ein internetfähiges mobiles Endgerät. Aufgrund dessen sind 
die meisten Menschen zu jeder Zeit mobil. Aus diesem Grund ist man es gewohnt 
schnell und überall an Informationen zu kommen und sein Wissen über ein Thema 
effizient zu erweitern oder zu vertiefen. 
Auch wenn es um die Buchung eines Fluges oder eine Urlaubsreise geht, 
recherchieren die Meisten erst einmal kurz im Internet, um zuvor schon einen groben 
Überblick zu bekommen. Oft reicht es dabei nicht mehr einfach nur Texte und Bilder 
auf einer Website anzuschauen, sondern es geht dabei um das ganzheitliche 
Erlebnis. Schließlich konnte man, mit der bisherigen Technologie, nur von außen auf 
Einleitung                                                                                   2 
 
die jeweilige Szene schauen in dem man Bilder oder Videos betrachtete. Durch 
Virtual Reality (VR) hat man neuerdings die Möglichkeit in das Geschehen 
einzutauchen und zu einem gewissen Grad selbst zu bestimmen, was man sich 
anschauen und erleben möchte. 
Die eigentliche Frage, die man sich als Mittler touristischer Attraktionen stellen sollte, 
ist, wie bekommt man die Menschen dazu diese Technologien zu nutzen? Denn sie 
muss den Kunden einen deutlichen Mehrwert wie Spaß, soziale Interaktionen oder 
interessante Informationen bieten, damit sie anfangen, diese neuen Technologien 
überhaupt zu nutzen. 
Wie Howard Rheingold bereits 1992 sagte: “Im Zentrum der VR steht eine Erfahrung 
– die Erfahrung in einer virtuellen Welt oder an einem fremden Ort zu sein1.“  
Genau diese Erfahrung möchten sich die Reiseveranstalter, Fluggesellschaften, 
Hoteliers und so weiter zu eigen machen, denn nur durch das Präsentieren 
besonderer Highlights, hebt man sich im Informationsdschungel von anderen 
Mitbewerbern ab. Die Erfahrung an einem fremden Ort zu sein, der virtuell erst 
einmal genauso auf einen einwirkt wie, wenn man diesen Ort real besuchen würde 
und gleichzeitig in seiner gewohnten Umgebung zu sein, eröffnet eine ganz neue 
Anziehungskraft für den Tourismus. 
Durch die bereits gesammelten Eindrücke der Destination, wie das virtuelle 
Schlendern durch einen unbekannten Ort oder das vorherige Erkunden eines Hotels 
oder einer Klasse im Flugzeug, ist das Verlangen größer diesen Ort im Realen zu 
besuchen und zu erkunden. Denn für viele Menschen ist der Urlaub, die schönste 
Zeit im Jahr, und somit stellen die Reisenden hohe Ansprüche an ihre Urlaubsreisen. 
Diese Ansprüche könnten dann durch das vorherige virtuelle Anschauen abgefragt 
und gegebenenfalls angepasst werden. Außerdem kann der Konsument so 
entscheiden, ob ihm der Ort zusagt oder eher weniger. Demnach kann 
gegebenenfalls direkt reagiert und nach einer Alternative gesucht werden. 
 
 
1.2. Problemstellung 
Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es, herauszuarbeiten wie Virtual Reality als 
Marketinginstrument in touristischen Unternehmen zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt 
eingesetzt wird und wie beziehungsweise ob es sich bereits am Markt etabliert hat. 
                                            
1 Rheingold, 1992 
Einleitung                                                                                   3 
 
Dies basiert hauptsächlich auf den Beispielen der Marriott Hotel Gruppe, der 
Lufthansa Group sowie einer empirischen Studie bei den Verbrauchern. 
Hierbei stellt sich die Frage, welche Aspekte Menschen dazu bewegen zu reisen. 
Man kann davon ausgehen, dass die zwei Hauptantriebskräfte des menschlichen 
Verhaltens, Motivation und Emotion, die entscheidenden Faktoren für eine 
Urlaubsreise und somit auch für Virtual Reality als Marketingaspekt sind. Man sollte 
jedoch bei der Motivation unterscheiden, ob sie extrinsisch oder intrinsisch geprägt 
ist. Hierbei kommt es zum Beispiel auch darauf an, ob es sich um eine Urlaubs- oder 
Geschäftsreise handelt.2 
Geht man von einer Geschäftsreise aus ist die Motivation eher extrinsisch, also auf 
Grund eines Jobs oder bedingt durch eine einer Pflicht. Bei einer Urlaubsreise ist die 
Motivation intrinsisch, da man diese Reise freiwillig machen möchte. Und somit muss 
man auch hier bei Virtual Reality ansetzten, denn die Touristen müssen Virtual 
Reality gerne benutzen, es soll einen Mehrwert bieten und die Motivation 
unterstützen diese Reise durchführen zu wollen. 
„They may forget what you said, but they never will forget how you make them feel.”3  
Dieses Zitat von Carl Buechner aus dem Jahr 2016 beschreibt ziemlich gut einen der 
wichtigsten Faktoren im Marketing, die Emotionen. Denn durch geschicktes 
Einsetzen von Marketing sowie Virtual Reality, können bei einem Menschen gezielt, 
zum Beispiel unter Anwendung von bestimmten Schlüsselreizen, Emotionen 
ausgelöst und dadurch eine gewünschte Verhaltensreaktion hervorgerufen werden. 
Jedoch sollten nicht nur solche Schlüsselreize zum Einsatz kommen, ansonsten 
stumpfen die Konsumenten zu schnell ab. Schlussendlich geht es darum, wie bereits 
im vorhergegangenen Abschnitt erwähnt, ein ganzheitliches Erlebniskonzept zu 
erstellen, welches dem Konsumenten nachhaltig im Gedächtnis bleibt.4 
Durch den zunehmenden Wunsch seine Zielgruppen individuell anzusprechen, ist 
der Einsatz von Virtual Reality in der Hinsicht sinnvoll, dass dadurch gezielte 
Einflüsse auf aktivierende und kognitive Prozesse im Insystem der Nachfrager 
genommen werden kann 5.

1.3. Methodische Vorgehensweise und Aufbau der Arbeit 
Die vorliegende Arbeit ist in fünf Abschnitte gegliedert. Nach der Einführung im ersten 
Kapitel, wird im zweiten Kapitel zunächst der zentrale Begriff „Virtual Reality“ näher 
erläutert. Weiter werden die Grundlagen des Tourismusmarketings und die 
Entwicklung sowie die Marketingeinsatzmöglichkeiten und die Einsatzmöglichkeiten 
in den einzelnen touristischen Segmenten näher betrachtet, um den Lesern die 
Thematik näher zu bringen.  
Das dritte Kapitel befasst sich mit der Umsetzung von Virtual Reality als 
Marketinginstrument. Hier werden die Umsetzungsbeispiele der Marriott Hotelkette 
sowie der Lufthansa Group vorgestellt. Anschließend erfolgen eine vergleichende 
Analyse der beiden Unternehmen sowie auch ein Vergleich mit Beispielen derselben 
Branche.  
Außerdem wird in Kapitel vier durch eine Befragung, die Meinung der Bevölkerung 
zu dem Thema Virtual Reality allgemein und als Marketinginstrument erörtert. Diese 
wurde im Laufe der Bearbeitungsphase als empirische Online-Befragung 
durchgeführt. Durch eine Facebook-Kampagne sowie zahlreiche Kontakte der 
Verfasserin, konnten 168 Probanden für die Befragung generiert werden.  
Im fünften und letzten Kapitel werden die Erkenntnisse der Arbeit nochmals 
zusammengefasst, diskutiert, ein Blick in die Zukunft aufgezeigt sowie 
Handlungsempfehlungen formuliert. 
 
  
Theoretische Grundlagen                                                                                   5 
 
2. Theoretische Grundlagen 
„Virtual Reality refers to use of three-dimensional displays and interaction devices to 
explore real-time computer-generated environments.”6 
Wie das Zitat bereits sagt, ist Virtual Reality eine spezielle Technologie um Nutzer in 
eine computergenerierte, dreidimensionale Umgebung zu entführen und diese in einer 
360° Sicht zu erkunden. Dies ist möglich, da die Head-Mounted-Displays (HDM), wie 
man die Virtual Reality Endgeräte auch bezeichnet, auf Kopfbewegung reagieren 
können. Jedoch gibt es Virtual Reality nicht nur als mobile virtuelle Realität in Head-
Mounted-Displays, sondern auch als 360° Grad Videos auf Computern oder mobilen 
Endgeräten, ebenso wie in computergestützten VR Headsets. 
Im Folgenden wird der Begriff Virtual Reality und dessen Geschichte erklärt, sowie die 
Grundlagen des Tourismusmarketings vorgestellt. Weiter werden die Möglichkeiten der 
Einsetzbarkeit als Marketinginstrument, der aktuelle Stand der Dinge sowie die 
Einsatzmöglichkeiten als Marketinginstrument in den verschiedenen touristischen 
Bereichen erörtert. 
 
 
2.1. Begriffserklärung Virtual Reality 
Der Mensch nimmt seine Umwelt mittels seiner verschiedenen Sinne auf. Durch 
reflektierendes Licht nimmt das Auge die realen Objekte in der Umwelt wahr und löst 
somit verschiedene Impulse aus. Durch die mehr als 30 Millionen Sinneszellen ist 
die visuelle Wahrnehmung die wichtigste Informationsquelle des Menschen. Somit 
versucht man sich diese zu Nutze zu machen und hier mit der Technik anzusetzen. 
Virtual Reality beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, ob man diese Impulse auch mit einer 
Computersimulation auslösen kann. Kann man eine Person, durch das Simulieren 
einer real wirkenden Welt, so manipulieren, dass sie denkt sie sei in einer realen 
Welt und dadurch nicht mehr unterscheiden kann was real ist und was nicht. 
Mit diesem Phänomen haben sich auch schon diverse Filme und Bücher 
auseinandergesetzt. Berühmtestes Bespiel hierfür ist der Film „Matrix“ und dessen 
Fortsetzungen, der Wachowski Brüder. In diesen Science-Fiction-Filmen ist die 
Menschheit durch die Herrschaft der Maschinen in eine solch realistische Virtuelle 
                                            
6 Dörner/Jung/Grimm/Broll/Göbel 2013, 13 
Theoretische Grundlagen                                                                                   6 
 
Realität versetzt, dass sie sich dieser Scheinwelt überhaupt nicht mehr bewusst sind 
und sie für ihre Reale halten.7 
Diese perfekte visuelle Realität wird auch als „Suspension of Disbelief“ bezeichnet. 
Durch die virtuelle Welt wird versucht, die Reize des Menschen so zu manipulieren, 
dass die Person sich komplett in diese Welt hineinversetzt und sie nicht mehr von 
der realen Welt unterscheiden kann. Ein gutes Beispiel hierfür ist die Simulation, in 
der sich die Person auf dem Dach eines Wolkenkratzers befindet. Durch das 
Nähertreten an einen scheinbaren Abgrund und das Hinabsehen wird der Puls und 
die Atmung der Person immer schneller und die Hände werden feucht, obwohl sich 
die Person eigentlich in einem Zimmer ohne Abgrund befindet, jedoch so komplett 
mit der virtuellen Welt verschmolzen ist, dass sie nicht mehr unterscheiden kann, ob 
sie wirklich am Abgrund steht oder zu Hause im Wohnzimmer sitzt.8 
 
 
2.2. Entwicklung Virtual Reality 
Die Entwicklung von Virtual Reality beginnt am Anfang des 19. Jahrhunderts, wobei 
der genaue Zeitpunkt schwer festzulegen ist, denn es gab zu dieser Zeit 
verschiedene Experimente bezüglich Virtual Reality. 
Der erste konkrete Entwurf entstand im Jahre 1956 mit Sensorama, eine Art 3D-
Kino, welches der erste passive VR Automat war. Jedoch war dies nur ein 
aufwändiges Einzelstück, ohne kommerziellen Erfolg. 
In Fachkreisen wird der Artikel „The Ultimate Display“ von Ivan Edward Sutherland 
aus dem Jahre 1965 als Grundstein von Virtual Reality gehandelt. Sutherland hatte 
bereits damals die Vorstellung eines ultimativen Displays, welches seine Nutzer in 
einer computergenerierten Welt bannen kann. Drei Jahre später veröffentlichte er 
das Buch „A Head-Mounted-Three Dimensional Display“ durch welches er das 
„Sword of Damocles“ realisierte. Dies ist ein an der Decke befestigtes Gerät, welches 
das erste bekannte Head-Mounted Display  war.9

Theoretische Grundlagen                                                                                   7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kurz darauf wurde Sutherland, zusammen mit David Evens, von der Universität Utah 
rekrutiert und zusammen gründeten sie die Firma Evans & Sutherland. Durch ihre 
Forschungen entwickelten sie Grundlagen für die verschiedenen Techniken der 
Computergrafik, wie sie heute beispielsweise in vielen Animationsfilmen zum Einsatz 
kommen.10 
Das VIEW-Projekt (Virtual Environment Workingstation) der NASA, in den 80er 
Jahren, war der erste virtuelle Arbeitsplatz. Zu dieser Zeit wurden auch die 
Computerprozessoren entwickelt, was die Entwicklung und Realisierung von Virtual 
Reality weiter vorantrieb. 11 
Ende der 80er gründeten Thomas Zimmermann und Jaron Lanier die Firma VPL. 
Diese entwickelte den „DataGlove“, einen Datenhandschuh zur Erfassung von 
Fingerdaten, sowie den Datenhelm „EyePhone“, welches eine Weiterführung des 
Head-Mounted Displays von Sutherland darstellte. 
Nintendo brachte 1995 das erste Head-Mounted-Display, den „Virtual Boy“ für 
Verbraucher auf den Markt. Die Videospielkonsole basierte auf Virtual Reality. Sie 
war keine VR Brille im gängigen Sinne, da sie auf einem Ständer befestigt war und

somit nur stationär benutzt werden konnte. Außerdem sorgte sie für 
Nackenschmerzen und ein allgemein unbequemes Spielerlebnis. Aus diesem Grund 
wurde die Produktion nach einem Jahr bereits eingestellt, da das Spielerlebnis an zu 
schlechter Bildqualität, Auflösung und der geringen Auswahl an Spielen scheiterte. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Danach war es lange still um die Entwicklung rund um VR, bis im Jahre 2012 eine 
neue Ära durch die Oculus Rift, eine neue Generation von VR-HMDs für den 
Massenmarkt, anbrach. Dies bildete den Startschuss auch für weitere Software-und 
Hardwarehersteller wieder in diese Technologien zu investieren. 
Nach der Übernahme von Oculus VR durch Facebook im Jahr 2014 bekam das 
Thema VR mediale Aufmerksamkeit und zahlreiche große Unternehmen wie Google, 
Samsung, Sony und HTC arbeiteten an der Entwicklung ihrer eigenen Technologien. 
Für den Durchbruch auf dem Massenmarkt gilt das Jahr 2016. In diesem Jahr wurde 
die Oculus Rift, die HTC Vive und die Playstation VR dem Massenmarkt zugänglich 
gemacht. In diesem Jahr wurde eine Absatzmenge von 14,9 Millionen Exemplaren 
prognostiziert, welche sich bis 2020 laut Prognose auf knapp eine Milliarde 
Exemplare erhöhen wird.12

2.3. Grundlagen Tourismusmarketing 
Durch die Ähnlichkeit der Tourismusbranche zur Dienstleistungsbranche ist auch 
beim Tourismus-Marketing auf diverse Besonderheiten zu achten, denn das Produkt 
Tourismus ist ein sehr komplexes. Wie auch bei Dienstleistungen ist das Produkt im 
Tourismus nichts Greifbares. Zudem ist es eine schwer messbare Leistung und wird 
sozusagen erst am „Ort der Verwertung produziert“13. 
Somit spielen vier Merkmale für das Tourismusmarketing eine wesentliche Rolle. 
Zum einen, die bereits erwähnte Immaterialität, denn schließlich existiert das 
touristische Produkt im physischen Sinne bzw. im Vergleich zum materiellen Gut 
nicht. Ein weiteres Merkmal ist das Uno-acto-Prinzip, welches die Untrennbarkeit der 
Leistungserstellung und des Konsums sowie die Mitwirkungspflicht der Touristen 
beschreibt. Die Heterogenität ist das dritte Merkmal, „welche die nur eingeschränkt 
mögliche Standardisierbarkeit touristischer Güter“14 beschreibt. Das letzte Merkmal 
ist die Vergänglichkeit bzw. die fehlende Möglichkeit der Lagerung touristischer 
Produkte. 
Das Tourismusmarketing wird hierbei in drei Phasen unterteilt: die Potentialphase, 
die Prozessphase und die Ergebnisphase. Bei der Potentialphase geht es um die 
Phase vor der eigentlichen Leistungserstellung, in der die Dienstleister ihre 
Fähigkeiten der Leistungserstellung unter Beweis stellen. Hierbei spielen 
Glaubwürdigkeit, Image, vorhandene Reiseerfahrung oder die Erfahrung anderer 
eine wichtige Rolle.15 Die nächste Phase ist die Prozessphase. Da die eigentliche 
Leistungserstellung erst nach Vertragsabschluss stattfindet, fallen Absatz und 
Leistungserstellung zusammen, wie das oben bereits erwähnte Uno-acto-Prinzip 
beschreibt. Da der Konsument hier unmittelbar beteiligt ist, besteht eine 
Mitwirkunspflicht des Nachfragers. Schließlich bestimmt sein Verhalten auch 
maßgeblich den Erfolg der Reise mit.16 In der dritten und letzten Phase, der 
Ergebnisphase, wird die materielle bzw. immaterielle Veränderung am Konsumenten 
begutachtet. Hier wird getestet, ob die Wünsche und Erwartungen des Konsumenten 
erfüllt worden sind. Diese Ergebnisse sind auch wichtig für weitere 
Marketingmaßnahmen. 
Ziel des Tourismusmarketings ist es die Wünsche ihrer Kunden zu erkennen und die 
erstellten touristischen Leistungen am Markt gewinnbringend zu verkaufen.17

Theoretische Grundlagen                                                                                   10 
 
Außerdem ist die Kenntnis über die Verhaltensweisen, Präferenzen und Werte der 
einzelnen Zielgruppen von entscheidender Bedeutung. Schließlich ist ein 
wesentlicher Aspekt, die Nachfrager überhaupt zu erreichen. 
Hierbei liegt auch die Schwierigkeit des Tourismusmarketings, denn die ähnliche 
Angebotspalette vieler Anbieter und deren leichte Austauschbarkeit bringen diverse 
Probleme mit sich. Deshalb müssen die Anbieter sich von ihren Wettbewerbern mit 
subjektiven, emotionalen Unterschieden differenzieren und so kommunizieren, dass 
ihr Angebot die Präferenz des Kunden am besten trifft. Denn im Grundprinzip sind 
die Angebote aller Anbieter gleich. Und somit gilt es immer wieder kreative, neue und 
andere Wege zu gehen, um sein eigenes Unternehmen wieder interessant zu 
machen und die Kunden zu binden. 
Marketing kann in diesem Fall nur besser betrieben werden, wenn man als 
Unternehmen, die zu Grunde liegenden Vorgänge einer Reiseentscheidung des 
Kunden kennt.18  
Ein weiterer wichtiger Faktor ist der perfekte Marketing-Mix. Durch die perfekte 
Kombination von Produkt-, Preis- Distributions- und Kommunikationspolitik kann ein 
Unternehmen viel erreichen. Auf Grund dessen sollten die Anbieter touristischer 
Leistungen ihre Kommunikationsziele genau festlegen und das ADIDAS-Modell 
zugrunde legen.

Durch die Verwendung des ADIDAS-Modells kann das Unternehmen ein hohes Maß 
an Bekanntheit erlangen sowie ein positives Image aufbauen. Denn schlussendlich 
interessiert den Kunden meistens nicht die einzelnen Teile der Reise, sondern nur 
die Gesamtwirkung und das Leistungspaket als Ganzes. 
Man sollte im Fall von touristischem Marketing zwischen verschiedenen 
Marketingmaßnahmen unterscheiden, wie zum Beispiel Mikro- und Makro-
Marketing, nachfragebezogenes Tourismus-Marketing, ganzheitliches Tourismus-
Marketing, Tourismus-Marketing als Marketing-Management-Methode sowie der 
bereits erwähnte Dienstleistungscharakter.19 
Beim Mikro-Marketing wird jeder touristische Betrieb als Einzelnes betrachtet und 
jeder Betrieb betreibt sein eigenes Marketing. Das Schwierige hierbei ist, dass die 
einzelnen Betriebe, trotzdem nur begrenzte Zielgruppen haben und sich einige 
Marketingmaßnahmen überschneiden. Beim Makro-Marketing hingegen wird das 
Ganze als kollektives Produkt gesehen und wird als Gesamtprodukt vermarktet. 
Hierbei müssen die einzelnen Betriebe ein gemeinsames Marketingkonzept 
entwickeln, somit kann die Überschneidung ähnlicher Marketingmaßnahmen auf 
                                            
19 Vgl. Freyer 2011, 62 
Theoretische Grundlagen                                                                                   12 
 
dieselbe Zielgruppe vermieden werden. Schlussendlich kann das Makro-Marketing, 
dass einzelbetriebliche Marketing nicht ersetzen, jedoch kann es Marketing in einer 
eigenständigen Dimension betreiben. 20 
Das nachfragebezogene Tourismus-Marketing ist auf die Nachfrager und seine 
Wünsche sowie seine Sichtweise auf das Leistungsangebot bezogen. Beim 
ganzheitlichen Ansatz des Tourismus-Marketings werden sechs verschiedene 
Marketingbereiche betrachtet, unter anderem das ökonomische, das 
gesellschaftsbezogene, das ökologische, das freizeitorientierte, das 
nachfragebezogene sowie das internationale Marketing. Die Marketing-
Management-Methode des Tourismus-Marketings ist angelehnt an das allgemeine 
Marketing-Management. Besonderheiten gibt es nur bei den touristischen 
Trägerschäften sowie den Dienstleistungen.21 Die Marketing-Management-Methode 
wird in diesem Fall in fünf verschiedene Phasen unterteilt. Diese Phasen sind die 
Informations- oder Analysephase, die Strategie- oder Zielphase, auch 
Konzeptionsphase genannt, die Gestaltungsphase, die Realisierungs- oder 
Umsetzungsphase bzw. Marketingimplementierung sowie die Kontrollphase.22 Oft 
wird dieses Modell durch fünf kurze Fragen vereinfacht: „Wo stehen wir? Wo wollen 
wir hin? Was können wir unternehmen? Welche Maßnahmen ergreifen wir? Sind wir 
angekommen?“23 Beim Dienstleistungscharakter werden alle allgemeinen 
Aussagen des Dienstleistungsmarketings auf den Tourismus übertragen und ein 
Phasenmodell entwickelt.24 
Jedoch ist Tourismusmarketing viel mehr als nur klassische Werbung für 
Destinationen, Hotels, Restaurants, Kulturinstitutionen oder Sehenswürdigkeiten. 
Es geht vor allem auch um Interessengenerierung, Leistungsvermarktung und 
darum eine wirkungsvolle Präsenz aufzubauen. Durch die richtige Kombination der 
Ziele und Präsenz auf diversen Kanälen, kann ein sinnvolles und zielführendes 
Marketing betrieben werden.

2.4. Allgemeine Möglichkeiten des Einsatzes von Virtual Reality als 
Marketinginstrument und der aktuelle Stand der Dinge 
In diesem Abschnitt geht es vor allem um den aktuellen Stand von Virtual Reality und 
die allgemeinen Einsatzmöglichkeiten als Marketinginstrument in diversen 
Branchen. 
 
 
2.4.1. Aktueller Stand der Dinge 
Wie bereits im vorausgegangen Abschnitt 2.2 erwähnt, war im Jahr 2016 der 
große Durchbruch von Virtual Reality und es wurde eine Absatzmenge von 14,9 
Millionen sowie ein Umsatz, bei der Hardware, von 129 Millionen Euro und 29 
Millionen Euro für spezielle VR-Inhalte, prognostiziert. Mit der Trendstudie 
„Consumer Technologie 2016“ von Bitkom und Deloitte wurde laut Bitkom-
Experte Timm Lutter, ein riesiges Potential für Virtual Reality vorausgesagt, denn 
mehr als die Hälfte der Deutschen über 14 Jahren hat schon einmal von Virtual-
Reality-Brillen gehört oder gelesen und fast jeder dritte zieht die Möglichkeit in 
Betracht eine solche in Zukunft auch zu nutzen. Die Einsatzmöglichkeiten für VR 
ist nahezu unbegrenzt, gerade in der Medienbranche oder im Tourismus gibt es 
sehr viele Verschiedene. Es können neue Erlebniswelten geschaffen werden und 
auch in der Computer- und Videospielbranche eröffnen sich ganz neue 
Möglichkeiten die Spiele zu gestalten. Dies sehen auch die Befragten der Studie 
von Bitkom und Deloitte so: 
 
 
Wie Abbildung 3 zeigt, ist die beliebteste Einsatzmöglichkeit, zu diesem Zeitpunkt 
die Computer- und Videospielbranche. Dicht darauf folgt schon die 
Tourismusbranche. Daran kann man sehen, wie stark vor allem diese beiden

Branchen in den nächsten Jahren von Virtual Reality geprägt sein werden. Aber 
auch die Verwendung in der Medien- und Musikbranche ist durchaus beliebt. 
Virtual Reality befindet sich noch in einer sehr frühen Marktphase, jedoch zeigen 
die Prognosen der Bitkom und Deloitte Studie aus dem Jahr 2016, dass der 
Umsatz auf dem deutschen Markt 2020 über eine Milliarde Euro betragen könnte, 
weshalb VR auch im Consumer-Technology-Kontext als das „Next Big Thing“ gilt. 
 
 
Zunächst sieht man in Abbildung 4 ein sehr starkes Wachstum der 
Umsatzzahlen, was 2018 langsam durch sinkende Gerätepreise und 
zunehmende Sättigung, stagnieren sollte. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt wird auch 
prognostiziert, dass mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit das Angebot von Inhalten 
immer breiter und die Nutzerbasis immer größer werden wird. Somit sollte sich 
der Anteil, der für gute Inhalte ausgegeben wird, immer weiter vergrößern. Spiele 
werden hierbei laut Prognose einen signifikanten Anteil ausmachen. 
Im Moment kann man die VR-Brillen in 3 verschiedene Klassen einteilen. Die 
günstigste Variante, sogenannte Low End- oder DIY-Brillen (DoItYourself-
Brillen), sind die rein mechanischen Smartphone-Halterungen wie beispielsweise 
die Google Cardboard. Sie bestehen aus einer Box mit 2 Linsen zum 
Selberbauen und sind der optimale Einstieg in die VR-Welt. Die etwas 
höherwertige Variante sind die Smartphone-Halterungen mit eingebauter 
Elektronik wie die Samsung Gear VR oder die LG 360 VR. Sie haben schon einen 
eigenen Sensor, der die Kopfbewegung in die VR-Welt überträgt und somit das

Nutzererlebnis optimiert. Außerdem gibt es noch die high-end Varianten, auch 
Full Feature VRs genannt, wie die Oculus Rift, die HTC Vive oder die Playstation 
VR, welche ein Headset mit eigenem Display besitzen. Die Hardware unterstützt 
selbst anspruchsvolle Anwendungen und ermöglicht den Nutzern ein komplettes 
Eintauchen in die virtuelle Welt, weshalb sie auch am häufigsten im Gaming-
Bereich eingesetzt werden. 25 
Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt wird Virtual Reality vor allem in der 
Computerspielbranche sowie der allgemeinen Unterhaltungsbranche sprich der 
Filmindustrie, Musikindustrie oder im Theater eingesetzt. Außerdem wird es oft 
zu Schulungszwecken, Aus- und Weiterbildung von Piloten, Astronauten und 
Kraftfahrzeugführern und in der Medizin zur Aus- und Weiterbildung sowie zur 
Diagnose genutzt. Auch die Automobil- und die Luftfahrtbranche nutzen Virtual 
Reality vor allem in der Konstruktion und Wartung.26 
Auch im Journalismus wird immer häufiger Virtual Reality eingesetzt, um den 
sogenannten Immersiven Journalismus zu verwirklichen. Dabei ist der 
Grundgedanke, den Menschen einen persönlicheren Eindruck zu vermitteln, die 
Geschehnisse selbst mitzuerleben und sich selbst auch in die Gefühlslage des 
Berichtes versetzen zu können. 
Die Bekanntheit von Virtual Reality konnte sich innerhalb eines Jahres um 11% 
steigern.27 Jedoch konnte der Bekanntheitsgrad im darauffolgenden Jahr 2017 
nur unwesentlich um etwa 1% gesteigert werden. Hier merkt man den noch 
langen und steinigen Weg zum massenmarkttauglichen Produkt. Zwar war der 
Hype am Anfang immens, doch in den kommenden Jahren wird sich zeigen, ob 
dieser nur von kurzer Dauer war oder ob es sich als massentaugliches Produkt 
etablieren kann. 
 
 
2.4.2.  Möglichkeiten des Einsatzes von Virtual Reality als Marketinginstrument 
Übermittlung und Handhabung von Informationen sowie Individualisierung und 
Erlebnisorientierung haben entscheidende Auswirkungen auf die Gestaltung von 
Marketingmaßnahmen, denn das Bedürfnis der Konsumenten nach emotionalen 
Reizen und Erlebnissen wird immer größer. Der Markterfolg eines Produktes

hängt nämlich weniger von der Qualität ab, sondern eher von der Fähigkeit den 
Konsumenten ein Erlebnis zu vermitteln, welches besser ist als das der 
Konkurrenten. Das Potential von Virtual Reality liegt in der Ansprache mehrerer 
Sinne, um ein einprägsames Erlebnis mit der Marke oder dem Produkt zu 
verknüpfen. Der Eindruck wird nachhaltiger, je umfangreicher sich der Nutzer mit 
dem virtuellen Produkt auseinandersetzt. 28 
Firmen können durch VR Erlebniswelten schaffen und hiermit die Dramaturgie 
ihrer Marketingmaßnahmen vergrößern. Somit wird auch die 
zielgruppengerechte Ansprache auf ein neues Level gehoben. Natürlich ist die 
Produktion von VR deutlich aufwändiger, der Output ist jedoch um einiges größer 
als bei normalen Videos oder Bildern, denn die Nutzung erregt großes Interesse 
und Faszination bei vielen Nutzern. Außerdem wird durch Virtual Reality die 
kommunikative Weiterentwicklung des Produktes vom Vertrauens- zum 
Erfahrungsgut unterstützt. 29 
Virtual Reality wird derzeit in den verschiedensten Branchen als 
Marketinginstrument eingesetzt. 
Unter anderem ist der Einsatz von VR in der Autoindustrie recht verbreitet, denn 
dort können die Kunden im VR Product Configurator detailgetreu alle Autos mit 
sämtlichen Ausstattungsvarianten anschauen und sich bereits vor dem Kauf ein 
genaues Bild ihres Traumautos machen. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist die “Audi VR 
experience“, die zurzeit in verschiedenen Autohäusern in Deutschland, 
Großbritannien und Spanien in Betrieb genommen wurde. Dort kann man sein 
neues Auto bis ins kleinste Detail mit allen Licht- und Soundeffekten konfigurieren 
und erleben. Außerdem können auch technische Komponenten unter der 
Fahrzeugoberfläche begutachtet werden  
Dasselbe gilt für die Architektur und die Reisebranche. Die Reiseanbieter können 
den Kunden vor Reiseantritt den gewünschten Ort, das gewünschte Hotel oder 
das gewünschte Kreuzfahrtschiff präsentieren. Außerdem kann man am Ort der 
Geschehnisse, wie zum Beispiel in einer Burgruine, die ursprünglichen Bilder 
wieder aufleben lassen und gleichzeitig die Touristen mit zusätzlichen 
Informationen, wie geschichtlichen Daten, versorgen. Architekten nutzen VR um 
Entwürfe detailgetreu zu präsentieren und für den Kunden zu veranschaulichen, 
wie das gewünschte Objekt später aussehen wird.

Mittlerweile wird Virtual Reality auch immer häufiger im Handel, in sogenannten 
Virtual Showrooms eingesetzt, um neue Produkte vorzustellen. Wie 
beispielsweise einen neuen Wanderschuh von Merrell. Im Store wurde hierzu ein 
Wanderpfad aufgebaut und mit Unterstützung von Virtual Reality wurden die 
Kunden in die Berge der Dolomiten versetzt und so konnten die Schuhe in einer 
real wirkenden Umgebung getestet werden. Ein ähnliches Projekt hatte der 
Kletter- und Bergsteigerausrüster Mammut in seinem 360° Project verwirklicht. In 
diesem man virtuell die Eiger Nordwand und das Matterhorn besteigen kann. 
Mittlerweile hat Mammut viele weitere 360°Touren verwirklicht und bietet sie auf 
der Homepage des Project 360° an. 
Für kleine und mittelständische Unternehmen ist diese Art von Marketing 
natürlich deutlich teurer und aufwändiger. Jedoch kann auch mit relativ wenig 
Geld VR Marketing genutzt werden. Oft wird einfach auf einen 360° Werbefilm 
gesetzt, um die Emotionen und Gefühle der Kunden in höherer Weise zu 
beeinflussen. Andere Möglichkeiten ergeben sich durch eine eigene VR-Brille mit 
Branding oder einfache VR-Games bzw. Apps, die auf die eigene Firma oder 
Marke zurückzuführen sind. Natürlich wird die Technik auch auf Ausstellungen 
und Messen immer unverzichtbarer, um seine Produkte interaktiv zu präsentieren 
und erlebbar zu machen. 
 
 
2.5. Einsatzpotentiale als Marketinginstrument im Tourismus 
Einsatzmöglichkeiten gibt es in diversen Gruppen des Tourismussektors. In diesem 
Abschnitt werden die Potentiale anhand der einzelnen Gruppen erläutert, hierzu 
zählen die Leistungsträger, die Destinationen, die Reiseveranstalter sowie die 
Reisemittler. 
 
 
2.5.1. Einsatzpotentiale bei Leistungsträgern 
Touristische Leistungsträger sind Institutionen, die die eigentlichen Produzenten 
der touristischen Leistungen sind.30 Als typische touristische Leistungsträger 
werden Transport- und Beherbergungsbetriebe gesehen. 31 Jedoch spielt Virtual 
                                            
30 Vgl. Herstell 2008, 15

Reality im Marketing von Transportunternehmen eher eine untergeordnete Rolle, 
da es hauptsächlich darauf ausgelegt ist, die Urlauber schnell und sicher zu ihrem 
Ziel zu bringen. Jedoch haben auch Transportunternehmen wie Lufthansa sich 
mit dem Einsatz von Virtual Reality beschäftigt. Hierbei geht es dann um 
Upselling von Leistungsklassen im Flieger oder auch die Präsentation der 
angeflogenen Destinationen. Unter Upselling versteht man im Vertrieb, dem 
Kunden ein höherwertigeres Produkt oder eine höherwertigere Dienstleistung 
durch eine Produktvorführung oder Argumentation anzubieten bzw. zu 
verkaufen.32 
Weiter ist VR als Marketinginstrument auch bei den Reisen, die den Transport 
nicht als Raumüberwindung, sondern als die eigentliche Reise verstehen, 
einsetzbar. Darunter fallen zum Beispiel Kreuzfahrtreisen oder thematische 
Zugreisen, wie die Transsibirische Eisenbahn. Jedoch ist es hierbei nicht möglich 
die Grenzen zwischen Transport- und Beherbergungsunternehmen sauber zu 
ziehen.33 Hier können dann die einzelnen Kabinen eines Kreuzfahrtschiffes oder 
der Züge mittels VR präsentiert werden. Weitere Möglichkeiten solche 
Produktpräsentationen von Lage und Ausstattung mittels VR sind Freizeit- und 
Themenparks oder Sportanlagen, wie Golfplätze. 
Diese Aspekte sind es auch die die Visualisierung, mittels Virtual Reality, von 
Beherbergungsbetrieben sinnvoll erscheinen lässt. Denn der Aufenthalt am 
Zielort ist zeitlich gesehen, der am als wichtigsten zu erachtende Teil der Reise. 
Und somit sind die Attribute Ausstattung, Atmosphäre, Lage, Umgebung sowie 
Eigenschaften wichtige zu visualisierende Marketingaspekte.34 Je komplexer und 
erklärungsbedürftiger die Destinationen, desto mehr eignen sie sich für den 
Einsatz von VR. 
Durch die breite Masse an Beherbergungsbetrieben und deren ähnliche 
qualitative und quantitative Aspekte, kann VR ein gutes Marketingtool sein, um 
sich von den Anderen zu differenzieren.

2.5.2. Einsatzpotentiale bei Destinationen 
Bei Destinationen handelt es sich laut Freyer um „geographische, 
landschaftliche, soziokulturelle oder organisatorische Einheiten mit ihren 
Attraktionen, für die sich Touristen interessieren. Aus ökologischer Sicht wird in 
Destinationen ein touristisches Leistungsbündel von verschiedenen Anbietern 
produziert und gemeinschaftlich angeboten. Von daher gelten sie auch als 
Makro-Betriebe, kollektive Produzenten, touristische Netzwerke und/oder 
Wettbewerbseinheiten, die ihre Leistungen für auswärtige Besucher anbieten 
(Incoming-Tourismus).“35 
Bei einer Destination kann es sich sowohl um eine Clubanlage als auch um einen 
gesamten Kontinent handeln. Das schwierige hierbei ist, dass Destinationen 
häufig in den verschiedensten Funktionen auftreten können. Sie können als 
Leistungsträger, Reiseveranstalter oder Reisemittler agieren. Dies bedeutet, 
dass auch unterschiedliche Marketingträger im Einsatz sind und dies muss den 
Bedürfnissen der jeweils zu vermarktenden Destination angepasst werden. 
Das Ziel jeder Destination, unabhängig von ihrer Funktion, ist es die 
Eigenschaften bestmöglich an die Kunden zu kommunizieren und somit die 
Bekanntheit der jeweiligen Destination zu steigern. 36 Hierbei geht es vor allem 
um Imagebildung und -erhaltung, sowie Informationen über das Angebot der 
Destinationen. An diesem Punkt können die jeweiligen Ziele, durch den Einsatz 
von VR, unterstützt werden. 
Durch die virtuelle Abbildung kann man den Kunden bereits im Vorfeld die 
Destination erlebbar machen und somit ihre mögliche Kaufentscheidung festigen. 
Denn durch die VR können alle potentiell relevanten Elemente, wie das 
Hotelzimmer, die Sportanlagen und vieles mehr sowie die Atmosphäre und die 
räumlichen Gegebenheiten dargestellt werden. Gleichzeitig kann man den 
Kunden durch die Visualisierung eine bessere Orientierung in der Destination 
mitgeben.37 
Außerdem kann gerade bei unbekannteren Destinationen durch Virtual Reality 
ein größerer Wille zur Kaufentscheidung sowie Bekanntheit erzeugt werden, da 
diese Destinationen sehr viel informationsbedürftiger sind als bekanntere. 
Weiter können sich Destinationen vor Ort Virtual Reality bzw. Augmented Reality 
zu nutzen machen, indem sie Apps entwickeln, die, wenn man sein mobiles

Endgerät mit der Kamera auf eine Sehenswürdigkeit richtet, spezifische 
Informationen wie geschichtliche Fakten oder Zahlen anzeigt. 
 
 
2.5.3. Einsatzpotentiale bei Reiseveranstaltern 
„Reiseveranstalter sind Tourismusbetriebe oder Betriebsteile, die überwiegend 
Leistungen Dritter zur Befriedigung des zeitweiligen 
Ortsveränderungsbedürfnisses und damit zusammenhängender anderweitiger 
Bedürfnisse zu einer neuen, eigenständigen Leistung verbinden und diese im 
eigenen Namen anbieten und in Rechnung stellen.“38 
Die Aufgabe des Reiseveranstalters ist es, die von Leistungsträgern und 
Destinationen bereitgestellten Produkte zu einem neuen Produkt, wie einer 
Pauschalreise, zu formen und dieses an den Endkunden zu vertreiben. 39 
Folglich gelten für Reiseveranstalter, bezogen auf die Einsatzpotentiale von 
Virtual Reality, dieselben Aussagen wie für Destinationen und Leistungsträger. 
Dementsprechend können auch Reiseveranstalter durch den Einsatz von VR die 
Produktmerkmale und -qualitäten besser und effektiver an den Kunden 
kommunizieren und sich gleichzeitig von Mitbewerbern am Markt abheben. 40 
Das umsatzstärkste Einzelprodukt ist die Pauschalreise, andererseits ist diese 
beim Kunden sehr austauschbar und wenig dafür geeignet eine Marktidentität 
aufzubauen oder sich am Markt zu positionieren. Deshalb müsste das Ziel der 
Reiseveranstalter eigentlich sein, den Anteil an weniger austauschbaren und 
identitätssteigernden Individualreisen zu erhöhen. Jedoch steht diesem Ziel 
entgegen, dass dadurch die zu erbringende Beratungsleistung enorm ansteigt, 
was die Vermarktung online komplizierter macht und dementsprechend nimmt 
diese deutlich ab. Denn individualisierte Spezialprodukte eignen sich im 
Allgemeinen weniger zum Onlinevertrieb als standardisierte Produkte. 
Jedoch können durch Virtual Reality auch komplexere Sachverhalte sowie 
beratungsintensivere Leistungsbündel dargestellt werden und deshalb besser 
über das Internet vertrieben werden. Denn durch die technologischen

Theoretische Grundlagen                                                                                   21 
 
Eigenschaften können diese Leistungsbündel informativ dargestellt werden und 
gleichzeitig ein hohes Vertrauen signalisieren.41 
 
 
2.5.4. Einsatzpotentiale bei Reisemittlern 
„Ein Reisemittler ist ein Handelsbetrieb, der im Auftrag der Produzenten 
vorwiegend Pauschalreisen und touristische Einzelleistungen an 
Endverbraucher vermittelt.“42 
Zentrale Aufgaben von Reisemittlern sind unter anderem die Vermittlung 
touristischer (Einzel-) Leistungen sowie Pauschalreisen an Endkunden. Somit ist 
der Einsatz von Virtual Reality in der Vermarktung der Produkte relativ ähnlich zu 
denen der Bereiche Reiseveranstalter, Destination und Leistungsträger.43 
Hauptaufgabe der Reisemittler ist daher die Beratung und Information der 
Kunden. Dadurch könnten die Reisemittler VR als Beratungsunterstützung vor 
Ort einsetzten, um ihre Kernkompetenz zu stärken und die Beratungsqualität zu 
steigern. Denn würden sie über das Internet gehen oder komplett virtuelle 
Beratungsterminals vor Ort aufstellen, würden sie ihre Kernkompetenz eher aus 
der Hand geben. 
Anders sieht es hier bei den elektronischen Reisemittlern, auch Online Travel 
Agency (OTA) genannt, aus: Diese OTAs vertreiben ihre Produkte ausschließlich 
online und können somit, durch VR unterstütztes Marketing online eine bessere 
und informativere Beratung betreiben und dem Kunden so ihre Produkte auf eine 
interessantere Art und Weise darstellen.

3. Umsetzung anhand von Beispielen 
In diesem Abschnitt geht es vor Allem um die beispielhafte Umsetzung von Virtual 
Reality als Marketinginstrument. Wie bereits im vorherigen Abschnitt erwähnt, gibt es 
viele verschiedene Möglichkeiten VR als Marketinginstrument in diversen Branchen 
einzusetzen. In diesem Abschnitt wird jedoch speziell auf die Tourismusbranche 
eingegangen. 
Es gibt mittlerweile viele verschiedene Anbieter in der Tourismusbranche, die auf den 
Zug Virtual Reality aufgesprungen sind. Egal ob Destinationen, wie zum Beispiel 
Dortmund oder Hawaii, Fluglinien wie Lufthansa, Hotelketten wie Marriott oder auch 
Freizeit- und Erlebnisparks. Die Verbreitung von Virtual Reality sowohl als 
Marketinginstrument als auch als Schulungs- und Ausbildungsmethode wird in der 
Tendenz immer weiter steigen. Aber auch die Verbreitung von Augmented Reality wird 
in dieser Branche ein immer größeres Thema werden, an dem man nicht mehr 
vorbeikommen wird. Bei Augmented Reality wird zum Beispiel eine reale Person in eine 
virtuelle Welt eingebunden oder ein fiktives Szenario in die reale Welt projiziert. 
Für diese Arbeit wurden die Beispiele der Marriott Hotels und der Lufthansa Group 
ausgesucht, der Einsatz von Virtual Reality betrachtet, analysiert sowie miteinander und 
mit Mitbewerbern ihrer Branche verglichen. 
Außerdem wird im darauffolgenden vierten Kapitel auf den Aspekt einer 
Kundenbefragung eingegangen. Wie reagieren die Befragten auf Virtual Reality als 
Marketinginstrument im Allgemeinen und wie weit wissen die Befragten, dass die 
gewählten Beispiele VR einsetzen. 
 
 
3.1. Marriott Hotels 
Marriott begann sich im Jahr 2014 mit der Technik Virtual Reality zu beschäftigen. 
Die Verantwortlichen stellten sich die Frage, wie sich das Reisen in den nächsten 
Monaten, Jahren und Jahrzehnten wohl entwickeln wird. Diese Überlegung war Teil 
der sogenannten „Travel Brilliantly“ Kampagne, welche Marriott zu diesem Zeitpunkt 
entwickelte, um den Bedürfnissen der Reisenden von heute und auch in Zukunft 
gerecht zu werden. 
In diesem Jahr überlegte sich Marriott gemeinsam mit der Marketingagentur 
Relevant und den Framestore VR Studios einen sogenannten 4D Teleporter auf 
Basis von Oculus Rift zu entwickeln, der die Leute virtuell an die besten Marriott Ziele 
Umsetzung anhand von Beispielen                                                                                  23 
 
bringen sollte. Für die Vorführung auf der Roadshow in acht verschiedenen 
amerikanischen Städten wurden zwei Ziele ausgesucht. Zum einen der Tower 42 in 
London und zum anderen der Wai’anapanapa Black Sand Beach in Maui auf Hawaii. 
Das ganze Erlebnis startet in der virtuell nach produzierten Hotellobby des Marriott 
in Baltimore, durch die man erst einmal schlendert. Dort sieht man unter anderem 
eine Karte von Hawaii. Wenn man näher kommt hört man Musik von einer Ukulele 
und Wellenrauschen, bis man schließlich vor der Karte steht und ein neues Bild 
erscheint und man direkt am Strand auf Hawaii steht. 
 
 
Der Teleporter sollte den Testern ein ganzheitliches Erlebnis bieten und sie zu den 
zwei unterschiedlichen Ecken der Welt bringen ohne, dass sie ihren Koffer packen 
oder in ein Flugzeug steigen müssen. Der Teleporter, wie in Abbildung 5 zu sehen, 
ist eine Art Telefonzelle, in welche man sich hineinbegibt und dort eine Oculus Rift 
VR Brille sowie Kopfhörer aufsetzt. Als Tester sollte man nicht nur mit den Augen 
und den Ohren, sondern mit allen ihren Sinnen an diese Orte gebracht werden. 
Deshalb wurden zusätzlich noch eine Windmaschine, eine Wärmelampe, eine 
Sprühmaschine für die Meeresbrise, verschiedene Düfte und eine sich bewegende 
Bodenplatte in den Teleporter eingebaut, um das ganze Erlebnis so real wie möglich

zu gestalten. Vizepräsident der Marriott Marketingabteilung Michael Dail sagte 
hierzu: „Wir wollten den Menschen auf einem sehr realistischen, virtuellen Weg 
zeigen, was der Slogan „Travel Brilliantly“ wirklich bedeutet“44 
Ein weiteres Marketinggadget ist der so genannte VRoom Service von Marriott, 
welches gemeinsam mit Samsung Electronics entwickelt wurde. Marriott gibt 
Reisenden die Möglichkeit von ihrem Hotelzimmer aus mit einer bereitgestellten VR-
Brille, welche im Zimmerpreis enthalten ist, in verschiedene Welten einzutauchen. 
Dieser Service besteht aus zwei Teilen. Zum einen ist es möglich in den 
verschiedenen Marriott Hotels weitere Hotels virtuell zu besuchen, unter anderem 
das Marriott an Londons, aus Monopoly bekannten, berühmter Park Lane oder das 
Marriott Marquis am New Yorker Times Square. Der zweite Teil besteht aus „VR 
Postcards“, wie Marriott sie bezeichnet. 
 
 
Dies sind kleine Videos, die Geschichten von Reisenden in verschiedenen Teilen 
der Erde, unter anderem in den Anden in Chile, den vollen Straßen von Beijing oder 
einer Eisdiele in Rwanda, erzählen. Bei diesen enthaltenen Postkarten handelt es 
sich um persönliche Geschichten von Reisenden, welche Dinge sie auf dieser Reise

erlebt haben und warum für sie das Reisen so wichtig ist. Dies ist erst der Beginn 
des VRoom Services, welcher Stück für Stück mit mehr Geschichten immer weiter 
ausgebaut werden soll. 
Ein weiteres, jedoch sehr stationäres Virtual Reality Highlight gab es im Jahr 2017 
gemeinsam mit der NFL. Im Courdyard by Marriott in New York City kann man sich 
in eine 4D-Kuppel stellen, in der man das Gefühl hat, als würde man direkt auf dem 
Feld des Super Bowls stehen. Hierbei versucht Marriott die Fans des Football Sports 
davon zu überzeugen, während der Spiele in ihren Hotels zu übernachten und ihnen 
gleichzeitig ein einzigartiges Erlebnis zu bieten. 
 
 
3.2. Lufthansa Group 
Seit 2014 beschäftigt sich Lufthansa mit Virtual Reality und ist eine der ersten Airlines 
die diese Technik in den verschiedensten Bereichen einsetzt. Hierzu ist Lufthansa 
eine Kooperation mit 3spin und Samsung eingegangen, um dieses Vorhaben der 
Virtual Reality in vielen Bereichen auszutesten. 
Bereits auf der Internationalen Tourismus Börse (ITB) 2015 setzte Lufthansa die 
Technik zum ersten Mal ein. Hier konnten die Besucher einen virtuellen interaktiven 
Flug erleben und dort viele Dinge testen. Durch das Agieren mit einem Kontroller, 
konnten sie auch virtuell Objekte, wie beispielsweise einen Salzstreuer, bewegen. 
Dies blieb jedoch nicht die einzige Bemühung in Richtung Virtual Reality. Im Jahr 
2016 hat Lufthansa das sogenannte FlyingLab initiiert. Auf diesen diversen Flügen 
unter dem Motto 360 Virtual Reality, konnten sich die Gäste das erste Mal mit dem 
Thema vertraut machen und neue Destinationen und Produkte virtuell erleben. 
 
Umsetzung anhand von Beispielen                                                                                  26 
 
 
Gemeinsam mit der Firma 3spin und Samsung entwickelte Lufthansa die 360° VR 
App. Diese kann einfach zu Hause auf das Smartphone heruntergeladen werden und 
funktioniert auch mit den günstigeren Varianten der VR-Brillen, wie zum Beispiel 
einer Google Cardboard oder theoretisch auch komplett ohne HMD. Weiter werden 
diese 360° Videos auf allen Social-Media-Kanälen von Lufthansa benutzt. Lufthansa 
nutzt die VR-App vor allem auch als Direktmarketing an Flughäfen. Den Reisenden 
werden vor Ort mittels Virtual Reality die höheren Klassen im Flugzeug gezeigt, die 
sie so ansonsten nicht so einfach zu Gesicht bekommen würden. Hierbei wird den 
Reisenden die Möglichkeiten und der Komfort der jeweiligen Klassen vorgeführt. Mit 
diesem Marketingaspekt konnte Lufthansa bereits ihren Umsatz an Upsells deutlich 
steigern. Egal ob auf dem Flug von Frankfurt nach New York, als auch anders herum. 
Auf diesem Flug wurde das Upselling das erste Mal getestet.45 
Mit der App können nicht nur die einzelnen Klassen im Flugzeug vorher angesehen 
werden, es können auch verschiedene Destinationen erkundet werden. Die App lädt 
die Nutzer unter anderem nach Mauritius, San José, New York, San Francisco, 
Miami, Tokio, Hongkong und Peking ein. Weitere Destinationen sollen noch folgen.

Außerdem ist es möglich sich die Geschichte von Lufthansa virtuell anzuschauen 
und zu erleben. 
Ein weiterer Marketingaspekt ist die virtuelle Betrachtung der Landschaft unter dem 
Flugzeug in Form von 360° Videos oder Fotos, während eines Fluges. Die 
sogenannte VR Moving Map zeigt sämtliche Berge, Seen und Städte unterhalb des 
Fliegers, egal ob es draußen Tag oder Nacht ist, oder ob das Wetter mitspielt. Durch 
360° Fotos und Videos kann man in ausgewählte Orte komplett eintauchen. 46 Nicht 
nur die Landschaft kann erkundet werden, man bekommt auch zusätzliche 
Informationen wie Geschwindigkeit, Flughöhe, Außentemperatur und Entfernung 
zum Zielort virtuell angezeigt. Außerdem wurde die Verbindung mit dem 
360°Infotainment System im Flugzeug gemeinsam mit 3spin entwickelt und beides 
wurde auf der ITB 2017 vorgestellt.

Eine weitere gemeinsame Marketingaktion von Lufthansa und 3spin waren die 
sogenannten Reisekompasse. Dies waren riesige Werbeplakate in Form einer Türe 
in verschiedenen deutschen Städten, auf welchen man verschiedene internationale 
Städte betrachten konnte. Diese waren so konstruiert, dass man durch das Bewegen 
des Werbeplakates, sich in der jeweiligen Stadt in einer 360° Umgebung umsehen 
konnte. Man konnte sich somit für kurze Zeit aus dem winterlichen Deutschland in 
sechs verschiedene Städte versetzten lassen. Unter anderem hatte man die 
Möglichkeit nach Tokio, San Francisco, Beijing, New York und Hong Kong zu reisen. 
Ein weiteres Highlight war die eingebaute Kamera in dem Werbeplakat. Mit dieser 
konnte man auf Wunsch ein Foto von sich selbst machen lassen. Dieses wurde dann 
in das 360°-Video integriert und zum Beispiel als Graffiti auf einer New Yorker 
Hauswand dargestellt. Für dieses Projekt gewannen 3spin gemeinsam mit Lufthansa 
den Clio Award, welcher auch als Oscar of Advertising bekannt ist. 
Eine andere Überlegung war die sogenannte FlyingLab me Convention. Bei diesen 
Events hielten ausgewählte Sprecher der me Convention, unter anderem auf dem 
Weg von San Francisco nach Frankfurt, Vorträge an Bord eines Lufthansafluges. In 
10000 Metern Höhe wurde über verschiedene Themen der Zukunft gesprochen und 
dies live ins Flugzeug sowie nach San Francisco, wo die eigentliche Convention 
stattfand, gestreamt. Die Gäste an Board konnten den Referenten live und virtuell 
Fragen stellen. Außerdem konnten die neusten technischen Entwicklungen getestet 
werden, wie zum Beispiel das Gerät „Muse“, welches Gehirnströme misst. 47 
Dieselbe Veranstaltung wurde auch als Pre-Confernce der dmexco – Digital 
Marketing Exposition & Conference, in Köln auf dem Flug von New York nach 
Frankfurt veranstaltet. Für sämtliche Veranstaltungen benötigte man lediglich ein 
Ticket für den jeweiligen Flug, ansonsten entstanden keinerlei Extrakosten für die 
Passagiere. Es sollte lediglich ein interaktiverer und interessanterer Flug werden und 
die Gäste von der Innovationskraft von Lufthansa überzeugen. 
Es gab noch einige weitere Veranstaltungen in diese Richtung, insgesamt wurden 
sechs Stück zwischen Juli 2016 und September 2017 abgehalten. Jedoch wurde die 
Reihe aufgrund von Sicherheitsbedenken und eventuell auftretender technischer 
Schwierigkeiten eingestellt. Die Überlegung, solche Veranstaltungen nochmals 
abzuhalten, steht jedoch immer noch im Raum. 
„Lufthansa möchte seinen Gästen die Auswirkung von Digitalisierung sicht- und 
greifbar machen“.48 Deshalb hat Lufthansa im Februar 2017 in ihrer Business-

Lounge am Frankfurter Flughafen, die dortigen Reisenden die Videobrille Avegant 
Glyph testen lassen. Diese kann universell eingesetzt werden. Egal ob das Abspielen 
von Videos vom Laptop, Smartphone, Spielekonsole oder einfach nur die 
Wiedergabe von Musik bzw. Hörbüchern, alles ist möglich. Im Testfall am Frankfurter 
Flughafen wurden sechs verschiedene Videos gezeigt, „das Angebot reichte von 
Entspannung über den Wolken über das Porträt einer surfenden Flugbegleiterin bis 
hin zum neuen Langstreckenflugzeug A350.“ 49 Um die neue Technologie zu testen, 
brauchte man nur Zugang zur Business Lounge am Frankfurter Flughafen. 
Ein weiteres Highlight war die Präsentation des neuen Lufthansa A350 auf der ITB 
2017. Dort konnten sich die Besucher, durch eine HoloLens von Microsoft, den 
Flieger in einer 3D Projektion in seiner direkten Umgebung ansehen, erleben und ihn 
virtuell durch die gesamte Ausstellungshalle fliegen lassen. Die HoloLens ist eine 
Mixed-Reality Brille, mit deren Hilfe man virtuelle Objekte in die reale Welt produziert. 
Eben wie den virtuellen A350 in die Messehalle.

Dabei ist die Lufthansa Fluggesellschaft nicht die Einzige der Lufthansa Group, die 
sich mit Virtual Reality beschäftigt. Auch Swiss Air, Austrian Airlines und Eurowings 
haben sich mit dem Thema auseinandergesetzt. 
Swiss Air beschäftigte sich vor allem im Rahmen ihres Engagements im Sportbereich 
mit Virtual Reality. Wie jedes Jahr unterstützte die Swiss Air die Lauberhornrennen 
der alpinen Skifahrer und drehte hierzu für die Zuschauer ein VR Video mit den 
Piloten der Patrouille Suisse beim Überflug über die Lauberhornabfahrt, sodass die 
Zuschauer live dabei sein konnten, als würden sie selbst mit im Flieger sitzen. 
Bei Austrian Airlines und Eurowings kann man sich, ebenso wie bei Lufthansa, die 
verschiedenen Klassen im Flugzeug anschauen und sich dabei über verschiedene 
Gegebenheiten in den einzelnen Klassen sowie über Tarife informieren. Jedoch 
haben beide keine eigene App, sondern bieten diese Möglichkeit in Form von 360° 
Videos auf YouTube und den sozialen Netzwerken an. 
Die Lufthansa Group setzt Virtual Reality noch in vielen anderen Bereichen wie der 
Pilotenausbildung, der Wartung von Flugzeugen sowie der Board-Unterhaltung ein. 
Dieser Teil wird in dieser Arbeit jedoch nicht näher betrachtet, da es sich hierbei nicht 
um vorrangige Marketingaspekte handelt. 
 
 
3.3. Vergleich 
Aus den beiden vorhergegangenen Abschnitten wird deutlich, dass beide Firmen, 
sowohl Lufthansa als auch Marriott, das Potential von Virtual Reality für ihre Branche 
und ihre Firma erkannt haben und diese für sich auch zu nutzen versuchen. Das 
Problem im Moment ist, dass Virtual Reality noch nicht wirklich bei der breiten 
Bevölkerung angekommen ist. Wie man aus der empirischen Untersuchung 
entnehmen kann, wissen 78% der Befragten nicht, dass die Anbieter wie Marriott, 
Lufthansa oder auch andere Anbieter aus der Branche mit Virtual Reality arbeiten. 
Lufthansa ist jedoch im Vergleich mit den anderen Anbietern noch am bekanntesten, 
wenn es um das Thema Virtual Reality geht. 
 
Umsetzung anhand von Beispielen                                                                                  31

Quelle: empirische Studie/eigene Darstellung 
 
Wobei man im Falle von Marriott sagen kann, dass sie auch eher im kleineren 
Rahmen und stationär Marketing mit VR betreiben, als Lufthansa dies tut. Lufthansa 
versucht ihre Virtual Reality Gadges für eine möglichst breite Masse zugänglich zu 
machen.  
Marriott stellt ihre Virtual Reality Erlebnisse nur einem relativ kleinen Kreis von 
Personen zur Verfügung, denn nur wenn man sich an einem der acht Orte befand, 
an denen der Teleporter gerade aufgebaut war oder eines der beiden Hotels in New 
York oder London besucht hat, konnte man diese Virtuelle Umgebung nutzen und 
testen. Eine weitere Möglichkeit die VR Postcards zu testen, ist der Besitz einer 
Samsung Gear VR und die Buchung des Samsung Milk VR Premium Services. 
Folglich wird der Nutzerkreis auch nur unwesentlich größer. 
Der „VRoom Service“ soll in Zukunft noch weiter fortgeführt und in mehr Hotels 
verfügbar gemacht werden, jedoch ist bisher nicht bekannt wann oder in welchem 
Umfang, dies der Fall sein wird. Ein Pluspunkt ist im vorliegenden Fall, die 
persönlichen Geschichten hinter den „VR Postkarten“. Da es sich um kurze, 
persönliche Geschichten von Reisenden, ihren Eindrücken und Gefühlen handelt, 
welche die Erlebnisse viel greifbarer machen, als wenn man nur die Bilder von einem 
bestimmten Ort sieht oder einen Erfahrungsbericht liest.

VON WELCHEM ANBIETER WISSEN SIE, DASS SIE 
VIRTUAL REALITY EINSETZEN?
Umsetzung anhand von Beispielen                                                                                  32 
 
Im Vergleich zum Rest der Branche ist Marriott eher etwas weiter zurück, da viele 
Hotelketten, wie Shangri-La, Radission Blu, Best Western, Hilton oder auch 
Jumeirah, mittlerweile online und flächendeckend 360°Videos von ihren Hotels und 
Destinationen anbieten. Marriott hat dies bisher jedoch nur versuchsweise über den 
Teleporter oder den VRoom Service getan. Die einzigen 360° Videos, die es von 
Marriott auf ihren Social-Media-Kanälen gibt, sind von diversen TEDx 
Veranstaltungen und Veranstaltungsankündigungen in unterschiedlichen Marriott 
Hotels in Deutschland. 
Jumeirah geht ein deutliches Stück weiter und hat eine eigene VR-App, die 
sogenannte Jumeirah Inside VR, entwickelt. In dieser App kann man sämtliche 
Hotels und ihre Highlights virtuell besichtigen. Bei Hilton nutzt man zwar nur 360° 
Videos verschiedener Hotels und Destinationen, jedoch sind sie die Einzigen die am 
Ende dieses Videos direkt eine Kaufoption eingebaut haben. Im Moment ist der VR 
Gebrauch auch bei Hilton noch sehr eingeschränkt, jedoch entwickelt auch sie immer 
weitere Features in Richtung VR. Bei Best Western kann man mittlerweile durch 
sämtliche Häuser Nordamerikas einen virtuellen Rundgang machen. Aufgrund 
dessen ist es den Gästen möglich auf dem YouTube Kanal von Best Western fast 
2000 Hotels mittels kommentierten VR-Videos zu erleben. 
Lufthansa macht es seinen Kunden insgesamt etwas leichter. Durch die 360° Grad 
App kann sich jeder Nutzer eines Smartphones oder mobilen Endgerätes diese 
herunterladen, nutzen und erkunden, was Lufthansa in der virtuellen Welt zu bieten 
hat. Theoretisch braucht man, wie bereits erwähnt, noch nicht einmal eine VR-Brille 
um sich in der App umzuschauen, jedoch fällt dann natürlich der Effekt des völligen 
Eintauchens weg. Das Positive der App ist, dass sie kostenlos zur Verfügung steht 
und selbst mit den günstigsten Varianten der VR-Brillen, wie der Google Cardboard 
funktioniert. Somit muss man nicht viel Geld ausgeben, um die App testen zu können. 
Außerdem konnte die Lufthansa durch den Einsatz der App direkt am Flughafen, ihr 
Upsells um bis zu 50% steigen.50 
Die weiteren Marketingaspekte, wie die FlyingLab Convention oder das Betrachten 
der Landschaft unter dem Flugzeug, ist natürlich nur den Leuten vorbehalten bzw. 
vorbehalten gewesen, die mit Lufthansa fliegen oder auf diesem bestimmten Flug 
mitgeflogen sind. Ebenso wie den Personen, die die ITB Messe oder die Business 
Lounge im Frankfurter Flughafen besucht haben. Sie waren diejenigen, die die 
                                            
50 Vgl. Mattgey 2017 
Umsetzung anhand von Beispielen                                                                                  33 
 
virtuelle Projektion des neuen A350 live erleben bzw. die Videobrille Avegant Glyph 
testen durften. 
Jedoch veröffentlicht Lufthansa auf ihrer Facebookseite viele Videos zu den 
genannten Marketingaspekten, um die breite Basis ihrer Follower daran teilhaben 
lassen zu können. Für die FlyingLab Convention wurde ebenfalls eine separate 
Homepage erstellt, auf der man auch nachträglich noch die Beiträge sowie die 
Vorträge der Sprecher anschauen kann. Im Moment investiert Lufthansa verstärkt in 
Mixed Reality, also sowohl in Virtual als auch in Augmented Reality, um ihre Vielfalt 
in modernen Technologien weiter auszubauen und den Kunden ein möglichst 
innovatives Marketing bieten zu können. 
Man kann sagen, dass Lufthansa versucht, ihren Passagieren digitale Innovationen 
entlang der Reisekette zu präsentieren, um herauszufinden was die Reisenden 
begeistert und welche Innovation Lufthansa dann im Regelbetrieb langfristig 
einsetzen kann. 51 
Auch andere Fluggesellschaften haben sich mit dem Thema Virtual Reality 
beschäftigt. Ein ähnliches Angebot wie bei Lufthansa bekommt man bei DELTA 
Airlines, welche ebenfalls eine App anbieten in der man sich die unterschiedlichen 
Flugklassen anschauen kann. Diese ist allerdings nicht so interaktiv, wie die App von 
Lufthansa und dient mehr dem Informationszweck der Passagiere als dem Erlebnis 
an sich. Bei Qantas Air bekommt man ebenfalls eine App, in dieser kann man sich 
verschiedene Orte in Australien anschauen. Unter anderem die Kangaroo Island 
oder den Uluru Felsen, genauso wie verschiedene Sehenswürdigkeiten in Sydney. 
Hier geht es in erster Linie darum, die Sehnsucht der Menschen nach diesen Orten 
zu wecken und dann im zweiten Schritt die Flüge zu diesen Zielen bei Qantas zu 
buchen. 
Die niederländische Fluggesellschaft KLM hatte einen etwas anderen Ansatz um ihr 
Produkt zu vermarkten. Sie gestaltete eine VR-App namens Flight Upgrader, in der 
man sich die Vorzüge eines Fluges mit KLM anschauen konnte, wie zum Beispiel 
„ein funktionierendes Entertainmentsystem, fürsorgliches Personal, gute & 
unbegrenzte Verpflegung sowie einen netten Sitznachbar.“52 Diese wurde mit VR-
Brillen am John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City an Passagiere von 
Billigfluglinien verteilt, um sie von KLM als Fluggesellschaft zu überzeugen. 
Auch die Fluggesellschaften Quantas Air, United Airlines, Emirates, Turkish Airlines 
oder Air France testen in verschiedenen Varianten Virtual Reality als

Marketinginstrument, wobei man hier nur von einem kleineren Rahmen sprechen 
kann und die Anwendungen sind meist auch nur Passagieren vorbehalten, die mit 
diesen Airlines fliegen. 
Ein Problem das auftaucht, sowohl für Hotels als auch für die Fluggesellschaften, ist, 
dass sie zwar auf ihren eigenen Homepages und Social-Media-Kanälen VR Inhalte 
anbieten können, aber die großen Buchungswebseiten wie Booking.com oder 
Expedia im Moment noch keine Möglichkeit für diese Inhalte auf ihren Websites 
bieten. Sie zeigen sich zwar an der Technik interessiert, sie wollen diese allerdings 
erst anbieten, wenn mehr Menschen von zu Hause aus Zugang zu VR Hardware 
haben. Expedia ist im Moment zwar schon dabei eine VR Anwendung, welche sich 
„try before you buy“ nennt, zu testen. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt ist diese noch nicht 
einsatzbereit. Mit der Anwendung kann man mit der HTC Vive durch Hotels laufen 
und den Kontroller nutzten um Türen und Schränke zu öffnen.53 
Auch in den Reisebüros kommt Virtual Reality oft noch wenig zum Einsatz. Im 
Moment testet Amadeus, eines der großen Global-Distribution-Systeme, eine neue 
VR Software, die “Virtual Reality Search and Booking Experience”. Diese wird mit 
einer VR Brille und speziellen Handschuhen bedient und der Kunde kann auf einer 
virtuellen Weltkugel sein Wunschziel aussuchen, sowie durch Flugzeuge spazieren 
und dort seinen Sitzplatz wählen. Zudem können mit der Kreditkarte, direkt in der 
Anwendung, Flüge, Mietwagen oder der gesamte Trip gebucht werden.54 
Hingegen lohnt es sich gerade im stationären Vertrieb für aufwendige Beratungen 
und teure Produkte wie Kreuzfahrten oder außergewöhnliche Clubs und Resorts 
Virtual Reality einzusetzen. Einer der wenigen Reiseveranstalter, die bereits Virtual 
Reality in ihren Reisebüros anbieten, ist Thomas Cook. Dies wird vor allem in 
Deutschland, Großbritannien und Belgien getestet. Zur Verfügung stehen hierbei 
eine Samsung Gear VR mit einem Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Ende des Jahres 2017 
werden dann circa 2000 Reisebüros von Thomas Cook mit dieser Technik 
ausgestattet sein.55 
Tui wählt einen etwas anderen Ansatz. Bei Tui gibt es um die 700 mobile 
Reiseberater in ganz Deutschland. So muss man als Kunde nicht in ein stationäres 
Reisebüro, sondern kann per Telefon- und Videochat oder vom heimischen Sofa aus 
gemeinsam mit dem mobilen Berater und Virtual Reality seine Reise buchen.56 Der 
Kunde kann sich so noch besser die unterschiedlichen Leistungen vorstellen und ist

daraufhin eher bereit ein höherwertigeres Angebot oder weitere Zusatzleistungen zu 
buchen. 
Mittlerweile gibt es auch immer mehr Firmen und Plattformen, wie zum Beispiel 
VDroom oder envrmnt, die für Unternehmen VR Homepages oder Videos erstellen. 
VDroom hat sich vor allem auch auf die Tourismusbranche spezialisiert. Auch 
Google ist in dieser Richtung unterwegs: Sie haben einen neuen Google Chrome 
Browser entwickelt, der direkt Virtual Reality unterstützt. Über die 
Programmierschnittstelle WebVR kann in Webbrowsern auf VR-Brillen oder 
Headsets zugegriffen werden und somit werden keine extra Programme oder Apps 
mehr benötigt, um in eine virtuelle Welt einzutauchen.57

4. Betrachtung aus Kundensicht 
Wie bereits im Jahr 2016 hat sich Bitkom in Kooperation mit Deloitte auch im Jahr 
2017 in ihrer Studie Zukunft der Consumer Technology mit dem Thema Virtual 
Reality beschäftigt. In diesem Jahr hat bereits jeder fünfte Deutsche schon Erfahrung 
mit Virtual Reality im Allgemeinen. In der empirischen Studie sind es sogar knappe 
41 % der Befragten. Doch wie sieht eigentlich die Hauptzielgruppe von Virtual Reality 
aus. Laut der Studie von YouGov aus dem Jahr 2016, ist die Hauptzielgruppe 
männlich, zwischen 18 und 29 Jahren alt und verfügt meistens über einen hohen 
Bildungsabschluss sowie ein höheres Haushaltseinkommen als der Durchschnitt der 
Bevölkerung.58 
 
 
In Abbildung 9 kann man erkennen, dass Virtual Reality im Allgemeinen langsam 
aber sicher bei der deutschen Bevölkerung angekommen ist. Es besitzen zwar bisher 
sehr wenige Menschen eine eigene VR-Brille, jedoch können sich circa ein Viertel 
der über 14-Jährigen deutschen Bevölkerung, vorstellen eine zu nutzen. Bei der 
empirischen Studie haben sogar 26% schon einmal Virtual Reality getestet und 
knappe 22% würden es gerne ausprobieren und können sich vorstellen eine VR-
Brille zu nutzen. 
Derzeit können sich auch schon 43% der Bevölkerung vorstellen, mit Virtual Reality 
einen Ort zu bereisen, 31% der Bevölkerung hat dies auch schon einmal getan. In 
der von Bitkom in Auftrag gegebenen Studie, können sich ebenfalls 45% der 
Befragten wahrscheinlich bzw. sehr wahrscheinlich vorstellen Virtual Reality zum 
virtuellen Reisen zu benutzen. Hier sieht man das große Potential für die

Reisebranche, wenn schon jetzt fast die Hälfte der Bevölkerung offen für diese Art 
von Reisen ist, wird sich dies mit ziemlicher Sicherheit in den nächsten Jahren weiter 
steigern lassen. 59 
Denn schließlich gehört laut der Studie von Deloitte und Bitkom das Bereisen von 
Orten bereits jetzt zu den beliebtesten Anwendungen von Endkunden. Hier wird 
ebenfalls gezeigt, dass der Mehrwert für den Verbraucher enorm und als 
Marketinginstrument für den Tourismus extrem wertvoll sein kann. In Zukunft werden 
die Verbraucher zu 73 % Hotels, Reiseziele oder Ferienwohnungen virtuell kaufen.60 
Auch in empirischen Untersuchungen konnte ein solcher Trend festgestellt werden. 
Wobei die Vorstellung mittels Virtual Reality ein Hotel vorher zu erkunden und sich 
darüber zu informieren, bei den Befragten als am Sinnvollsten empfunden wurde.

Im Reisebüro können vor der Reise unter anderem schon Zusatzangebote, wie 
Tauchkurs oder Raftingtouren, mittels VR beworben werden. Ebenso kennt man als 
Kunde dann bereits die Unterschiede bei der Ausstattung von Hotels oder 
Flugzeugen und weiß, wie sie sich anfühlen können.61 Dadurch sind viele eher bereit 
eine teurere Kategorie zu buchen, was im Fall von Lufthansa bereits erwiesen wurde.

Mit 50% mehr verkauften Plätzen in der Premium Economy bzw. höheren Klassen, 
hat das Vorführen durch Virtual Reality am Flughafen eine deutliche Wirkung 
gezeigt.62 Dies konnte in der empirischen Untersuchung eher nicht bestätigt werden, 
da nur knapp 15% der Befragten einen Vorteil darin sehen, sich die Klassen im 
Flugzeug im Voraus anzuschauen. Vielen Reisenden ist es jedoch wichtig nach 
eigenen Wünschen und Bedürfnissen zu agieren und durch den Einsatz von Virtual 
Reality kann die eigene Interaktion deutlich gesteigert werden. 
Auch wenn der Hype um Virtual Reality noch so groß ist, hat sich gezeigt, dass sich 
jeder zweite nicht dafür interessiert und somit die Technik auch nicht nutzen möchte. 
Hierbei sind die Gründe für das fehlende Interesse relativ unterschiedlich. 
 
 Abbildung 13: Gründe für die Nichtnutzung von VR 
Quelle: Lutter/Meinecke/Tropf 2017, 49 
 
Abbildung 10 beschreibt die Gründe, weshalb der Durchbruch am Massenmarkt 
noch nicht erfolgt ist und warum das Interesse an der Nutzung von Virtual Reality 
noch bei vielen Verbrauchern weitestgehend fehlt. Bei 38% ist es vor allem die 
fehlende, nicht ausreichende Beschäftigung mit dem Thema und den Endgeräten. 
Hingegen sagen 39% der Bevölkerung klar, dass sie das Thema und die 
dahinterstehende Technik einfach nicht interessiert. 
Bei den Personen, die angegeben haben, sich noch nicht ausreichend mit VR 
beschäftigt zu haben, ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit relativ groß, dass sie sich in naher 
Zukunft zumindest einmal mit der Technik befassen werden und dann entscheiden, 
ob sie weiter damit arbeiten möchten. Denn laut der Ericsson Studie planen die Hälfte 
der Personen, die sich noch nicht ausreichend damit beschäftigt haben, in naher 
Zukunft ein VR-Gerät zu nutzen, schließlich wird es ihrer Meinung nach einen großen 
Einfluss auf die Zukunft haben. 63 
Bei den 35% der Befragten, die angaben, dass ihnen die Geräte zu teuer seien, sieht 
man an welcher Stelle noch einiges an Potential verborgen liegt. Denn wie bei allen 
neuen Technologien wird die Hardware immer weiter verbessert und dadurch auch 
mit der Zeit immer günstiger. Nachweislich werden Tag für Tag mehr Inhalte

produziert und dies macht die gesamte Technologie immer attraktiver, sowohl für 
Kunden als auch für Unternehmen. Im Jahr 2016 war in der Verbraucherumfrage von 
Deloitte ein optimaler Preis von 78€ und ein Maximalpreis von 153€ pro Endgerät 
prognostiziert worden64, jedoch sind die meisten Geräte im Moment noch deutlich 
teurer. Auch bei der Endverbraucherbefragung der Verfasserin wurde deutlich, dass 
ein großer Teil der Befragten maximal 50 € oder sogar überhaupt kein Geld für ein 
solches Endgerät ausgeben würden.

Durch das Engagement der großen Firmen wie Facebook, Microsoft oder Google, 
welche sich auch kontinuierlich mit dem Thema Preis beschäftigen, wird sich dieser 
in den kommenden Jahren deutlich verringern und somit sollten auch für die breite 
Bevölkerung bald erschwingliche Geräte zur Verfügung stehen.

Jedoch geht der Trend, wie in Abbildung 11 sichtbar, vor allem in der Altersgruppe 
der 24-35-Jährigen, im Vergleich zum Vorjahr zu den teureren Endgeräten wie der 
Oculus Rift, Playstation VR oder der HTC Vive. Im Jahre 2016 waren hingegen ganz 
klar die Google Cardboard und die Samsung Gear Spitzenreiter an verkaufen 
Geräten.65 Diese Entwicklung konnte ebenfalls in der Befragung der Probanden 
festgestellt werden. Denn die junge Generation ist den neuen Trends oft 
aufgeschlossener gegenübergestellt und würde auch für ein besseres Erlebnis mehr 
Geld ausgeben. 
Der Trend ist vor allem verständlich, da die günstigen Varianten der HDMs, teilweise 
sehr verpixelte virtuelle Welten zeigen und somit nach einer gewissen Zeit ein Gefühl 
von Schwindel und Unwohlsein hervorrufen können. Andererseits besteht auch bei 
den hochwertigen Geräten die Gefahr von brennenden Augen, Schwindel oder 
Unwohlsein. 
Ein weiterer Punkt der aktuell ebenfalls von den Verbrauchern diskutiert wird, ist die 
Gefahr der sozialen Isolation durch Virtual Reality. Laut den befragten Forschern, 
der Ericsson Studie, könnte das Risiko darin bestehen, dass Personen anfangen ihre 
reale Welt und die sozialen Kontakte darin, nicht mehr zu mögen oder sie nicht mehr

als wichtig erachten und sich deshalb immer weiter in ihre virtuelle Welt 
zurückziehen. Zudem wird darüber diskutiert, ob eine zu realistische, virtuelle Welt 
das Gehirn manipulieren kann. 66 
Im Moment gibt es des öfteren Probleme mit Übelkeit, da die Augen sich in 
Bewegung befinden, jedoch die Ohren und alle anderen Sinne dies in den meisten 
Fällen nicht tun. Dadurch wird ein Konflikt erzeugt, welcher zu Wahrnehmungsverlust 
führen kann und somit einen Zustand hervorruft, der an Reiseübelkeit erinnert.67 
Dieses Problem könnte sich jedoch erheblich verbessern, sobald die Geräte besser 
ausgereifter sind und man ohne Probleme zwischen der realen und der virtuellen 
Welt hin und her wechseln kann. Hierzu steht die Überlegung im Raum, Virtual 
Reality mit Augmented Reality zu verknüpfen und somit das Problem des kompletten 
Verlustes der realen Welt zu umgehen. 
Im Marketing achten die Kunden bei Virtual Reality vor allem darauf ausreichend 
Informationen zu bekommen und somit einen Mehrwert aus der Technik zu ziehen. 
Die Informationen sollten auf eine unterhaltsame Art und Weise, am besten als 
wirkungsvolle Geschichte erzählt werden, da dies den Endverbraucher am ehesten 
anspricht. 70% der Nutzer von VR ist es zudem wichtig zu wissen, woher das 
Produkt stammt. Außerdem legen sie Wert auf Expertenmeinungen, sowie auf die

oder Testimonials die Wirkung ihrer Produkte und Kampagnen verstärken.  
Interessanterweise fand die YouGov Studie heraus, dass gerade im Mittleren 
Osten, Nordafrika und südostasiatischen Raum schon jetzt 71% der in 21 Ländern 
befragten Konsumenten, ihre Ferien virtuell planen würden.

Wie Abbildung 13 zeigt, stehen dreiviertel der Befragten der Möglichkeit ihre Ferien 
mit VR zu planen bzw. sich die nötige Software dafür auf ihr mobiles Endgerät zu 
laden, sehr offen gegenüber und gut 64 % würden eher einen Reiseanbieter 
wählen, der VR anbietet. 
In Deutschland hingegen würden circa 62% der Befragten VR für die Planung ihrer 
Ferien nutzen, wobei nur knapp die Hälfte den Service nutzen würden, wenn sie 
dafür nichts extra bezahlen müssten. 13% hingegen würden auch für den VR 
Service extra bezahlen.69 
In der empirischen Studie wurden die Teilnehmer gefragt, was sie davon abhalten 
würde, sich mittels Virtual Reality über ein unbekanntes Urlaubsziel zu informieren.

Quelle: empirische Studie/eigene Darstellung 
 
Hier wird ziemlich deutlich, dass die Meisten im Moment noch keinen großen 
Mehrwert in Virtual Reality sehen oder sich die Hardware nicht beschaffen 
möchten. Einige andere Gründe waren vor allem das mögliche Täuschen der 
Verbraucher mittels gestellter Hochglanzvideos bzw. das Verfälschen der Wahrheit, 
wie die Landschaft wirklich aussieht. Denn oft werden die Videos dann unter besten 
Bedingungen gedreht und spiegeln nicht die einzelnen Jahreszeiten oder die 
Landschaft bei schlechtem Wetter wieder. Weiter wollen einige der Befragten, 
lieber unbedarft reisen und sich dann vor Ort auf die Gegebenheiten, sowie Land 
und Leute einlassen. Ein interessanter Aspekt, der bei den meisten Studien über 
Virtual Reality außenvor gelassen wurde. 
Weiter zeigt die empirische Studie, dass sich auch viele der Befragten einfach nicht 
sicher sind, ob sie sich durch Virtual Reality besser beraten fühlen würden.

5. Schlussbetrachtung 
In diesem Abschnitt werden die Erkenntnisse der Arbeit nochmals 
zusammengefasst, diskutiert, ein Blick in die Zukunft aufgezeigt sowie 
Handlungsempfehlungen formuliert. 
 
5.1. Zusammenfassung 
Abschließend sei zu sagen, dass Virtual Reality sowohl als Marketinginstrument im 
Tourismus als auch allgemein noch ziemlich am Anfang steht, jedoch großes 
Potential und viele neue Möglichkeiten für die Zukunft bieten kann. Der Hype war im 
Jahr 2016 riesig und wird in den nächsten Jahren tendenziell noch weiter zunehmen, 
doch im Moment befindet sich Virtual Reality noch in einem recht frühen Stadium 
und kommt vor allem im Gaming Bereich bei passionierten Spielern zum Einsatz. 
Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt muss dafür aber noch einiges getan werden, denn zurzeit 
sind die Endgeräte für die breite Masse noch zu teuer und es müsste noch deutlich 
mehr massentaugliche Inhalte generiert werden. Denn im Moment fehlt noch der 
langfristige Mehrwert und viele Nutzer verlieren nach der Testphase das Interesse. 
Außerdem empfinden viele Verbraucher die Technik noch als unausgereift, da die 
Geräte teilweise umständlich, unhandlich und vor allem die Videos oft sehr verpixelt 
sind. Dies kann wiederum das bereits angesprochene Unwohlsein und 
Schwindelgefühl hervorrufen und somit das Erlebnis schmälern und den Nutzer die 
Lust an der weiteren Nutzung nehmen. 
Schlussendlich kann man sagen, dass es bei Virtual Reality vor allem um das 
Storytelling geht und man sich mit einer gut erzählten Geschichte, besser von seinen 
Konkurrenten am Markt abheben kann. Auch wenn man nahezu dasselbe Produkt 
verkauft, spricht man mit VR deutlich mehr und vor allem auch tiefgreifende 
Emotionen der Menschen an. Außerdem ist VR der stärkste Weg, einen Nutzer direkt 
in die Geschichte zu integrieren und ihn zu einem gewissen Grad, auch selbst 
entscheiden zu lassen, welchen Teil der Geschichte er sich als erstes ansehen 
möchte. In diesem Fall macht man den Nutzer selbst zum Erzähler. Denn durch diese 
Customer Journey kann das Produkt der Zielgruppe nähergebracht werden und 
somit steigert sich die Kaufwahrscheinlichkeit. Außerdem bietet Virtual Reality, die 
Chance die Markenwelt des Unternehmens mit der Welt des Verbrauchers zu 
verschmelzen und dadurch eine größere Markenbindung zu erzielen. 
Auch bei den touristischen Betrieben hat man dies verstanden und versucht mit der 
neuen Technik die Kunden enger an sich zu binden. Gerade Lufthansa ist im 
Schlussbetrachtung                                                                                   46 
 
Segment der Fluggesellschaften sehr weit vorne, was den Einsatz von Virtual Reality 
betrifft. Egal ob als Marketinginstrument oder auch im Ausbildungs- und 
Technikbereich, Lufthansa hat sich mit der neuen Technik auseinandergesetzt und 
testet nun viele verschiedene Möglichkeiten um sie massentauglich und 
kundenfreundlich einzusetzen. 
Auch Marriott hat seine ersten Schritte mit Virtual Reality gemacht und wird auch in 
den kommenden Jahren weiter damit arbeiten. Tendenziell werden sie ihre VR 
Postcards weiter vorantreiben und über kurz oder lang auch die virtuellen 
Rundgänge durch ihre Hotels flächendeckender ausbauen. 
Wird sich die Technik weiter verbessern, dann werden auch weitere touristische 
Anbieter ihr Angebot vergrößern und mehr Inhalte generieren, sodass der Mehrwert 
für die Verbraucher deutlich erhöht werden kann. 
 
 
5.2. Beantwortung der Forschungsfrage 
Man kann sagen, dass im Moment Virtual Reality als Marketinginstrument im 
Tourismus noch ganz am Anfang seiner Entwicklung steht. Es haben zwar schon 
einige Anbieter den Vorteil davon entdeckt, jedoch ist die Technik dafür noch zu 
wenig ausgereift. Auch die großen Buchungsplattformen sind zwar interessiert, 
sehen aber im Moment noch keine große Notwendigkeit auf diesen Zug 
aufzuspringen, da es auf dem Massenmarkt noch zu wenig bekannt ist. Viele 
Anbieter agieren im Moment noch in deutlich zu kleinem Rahmen und meistens auch 
eher experimentell, als dass es wirklich als etabliertes Marketinginstrument zählen 
kann. Man merkt, dass gerade die einfachen 360° Videos bei Destinationen immer 
beliebter werden, da es doch ein anderes Erlebnis darstellt, als ein Standard-Video 
oder einfach ein paar Bilder. 
Aber genau hier liegt das berühmte Huhn-Ei Problem. Die großen Firmen wollen erst 
mehr aufwändige Inhalte produzieren, wenn das Produkt bei der breiten Masse 
Anklang gefunden hat, jedoch beschäftigt sich die breite Masse damit eher, wenn es 
aufwändige, interessante Inhalte gibt, die sie nutzen können und die sie auch als 
mehr, als eine Spielerei betrachten. 
Auf lange Sicht könnte es sich als Marketinginstrument auf dem Massenmarkt 
etablieren, wenn sich die Technik noch deutlich weiter verbessert und die Endgeräte 
für die Verbraucher noch günstiger werden. Denn grundsätzlich ist auch das 
Interesse bei den Verbrauchern vorhanden. Auch wenn der Markt im Moment noch 
Schlussbetrachtung                                                                                   47 
 
klein ist, sollte die Reiseindustrie auch weiterhin ein Vorreiter bleiben, um diese 
Technologie der breiten Masse zugänglich zu machen. Denn gerade in der Branche 
kann das Potential von Virtual Reality eine ganz neue Möglichkeit des Reisens und 
der Reisevorbereitung bringen. 
Was man sich jedoch bei all dem Positiven, über das Wissen der jeweiligen 
Destinationen, fragen sollte, ist das was durch das Fortschreiten der Technik 
verloren gehen könnte. Kann man sich nach dem vorherigen Besichtigen der 
jeweiligen Destination, überhaupt noch unbedarft auf die Eindrücke der Umgebung 
sowie Land und Leute einlassen, oder hat man sich dann bereits ein Bild gemacht, 
welches durch das virtuelle Betrachten möglicherweise verfälscht ist und der 
Verbraucher somit danach trotzdem eine Enttäuschung erlebt, da die Vorstellung in 
seinem Kopf eine Andere war. Oder kommt es irgendwann soweit, dass es den 
Leuten reicht, die Orte nur noch virtuell zu bereisen und es quasi nicht mehr als nötig 
empfinden den gesehenen Ort in der realen Welt zu besuchen. 
 
 
5.3. Ausblick 
Virtual Reality wird in Zukunft weiterhin eine Rolle spielen. Andererseits wird man 
auch an Augmented und Mixed Reality in den nächsten Jahren nicht vorbeikommen, 
denn sobald man von Virtual Reality spricht, sind auch die anderen Beiden nicht weit. 
Natürlich sind es unterschiedliche Konzepte, bei Mixed Reality verschmilzt die echte 
mit der virtuellen Welt. Das beste Beispiel von Augmented Reality ist das beliebte 
Handy-Spiel Pokémon Go, das 2016 auf den Markt kam. Hier bewegt man sich in 
der realen Welt und es werden virtuelle Objekte in die Umgebung projiziert und je 
nach dem wo sich die Person befindet, ändern sich auch die in die Umgebung 
projizierten Objekte. 
Neuerdings wird auch über das Thema Stand-Alone-Brillen diskutiert, welche ohne 
Smartphone oder Rechner auskommen sollen 70 Bei der Facebook-Tochter Oculus 
VR wird schon an so einem Stand-Alone Modell gearbeitet. Im Moment gibt es 
bereits eine Referenz-Plattform der Firma Qualcomm, die zu den Stand-Alone Brillen 
zählt, jedoch möchte die Firma die Brille selbst nicht herstellen, sondern will nur ein 
Forum zur Verfügung stellen, bei dem Ideen in diese Richtung weiterentwickelt 
werden sollen.71 Auch Intel hatte 2016 angekündigt, solch eine Stand-Alone-Brille 
                                            
70 vgl. Lutter/Meinecke/Tropf 2017, 44

Schlussbetrachtung                                                                                   48 
 
auf den Markt bringen zu wollen. Jedoch wurde dieses Projekt im darauffolgenden 
Jahr, auf Grund von zu wenig Interesse der Finanzierungs- und Entwicklungspartner 
wieder eingestellt. Eine Wiederaufnahme des Projektes ist für Ende des Jahres 2017 
geplant.72 
Im Moment hängt die Technik der Virtual Reality noch sehr stark von der 
Rechnerleistung, dem Speicher, den Sensoren und der Bildschirmqualität des 
Smartphones bzw. des Computers ab. Auch wenn sich die Smartphones ständig 
weiterentwickeln und immer leitungsfähiger und intelligenter werden, könnte sich mit 
den Stand-Alone-Brillen, die komplette Technologie noch einmal verändern und 
wieder einen komplett neuen Zweig für Virtual Reality ermöglichen. Dies liegt im 
Moment jedoch noch in der Zukunft.  
Der nächste Schritt ist die Geschwindigkeit der Netzwerke. Im kommenden Jahr soll 
es die 5G Netzwerke geben, welche eine nochmals deutlich höhere Geschwindigkeit 
als LTE bzw. 4G haben sollen. Dieses Netzwerk wird die mobilen VR Anwendungen 
stabiler und schneller machen und ihnen eine hohe Bandbreite liefern. 73 Auch die 
Befragten der empirischen Studie, denken zu 45%, dass die Etablierung von Virtual 
Reality als Marketinginstrument stark von der technischen Entwicklung abhängt.

Schlussbetrachtung                                                                                   49 
 
 
In der Reisebranche und ihrem Marketing wird es in Zukunft auch immer wichtiger 
werden, egal ob es um die Zubuchung von Zusatzoptionen im Vorfeld im Reisebüro 
oder das einfache Erkunden von Destinationen, Hotels oder Flugzeugen geht. Das 
Angebot kann noch wesentlich weiterentwickelt werden, zum Beispiel solche 
Zusatzoptionen wie Bungeesprünge oder Fallschirmsprünge als Erinnerung im 360° 
Video mit nach Hause zu nehmen und somit das Erlebnis immer wieder erleben zu 
können. 
Wie bereits erwähnt, wird man auch in Zukunft nicht an Augmented Reality 
vorbeikommen, denn auch hier gibt es viele interessante Möglichkeiten Marketing zu 
betreiben. Eine die sich bereits heute schon auf dem Markt befindet, ist die 
HoloLense von Microsoft. Ein bekanntes Verwendungsbeispiel war die Projektion 
des neuen A350 von Lufthansa auf der ITB 2017. Hier konnten die Besucher das 
Flugzeug so erleben, wie sie es ansonsten niemals hätten können. 
Außerdem wird Augmented Reality beim Thema historische und allgemeine 
Sehenswürdigkeiten an zusätzlicher Bedeutung gewinnen. Hier ergibt sich die 
Möglichkeit, dem Verbraucher vermehrte Informationen sowie Modelle der 
historischen Gebäude über das Smartphone anzuzeigen oder sie in die Welt des 
damaligen Bauwerkes zu entführen. Diese zusätzliche Informationseinblendung, 
kann aber auch in Hotels oder Restaurants eingesetzt werden, beispielsweise um 
einem Gast die Speisekarte in seiner Muttersprache anzuzeigen oder auch um 
Informationen zur näheren Umgebung zu bekommen. Augmented Reality kann, aber 
nicht nur als Instrument für die Verbraucher dienen, sondern auch zur Schulung von 
Mitarbeitern, in denen ihnen eine reelle Situation gezeigt wird, in der sie agieren 
müssen. 
Vor allem wird Virtual Reality sich in den nächsten Jahren in den Bereichen Lernen 
und Bildung, Musik und Konzerte, Events sowie Arbeiten und Trainieren 
weiterverbreiten, da VR eine große Erweiterung für diese Bereiche bringen wird. 
Auch im Bereich Online-Shopping wird Virtual Reality eine Rolle spielen. Bei diesen 
Anwendungen kann man die Ware, egal ob Kleidung, Möbel oder ähnliches, direkt 
virtuell im eigenen Zuhause anprobieren bzw. virtuell aufstellen, um zu sehen, ob 
das gewünschte Objekt zu einem passt. 
Eine weitere Entwicklung könnte die Standardisierung von Eyetracking sein, um 
Virtual Reality noch weiter zu verbessern. Außerdem wird die Technik im 
Allgemeinen immer besser, denn zum heutigen Stand sind die VR Videos teilweise 
noch stark verpixelt, was sich mit der Weiterentwicklung deutlich verbessern dürfte. 
Schlussbetrachtung                                                                                   50 
 
In Expertenkreisen wird im Moment auch schon über ein Smartphone diskutiert, 
welches selbst Virtual Reality fähig ist und man somit keine zusätzliche Hardware 
mehr benötigt. Dies wäre ein weiterer Schritt VR einer breiteren Masse zugänglich 
zu machen bzw. näher zu bringen. 
Einige Experten sehen in dem Film Ready Player One der im März 2018 in die Kinos 
kommt, die selbe Möglichkeit, wie bei Avatar für die 3D-Technologie. Kurz nach dem 
der Film in die Kinos kam gab es einen riesigen Hype um die 3D-Technologie und 
somit könnte auch der neue Film breiten Aufmerksamkeit für die VR Technologie 
bringen und einen weiteren Schritt in Richtung massenmarkttaugliches Produkt 
machen.74  
Man darf gespannt bleiben, wie sich das Thema in den nächsten Jahren entwickeln 
wird und welcher Anbieter als nächstes einen großen Schritt wagt, um die 
Technologie weiter Richtung Massentauglichkeit zu bringen.

Virtual reality has been up and coming for years and there are a lot of possibilities for mar-
keters. Still in year 2018 not many of the companies have invested into virtual reality or 
360-degree photo/video marketing. 
 
This thesis is all about the technologies and history behind virtual reality and how market-
ers could use virtual reality as their part of their marketing activities. It will tell you all the 
important numbers about virtual reality, what popular VR headsets there are and what kind 
of actions you can take to use virtual reality in your marketing. 
 
Travel industry is one of the industries which will benefit the most from virtual reality and 
360-degree video/photos in their marketing since the visual content is extremely valuable 
in travel marketing. Virtual reality offers marketers new way to market locations and ac-
commodation by sending them there, virtually and it creates possibilities for agencies, too.  
 
It also offers new ways for more effective advertising since the users are completely im-
mersed into the content.  
 
Many Real Estate businesses are already using VR since it allows them to showcase fu-
ture projects that they haven’t even started building and gain revenue from early on.  
 
Virtual reality also offers a “WOW”-factor and companies like Lenovo are already using it in 
their trade shows successfully as the 350% increase of the leads shows. Companies can 
now invite all their peers around the world to their events by using livestreaming with virtual 
reality.

1 Introduction 
This part of the thesis will explain what virtual reality does mean, how it works, about its 
history and how is virtual reality doing right now. 
 
1.1 The purpose of the research 
Virtual reality is one of the technologies which can have big impact in our lives in the next 
few years, so it is crucial for us to understand what it really is and what it can do right now 
and in the future. It is already impacting the ways we can learn, play and how we can 
meet without physically being there. But it is also being used in marketing and it is im-
portant for marketers to know how they can benefit from this technology. 
 
The purpose of the research is to educate marketers on what virtual reality is and how 
they can use it for getting results. It guides you through the history and future of VR, tells 
you about its current state and what “big players” there are in the industry and leads you 
to the actions marketers can take if they wish to add virtual reality as part of their market-
ing strategy. By reading this thesis one should understand what virtual reality is, how one 
can use it in marketing and what the future holds with virtual reality. 
 
1.2 What is Virtual Reality 
According to Oxford dictionary the definition on virtual reality (also known as VR) is: “The 
computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be 
interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic 
equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors” (Oxford 
Dictionary 2018.). What it basically means that virtual reality is computer-generated reality 
where user can interact with the surroundings. In this thesis we will also consider 360-de-
gree video as part of “virtual reality” since it is also often discussed as a part of virtual real-
ity. 
 
Most people associate virtual reality with gaming, but it is much more than a gaming plat-
form. In virtual reality architects can build complex structures which are not possible in the 
real world because of funding or physics. People can travel around the world virtually in 
just a few clicks and doctors can practice their operating skills without fear of hurting 
someone or something. 
 
Virtual reality is gaining more and more popularity every day but there are some issues re-
stricting it to become as a part of peoples’ everyday life. One of the biggest issues is the 
 2 
 
total cost for the user: the cheapest possible setup for you to use with a PC will cost you 
something between 1200-1500 USD for you to be capable to use Oculus Rift. There is 
cheaper option if you are into gaming consoles since PlayStation 4 with all the needed 
items for using PlayStation VR will cost 600-700 USD. The most used virtual reality de-
vices are VR-headsets made for mobile phones. In terms of usage most popular single 
virtual reality headset is Samsung Gear VR with 5 million units “sold”. With these devices 
comes another problem, the computing power. People are ready to produce high quality 
content for virtual reality but unfortunately, we cannot use this content yet because of lack 
in computing power. This topic will be more covered in next chapter, virtual reality devices.  
 
Another big problem which virtual reality faces is lack of content. Since the number of us-
ers is still quite small, there are not many people producing content for the devices. Also, 
there are multiple platforms for content and no unified standards, but the future is aiming 
towards unification and you can already use multiple app stores for downloading content.   
 
If successful virtual reality can create completely new platform for marketing that hasn’t 
been yet discovered by many companies. VR allows you to create more interesting con-
tent for your audience and gives them more realistic experiences than ordinary videos or 
applications can: you can send them to your new resort or let them test drive your new 
car. The technology also cheats your brain to think that you are there. This is what makes 
it more memorable than regular 2-dimension videos or applications ever can. According to 
the HTC Vive Chinas President Alwin Wang Graylins column kids can learn much faster 
by using virtual reality education compared to the traditional education (RoadtoVR 2018.). 
When audience equips the VR-headset, they are immersed in the content and not dis-
tracted as easily compared to ordinary videos or applications since they need to take the 
headset off before doing anything else, so you get full attention to your message.  Since it 
is relatively new tool for marketing, it also attracts more new crowds and media, so your 
marketing campaign can get even more attention than expected. As seen from the graph 
below the interest towards virtual reality has rapidly increased since early 2016 and even 
though the number of searches has slightly decreased in 2017 the trend is going up again. 
The peak times for the searches have been during the Christmas time and important prod-
uct launches.

1.3 History of Virtual Reality 
The history of virtual reality can be dated back to 19th century and to the 360-degree 
paintings which were trying to get the user feel like they are part of the scene. The real 
breakthrough for virtual reality happened in 1838 when researcher Sir Charles Wheat-
stone invented stereoscope and its technology. Wheatstone realized that human brain can 
combine two photos into one if one photo is showed to one eye. This effect made the 
combined image to seem more “deep”. The device which combined these two images into 
one was called stereoscope and the technology is still used for the lower tier mobile VR 
headsets like Google Cardboard.  
 
The next breakthrough for virtual reality happened in 1950s when cinematographer Mor-
ton Heilig invented device called Sensorama. It had speakers, stereoscopic screen, mov-
ing chair and even smell generators. Heilig filmed six short films for the Sensorama all by 
himself.  
 
Figure 2. Sensorama (Wikipedia 2016)

In 1965 Ivan Sutherland created the concept of “Ultimate Display”. For Sutherland, “Ulti-
mate Display” meant that you could view computer-made 3D world (including the 3D 
sound) and performs actions in that world. In 1968 Sutherland brought his concept to real 
life with his student and created “Sword of Damocles” – first computer powered VR-head-
set. The headsets feature’s and design were extremely basic, and it was hanging from the 
ceiling since it was too heavy to be comfortably used otherwise. 
 
The next major steps for virtual reality were in the end of 1980’s and in the 90s. The term” 
virtual reality was popularized and first company to sell VR-headsets was VPL (Visual 
Programming Lab). They also invented a glove which you could use in virtual reality world 
and it would follow your hands movements. In the 90s there were VR-arcade machines 
and companies like Sega and Nintendo launched their own VR-headsets, but both failed 
to see mass scale adoption or in the Sega’s case even mass production.  
 
From that point the technology for virtual reality has developed rapidly and after Google’s 
launch of Google Cardboard and Facebook’s Oculus acquisition many of the tech giants 
are investing into VR development. 
 
1.4 Year 2018 for virtual reality 
Many sources were betting on the year 2017 being the year of virtual reality but there is 
still long way towards the estimates as the graph below shows. According to the Super-
Data the number of shipped VR-headsets decreased in 2017 instead of the most esti-
mates for some of the brands: 
 5 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Sales of VR in 2016 & 2017. (SuperData 2018) 
 
Still, virtual reality is considered as one of the “next big things” according to various 
sources. M&A firm Digi-Capital predicts that the virtual reality industry will be worth 30 
billion USD by the year 2020 and in 2025 it can already be worth 80 billion USD according 
to Goldman Sachs (CNBC 2016.). The sales of virtual reality goggles will also increase in 
the future, estimates varying from 500 million VR/AR-devices sold by year 2025 according 
to Piper Jaffray investment bank (UploadVR 2015.). That’s a big change to compared to 
current estimate of 13.65 million devices being sold in year 2017 (Statista 2017.) so the 
potential of the market is great. That is the one of the main reasons big companies like 
Facebook, Apple, Sony, HTC, Samsung and Google are interested in this technology and 
developing their own devices and software for the virtual reality segment. 
 
2018 can be considered as good year for virtual reality since the technology is improving 
constantly and all the major brands launching their new headsets in 2018 with the biggest 
launches being standalone headsets from Google, Oculus and HTC. One major part for 
mass adaption is the content and the amounts invested to VR/AR companies increased in 
2017 so we will see more companies entering the market with their products. According to 
the DigiCapital VR/AR industry got over 3 billion USD in investments in 2017 which is the 
new record for the VR/AR field (DigiCapital 2018.) and be considered as a possibility for a 
breakthrough for the VR/AR industry.

2 Virtual reality Headsets 
Virtual reality devices can be separated in two different types: to ones which use com-
puters (or consoles) and ones which use mobile devices to power them. Main differ-
ence between mobile VR and Stationary VR (PC and console-using devices) is that 
the quality and controls are far more advanced in stationary VR. Stationary VR also 
comes with a lot higher price tag and the need of highly powered computer or 
PlayStation 4. 
 
In the interview with the Henrik Helin he mentioned the high prices being a problem 
for VR and said the prices need to be lower for the mass to adapt. 
 
There are also other manufacturers of VR headsets, but they are either smaller than 
ones mentioned below or have their focus only on the Chinese market. 
 
The market share of the different headsets looked like this in 2016: 
 
Figure 4. Global VR Headset Shipment Market Shares in 2016 (Strategy Analytics 2017)  
 
2.1 Mobile VR Headsets 
Mobile VR headsets are most sold headsets based on statistics from year 2016. In 2016 
there were over 90 million mobile headsets sold according to SuperData (SuperData 
 7 
 
2018a.) and Google cardboard was the biggest seller with 88.4 million headsets sold fol-
lowed by Samsung gear VR with 2.3 million headsets. These numbers don’t even tell us 
about the amounts of Chinese mobile headsets which have been sold in millions. So, let’s 
look at some of the most popular mobile VR headsets in more detail. 
 
In the interview Henrik Helin said: “Personally, I see the best potential in mobile VR so 
that the people wouldn’t have to have PC’s with them, just a mobile device is enough.”  
(Henrik Helin 17.11.2017.) 
 
2.1.1 Google Cardboard 
 
Figure 5. Google Cardboard (ITead 2018) 
 
Google Cardboard VR-headsets have the biggest market share with 88.4 million headsets 
sold in 2016. One of the reasons for that is the price tag of 5 USD and you can brand it, so 
a lot of brands have their own branded headsets. It was launched in 2014 by Google and 
since then gained a lot of popularity. You can purchase one from Google or make one 
yourself by using instructions provided by Google. Many companies also copied the idea 
of the headset and built their own higher quality headset and these headsets are popular 
especially in Chinese market.  
 
2.1.2 Samsung Gear VR 
 
Figure 6. Samsung Gear VR (Samsung 2018) 
 
 8 
 
Samsung Gear VR is the second popular mobile VR-headset with total of over 5 million 
devices distributed worldwide in 2016. It was released in 2015 and Samsung gave these 
units for free for buyers of Samsung S6 and S6 Edge mobile phone buyers, so the real 
sales amount of the headsets is 2.3 million in 2016 and expected to be 4.1 million in 2017 
(IHS Markit 2017.). Samsung Gear VR comes with their own Oculus powered app store 
which currently has over 600 apps. They launched newer version of the Gear VR in April 
2017 to work with the new Samsung Galaxy 8-series and the newer Gear VR supports 
Samsung Galaxy-series from S6 to S9. And what’s the most special thing about the newer 
Samsung Gear VR is that it has its own controller which was missing in the previous ver-
sion. 
 
2.1.3 Google Daydream View 
 
Figure 7. Google Daydream VR (Phys.org 2016) 
 
Google Daydreams first version was released in November 2016 with the launch of the 
Googles Own Pixel mobile phone-series. It’s the main competitor for the Gear VR and ac-
cording to the IHS Markit the sales will be around 2.23 million sold devices in 2017 (IHS 
Markit 2017.). It also has its own app store (which has less apps than Gear VR) and 
comes with a remote. What makes it special compared to the Gear VR is that it supports 
phones from other manufacturers too and even the new Samsung Galaxy S8-series. It re-
ceived minor design update in late 2017 and is now shipped with more colours.  
 
2.2 Stationary VR headsets 
In 2016 there were only 2 million stationary headsets sold according to SuperData. Even 
though stationary VR offers superb performance compared to mobile VR they are still far 
behind the sales. One of the biggest things lowering the sales is the cost: Stationary VR 
requires powerful computer (price around1000USD) or PS4 which costs around 300USD. 
Then you need to spend 300 to 600USD for the VR headset so even the cheapest setup 
will cost you more than 600USD. With the higher price tags these headsets offer also 
more features than mobile VR headsets. They have advanced controllers, you can move 
 9 
 
inside virtual reality and have superior graphics compared to mobile VR. With the higher 
graphics you get also higher refresh rate which helps people for not suffering from “virtual 
reality sickness” which is result of too low refresh rate and causes symptoms like nausea 
and headache.  
 
2.2.1 PlayStation VR 
 
Figure 8. PlayStation VR (PlayStation 2018) 
 
PlayStation VR was the most sold stationary VR headset in 2017 and has sold almost 1,7 
million units in 2017 (SuperData 2018) which is more than HTC Vive and Oculus Rift have 
sold combined according to the market data. It is few hundred dollars cheaper than Vive 
or Rift and only needs PS4 to run it, so people don’t need powerful computers to use it. 
The prices for PS VR start from 300USD. 
 
2.2.2 HTC Vive 
 
Figure 9. HTC Vive (VRBound 2018) 
 
HTC Vice is stationary VR-headset from Taiwanese electronics company HTC and Ameri-
can Valve Corporation which is known from games like Counter-strike and software distri-
bution platform Steam and the headset was launched in April 2016. It is the second most 
sold stationary VR-headset with 297 000 units sold in 2017 (SuperData 2018a). HTC Vive 
uses Steam VR to distribute content to its users. They also launched Pro-version of the 
 10 
 
headset in 2018 which comes with a higher resolution and the possibility to use it wire-
lessly with adapter which is not possible with the basic Vive headset. 
 
2.2.3 Oculus Rift  
 
Figure 10. Oculus Rift (VRBound 2018.) 
 
Oculus Rift was the VR headset which started the real interest on virtual reality and is the 
main competitor for HTC Vive. The official launch of the consumer edition was in March 
2016. It was acquired by Facebook with price of 2 billion USD in 2014. It is also least sold 
headset with only 362 000 units sold in 2017 (SuperData 2018a) and had some problems 
with their shipments has its own app store called Oculus. It retails currently for 399 USD 
with the Touch controllers after some big price cuts in 2017. 
 
2.2.4 Microsoft Mixed Reality headsets 
 
Figure 11. Windows Mixed Reality headsets (IO-Tech 2017) 
 
Microsoft entered the VR-hardware space with their branded “mixed reality” headsets to 
compete with Oculus and HTC. The “mixed reality” term used as the product name is con-
fusing since the headsets don’t have any mixed reality capabilities, yet but according to 
the Microsoft that might not be the case in the future. What makes them so special is that 
you don’t need to have top-tier PC to use their headsets and modern mid-priced PC with 
Windows 10 should do the job. It also has six degrees of freedom built-in, so you don’t 
 11 
 
have to buy any external sensors. The price for their headsets depends on the manufac-
turer but the prices including Motion controllers are from 399 to 499 USD. The 399 USD 
and 449 USD ones come with 1440x1440 resolution (per eye), LCD displays and have 
slightly different designs and field of views. Samsung’s 499USD Odyssey headset comes 
with higher resolution (1440x1600 per eye), AMOLED display and built-in AKG head-
phones and according to the tech news site The Verge it can be considered as a real 
competitor to Oculus Rift. Samsung’s headset is currently available only in the US. 
 
2.3 Standalone VR headsets 
According to the chairman of FIVR Ry (Finnish Virtual Reality association) Olli Sinerma 
and Henrik Helin and some other industry experts that next big thing in VR headsets will 
be the standalone VR. By standalone VR headset they mean that the VR headset doesn’t 
need a mobile phone or PC to work, it has all the technology built-in, so you can say 
goodbye to all the cables and charging phone. All the big players in VR are currently fo-
cusing on building their own standalone headsets and racing who’s going to be the first on 
the market. Some of them will have motion sensors built in, so you don’t have to buy any 
external sensors to achieve the six degrees of freedom.  
 
2.3.1 HTC Vive Focus VR 
 
Figure 12. HTC Vive Focus (Slashgear 2018) 
 
HTC Vive Focus was revealed in Mid-November, a month later after Oculus introduced 
their own standalone headset. It runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (same processor 
which is used in many latest flagship mobile phones). It is also the first commercially avail-
able standalone headset which supports six degrees of freedom. HTCs focus for this 
headset was China and in March 2018 they announced that the headset would also be 
available worldwide during 2018. At the launch event HTC also announced that its plans 
of making standalone headset for the Google Daydream platform were cancelled. It was 
launched in China early 2018 and costs 3 999 CNY (635 USD) for white model or 4299 
CNY (684 USD) for the blue model.  
 
 12 
 
2.3.2 Oculus Go 
 
Figure 13. Oculus Go (UploadVR 2018) 
 
Oculus announced their first standalone headset Oculus Go in Mid-October. What makes 
it different from HTCs Focus is that it’s probably going to be cheaper with 199USD price 
point since it doesn’t support six degrees of freedom or fully tracked controllers and ships 
with lower tier Qualcomm 821 processor. It also has spatial audio built inside so you don’t 
need additional headphones. The controller of the headset is like the one in Samsung 
Gear VR, so the developers can build apps for both Gear VR and Oculus Go. Developers 
should be getting their kits in November and it should be available in early 2018.  
 
2.3.3 Lenovo Mirage Solo with Daydream 
 
Figure 14. Lenovo Mirage Solo with Daydream (Lenovo 2018) 
 
Google’s answer to their competition on the standalone VR-headset market comes from 
computer manufactures Lenovo. Daydream standalone VR-headsets were originally sup-
posed to come from both HTC and Lenovo, but HTC retired from the deal and decided to 
launch their own standalone headset instead. Headsets sensors support the six degrees 
of freedom with the Googles technology called “WorldSense” so you don’t need any exter-
nal sensors and can freely move around. It comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 
(same as in the HTC Vive Focus) and with QHD screen and will start shipping during 
spring 2018.

3 Research methods 
Research was conducted by using qualitative research methods. Qualitative research 
method was chosen as a main research method since there is no database of companies 
using virtual reality as a marketing tool and we wanted to get better insights on how com-
panies could benefit from virtual reality marketing. The persons chosen for the qualitative 
interviews were found on the Facebook group page of the FIVR (Finnish Virtual Reality 
Association) where I posted and asked for volunteers for this interview. Only two people 
responded to me out of 1506 members and both were chosen for the qualitive interviews. 
The interviews were held 17th of November 2017 at Café Pirita in Helsinki. One of the in-
terviews was an interview by phone and second one was a face-to-face interview. The in-
terview questions were sent to the people interviewed beforehand, so they could prepare 
for the interview. The questions I asked were different for the both persons since they 
were working on different aspects of virtual reality industry. The persons chosen for the 
interviews were Olli Sinerma (Chairman of the Finnish Virtual Reality Association) and 
Henrik Helin (CEO of the 360mediatalo). Olli’s association FIVR is leading association for 
VR in Finland and is closely working with VR developers and investors and towards mak-
ing Finland as a leading country for virtual reality in Europe. Unfortunately, the interview 
with Olli was recorded phone call and the file which consisted the audio of the interview 
was corrupt, so the data gotten from the interview is only based on notes and the memory 
of the interviewer. Henrik is the CEO of 360mediatalo which is focusing on creating 360-
videos and virtual reality applications for marketing purposes and showcased their work in 
various trade shows in Finland with their clients. 
 
The research was based on the question of how virtual reality could be used in marketing 
and what kind of tools marketers can use. The first part of the research was to find infor-
mation about virtual reality and how it had already been used in marketing and what other 
possibilities there could still be for the marketers. Since there are not a lot of books about 
virtual reality and its use in marketing, most of the research was done by searching infor-
mation from the internet which has a lot of interesting articles about the subject. These ar-
ticles were about the different areas where virtual reality is already being used as a mar-
keting tool and some insights with statistics about the VR field. The main reason for the 
small amount of information is because of the reason that technology is still quite new and 
has not reached its full potential yet.  
 
The second part of the research were the interviews with the virtual reality specialists who 
would provide me with some insights about the industry and support the theory written in 
the thesis. The questions were about the virtual reality, what is its place in Finland and 
 14 
 
how marketers could benefit from it. We also discussed some cases which have been 
done in Finland and some interesting companies in Finland working in the VR-field. These 
questions were customized for the both persons since they were working in different areas 
of VR. These questions can be found in the attachments (Attachments 1 and 2).

4 Applying virtual reality marketing 
This chapter will discuss about how virtual reality marketing can be used in different indus-
tries or areas of marketing. Topic will be based on research and the real-life examples of 
the companies which have already implemented virtual reality marketing as part of their 
marketing strategy and how they have done it.  
 
In the interview Henrik Helin mentions the reason he got into VR-marketing as follows: 
“The mission of marketing has always been the same: getting into the people’s minds and 
them to remember the concept you are providing to them. And VR sticks with you much 
better than traditional marketing and that was my thing.” (Helin 17.11.2017.)  
 
4.1 Virtual reality in travel industry 
Travel industry is currently in the era of big changes since most of the information regard-
ing traveling is found online. You can compare the prices and services of accommodation 
and flights in just a few clicks. Travel agencies are reducing the amounts of brick and mor-
tar locations and starting to focus on their digital presence instead. According to Statistic 
Brain 57 percent of all travel reservations are made via online in 2017 (Statistic Brain 
2017.) so being online is crucial for businesses to survive these changes. There are few 
indications that virtual reality might the next big thing for the travel industry: The media 
has talked a lot about virtual traveling and many major companies in the industry have 
started experimenting the possibilities of VR and producing content for their audiences. 
 
Google studied travellers’ habits in 2014 travel study and came up with some interesting 
details. The study tells us that amongst price the main reason why people book their travel 
from online travel agencies are the site tools and options. One of the tools could be possi-
bility to virtually feel the hotel or location at your home. But more importantly, 56% of the 
leisure travellers find their inspiration to travel from the internet and 83% of those people 
found social networks and video sites to be their top source of inspiration. Especially vid-
eos were important when thinking about taking the trip and when choosing the right desti-
nation. (Think with Google 2014.) Virtual reality gives users even more immerse and 
memorable experience so that could be one of the keys to get customers to choose your 
company.  
 
When making the virtual reality content, I would also think about the languages you are 
using: according to the study by Visa and Oxford economics, Chinese speaking custom-
ers will be spending more than 250 billion USD to traveling in the year 2025 (Visa 2016.). 
 16 
 
Many Chinese don’t understand English, so this is one more way to attract broader audi-
ence. Especially virtual reality will be a big thing there since the virtual reality market will 
grow from 249 million USD in 2016 to 1,7 billion USD in 2021. (Research and markets 
2017.) 
 
4.1.1 Marketing travel locations 
In my opinion, this is one of the most important ways to get tourists to visit your country or 
city. Many countries and touristic cities have their own tourism boards and are responsible 
of marketing the country or city. At the time of writing, only few cities have been using vir-
tual reality in their marketing, even though there are great possibilities. If you search 
YouTube, you can only find few 360-degree videos from big cities even though virtual re-
ality videos are attracting more and more crowd every day. Good example of attracting 
crowds is video tour made by New York Times in the city of New York. It has been out in 
YouTube for a year now and has over 2,3 million views and still getting decent amount of 
new views.  
 
Good and easy way to get more tourists to choose your country or city from your competi-
tion is to do short video about the place you are marketing. According to HospitalityTech 
the ones who finished watching video ad about the city were 23 times more likely to book 
a stay in that location (HospitalityTech 2015). Great way is to make 360-degree guided 
tour video about the location. This could be done as example below suggests. 
 
Example: 
 
Country/city X wants to attract more tourists and decides to make a 360-degree VR-com-
patible guided tour video about the place. 360-degree video allows interested people to 
see city in completely new perspective and with the use of VR-headset person can almost 
feel like they are already there.  
 
Good way to do this kind of guided tour would be to have someone who is well known to 
their target audience to guide them through the place and visiting their favourite spots in 
that area. Another idea would be to just hire a guide and show their audience places of in-
terest. This could be done as co-creation with local places of interest and services to re-
ceive the necessary funding for the video. When filming is finished, it would be shared to 
the social media and not only by the country or city but also by all the participants of the 
video (places of interests, guides and filmmaker). This would share the experience to 
 17 
 
much broader audience. It might even be featured in the news since the technology is 
new and interesting. 
 
This type of VR-content could be used not only by the tourism authorities but all kinds of 
companies. For example, booking.com and TripAdvisor offer their customers free travel 
guides and what would be more interesting way to give your customers additional value 
than experience like this. They could explore the city even before landing and could de-
cide what they want to do during their trip. 
 
4.1.2 Marketing travel accommodation in virtual reality 
Internet has made comparing accommodation much easier and new ways of travel ac-
commodation are being offered so it is even more crucial to stand up from the crowd. Ac-
cording to the study conducted by Statisticbrain there are 148.3 million bookings made 
online each year. Surprisingly, 65,4% of these bookings are made directly from the hotel 
websites (like marriot.com). Rest of the booking are made from merchants like Expedia or 
retail websites like booking.com. (Statistic Brain 2017.) 
 
Euromonitor study also suggests that by the year 2020 more than 44% of the total book-
ings are done from online and the share of the smartphone bookings will rise in the future 
(Euromonitor 2016.) so this means that the hotels and other travel accommodation ser-
vices should put even more effort to be visible online.  
 
Photos are really good way to generate more engagement and according to a study by 
TripAdvisor 73% of travellers use photos to make decisions (TripAdvisor 2013.) so it is 
crucial for the companies to include photos to their website and in this case to the TripAd-
visor. Study was conducted in 2013 so four years later some of numbers might have 
changed but the fact still is that more photos means more engagement. Nowadays we 
could consider using 360-degree photos and videos as important as the photos where in 
2013.  
 
Even more impactful way to attract more engagement is to have videos about your ac-
commodation. In 2013, around 51% of leisure travellers, 69 percent of business travellers 
and 55% of affluent travellers watch travel videos online (Google The Traveller 2013.) so 
the audience for the videos is broad. 50% of the people would prefer to watch videos on 
hotels own website and 32% from YouTube. 68% of the travellers would prefer infor-
mation about the amenities and features of the hotel and 32% prefer information about 
nearby activities and 57% think the most important content are the rooms, suites and 
 18 
 
common areas. For the nearby activities, most interesting was the dining/bar options and 
outdoor activities. The preferred type of the video was that it should be informational and 
tell you about the hotel, services and location. The most interesting fact is that 37% of the 
answerers would prefer a guest to narrate the video and 31% want the video without nar-
rator. (Software Advice 2014.) 
 
Since virtual reality is quite new thing there are not many accommodations that provide 
360-degree videos to their possible customers. One of the first companies to use virtual 
reality as a marketing tool was hotel chain Marriot who let newlyweds to try their VR-expe-
rience in a booth which contained VR-headset and some special effects like wind. The vis-
itors were “teleported” to one of Marriot’s various resorts around the world. Best Western 
is working with Google Street View to let their users to access indoors of the hotels from 
the Street view in 2 200 of their locations in North America and Airbnb is partnering with 
Matterport for making 360-degree photos and 3D-models for some of their listed proper-
ties. Hilton also announced their VR-application in which you can visit some their resorts 
around the world and can find some 360-degree videos from smaller hotels in YouTube. 
Still, there is not much content about hotels in 360-degree format even though it offers 
whole new way to gain information about the rooms and services provided by the accom-
modator. With VR-content you can also gather new kind information about your audience: 
where are they looking in the room or public areas and what kind of rooms are more inter-
esting. These are just some examples of the analytics you can get from VR against tradi-
tional video where you cannot control where you are watching. So how could hotels pro-
vide virtual reality experience to their possible customers? I will introduce you some ideas 
below.  
 
Easiest way for an accommodator to produce their 360-degree video about the accommo-
dation would be to hire a person who is capable of filming and editing 360-degree video. 
Video should be informal: tell people about the rooms and amenities, facilities and public 
areas. One should include different type of rooms since customers might get interested of 
paying more if they can feel the difference between cheaper and more expensive rooms 
and virtual reality is as close as you can get to feeling it without being present. Accommo-
dator could also make a video about the points of interest and services available nearby 
since they were considered important in the study mentioned above and can attract new 
audience to your website or YouTube-page (people searching about places of interest in 
city X). 
 
 19 
 
If your company is part of bigger chain, it would be beneficial to consider making a mobile 
application to see the content since you can gather more analytics and provide calls to ac-
tion after the video. In the application, you could choose the location where you want to go 
and which hotel you would like to see. Also, there would be videos of the places of interest 
and not only about the accommodation. After finishing watching the video it would include 
strong call to action and watcher could continue straight to the booking page after watch-
ing.  Application would work on Android and iPhone and videos could be watched in 360-
degree format and in format for virtual reality headsets.  
 
4.1.3 VR-marketing for travel agencies 
Travel Agencies are constantly finding new ways to market their services to customers 
and traditional travel agencies with brick and mortar locations are getting harder to find in 
many countries since online sales are increasing every year being predicted to be 694 bil-
lion USD (Statista 2016a) in 2018 for all the travel services (Hotels, flights and other ser-
vices). 
 
This gives huge pressure for the brick and mortar stores and they need have new ways to 
attract customers to their locations and try to digitalize their services. One way to attract 
customers is to your location is to have something special at your store and that is what 
Thomas Cook did: They added VR-headsets to their flagship stores in UK, Germany and 
Belgium in 2015. 
 
They filmed 360-degree VR films at their travel locations in Egypt, Cyprus, Greece, New 
York and Singapore and filmed different activities you can do there like snorkelling in the 
red sea or taking a helicopter tour around New York. It was launched in 2015 and was a 
huge success: it had press coverage from Bloomberg and Marketing Week, generated 
sales of 12 000 GBP in UK and Germany with return of investment being 40%. There also 
was a 180% increase on their New York tour sales. (Bloomberg 2015.) 
 
Another way to get even more broad audience is to share these virtual reality experiences 
online, in places like YouTube or make your own application for mobile devices so that 
even more people interested in traveling could see what they can book from you and this 
is what Finnish travel agency Aurinkomatkat has done. They launched their VR-applica-
tion in biggest travel-related trade fair in Finland called “Matka” (Travel in English) in early 
2016. They asked visitors to try their virtual reality-application and provided free branded 
Google Cardboards for the users willing to try the application. Another Nordic travel 
agency Tjareborg is sharing their 360-degree videos of their most prestigious locations 
 20 
 
like Dubai on their Facebook and YouTube pages. These include videos about their hotel 
offerings and local sights and can be also viewed with VR-headset. 
 
4.2 VR in real estate and spaces 
One of the first implementers of virtual reality after adult entertainment and gaming was 
the real estate business. Virtual reality offers real estate businesses a lot of opportunities 
since it offers completely new way to design and showcase real estate plans and com-
pleted structures.  
 
For business to consumer sales producing virtual reality content can provide rapid in-
crease in sales. One of the hardest tasks for real estate agents is to get people to go and 
see an apartment or a house but with virtual reality they don’t need to come and see the 
place but instead they can use their virtual reality headsets and go and see the tour when-
ever they are interested. Also, the use of the VR-headset is not mandatory since virtual 
reality videos can be viewed in 360-degree format from any device which support the plat-
form one has used to upload the video. So basically, everybody who has access to Face-
book or YouTube is your potential customer, so you can reach billions of people with your 
VR-content.  
 
Many real estate companies have received positive results as they have started using vir-
tual reality as part of their marketing activities. Not only will it allow you to showcase exist-
ing housing, but it will allow your audience to get familiar with your future projects which 
are still being built since with current technology it’s possible to achieve almost real look-
ing 3D models for virtual reality. Company Virtual Xperience builds 3D-models for their cli-
ents so that they can use virtual reality to showcase their upcoming property projects to 
their investors or buyers to start gaining revenue even before the building even starts. 
What makes it even more interesting that features Real Time Options, so you can change 
the colours, materials, furnishing and lighting conditions so that the possible buyers can 
get even more customized experience. 
 
One of the great tools for VR-real estate marketing existing properties is Matterport 3D-
camera and their applications for it. Matterport’s 3D-camera allows you to take 360-de-
gree photos and map the whole area for and accurate 3D-model. In addition to the accu-
rate 3D-model the software also allows user to make 360-degree excursion throughout 
the property which is the most interesting feature for the real estate marketers and you 
can later turn this excursion to VR experience. According to the Matterport Director of 
Commercial Real Estate Marc Rehberger the time spent viewing the ad increases from 
 21 
 
three to six times when there’s a Matterport 3D-model on the real estate ad (Forbes 
2017.). They also have the biggest VR library of the “Real World Places” according to their 
own website with over 250 000 spaces published to their CoreVR app designed for 
Google Cardboard and Daydream and Samsung Gear VR (Matterport 2016.). One the 
reasons for their growing popularity is the usability of their products and apps: you don’t 
have to be software engineer to use them, just basic knowledge of computers and appli-
cations is fine.  
 
Matterport is also collaborating with Finnish virtual reality company Vizor which has a 
strong focus on virtual reality. They created an VR-experience for WebVR and you can 
watch it even from your Facebook news feed. Just by using your mouse you can browse 
small part of the National Gallery in London or when using VR-headset it offers you full vir-
tual reality experience. This is big thing for all the marketers who are using 360-degree 
photos as part of their marketing in Facebook since with this tool you can create 360-de-
gree tour and even provide more details of the space by adding text to the tour. The best 
thing is that your audience doesn’t even have to leave Facebook, but they can tour around 
the content without leaving their newsfeed. 
 22 
 
This is how the experience looks in your Facebook newsfeed: 
 
Figure 15. Vizor Facebook 360 experience (Vizor 2017) 
 
And as seen from the photo you can also use virtual reality to not only market real estate 
but also other spaces like museums and shops or even shopping malls with the 
technology Matterport and its competitors provide.  
 
4.3 Using virtual reality in event marketing 
Event marketing is one of the most powerful ways to showcase your product or service to 
the audience which are already interested in the industry you’re in. But event marketing 
also has another definition: it also means marketing an event you (or someone else) is or-
ganizing.  
 
According to survey by Bizzabo, 80% of marketers think that event marketing is critical for 
their organization's success (Endless 2018.) so companies need to do something differ-
 23 
 
ently to stand out of the crowd. One of the effective ways marketers have found is by us-
ing virtual reality to promote their products and services in completely unique way or pro-
moting events. 
 
4.3.1 Using virtual reality at trade shows  
Many companies have issues of displaying their products the proper way in the trade 
shows. If your product is something big it’s hard to bring it to trade show. I’ve seen hotel 
rooms being built for trade show purposes but with virtual reality you can let people to 
wonder around your new resort and see the all types of rooms and services your hotel has 
to offer. Marriot hotel chain has promoted their locations at various trade shows with vir-
tual reality since 2014.  
 
But not only travel industry can benefit from using virtual reality at trade shows: Lenovo 
promoted their Unified Workspace at Gartner Symposium trade show. Gartner Sympo-
sium is where hundreds of top CIOs and IT executives from US come to search for new IT 
solutions for their companies. The year before they got approximately 80 leads, so they 
wanted to try something different and instead demoing their solution they decided to cre-
ate an VR experience instead. They partnered with the company called Lucid Dream and 
according to their chief commercial officer Joshua Setzer “Virtual reality experiences tap 
into a different part of the brain that’s used for extended memory, so it increases the 
chance of success in future follow up” (Lenovo Software 2017.) when compared to the tra-
ditional fair show marketing. Together they created first-person shooter game and set up 
six VR-headset stations for the people to try. People were lining to try the VR and over the 
course of 4 days, around 360 executives tried the VR-experience. They used the head-
sets for 15 minutes on average and with the debriefing of the experience they managed to 
get 30 minutes of attention from the top-level executives. According to the company state-
ment to New York Times they managed to get three times more leads compared to the 
previous trade conferences (New York Times 2017.).  
 
Another good example of what you can do in trade shows is the idea which Henrik Helin’s 
company 360mediatalo got: They filmed street racing video in 360 and let their users to try 
how it feels like to be seated in a race car by building a race car frame and handing them 
VR headsets in which they could enjoy the race car video in VR. According to Henrik it 
was one of his favourite projects and got positive reactions from the crowd since the same 
video was also filmed in regular video format. 
 
 24 
 
Easiest way to benefit from virtual reality at the trade shows is to focus on good quality 
content that can be represented in multiple events and outsource the production and rent 
virtual reality headset-setup with instructors for the trade show. Cost of the high-quality 
production would be somewhere between 50 000 – 100 000 USD but the prices are com-
ing down and good content can be made with  budgets under 10 000 USD like VR movies 
“I am because of you” shows us (UploadVR 2017). Companies like Marriot have their own 
customized virtual reality setup called “Teleporter” which has ability to add other experi-
ences like wind on top of the virtual reality, so it feels even more realistic.  
 
Many companies are also developing their own applications for virtual reality experiences 
and it is becoming as one of the ways to market your product or services. If you are inter-
ested in developing an application for mobile/VR-headsets you should also add at least 10 
000 USD more for your budget in addition for the virtual reality production even though it 
can be made with cheaper budget, but the quality won’t be as good. These applications 
should be well promoted at trade shows and you could give your audience free branded 
VR-headsets (like Google Cardboard) so they could use your application also at home 
and even let their friends and family try it, so it is best to focus in VR-apps for mobile de-
vices. 
 
4.3.2 Marketing an event with virtual reality 
In the era of livestreaming and 5G-networks becoming reality rather than distant future it 
will be even more common to people use web communication instead of traveling and vir-
tual reality will give us possibility to be present around the world from our office or home. 
This will create whole new audience for the events and allows event organizers to sell the 
same seat hundreds or even thousands of times without fear that the event will be sold 
out.  
 
One of the first companies to organize event with the use of virtual reality was Chinese 
mobile device company called OnePlus which held their launch event for their new mobile 
phone in China but delivered free VR-headsets for limited number of fans and media and 
created free app for all the potential viewers to watch it in virtual reality. This was in 2015 
and technology has taken huge steps since and viewers had option to watch livestreamed 
360-videos with VR-headsets since April 2016 and Facebook introduced the same option 
in March 2017. There is also a lot of competition from big TV-companies and new compa-
nies for the rights to broadcasts events with 360-degree video/virtual reality and since 
more and more people are adapting to virtual reality we can see the competition just get-
ting even more fierce. But what does all of this mean to a marketer? 
 25 
 
 
Example A: Company X new model Y launch. Your company is luxury car manufacturer 
and you want to give your customers unique experiences with your cars. Why not create 
them one more unique experience with virtual reality: instead of spending hundreds of 
thousand dollars for various launch events you can invite them to watch the big launch 
event from their home/office or create local events with smaller budgets where the invited 
people could meet with each other and try virtual reality. They could see the live event in 
VR and virtually even drive the car before getting it delivered or available for a test drive. 
How? 
 
Luxury car makers use CRM and pay attention for customer service, so the local and in-
ternational sales personnel have good idea who to invite to this kind of event. They could 
send a package to their loyal customers with branded virtual reality headset and an invita-
tion letter with the instructions for the VR-headset. They can then choose if they wish to 
attend from home or go to a local event. At home, they could watch the event live or when 
they have time with mobile app and if they decided to go to a local event, there would be 
more powerful VR-headset where you can “test drive” the new car model. You will proba-
bly also get media exposure since even though the virtual reality is gaining popularity, it is 
still quite new and exotic technology and people are interested about it. This could be ap-
plied for not only for luxury cars manufacturers but many other luxury product manufactur-
ers in various industries. 
 
Example B: Event organizer X wants to market their event ABC and sell tickets for virtual 
seats. Event organizer X wants to increase the sales of tickets their upcoming event and 
start selling tickets for virtual seats and as a marketer it is your job to get it done. Good 
way to do this is to add VR-ready videos to YouTube and Facebook so people can experi-
ment the technology for free before paying for the seat and they can even get interested 
about buying actual ticket to the event. Another way is to have a mobile application for the 
event where people can watch rebroadcasts of the other events and buy tickets. But the 
bar to download an application is higher than watching video from your browser/existing 
app so the focus should be in there. VR-ready videos could include videos of other events 
and been filmed from the “best seats” available since virtual reality should bring something 
extra to the audience for them to use it. For example, one of the world’s leading business 
events, Nordic Business Forum is selling tickets for the virtual reality experience as part of 
their live stream service. Currently compatible with Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift and 
HTC Vive the prices start from 120 EUR + VAT compared to the traditional ticket which 
goes for 990 EUR + VAT (Nordic Business Forum 2018.) so it’s possible to make big sav-
ings by using the VR. As a marketer, it is important to understand how virtual reality will 
 26 
 
affect events. It will increase the sales of the events since the price for attendance will be 
significantly lower: for example, courtside seats for NBA game for 20 USD instead of 10 
000USD courtside tickets. Virtual reality will be also great way to gain media exposure for 
launch events. 
 
4.4 Virtual Reality advertising 
Using advertising for users who are using virtual reality headset is effective way to get 
your message sent to your audience. Since the person who is using virtual reality headset 
are fully immersed to the content they are seeing trough the VR-headset. People who 
have tried virtual reality know that when you are using the VR-headset it is almost impos-
sible to do other tasks than focus on the content since your view is blocked and you are 
listening the audio from the content. This means the user is less likely to have any distrac-
tions to perceive your message compared to the modern world where distractions are 
everywhere. Good example would be modern TV-ads since during the commercial break 
you can use your mobile phone, grab something to eat or go to the restroom. If person is 
using VR-headset, he or she needs to pause the content and take the headset off to do 
any of the things I mentioned above.  
 
Virtual reality advertising is still not widely used and one of the few platforms that has 
made it possible is YouTube. In July 2015 Google announced 360-degree video ads for 
YouTube by using the TrueView advertising platform. TrueView is Google’s platform for 
video advertising on YouTube. There are two types of TrueView ads: in-stream and video 
discovery. In-stream ads play during or before the video of one of the YouTube’s partners. 
Every viewer must watch at least five seconds of the ad and only after that they can skip 
the ad or continue watching it. You only must pay when viewer watched the ad for 30 sec-
onds (or till the end of the video if it’s shorter than 30 seconds) or clicks through on a card 
or some other elements added to the ad. Video discovery works quite differently since 
they will advertise your video on the YouTube’s search pages or together with other 
YouTube videos. It will be also showed to your target audience via Google Display Net-
work and you will pay each time the user clicks on your ad. The 360-degree ads work on 
both Android and Apple via YouTube-app and when using YouTube with Chrome-web 
browser.  
 
But how powerful can the 360-degree ads be? On their 360-degree ad release announce-
ment they gave some promising numbers: 
 
 
 27 
 
“…And for those videos that were run as ads, campaign results have been impressive: for 
instance, Coca-Cola’s 360 video celebrating the 100th anniversary of their iconic bottle 
design outperformed standard in-stream video ad view-through rates by 36%.” (Google 
Inside AdWords 2015.) 
 
Google also made a study with outdoor equipment manufacturer Columbia Sportswear 
where they made two advertising videos: one in traditional format and one by using 360-
degree video. They were focusing on classical metrics like view-through rates, viewer re-
tention and for the 360-degree video they also measured the interaction rate which 
measures the amount of people using the 360-degree video by moving their phones or 
mouse around to see the full 360-degree picture. The videos were unlisted on YouTube 
meaning that only way for the audience to see the videos was to watch the in-stream ad 
or by sharing the ad to others. The idea of the campaign was to get the audience to watch 
the full-length advertisement video instead of the shorter 60 second one. Instead of the 
promising results of the Coca Cola campaign this campaign underperformed when com-
pared to the traditional video when looking at the view-through rate. On the other hand, 
the 360-degree video had higher click-through rate. The interaction rate of the 360-degree 
video was also higher than its view-through rate meaning that the audience was interested 
in the new video features even though they didn’t finish watching the video. 360-degree 
ad also clearly outperformed traditional video ad on all the action metrics: views, shares 
and subscriptions. The full length 360-degree video also got 46% higher viewer count 
when compared to the traditional full-length ad and the 360-degree ad was also cheaper 
when they combined the organic and paid views together since the 360-degree ad was 
shared more. (Think with Google 2016b.) 
 
In June 2017 Google also announced their new project about showing online ads in virtual 
reality and they are currently testing it in their Area 120 workshop (used by Google to test 
out new ideas by their employees). They would show this in VR apps so that the app de-
velopers would have another source of income instead of only selling their apps. The ad 
would be a small branded box which could open a small screen which would open a video 
ad when clicked or stared long enough. The project is still a prototype-phase. (Google De-
velopers 2017.) 
 
Another player for VR-advertising is game engine company Unity which is a major player 
in virtual reality development. They have taken little bit different approach to the ads in 
VR. Instead of passively watching the ads the audience will have the chance to play with 
them in virtual reality. Called “Virtual Rooms” the audience can enter to the ad through 
“glowing door” and will enter totally different experience and can explore the ad from 30 to 
 28 
 
60 seconds, depending on the activity of the user. Currently they are testing the “Virtual 
Rooms” with the movie company Lionsgate to promote new film “Jigsaw”. They offer the 
experience in two channels: first one is the Samsung Internet VR (Internet browser for 
Gear VR) and the second is Spiraloid’s Nanite Fulcrum (VR graphic novel which is availa-
ble for both Gear VR and Oculus Rift).  
 
Third big company starting to use VR advertising is Hulu, an American subscription on de-
mand service which is owned by the big film companies like Walt Disney and 21st Century 
Fox amongst others. Hulu has taken a bit different approach to advertising compared to its 
competitors: they offer their advertisers to implement their ads to virtual reality series or 
focus on specific occasions like the premiers. They have two advertisers to sponsor their 
new VR-series “Door No. 1” and the users can choose how the story continues. Partnered 
with Nissan and dating-app Bumble, they will see these brands while watching the con-
tent. The VP of integrated marketing at, Hulu Nicole Sabatini says: “It’s a unique oppor-
tunity to reach a very specific type of audience – a more influential audience that is look-
ing to try the newest content experiences”.

5 Conclusions 
Virtual reality has the chance to really change the game when it comes to marketing. 
While social media and digital marketing are gaining more and more popularity, some 
companies are trying to come up with new ways to attract audience and virtual reality is 
one of the best ways to do it.  
 
This chapter will conclude all the important topics together and answers to the main ques-
tions of this research: how marketers can use virtual reality and what kind of technology is 
there for them to use.  
 
5.1 Virtual reality headsets 
Virtual reality headset market is controlled mainly by three big names: Oculus (owned by 
Facebook), HTC Vive and Google. Microsoft has also entered the VR headset market with 
their stationary “mixed reality” headsets which were produced by companies like Sam-
sung, Lenovo and Dell amongst other top tier computer manufacturers. One of the rea-
sons for the tech giants entering the market is not only to get a slice of the cake of the VR 
hardware sales but also gain more sales from their software stores like Windows store, 
Googles Daydream platform or Oculus store.  
 
The VR headsets can be currently divided in three different categories: mobile VR head-
sets, stationary VR headsets and standalone VR headsets. In the future there might be 
more categories like “mixed reality” headsets which combine both virtual and augmented 
reality together in one headset and that is what Microsoft is currently working on with their 
partners. 
 
Mobile VR is currently the most popular of the all three which can be seen from the Figure 
4 (VR Headset sales in 2016). The most popular mobile VR headset is Google Cardboard 
and products based after its design. The reason for it being so popular is its price point: 
you can buy it or its copy for less than 10 USD and giving them away as part of VR experi-
ence is one of the marketing tactiques used by some companies. The main use for 
Google Cardboard is for watching 360-degree videos or accessing some basic VR content 
since it doesn’t ship with controller so for example gaming is quite difficult. The second 
reason for that is that is doesn’t have designated app-store for virtual reality apps and 
games. The second most popular headset is Samsung Gear VR which is made by part-
nership with Oculus. The reason for it being so popular is because of the bundle deal 
Samsung offered worldwide: when buying new Samsung flagship phone (all S6/S7/S8 
 30 
 
and Note 8) you could also get free Samsung Gear VR package with headset and control-
ler. Compared to the Cardboard, Gear VR has much better building quality and it comes 
with remote and designated Oculus app-store for plenty VR experiences. It works only 
with new high-end Samsung phones. Third popular mobile VR headset is Googles Day-
dream. It is Googles response for Samsung Gear VR and offers good building quality and 
ships with a controller. The main difference to Gear VR is that Daydream uses Google’s 
own Daydream app store and works with multiple phones, not only Samsung.  
 
For the stationary VR headsets, the market leader is currently PlayStation. Compared to 
its main competitors Vive and Rift it wins its market share by low price point and by the 
fact that you don’t need to upgrade your PC, you can just plug the VR headset into your 
PlayStation 4 and you are ready to go. The fact that they have a lot of exclusive games 
and that the gamers are more likely to try new technology has also helped them to boost 
their sales. The second and third are HTC Vive and Oculus Rift which were released in 
2016. Compared to the PlayStation VR, for using HTC Vive or Oculus Rift you need high 
end PC which can run VR apps and games but also offer slightly better performance over 
PS VR.  One of their main differences are the app stores: HTC Vive uses Viveport and 
Steam and Oculus on the other hand also has partnered with Steam and offers their own 
Oculus store for the users of their Oculus Rift. Newcomer for the stationary VR market 
was Microsoft and its partners. Again, the main difference is the app store since Microsoft 
offers their apps through their Microsoft Store. But Microsoft is focusing the development 
of their VR headsets towards creating mixed reality experiences in the future. Also, Mi-
crosoft’s headsets don’t require external sensors for tracking movement compared to Rift 
and Vive. 
 
According to the interview with Olli Sinerma the future of the virtual reality lies in 
standalone VR and the year 2018 is the year when many of the headset manufacturers 
are launching their first standalone headsets. Compared to the stationary VR headsets the 
main difference is that you don’t need to have powerful PC anymore and you get rid of all 
the wires you needed to plug to your headset from your PC to power it. The most im-
portant standalone headsets are the Vive Focus VR and Lenovo Mirage Solo since they 
are the first standalone headsets to offer six degrees of freedom movement. Again, the 
main difference are the app stores since Vive works with their own Viveport and Steam 
and Lenovo uses Googles Daydream store. Third important standalone headset is Oculus 
Go which will not have six degrees of freedom movement tracking and has lower tier 
specs but is going to be lot cheaper with the price of 199 USD.

5.2 How to apply virtual reality to your marketing  
Using virtual reality as part of your marketing portfolio is not an easy task since it takes a 
lot of effort, time and money. But the rewards are also high since according to the 
Googles research Coca-Cola got 36% better view through rates when they ran their ads in 
360-degree format compared to the traditional video ad. There are also a lot of other stud-
ies backing that virtual reality can be important piece of marketing like the Lenovo case in 
which they let the top level executives to try VR themselves at a trade show and Lenovo 
got three times more leads and more one-on-one time with the persons trying the VR. 
 
One of the industries which could benefit most from using virtual reality is the travel indus-
try. Important part of marketing in travel industry is the visual content: people who 
watched a video ad about the city were 23 times more likely to book a stay in that city. An-
other study by TripAdvisor shows that 73% of travellers use photos to make booking deci-
sions. This research was based on normal photos in 2013 when the photos were not so 
common but now this could be considered as extra engagement if the hotel would have 
360-degree photos or videos posted on their TripAdvisor-page or website. For marketing 
travel locations with VR is the cooperation: showcasing multiple businesses and attrac-
tions on one video or VR experience makes more interesting content but also allows 
smaller businesses to participate by the possibility of splitting the costs since VR experi-
ences are quite expensive and high-quality productions can cost anything between 50 to 
100 000 USD. For accommodation marketing virtual reality can be extremely powerful 
since it allows you to showcase the whole room in one photo and 3D tours of hotels are 
getting more popular and many of the biggest players are already starting to realize the 
power of VR by launching their 360-degree or full VR experiences. The biggest names in 
hotel industry like Airbnb, Best Western, Hilton and Marriot are already using virtual reality 
as part of their marketing. Also, the travel agencies can use virtual reality and good exam-
ple of that is one of the biggest leisure travel agencies, Thomas Cook. They added VR 
headsets to their flagship stores and let their customers “travel” to their locations around 
the world. This resulted 40% ROI and they also got media exposure from big media 
houses. Another way for agencies is to create their own app like Finnish leisure travel 
agency Aurinkomatkat did: they created VR app for smartphones which allows you to 
“travel” to some of their locations and marketed it at the biggest travel fair in Finland by 
handing out branded Google Cardboard headsets if person downloaded the app. 
 
Virtual reality is not only good for showcasing hotels but also other properties and spaces. 
Since VR gives new perspective of the property to the user, it is already being used by 
many of the top real estate companies in US. Virtual reality allows users to experience the 
 32 
 
properties like they never had before and opens other possibilities for the seller: property 
tours can be now accessed virtually 24/7 and anywhere around the world with just a 
smartphone and internet connection. Real estate developers can also create accurate 3D-
models for VR and by that customer gets even more accurate view of how the property 
will look when its ready. Their customers can even change how the interior looks by de-
signing the interior by themselves with designated VR-app. This makes it easier for the 
developers to sell future projects to the investors and potential buyers and gain revenue 
even before the building process starts. Company Matterport has come up with 3D cam-
era which takes high quality 360-degree photos and transforms them into a virtual tour. 
What makes the camera and its app so special is that it also can make accurate 3D-model 
of the space and these tours can be also made into a VR-experience without any postpro-
cessing through their app. Matterport’s CoreVR app also hosts biggest “VR-library” of real 
world places with over 250 000 VR-spaces listed. Matterport is working with Finnish VR-
company Vizor and they are trying to embed virtual tours to Facebook so you could ac-
cess the tour without even leaving your Facebook newsfeed. 
 
Around 80% of marketers think that event marketing is crucial for their business, so it is 
important to attract attention in new ways. Virtual reality can be one of those tools as 
Lenovo has noticed: at Gartner Symposium trade show they managed to get three times 
more leads compared to the previous year by using virtual reality. To gain this kind of re-
sult marketers need to rent or buy VR headsets and buy VR production from a company 
which provides VR content and present it to the crowd. Another way to shine at trade 
shows is to make an VR app and promote it during the trade show and handing branded 
VR headsets like Google Cardboard to the people who download the app. For event mar-
keting virtual reality is extremely valuable: if your audience has a smartphone with fast in-
ternet connection and VR headset they can access your event from all around the world if 
you just invite them. One of the first companies to do so was Chinese mobile device com-
pany OnePlus which livestreamed their product launch in VR on YouTube. Before the 
stream they sent Google Cardboards to the limited number of registered persons around 
the world, so they could watch it in VR. This kind of marketing tactics could be imple-
mented for launch events or even educational type of events. One of the biggest business 
conferences in Europe, Nordic Business Forum, is already selling tickets to the live stream 
which can be also accessed with Virtual Reality headsets for more immersive experience. 
You can also buy tickets to watch NBA games from the front row seats along many other 
sports events so there is huge potential for virtual reality event streaming, especially when 
the 5G networks start working and offer us faster network speeds. 
 
The advertising business is searching new platforms and VR future potential is looking 
 33 
 
quite promising. What makes virtual reality advertising so interesting is that the user is im-
mersed to the content and can’t really be distracted from the advert and makes adverts 
more impactful compared to traditional adverts. YouTube was the first big social media 
platform to launch 360-degree videos as part of their media library in 2015 and companies 
like Coca-Cola and Columbia have used 360-degree video advertising with good results 
like +36% increase of view-through rates. In June 2017 Google announced their new pro-
ject for advertising in VR platform. The main objective for showing ads in VR is to give de-
velopers another source of revenue and by that making Google’s VR platforms more at-
tractive for the developers. The project is currently on prototype-phase, but the ads would 
be shown as small branded boxes and when stared or clicked the box would open video 
ad. But Google is not the only company interested in VR advertising: Game engine com-
pany Unity is also big name in VR development and they have come up with their own so-
lution for VR ads. “Virtual Rooms” is different approach from the Google since instead of 
showing a branded box the user is shown a “glowing door” and if they decide to interact 
with it they are taken to completely different experience (which is the ad). Unity is currently 
working with companies like movie company Lionsgate and Samsung for testing the ads. 
Third name in the VR advertising is the US-based streaming company Hulu. They have 
their own VR-series where the user chooses how the story goes further. The series is 
sponsored by Nissan and dating app Bumble and they get their brands shown to very spe-
cific crowd since the VR users can be considered as early adaptors for new technologies.

6 The future of virtual reality 
Virtual reality has overcome its hype-phase and according to the Gartner hype cycle for 
emerging technologies it is already on its way to become mainstream product.  
 
Figure 16. Gartner Top Trends in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 
2017 (Gartner 2017.) 
 
According to the Gartner it should take 2 to 5 years for virtual reality to gain its so-called 
“plateau of productivity”. According to the Gartner the term “plateau of productivity” means 
“Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more 
clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly pay-
ing off”. (Gartner 2018.) 
 
The next big steps for the virtual reality to gain more and more popularity is the develop-
ment of the quality and ease-of-use. In the interview with Henrik Helin he mentions that 
the biggest obstacle for mass adaption of VR is the lack of the VR headsets. (Helin 
17.11.2017.) 
 
The biggest players on the market have already launched their first editions of wireless 
headsets but some of them are still not as powerful as their wired competitors. That will 
 35 
 
change in the future and according to FIVR Chairman Olli Sinerma the wireless versions 
will totally replace wired ones quite soon.  
 
Second problem lies with the image quality: there just are not enough pixels in the 
screens. The quality is already good but for the human eye to see the footage in real-life 
quality you would need a screen which provides over 2000 pixels per inch (PPI) per eye 
(Wired 2017.). For comparison, Oculus Rift provides you with screen of 441 PPI per eye 
and HTC Vive with 447 PPI per eye. Finnish company Varjo is tackling this issue with their 
own VR-headset which should be able to provide astonishing 3000 PPI per eye. They are 
still in early development phase but as you can see from the photo the results are aston-
ishing when compared to VR-headsets like HTC VIVE or Oculus Rift:  
 
 
Figure 17. Varjo Bionic display comparison images 2018 (Varjo 2018) 
 
On the top photo you can clearly see all the buttons and texts compare to the current flag-
ships. This is especially important when it comes to professional usage of the virtual real-
ity: in the example they have provided you with view of the cockpit, but this can be imple-
mented to various fields of training which benefit from the humanlike PPI. This kind of 
 36 
 
technology comes also with a hefty price tag: According to Varjo CMO the price of the 
headset will be between 5 000 to 10 000 USD and they are focusing on the enterprise 
market (RoadtoVR 2018b). There definitely is some interest for a VR-headset with high 
PPI since company announced some of their development partners which contained com-
panies like 20th Century Fox, Airbus and Volkswagen among others. They have also part-
nered with both AMD and NVIDIA on the hardware side (AnandTech 2017). If the com-
pany is successful with their product and can start large-scale manufacturing of the head-
sets we will probably see the increase of PPI in consumer devices as well. There has 
been also some news about other VR-headsets coming to compete with Varjo but so far 
there have only been some rumours. 
 
Other solution for the better image quality lies in eye-tracking. Companies like Google, Ap-
ple and Oculus (owned by Facebook) have bought their own eye tracking companies and 
one of the reasons might be adding the eye tracking software to our household electronics 
and to virtual reality headsets, too. Swedish company Tobii one is the leading eye tracking 
development companies and is now working on implementing eye tracking to virtual reality 
headsets. Company has already showcased their skills with eye tracking by adding sup-
port for eye tracking in Windows 10. Now the company is working with together with Qual-
comm and adding eye tracking to Qualcomm’s next standalone VR-headset. (Wired 
2018.) 
 
One of the reasons of eye-tracking being so important is the technology called “foveated 
rendering” which according to VRFocus is: “Foveated rendering is a technique that tracks 
where the user is looking and only renders the area they are looking directly at in full de-
tail, with everything else being blurred. This has been mostly aimed at reducing the 
amount of system resources needed to create VR worlds in realistic detail, but also has 
potential elsewhere”. (VRFocus 2017.) 
 37 
 
 
 
Figure 18. Foveal Rendering explanation (VRFocus 2017) 
 
 According to Tobii foveated rendering also increases the battery life amongst other 
things: “By understanding where you are looking, HMDs can direct high-definition graphics 
processing power to that exact spot in real time. This enables higher definition displays, 
more efficient devices, longer battery life, or increased mobility”. (Tobii 2018.) Foveated 
rendering does not only improve the image quality but also makes the lower spec devices 
able to run virtual reality content. According to the demo shown to Engadget foveated 
rendering was able to improve the framerate on low tier PC from 45 frames per second 
(FPS) to 90FPS. (Engadget 2017.) 
 
Another important aspect of eye tracking is the interaction in virtual reality. The interfaces 
are mostly gaze or controller-based and for interaction you need to look to right direction, 
gaze or use your controller to point it and then choose the action. Eye tracking combines 
the first two phases together which makes interactions slightly faster and easier.  
 
For the marketers the most interesting detail about eye tracking is its possibilities for 
collecting data & analytics. Eye tracking would give developers important data about 
possible improvements, but tracking could be also used as marketing research tool. 
Marketers would have the possibility to test out many of their products before the release 
in virtual reality environment and get data on what draws people’s attention, and which 
details they are focusing into. People might not even remember that their gazes are being 
tracked so the results would be more realistic compared to the cases where the test 
 38 
 
subject would be handed a pair of eye tracking glasses and they might not act as natural.  
 
The biggest concern for eye tracking and its analytics will be privacy issues. According to 
the Tobii’s president of consumer business unit, Oscar Werner, privacy is their priority. 
The only info they share with developers is the gaze direction. “We do not allow 
applications to store or transfer eye-tracking data or aggregate over multiple users. It's not 
storable, and it doesn't leave the device"" Werner says (Wired 2018) .Tobii is also working 
with researchers and allows them to gather analytical data but to do so they must ask for 
the users’ permission. 
 
Also the forecasts for VR, MR (Mixed reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) headset sales 
looks quite promising which can be seen from the figure below: 
 
 
Figure 19. Shipment of VR and AR devices by category, 2016-2021 (Capacitymedia 2017) 
 
According to analyst company CCS Insight we will see big increase of the shipments VR 
and AR headsets in the future and the largest part for it goes for the mobile VR and AR. It 
is also interesting to see that the dedicated VR (meaning PC connected and standalone 
headsets) will also start to gain more popularity in the future (Capacitymedia 2017). The 
popularity of the mobile VR and AR can be explained by the fact that there are above 2 
billion smartphone users (Statista 2016b.) and most of them can access to VR/AR by just 
downloading application instead of buying expensive standalone headsets or top tier 
PC’s. When the technology will get cheaper more people will adapt and that is also one of 
the reasons that the dedicated VR will gain more popularity since the headsets will be 
cheaper in the future.

Abstract 
 This project investigates the development of a series of experimental, tangible, electronic textile 
(e-textile) interfaces to virtual reality (VR), using the approach of human-computer interaction (HCI). The e-
textile interface is an unconventional controller that manipulates objects (3D visual asset) within virtual 
reality. This research has been framed within the context of HCI using a framework of Tangible User 
Interfaces (Ulmer and Ishii 2000).  
 
Through this research I explore how human touch relates to tangible objects and passive haptics. I also 
explore the overlap between visual experience and virtual reality by employing the theory of Haptic-Visual 
overlap (Fitzmaurice 1998), which deals with 3D volumetric perception of a physical object as well as the 
idea of Active Touch (Gibson 1962, Lederman and Klatzky 2009, Visell et al. 2016).  
 
Using the aforementioned theoretical frameworks and employing research through design methodology, I 
prototyped a series of explorative e-textile interfaces and virtual reality digital counterparts.

1. Introduction 
This research project investigates the development of an experimental, tangible, electronic textile (e-
textile) interface for virtual reality (VR), using a human-computer interaction (HCI) approach. The e-textile 
interface developed in this thesis is an unconventional controller for a 3D visual asset that is composed of 
a real world physical haptic interface that is rendered within virtual reality. The e-textile interfaces have 
been created in two methods. One method embeds sensors in textiles while the other method involves 
sensors created from conductive and resistive textile materials and fabrics. The sensors capture participant 
data as they explore the tangibility of the electronic textile interface. The data generated by the sensors is 
modifies the 3D visual asset within the virtual reality space.  The central goal of this thesis is to explore the 
relationship between tangible objects in the physical world and their corresponding digital representation 
in virtual reality.  
Humans have an age-old relationship with fabrics based on their use in garments, which can be 
metaphorically understood as a second skin because they are so deeply integrated in daily life. Our 
interaction with fabric is incredibly intuitive. In this thesis, e-textiles are considered as ‘interfaces’, 
particularly in the sense that their unique materiality provides a set of affordances that we can explore and 
interact with intuitively. Such affordances have been used to develop a soft and deformable tactile interface 
for a virtual reality experience.  
The physical interaction between the e-textile interfaces and digital objects in virtual reality (i.e. VR assets) 
has been designed using the following theoretical frameworks: Tangible User Interfaces by Umber and Ishii 
(2000), Theory of Active Touch (Gibson 1962, Visell et al. 2016), and the Theory of Haptic Visual overlap by 
Fitzmaurice (1998). These theoretical frameworks are discussed in Chapter 2 and refined using the design 
methodology of Research through Design as discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. 
2 
 
 
Fig.1 Theoretical Framework for this research 
 
The application of this methodology helped create 3D visual assets in virtual reality and also helped develop 
the e-textile interface by gathering feedback and the practice of iterative design. Throughout the design 
process, I intended to develop and create intuitive connections and interactions between the physical and 
the virtual environments.  
 
Feedback received during the Research through Design phase of this study, was used to develop an 
interactive and exploratory exhibition piece where users could bridge the gap between the physical and 
virtual worlds. The Theory of Active Touch (Chapter 2.2) emphasizes the use of textural affordances as a 
powerful factor in the development of interfaces for virtual worlds. This theory states that the active 
exploration of materials (i.e. e-textile interfaces) tends to guide the observer’s attention to properties of 
the virtual environment and the corresponding virtual assets found within it. The Theory of Haptic-Visual 
Overlap, discussed in Chapter 2.3, describes how 3D tangible interfaces in virtual reality compensate for 
the lack of depth perception while at the same time improving interaction within these spaces. The sense 
of touch, also referred to as haptics, is known to positively impact task performance within these virtual 
reality environments. This phenomenon has been reviewed in scientific journals concerned with how the 
human brain integrates tactile and visual information through 3D volumetric perception (Bouguila, Ishii, 
Sato 2001) and also by research in the field of haptic integration in virtual reality systems (Insko 2001). 
3 
 
1.1. Background and context of the problem  
Currently, virtual reality is predominately accessed through mainstream commercial plastic controllers that 
provide force feedback (i.e., mechanically generated vibrations from a motor) meant to enhance haptic 
integration. Force feedback is mainly used during the manipulation of 3D virtual visual assets. For example, 
when a participant grasps an object and changes the position or orientation of an object in virtual reality, 
they use a handheld plastic controller. These controllers can be made to point at 3D virtual assets in order 
to manipulate them with the help of virtual- and controller-based affordances that lead to specific 
interactions in the virtual world. In this kind of an interaction, the participant has no sense of physically 
grasping the virtual asset as they are interacting with an abstracted plastic controller. This leads to a lack of 
meaningful and intuitive haptic sensory integration within virtual reality spaces. 
Textiles are materials that we haptically experience every day, both within our environment and on our 
bodies and Due to their widespread and daily use, we interface with them intuitively. Textile materials are 
often stretchable and provide some unique manipulations, that when combined with electronics, can create 
soft and flexible computationally enhanced entities. The interfaces in this thesis are created using e-textiles 
and, unlike standard electronics, are not built on rigid plastic structures like conventional controllers for 
virtual reality.  
A computing interface is the means of communication between the computer and the user. This is normally 
a peripheral device such as monitor or a keyboard. An interface is a shared boundary across which two 
or more separate components of computer system that exchange information. (Blaauw and Brooks 
1997) This project uses e-textiles as an expressive haptic inclusion method to virtual reality. By using 
deformable materials I hope to enhance the relationship between physical interaction and the 3D virtual 
visual asset.  
 
4 
 
1.2. Purpose of the Thesis Research  
Currently virtual reality spaces suffer from a lack of diversity in tactile and haptic interactions. Physical 
interactions in these spaces are mainly through hand held plastic controllers, which feature buttons and 
force feedback cues (i.e. vibration). This project attempts to establish a connection between the user and 
the virtual space through haptic interference by the addition of soft touch based interfaces that act as 
controllers to virtual objects (3D visual assets) in virtual reality. 
 
This project attempts to bring the framework and theories from Tangible User Interfaces, Active Touch, and 
the Haptic-Visual overlap into the domain of e-textile interface design and the design of their corresponding 
3D visual assets for virtual reality. This is done by applying the considerations set by these theories in 
creating explorative e-textiles with designed affordances and tangible qualities, which can act as an 
interface for interacting with 3D visual virtual assets through touch. Sense integration through touch is a 
means of non-verbal communication within this medium (Fitzmaurice 1998). Textiles have a propensity to 
be texturized, are legible to human touch, and encourage active touch (Gibson 1962, Visell et al. 2016), and 
this project takes advantage of these attributes in order to explore and demonstrate new methods for 
developing tangible interfaces for virtual reality experiences. 
 
The prototypes created in this project are composed of various tangible e-textile objects that have different 
stiffness or flexibility and can be physically deformed by hand. The final outcome of this project is a table 
upon which these physical objects are placed. When participants manually interact with the objects on the 
table, there is a corresponding manipulation of 3D assets in virtual reality. In this exploration, the material’s 
stiffness or flexibility is correlated to the visually represented 3D virtual assets. Their deformation in virtual 
space is designed to correspond with the characteristics of their associated physical materials (Ullmer and 
5 
 
Ishii, 2000).  Through this relationship, embodiment, and coupling of the physical interface to the virtual 
asset, it is possible to explore the virtual assets through their physical counterparts. 
 
1.3. Rationale 
Within virtual reality worlds, there is a need to create a more complete and cohesive virtual reality 
experience. Research trends suggest that haptic integration is imperative for continuous presence being 
maintained by participants in virtual reality spaces (Ramsamy et al, 2006). The sense of presence is often 
broken or lost when the participant reaches their hand out for a 3D virtual visual object and instead of being 
able to feel it, they see their simulated hand pass through the virtual asset. Various research interests point 
towards integrating haptics in virtual worlds to make the experience more convincing. Insko (2001) 
concludes that “Passive haptics, augmenting a high-fidelity virtual reality environment with low-fidelity 
physical objects, will markedly improve both sense of presence and spatial knowledge”. In this project, the 
physical and virtual objects overlap perceptually, creating a continuous sense of integration between the 
physical and virtual spaces. Oculus Rift researcher Michael Abrash (2016) suggests “The difference in the 
right combination of stimulus at the right time makes, deeply convincing experiences in virtual reality”.  
 
1.4. Scope and Limitations 
This thesis is framed within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research and the framework of Tangible 
User Interfaces (TUI). The tangible interfaces are constructed out of electronic textiles (e-textiles) that 
promote manual interaction with the hands.  These interfaces have been specifically designed to control 
and manipulate 3D visual assets within virtual reality. This thesis examines the relationship between active 
manipulation of physical objects/artifacts/interfaces and is viewed through the theory of Active Touch 
(Gibson 1962, Visell et al. 2016). Further, the theory of Haptic-Visual Overlap has been studied to better 
understand the relationship between haptic and 3D visual asset associations in virtual reality. The use of

virtual reality within this project is limited to using this technology as a screen that renders 3D visual assets 
and allows digital interaction with these assets. The haptic interactions with objects/artifacts/interfaces 
that I have developed complement and enhance the 3D visual experience as simulated through a virtual 
reality headset.   
My prototypes are created from e-textiles primarily and composed of DIY textile sensors. These sensors are 
not standardized and cannot be replicated, and thus are fine-tuned to each interface. In addition, the 
Framework of Tangible User Interfaces (Ullmer and Ishii, 2000) couples the physical interface to its 
intangible digital counterpart through the ideas of embodiment and representation. Each e-textile interface 
has been designed and custom built for their corresponding virtual reality experience. 
 
1.5. Research Questions 
1. How might the physical affordances of textiles be used as part of a tangible user interface for a 
virtual reality experience? 
2. How can the conductive and resistive properties of electronic textiles be used to detect different 
 kinds of touch? 
3. How can 3D visual assets in virtual reality respond to changing conditions of objects in the physical
 world?

2. Theoretical background and Framework  
This project brings together the framework of Tangible User Interfaces, the theory of Active Touch and the 
theory of Haptic Visual Overlap into the domain of e-textile interface design and the design of 3D visual 
asset in virtual reality. By exploring these theoretical frameworks, I developed explorative, electronic, 
textiles that not only represent and control assets within virtual reality space, but also address and 
ameliorate the lack of a sense of touch (i.e. haptics) in a virtual reality environment.  
The framework for Tangible User Interfaces has allowed me to critically analyze the design process through 
the framing of a series of intertwined questions that are based on the relationship of the physical e-textile 
interface with the 3D virtual asset in virtual reality, I also utilized these lenses in my prototype development. 
These questions primarily address how the e-textile interface controls and represents the embodied 
characteristics of its digital counterpart. They also relate to the issues of how active touch promotes the 
use of affordances in the textile material, and how the haptic visual overlap enhances the virtual reality 
experiences. 
 
2.1 Tangible User Interface (TUI) 
HCI researcher Alan Dix (2009) describes his field as “the study of how computer technology influences 
human work activities.” The term computer technology includes most technology such as PCs, mobile 
phones, laptops, household appliances, in-car navigation systems and even various other systems that have 
embedded sensors and actuators. HCI has an associated design discipline referred to as interaction design 
that is involved with how computer technology can be designed to create ease of use for people. The key 
aspect of the interaction design discipline is the notion of “usability”, which is often defined as efficiency, 
effectiveness, and satisfaction. HCI is both an academic discipline studying the way technology impacts 
8 
 
human activity and a design discipline aimed at designing technology for maximum usability, effectiveness, 
and satisfaction (Dix 2009). 
For more than forty years people have relied primarily on screen-based text and graphics to interact with 
computers. In the nineties, there was a movement of incorporating physical objects and artifacts within 
virtual spaces. One example of this was the early works of Wellner (1993), a final-year PhD candidate at the 
University of Cambridge Computer Lab who worked as a research scientist at Xerox of EuroPARC on 
interacting with paper objects on a Digital Desk. Similar trends have been seen in the explorative work of 
Durrell Bishop, a student at the Royal College of Arts, who designed a prototype telephone answering 
machine that incorporated everyday objects that were augmented with computation, in order to make 
digital information graspable (Crampton, 1995). 
Ullmer and Ishii (2000) stated that “The last decade has seen a wave of new research into ways to link the 
physical and digital worlds”, and a similar line of thought has been pursued at the Key Centre of Design 
Computing and Cognition at the University of Sydney, where researchers are developing tabletop systems 
that combine Augmented Reality and Tangible Interfaces (Kim and Maher 2008). Furthermore, this 
approach is reflected in the established practices of the “MIT Tangible Media Group” headed by Hiroshi 
Ishii through their work on tangible interfaces. The area of Tangible User Interfaces involves physical 
interaction, virtual environments, and computation as part of the physical world. The word “tangible” is 
derived from the Latin “tangibilis” and “tangere” which means “to touch.” 
 
2.1.1 Key characteristics of Tangible User Interface (TUI) 
Human beings have skills for sensing and manipulating their physical environment, but these skills are not 
being employed in interaction with the digital world today. The framework of Tangible User Interfaces 
builds upon these human-based skills and applies HCI approaches that incorporate physical objects and 
artifacts with computational abilities within virtual spaces. The relationship between the two is that the 
digital representation embodies the characteristics of the physical representation. The coupling of physical 
9 
 
objects/artifacts/interfaces and their 3D virtual counterpart in virtual space allows the participant to use 
their skill set (i.e. interacting with objects in the physical world) to access virtual objects. Ishii and Ullmer 
(1997) describe this as the “seamless extension of the physical affordance of the object into the digital 
domain.” 
 
In a comparison between the traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) model (i.e., computer screen and 
mouse) and the Tangible User Interface (TUI) model, Ullmer and Ishii (2000) note that the TUI model 
incorporates the GUI model, but it splits the output of the GUI into Physical Representation (rep-p) and 
Digital Representation (rep-d). In this model, the digital representation “control and physical 
representation” (tangible interface) embody or takes on the characteristic of the “digital representation” 
(rep-d). 
 
 
Fig.2 GUI and TUI. Comparison of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) (left) and Tangible User Interfaces 
(TUI) (right) interaction models (Ullmer and Ishii 2000). 
 
Three key characteristics of the framework for Tangible User Interfaces, outlined by Ullmer and Ishii (2000), 
are presented below as direct quotes from their research: 
 
1) “Physical representations (rep-p) are computationally coupled to underlying digital information 
 (model). The central characteristic of tangible interfaces lies in the coupling of physical 
 representations to underlying digital information and computational models.”  
10 
 
The first key characteristic discusses the computational model in relationship to the physical representation 
(rep-p). The model would use a Unity 3D asset simulator or algorithm to create the required simulation real-
time. The computational model also considers the x, y, z location, displacement, and manipulation data 
from the e-textile’s sensor output. These two aspects, namely the real-time simulator along with sensor 
data, are coupled. This has been further discussed with respect to the prototypes in Chapter 6. 
 
2) “Physical representations embody mechanisms for interactive control. The physical 
 representations of the tangible interface also function as interactive physical controls. The physical 
 movement and rotation of these artifacts, their insertion or attachment to each other, and other 
 manipulations of these physical representations serve as tangible interface’s primary means for 
 control.”  
 
The second key characteristic discusses control mechanism within the system, where it can be said that the 
physical representation (rep-p) acts as the control for the digital counterparts (rep-d). The e-textiles have 
sensors in them and the data received from the sensors during interaction is used to manipulate and control 
3D visual assets in virtual reality. The prototypes described in Chapter 6. act as controls for their digital 
counterpart. 
 
3) “Physical representations are perceptually coupled to actively mediate digital representations 
 (rep-d). Tangible interfaces rely upon a balance between physical and digital representations. 
 While embodied physical elements play a central, defining role in the representation and control 
 of tangible interfaces, digital representations - especially, graphics and audio - often present much 
 of the dynamic information processed by the underlying computational system.”  
 
11 
 
The third of the three key characteristics is the quality of the e-textile interface is perpetually coupled to 
the qualities of the 3D visual asset in virtual reality. The e-textile physical interface is designed to exploit 
the affordances provided by the textile materials (e.g., stretching, pushing, and deforming the physical 
interface). The 3D virtual asset responds to the changes made to the e-textile interface. Various prototypes 
in Chapter 6. illustrate this. 
 
Where the above three characteristics refer directly to their model, a fourth characteristic of tangible 
interfaces is also significant. 
 
4) “The physical state of interface artifacts partially embodies the digital state of the system.”  
 
Prototypes discussed in Chapter 6. demonstrate the coupling of physical objects/artifacts (i.e. e-textile 
interface) with 3D virtual visual assets that are fluid-like in character (i.e. water, air and semi-solids). The 
stretchable, deformable nature of fabrics allows them to represent fluid-like virtual entities. This 
characteristic will be further described in relation to the prototypes, which are discussed in Chapter 6. 
Embodied entity refers to a physical or virtual entity, that represents an idea, quality, characteristics or 
feeling. In the prototype Boomerang (see Chapter 6) the quality of “stiffness” is embodied in the physical 
object as well as the virtual entities (i.e. 3D virtual object). 
 
 
 
Fig.3   Three key characteristics for ‘Tangible User Interfaces’. Noted above through Ullmer and Ishii 
paper Emerging frameworks for tangible user interfaces (Ullmer and Ishii 2000). 
12 
 
2.1.2 Distinguishing physical properties of Tangible Artifacts  
Tangible user interfaces are systems that use physical artifacts as representations of, and controls for, their 
intangible digital. The physical artifacts at the center of tangible interfaces, the tangibles/artifacts/objects, 
have four distinguishing physical properties as outlined in Ullmer and Ishii (2000) 
 
1) Physically embodied “The broadest property and criteria of tangible interfaces is that digital 
 information or functionality is somehow embodied in physical form.” 
2) Physically representational “The specific physical form of these physical artifacts can vary widely. 
 On the one hand, they can be literally or ironically representational, alternatively, these artifacts 
 can be symbolically representational, bearing no material resemblance to the digital associations 
 for which they stand.” 
3) Physically manipulability “An important aspect of physical manipulability is that Tangible User 
Interfaces artifacts are generally graspable.” This property has been prominently highlighted by 
the PhD. Thesis of Fitzmaurice (1996). This means that objects can be taken within the hand, and 
physically manipulated with the hand and fingers.” 
4) Spatially reconfigurable “In contrast, the spatial reconfiguration of physical elements - their 
 physical  placement and removal, translation and rotation - is the central mode of interaction with 
 tangible  interfaces. While these compositional elements often will be mechanically constrained, 
 their spatially reconfigurable state will take on special significance.” 
 
The framework of Tangible User Interfaces is well represented through project “Urp” (Fig.4), a TUI made 
for urban planners and architects where physical building models are used to control digital data 
visualizations of air flow (represented by the dots), digital shadows, and mirror glare. As the building models 
are physically shifted by hand, there is a corresponding change in the digital representations. In this system, 
rep-p is the physical position (x, y), dimensions, and materials of the building, while rep-d is the graphically 
13 
 
created shadow, glare, and wind direction. It can be said that the digital representation embodies the 
characteristics of the physical representation (building models), because the building dimension and 
position (i.e. real time physical character) directly affect the wind flow in its surrounding area. Therefore, it 
can be said that the wind flow (i.e. rep-d in real-time) embodies the characteristics of the building (position 
xy, dimensions real-time). The same can be said for the digital shadows, because when the building models 
are physically moved and rotated, their corresponding shadows transform accordingly. Hence, the digital 
shadows embody the character of the physical building model. 
 
 
Fig.4   Urban Planning Simulation. “Urp” urban planning simulation, with physical building models and 
wind tool and probe. (Tangible Media Group, MIT Media Lab 1999) 
 
The computational model for the real-time air flow simulation uses the motion of fluids equation. The 
computational model also considers the xy locations and dimensions (length and width) of the building. 
These two aspects, the motion of fluids equation and the building specifications, are coupled, 
demonstrating the first of the three key characteristics of the framework mentioned above (see Chapter 
2.1.1). 
This project aims explores a fluid human-computer interaction between a physical fabric interface that acts 
as both a controller and the digital representation (i.e. rep-d), 3D visual virtual asset, experienced through 
virtual reality. The various prototypes explored have been designed using the framework of Tangible User 
14 
 
Interfaces and will be discussed in Chapter 6. Ahead, the theory of Active Touch and the theory of Haptic 
Visual overlap are also discussed.  
2.2 Active Touch  
In his seminal 1962 paper Observations on Active Touch, J. J. Gibson emphasized that being passively 
touched tends to focus the participant’s attention on their subjective bodily sensations, whereas the active 
exploration of affordances tends to guide the participant’s attention to properties of the external 
environment (Lederman and Klatzky 2009). The term “affordance” (Gibson 1966) refers to actions that are 
made physically possible by the properties of an object or an environment. Gibson (1962) states that “Active 
touch refers to what is ordinarily called touching which is different from being touched.” This is an 
important phenomenon when creating passive haptic interfaces for virtual reality since Active touch is 
“exploratory” instead of “performatory” (Gibson 1962). 
 
Gibson’s work is considered a central pillar within the theory of Active Touch. Currently this field is pursued 
in robotics, where active touch refers to the idea of interpreting touch-instigated signals that are captured 
by sensors (i.e. sensing mechanism in the robotic skin) whose motion is deliberately controlled to facilitate 
information gain (i.e. active exploration of object/artifact/interface using robotic hand ). Visell et al (2016) 
state that the term “active” “is applied to the role of motor behavior in eliciting or shaping sensory signals, 
at least when the movement is intended to capture information via touch.”  
The e-textile interfaces created during this project are intended to exploit the inherent affordances of 
textiles (i.e. stretching, pushing, and deforming). These affordances are further accentuated when the 
interfaces are designed in a way that encourages Active Touch. This has been done by incorporating 
elements like pleats and folds in draped fabric (see Chapter 6, Concept 1 - E-textile screen partition) or 
spring-like stretchable and deformable elements using knitted fabrics (see Chapter 6, Prototype 2- E-textile 
knitted disk interface). 
15 
 
Prototype 3. uses “perceived affordances” (Norman 1998) or the actual properties of the physical object, 
which determine just how the thing could possibly be used. It also uses the linearity of fabric that takes the 
form of a fan and allows the fabric to be creased, folded, and opened with ease (see Chapter 6, Prototype 
3. E-textile hand fan). Further, 3D shapes that enable fabric deformation by physically squeezing the 
material (see Chapter 6, Prototype 5. E-textile ball interface) have also been explored. The prototype 
explorations discussed in Chapter 6. demonstrate how various textile materials have been approached with 
the idea of promoting affordances and the tactile sense. 
 
2.3 Haptic Visual Overlap  
Haptic and visual modalities overlap because they are both sensory systems capable of processing the 
geometric structure of an object. My research uses the term haptic to describe a form of nonverbal 
communication (Hans, 2015) that incorporates the sense of touch. Through vision and touch, complex 
three-dimensional (3D) geometric properties of objects can be recognized. Vision is the modality we most 
often use to identify objects, but the tactile system (or haptics) is also useful, particularly in situations where 
objects cannot be seen. This directly affects the control of 3D assets within virtual reality environments as 
discussed below. 
In 2001, Newell reported that the visual system recognizes the front view of the object and the hand 
recognizes the back view of the object. He stated, “hands recognize the objects best from the back” (Heller 
et al. 2002). In his PhD thesis, Fitzmaurice (1998) stated that the overlap of “haptic-visio” space is what 
completes 3D perception of a physical object for a human being in physical space.  The incorporation of 
physical objects into virtual environments facilitates grasping behaviors and innate spatial reasoning skills 
for object manipulation (Fitzmaurice 1995, 1998). 
16 
 
Haptics can also provide information about the weight, compliance, and temperature of an object as well 
as information about surface features. This kind of information is not readily available by looking at the 
object. Vision can provide information about color and surface patterns, and both haptics and vision can 
give information on the volumetric shape. The haptic system can only operate within arm’s reach but when 
objects are in range they can be manipulated and thereby reveal the structures and features of unseen 
surfaces and parts, thus satisfying both visual and haptic system. (James, Keith Humphrey, Gati, Servos, 
Menon, and Goodale 2002)  
Haptic modality encompasses various haptic cues from the physical interface that are triggered at the time 
of tangible interaction. These cues are the feel of 3D shape (volumetric shape), compliance (i.e. material 
stiffness or flexibility), thermal quality, weight, and surface texture. Likewise, the visual modality 
encompasses various visual cues from the physical or 3D virtual interface, and these cues include 3D shape 
(volumetric shape), color, and pattern. 
 
A. 3D Volumetric Perception and Depth Perception 
The overlap of “haptic - visual” modalities improve the 3D volumetric perception of a virtual object in virtual 
reality because complex, 3D, geometric properties can be recognized when vision is combined with touch.  
It has been noted that haptic sensations (i.e. force feedback) are known to impart users with realistic feeling 
about physical interactions and these sensations improve the control over virtual objects in a 3D simulated 
space as noted by Bouguila, Ishii, and Sato (2001) in their paper concerning the testing of grasping 3D 
objects in Stereoscopic spaces.   
Depth perception is one of the critical issues in virtual reality (Naceri, Chellali, Dionnet, and Toma, 2010). In 
“Depth Perception of Virtual Environments”, Bouguila, Ishii, and Sato (2001) suggest that participants rely 
on the apparent size of the 3D asset when making depth comparisons in virtual reality. Uncontrolled 
17 
 
feedback cues in a 3D virtual environment can provide false depth information, which can create a sensory 
conflict leading to distorted visual perceptions and unskillful interactions. Artificial display systems (i.e. 
virtual reality headsets) and feedback cues (i.e. active or passive haptics) have to work in concert with each 
other to create the illusion of a sense of interaction. In the real world, human senses such as vision, audition, 
haptic, etc. are almost always in agreement with each other, and thus accurate depth perception is usually 
possible (Bouguila, Ishii, Sato, 2001). 
As demonstrated in a study by Cooper et al (2018), the integration of haptic and visual perception leads to 
faster, responsive, performance than when the haptic or visual cues are perceived in isolation. In their 
experiment, the task was to change the wheel on a virtual racing car in a 3D environment as fast as possible 
using a 3D haptic device (i.e. active and passive haptics together). Their results showed that the combined 
input of tactile and visual sensory cues led to a reduced mean completion time compared to when only 
haptic cues were available on their own. 
 
B. Compliance (force) 
Compliance is the scientific term used to describe the stiffness or flexibility of a physical material. It also 
refers to the resistance of a material to deformation. When a participant is asked to interface with and 
manipulate a material, visual priors come into play because experiences of force occur in the context of 
visual experience. It has been suggested that the sensation of force through mechanical interaction with 
materials, and the corresponding displacements perceived by vision, become associated with long-term 
memory. Klatzky and Wu (2014) state, “Kinematic features in a visual percept can be matched to stored 
haptic experiences to infer force.” This idea has been used in Prototype 2 (see Chapter 6, Prototype 2. E-
textile knit disk interface) and Prototype 5 (see Chapter 6, Prototype 5. E-textile ball interface). In those 
prototypes, the displacement of e-textile materials results in corresponding changes to and displacements 
of the 3D visual assets. For a satisfactory interaction with physical materials their flexibility and/or tactile 
18 
 
feel should correspond to the visual distortion in the volumetric shape of the material. In an experiment to 
deduce or discriminate spring stiffness, a number of participants were exposed to a physical spring 
apparatus and screen based visual feedback. This experiment noted that the minimum difference in 
intensity required for discrimination increased for the “haptic feedback only” condition, while in the case 
of “haptic + visual feedback” condition it was reduced (Klatzky and Wu, 2014). Haptic Visual overlap, 3D 
volumetric perception and material compliance within various prototypes are discussed in Chapter 6. These 
prototypes demonstrate how different textile materials have been approached with the idea of promoting 
“Haptic-Visio” overlap. 
 
 
Fig.5 Theoretical Framework for this research 
In conclusion, it can be said that the framework of Tangible User Interfaces, when applied to the design of 
e-textile interfaces and 3D virtual visual assets, leads to an explorative space where the physical and digital 
intuitively overlap to create an enhanced experience. The information within virtual reality can only be 
accessed through the graspable, interfaces, where the material affordances of these interfaces guide the 
participant during the interaction. The questions that arise from the coupling of the tangible user interface 
and the 3D virtual assets are primarily how the e-textile interface controls, represents, and embodies 
characteristics of its virtual counterpart. The theory of Active Touch is poised in the interaction space 
created primarily for human hand action and the e-textile interface, where it promotes the use of 
affordances in the textile material. Thus, it can be said that the intuitive exploration of the e-textile is a way 
19 
 
to explore the 3D visual asset in virtual reality. Further, the theory of Haptic-Visual Overlap is positioned in 
a space between the e-textile interfaces and virtual reality as seen in Figure 5. The compliance (i.e. stiffness 
or flexibility) of physical materials and their 3D virtual representation enhances the virtual reality 
experience. A contextual review of works that explore interfaces through tangibles and promote active 
touch and haptic-visual overlap, is discussed later.

3. Contextual Review 
This chapter reviews e-textile research projects that contribute to the area of Tangible User Interfaces and 
explore the theory of Active Touch and Haptic-Visual overlap. The features of Tangible User Interfaces 
include physical objects and artifacts that act as representations and controllers for their digital 
counterparts. Within the projects mentioned here are objects/artifacts/interfaces that can be exploited for 
their physical and tactile affordances, as these affordances are meant to guide the participant during 
interaction (Ullmer and Ishii, 2000), as described in detail in Chapter 2. Research in the field of textile-based 
interfaces supports haptics (i.e. sense of touch Chapter 3.5) as a means of introducing a more innate and 
intuitive interaction with computer technology. These ideas are built around creating expressive 
interactions, as it can be said that the tactile input of data into the system is not cerebral but intuitive. 
“Intuitiveness” is defined as human understanding that allows for operation without explicit instruction. 
Our repeated exposure to materials and interactions with them evokes such an intuitive understanding of 
them. Because we are surrounded by textile materials in our everyday environment, there is research to 
make fabrics computationally intelligent, including in the physical-digital interaction space. 
In the early nineties, work emerging from the Xerox Research Lab diverged from traditional Graphical User 
Interfaces (GUI) models that utilized a mouse, keyboard, and monitor as an input, towards the model of 
Tangible Interfaces that involved input devices or controls that utilized physical object/artifacts. These 
physical object/artifacts were enabled with computational ability through sensor-based technology, and 
their inclusion within digital spaces imparted specific meaning to the digital context. In the late nineties, 
academic work related to tangible interfaces using e-textiles emerged from MIT Media Lab. This is seen in 
the example of the e-embroidery wearable music jacket (Post et al, 2000), which consists of an embroidered 
conductive thread keypad connected to a wearable MIDI synthesizer and speaker circuit. The evolution of 
haptics within digital spaces as proposed by Fitzmaurice et al (1998) involved touching and interacting with 
21 
 
an object. He stated that this kind of interaction helped cognition and used examples of early calculating 
devices like the Abacus, which requires physical interaction with beads. He further stated that digital data 
would be better understood when attached to physical objects within the digital space. In 1992, Shimoga 
et al, reported that haptics help cognition and improve user response. 
Moving on from haptics that help in the cognitive understanding of data within digital systems towards 
haptics that evoke intuitive responses in users, this research addresses the latter. Margret Orth researches 
the confluence of tangible interfaces and e-textiles. She worked on academic projects with tangible 
interfaces for manipulation and exploration of digital information (Gorbet, Orth, and Ishii, 1998). She 
further developed her interest by creating tangible computing interfaces and computational devices from 
electronic fabrics and conducting threads (Orth, Post, Cooper 1998). One of Orth’s project is the 
Embroidered Musical Ball interface, which is composed of sewn conductive electrodes acting as pressure 
sensors for modulating sound (Orth 2000). 
In early 2000, Do-it-yourself (DIY) toolkits enabled the DIY community to experiment with e-textiles and 
wearable computers by using familiar materials and techniques (e.g., textiles and sewing). New electronic 
textile material and integration techniques have led to growth in DIY e-textile sensor movement (Buechley, 
2006) this further promoted ways of constructing material based haptic interfaces. 
An Interactive wall (2010) designed by the High Low tech group (MIT Media Lab) encouraged users to run 
their hand across a wallpaper constructed out of paper, paint, and Arduino sensors. The wallpaper was 
attached to a paper computing kit that allowed users to turn on a lamp, play music, or send a message to a 
friend.  
The application of this ideology (i.e. haptic inclusion) can be seen in more recent commercial projects that 
aim to make e-textiles more broadly available to the public. Companies like Eeonyx (Eeonyx 2018, 
https://eeonyx.com/) and Google’s Jacquard project lay the foundation for making e-textiles readily 
available for incorporation into digital lifestyle products. These products have the potential to be introduced 
22 
 
into digital spaces where different modalities can meet.  Haptic have been studied as a part of e-textile 
affordances for the last two decades as a means of communication within digital technology. In recent 
years, some studies proposed various haptic inclusion devices (i.e. force feedback). However, this research 
focuses specifically on passive haptic objects/artifacts for virtual reality 3D visual asset manipulation.  
The projects mentioned in the following section provided the foundation for my work in e-textile research 
and have influenced the design of the objects/artifacts/interfaces mentioned in Chapter 6. With this overall 
view in mind, while looking at design trends and technological development in e-textile interfaces, several 
projects by various groups are covered next chapter. 
 
3.1. Tangible Textiles as Interfaces 
Tangible interfaces often exploit the way humans use their hands to interact with objects. The research 
projects detailed below are limited to interactions that, specifically and only, incorporate hands and fingers. 
Tangible interfaces using fingers include swipe or pinch, whereas tangible interfaces that are built around 
hands point towards interactions such as grasping or grabbing, but can also include interactions that are 
finger-specific. 
 
A. ‘Touch’ ‘Swipe’ or ‘Drag’ Interfaces 
 
Fig.6 Cilllia-3D printing Functional Hair.  
3D Printed Hair acting as a touch sensor (Ou, Ishii MIT Media Lab 2016) 
23 
 
In a research project by Ou and Ishii (2016) that encourages touch and swipe interactions named Cilllia, 
which is focused on 3D printing Functional Hair at the MIT Media Lab’s Tangible Media Group, describes a 
method for 3D printing hair-like structures on both flat and curved surfaces. Their project involved building 
a software platform that would allow users to create their own 3D printed hair geometries. This system can 
print minute hair geometries that are smaller than 50-100 microns. Hair grows in a directional order and 
follows a certain pattern specific to a certain area of the body, thus allowing for touch sensing in human 
beings. In this study, Ou and Ishii (2016) state that “The ability to fabricate customized hair-like structures 
enables us to design passive actuators and swipe sensors. We also present several applications that show 
how the 3D-printed hair can be used for designing everyday interactive objects.” This project enables and 
promotes a 3D printing systems that can create touch-based sensors from microfibers. When these 
microfibers are attached to electronics, they create tangible artifacts. When a user interacts with these 
artifacts through touch or dragging their finger across their surface, they create data specific to the 
interaction, which is a primary requirement of Tangible User Interfaces. This project demonstrates how 
tactile cues enhance spatial understanding of objects (Fitzmaurice 1996). It can be seen how the deformable 
quality of the fibrous material is being explored through the finger, where the user can use the fibrous 
texture to judge the directional change in the order of the fibers, hence guiding their interaction further via 
these cues. 
 
Fig.7 Tangible Textural Interfaces, Eunhee Jo, Royal College of Art graduate (2012) 
 
24 
 
Royal College of Art graduate Eunhee Jo (2012) designed a tactile music speaker with a fabric control panel 
and a speaker that responds to music. The control panel for the Tangible Textural Interface (TTI) speaker is 
embedded in a concave surface on one side. By pushing the knit fabric surface forward, backwards, up and 
down, the user can skip tracks, adjust the volume, or access various options on the equalizer. The stretch 
fabric acts as a passive haptic response to the user. On the other side, the speaker's surface pulsates to the 
beat of the music and physically responds to selections made on the control panel. This non-screen based 
design effectively demonstrates the use of passive haptics. The knit fabric accommodates the deformation 
of material as the user interacts with the surface of the control area. While in the speaker area, the physical 
shape changes and the textile material responds to the music. The speaker embodies a certain character of 
music as it pulsates to the beat as the participant controls the music (Jo, 2012). 
 
 
Fig.8 User interacting with touch sensitive denim, Google’s Project Jacquard (Poupyrev 2016) 
Project Jacquard (Poupyrev, 2016) is a recent initiative by Google. The project researches various 
conductive yarns that are amendable to being woven using the current textile manufacturing technology. 
The woven fabric that incorporates the e-yarn can be used for various purposes and is currently being 
marketed by Levi’s in a denim jacket (i.e., Commuter jacket). The general idea of this project is to “deploy 
invisible, ubiquitous interactivity at scale” (Poupyrev 2016). The resulting e-textile can be used to 
manufacture soft toys, furniture, apparel and bags, automotive or home interiors, and many other everyday 
25 
 
lifestyle products. Any object made using Google’s Jacquard textiles can be digitally interactive and 
computationally responsive (Fig. 8). These kind of technological development points towards a trend that 
will create the foundation for more tangible, material, inclusivity in digitally interactive spaces. This has 
been expressed directly as Poupyrev (2016) states that “Consequently, for designers of these objects, digital 
sensing and computation will become basic properties of the textile materials- like weight, color and 
elasticity.”

Fig.9 The Fabric Keyboard (Wicaksono and Paradiso, MIT Media Lab 2017) 
 
Fabric Keyboard (Wicaksono and Paradiso, 2017) is a deformable, textile, music keyboard, based on a 
multimodal, fabric, sensate surface. Each key on this keyboard can detect touch, proximity, pressure, 
stretch, and coupled electric fields simultaneously, resulting in rich discrete and continuous gesture sensing 
as well as touch sensing. This enables unique tactile experiences and new interactions both with gestures 
such as pressing, pulling, stretching, and twisting of the keys or fabric, as well as non-contact by hovering 
and waving towards/against the keyboard’s electromagnetic source. The dual abilities of contact and non-
contact gesture-based control allow the performers to be more expressive. According to Wicaksono and 
26 
 
Paradiso (2017) “This enhances the relationship between the physical interaction and the music, as the 
fabric deeply embodies the sound it resonates.”  
 
Fig.10 Chang and Ishii demonstrating interaction with fabric as a part of ZStretch  
(MIT Media Lab 2007) 
In their project, Z-Stretch, Chang and Ishii (2007) describe a textile music controller that supports expressive 
haptic interactions like stretching, deforming, pulling, and pressing. Chang and Ishii describe various ways 
in which ordinary hand interactions can be supported by fabrics (Fig.10) and how they can be used to 
control music. The musical controller takes advantage of the fabrics’ deformational constraints to enable 
proportional control of musical parameters such as frequency and pitch. Chang and Ishii (2007) claim, “This 
novel interface explores ways in which one might treat music as a sheet of cloth.” Their project is based on 
the idea that stretching fabric can provide rich and dynamic expression and input to the creation of music. 
Fabric can allow for a wide range of interactions, and the idea of stretching is closely linked with musical 
manipulation. In sound editing software, one can often “stretch” a piece of music by increasing the duration 
or pitch. In the physical world, the deformation of materials is often coupled to sound, as when wooden 
beams creak as they bend or when a string is bent by plucking it.  Through their research, Chang and Ishii 
have demonstrated a way of connecting fabric materiality and the haptic qualities of the interface. In 
general, the Zstretch fabric controller supported regular fabric interactions like stretching, grabbing, and 
twisting on both the regular planes and edges. Stretching any part of the edges allowed the different sound 
parameters to be changed. Users would typically use a combination of one-handed and two-handed 
movements during interaction. 
27 
 
 
Fig.11 Felt Sensors (2015), Lara Grant, Interactive Telecommunications Program, NYU 
 
In a study by designer Lara Grant, various felt-based interfaces were created by embedding e-textile sensors 
inside felted shapes to explore pressure and stretch sensing. Her felted ‘Stretch sensor’ neck wrap and 
‘Pinch and Location’ interfaces use grab and pinch interactions that add to a more exploratory haptic 
vocabulary. This enables unique tactile experiences and new interactions (Grant, 2015). 
 
In conclusion, it can be said that tangible textile interfaces often exploit the affordances created by the 
deformable nature of fabric. Such deformations can include, but are not limited to, stretching, pulling, 
pressing, folding, and dragging the objects/artifacts/interface. These e-textile interfaces are equipped with 
computational abilities and are able to sense the way humans interact with them. When a user interacts 
with these artifacts through touch or dragging their finger across the surface, a certain kind of data is 
captured that is specific to the interaction, and this is a primary requirement of Tangible User Interfaces. 
The specificity of the data is further reflected in the digital or virtual space that these interactions represent. 
Like in the case of the Commuter jacket (i.e., the Google Jacquard and Levi collaboration), as the user taps 
the touch sensitive denim fabric data received from tapping is converted into a specific action that can be 
applied to controlling a mobile device. The same can be observed in Eunhee Jo’s knit fabric speaker interface 
(Fig.8), where by deforming the fabric control panel the user can access various selection options. Thus, 
each interaction has a specific outcome. Various projects have demonstrated a way of connecting fabric 
materiality and the haptic qualities of the interface to data.  
28 
 
Furthermore, these projects also demonstrate how tactile cues enhance the spatial understanding of 
objects (Fitzmaurice 1998). This is greatly reflected in the project Fabric Keyboard (Wicaksono and Paradiso, 
2017) where researchers relate the physical interaction with fabric to the music in a way that suggests the 
fabric embodies the music. The same line of thought is reflected in Zstretch’s proposed fabric music 
controller where the researcher has attempted to map the deformation of the fabric caused during 
interaction to various sound frequency (Chang and Ishii 2007). Thus it can be said that embodiment, control, 
and representation are central themes. Chapter 3.3 covers recent projects that specifically use e-textile 
interface in virtual reality. 
 
3.3. E-textile and Soft Interfaces for Virtual Reality 
Chapter 3.3 summarizes projects that use e-textiles and alternative, soft, interfaces within virtual reality 
spaces. One notable project is Stella Speziali’s thesis and virtual reality research called, “Tangible Worlds” 
(Speziali, 2017).  Her project offers a sensory, virtual reality experience where the user interfaces with the 
virtual reality world through touch. The tactile experience is fundamental in this experience, since the 
virtual reality space is visually controlled through fabric. As the user interfaces with the fabric, the abstract 
visual patterns within the virtual reality experience change. The sensors within the fabric are commercially 
available flex sensors and the microcontroller is an Arduino UNO. This project establishes a strong link 
between reality and virtual reality through touch. Speziali (2017) says, “What we perceive from the outside, 
does not represent what we live inside the virtual world. This project reflects on how to manipulate the 
reality and influence the virtual world and vice versa. I’m trying to explore what is means to touch some 
strange materials without seeing our hands and see something happening in the virtual world.”  
In another project, researchers at York University introduced diegetic, tangible, objects in virtual reality 
narratives (Harley, Tarun, Germinario, and Mazalek, 2017). Their system is made of commercially available 
hardware and a sensor unit designed to track a physical object represented within the virtual reality space. 
29 
 
The same sensor setup has been used with various custom made objects as well as other tangible objects 
like a cube, a stuffed animal, a treasure chest, and a wooden boat. This project is particularly exciting for 
two reasons. It addresses narrative in virtual reality spaces and also questions the relevance of traditional 
button type controllers. Harley et al state, “While controller-based interactions are the current standard in 
consumer virtual reality, their tangible and tactile qualities communicate limited information about the 
objects they represent or the story world in which they exist.” This stands in contrast to another approach, 
where everyday objects are introduced to virtual reality to direct gameplay. The gyroscope tracks the 
orientation of the object within the virtual reality space and each tangible object has a specific meaning and 
interaction designed for it. The researchers have attempted to demonstrate through this project “passive 
and active haptics” to bridge the gap between the real and the virtual worlds. They include physical 
characteristics of the physical objects represented in the virtual space to expand the possibility of 
interaction. In the case of the stuffed squirrel, a 3D digital representation was created to be used within 
virtual reality. In their project, both active and passive haptics were utilized. Active haptics were utilized for 
programmed digital feedback and used time vibrations during interactions while passive haptics provided 
feedback about the weight and texture of an object.  
Harley et al (2017) emphasize the use of passive and active haptics for tangible objects and state that 
“Bringing these considerations together expands the design space of tangible narratives, first in the choice 
of the objects themselves, and second in the visual affordances of virtual reality, as any object can gain or 
lose its visual attributes.” 
In contrast to traditional handheld controllers, various soft, fabric, glove based controllers were introduced 
in the CES 2017. One example is the Noitom Hi5 VR gloves developed by Richard Borris. These gloves offer 
hand and finger tracking for the HTC Vive VR headset. The device claims to have full-hand motion capture 
and sensors that interact with 3D objects in virtual reality spaces. They also claim to have an orientation 
output rate of 90 frames per second, which is the industry standard for quality virtual reality today. These 
gloves ensure hand and finger tracking by orienting the hand and allowing each finger to bend 
30 
 
independently. Flex sensors and a gyroscope, positioned within the glove, send motion and hand position 
data via Bluetooth. The hardware calculates the average bend of the finger, ten finger joints, and the overall 
orientation of the hand. During the installation, the user inputs their finger length by engaging in a short 
calibration. The HTC Vive position sensors are strapped on the wrist. The rest of the data is extrapolated to 
find the location of the shoulder and arm after which the data is then used to model the wrist and arm real-
time. These types of virtual reality glove controllers are developed by independent hardware peripheral 
developers in collaboration with companies like HTC Vive and other virtual reality gear makers. They are 
then introduced to game developers and the virtual reality development community who are encouraged 
to build games and environments around these controllers.

glove 2017 (Right) 
These gloves are extremely good at recreating the hand and finger movements and orientation in virtual 
space. The manipulation of 3D virtual asset is customized for glove type interactions and haptic cues based 
on force feedback mechanism guide the interactions with the 3D virtual assets. 
In conclusion, recent projects in virtual reality that include unconventional interfaces, and use tangible e-
textiles, are successful at creating sense-based input to virtual reality (Speziali 2017). There is an overall 
movement and trend that points towards creating an intuitive interaction (Harley, Tarun, Germinario and 
Mazalek 2017) where artifacts, materials, and techniques are being created to develop interfaces that move 
away from being merely input devices (i.e. handheld controllers for virtual reality) and towards experiential 
31 
 
interfaces (Speziali 2017). The haptic experience is fundamental in these interactions because these 
projects offer a sensory, virtual reality, experience where the user interfaces with the virtual reality world 
through tangible objects 
In the following section, I review how commercial controllers manipulate 3D assets within virtual reality. 
 
3.4. 3D Asset Manipulation using Current Controllers in Virtual 
Reality 
This section covers various virtual reality controllers and interfaces that are mainstream, as well as research 
into traditional 3D asset manipulation and how that differs from the interfaces built as a part of this project. 
3D manipulation tasks include selection (acquiring or identifying an object or subset of an object), 
positioning (changing the objects 3D position), rotation (changing the objects 3D orientation), and scaling 
(uniformly changing the size of an object) (Poupyrev et al, 1997).  
 
Mainstream controllers (Fig. 14) are defined as interface or controller (hardware) that are constant and 
support many virtual reality games (software) that are built around these existing controllers. Mainstream 
controllers are generic, so that they can be adopted by a general population. Their design is based upon the 
shape, position of fingers, and ergonomics of human hands. 
 
When using mainstream controllers, the interaction within virtual reality spaces occurs through a virtual 
interface. The controller assists the user to choose from virtual interfaces and relies on UI signifiers. On 
these controllers, when a user pushes a button they see their hands move or they manipulate 
specific items. The user must quickly understand interaction concepts without an expert to explain the 
interface. The HTC Vive and Oculus Rift controllers have no finger tracking, but they are designed so that 
users intuitively understand the button’s function by the button’s physical touch, placement, and position. 
32 
 
 
 
Fig.13 UI signifiers/labels in the hands in mainstream VR controllers 
Mainstream controllers differ from the interfaces that have been created during this project because while 
the commercial controllers control virtual assets and successfully manipulate 3D virtual assets, they neither 
represent nor embody the characteristics of the 3D assets. This is a distinguishing factor for Tangible User 
Interfaces, the interface represents or embodies characteristics of the 3D virtual asset as well as controlling 
it. In a Tangible User Interface, the affordances guide the interaction as the passive haptic builds on intuitive 
real-time responses from the participant while they handle the e-textile interface with one or both hands. 
The real-time change in the e-textile interface is computationally mapped to the 3D virtual asset. In the 
case of a glove-based methods used to imitate realistic interactions with 3D virtual objects, the virtual hand 
is made to change shape on contact or trigger force feedback or sound feedback. One such method is 
described by Alvas, Marchal, and Lecuyer (2012) in their paper, “The God-Finger Method for improving 3D 
Interaction with Virtual Objects through Simulation of Contact Area”. They believe the glove-based method 
allows more realistic manipulation of 3D virtual assets because the participant relies on interaction between 
their hand and the asset, whereas, in the case of commercial controllers, the user is taught affordances 
through signifiers and force feedback. In tangible user interfaces the affordances are through active 
touching (Gibson, 1962), while the glove provides/offers passive touching through force feedback. Here the 
term “3D Asset Manipulation” means spatial rigid object manipulation in a virtual reality environment.

This Climb VR game is sold specifically for Oculus Rift and in Fig. 15, it can be seen that the Rift controller 
takes the shape of hands in virtual reality and the grabbing action is only possible through pressing down 
on buttons on the controller. The 3D virtual object manipulation techniques used by these are grasping and 
pointing.

(Middle) Glove and handheld controllers strapped to the arm. This provides the position sensor data. 
Specifications of the Manus VR glove (Fig.16 and 17) include full finger tracking, haptic feedback, gyroscope, 
accelerometer, and magnetometer to measure orientation. The glove is completely wireless, powered by 
34 
 
cells, and has a latency of 5ms. The Manus VR Glove calculates the relative position of the hand. To get 
positional tracking of the gloves, it relies on the tracking solution of other systems, such as Xsens and Vive 
Tracking. Any tracking solution that gives the location of the wrist can be used to provide positional tracking. 
 
 
Fig.17 Manus VR glove in live interaction with assets in VR 
 
While these gloves are extremely good at recreating the hand-finger movement and orientation within the 
xyz space in 3D, their interaction between the 3D virtual asset and the 3D hand model is extremely limited. 
However, in most virtual reality systems, when these two modalities are coupled together, the real world 
users and the virtual world are separated and do not interact directly with each other.  
When the participant is asked to grasp a 3D virtual object, thus understanding the task of grasping, a graphic 
hand usually emerges in the 3D virtual scene while the participant uses their real hand to control the 
interaction. In this kind of interaction, the participant feels that the 3D graspable object is at a remote site, 
thus associating the interaction with an “indirect control” and disassociating with the virtual environment 
itself, it keeps the real and the virtual worlds non-fused. They remain two separate and distinct 
environments. This effect of disassociation is primarily due to the lack of depth perception within 3D virtual 
environments (Bouguila, Ishii, and Sato, 2001) and also the lack of the haptic experience of the 3D virtual 
asset. Through this discussion we have established the differences in approaches to 3D asset manipulation 
in virtual reality using mainstream controllers vs. the interfaces that have been created as part of this 
35 
 
project to augment the sensate qualities of the virtual reality space using the haptic visual overlap 
(Fitzmaurice 1998) and Active Touch (Gibson 1962). 
 
3.5. Haptics  
Haptics is a form of nonverbal communication (Hans 2015) that incorporates the sense of touch. The term 
“haptic” which contains the Greek root meaning “to fasten” suggests the interactive nature of the 
sensations. Part of the body is “fastened” to a part of the world, and feedback results from the active 
exploration of a surface object by the limbs, hands, and skin of the user (Biocca and Levy, 1995). 
 
The sense of touch is one of the five major senses (Hans 2015) and is considered a continuous sense. In 
other words, we are always using our sense of touch, consciously or unconsciously, even when we are 
sleeping. In his study on the history of the senses, Robert Jutte (2005) noted that the human race has 
entered a “haptic age”. McLuhan in 1964 said that the new age of electronic media would be defined not 
by vision but by “touch”, as electronic media emulated the tactile sense in their capacity to universally 
translate data for the different sense modalities (Parisi, Paterson, and Archer, 2017). 
 
Within the context of virtual reality, “haptic” refers to the science of applying tactile sensations to human 
computer interaction (HCI). The advent of this kind of technology in mainstream HCI is mainly to do with 
touch screen mobile phones where incorporating “haptic feedback” (vibration) to screen based interfaces 
offers an extra dimension to interacting with these electronic devices. The feedback sensation was 
introduced to compensate for the lack of physical keypad on the purely screen based phone. So the vibration 
function of the phone is used to simulate the tactile feel of buttons (Jang, Kim, Tanner, Ishii, and Follmer, 
2016). The extension of this mainstream phenomenon, is seen within virtual reality or 3D environments 
because it is considered an important aspect for feeling truly immersed within these environments.  The 
36 
 
most common haptic feedback is vibration, or electrostatic shock produced by external devices, such as 
specially developed gloves, shoes or joysticks, that are in contact with the user’s skin. These forms of haptic 
feedback are usually triggered while the user is trying to interact with certain 3D visual assets within the 
virtual reality environment (Michael Abrash, Oculus Summit 2016). In the same line of thought Shimoga 
(1993) suggests that, “Haptic imagery could greatly enhance our exploration and use of the virtual worlds, 
a number of studies show that haptic feedback can reduce the time it takes to complete manual tasks as 
much as 10%-75%.” If all information, even abstract information, could be physically touched and 
manipulated, our ease of understanding and our sense of presence can be significantly increased (Biocca 
and Levy, 1995). This research is significant for creating tangible interfaces for virtual reality.  
 
Within the scope of this paper, “haptics” refers to the resultant phenomenon that takes place while the user 
is made to physically interface with various textures and material objects using their hands. In this context, 
the “haptic feedback” generated is self-created in a sense that the user is generating feedback for themselves 
while interacting with the physical interface, so there is no externally or artificially induced haptic feedback 
through vibration or electrostatic shock.

4. Material Review: Electronic Textiles 
Electronic Textiles (e-textiles) are textile materials, fabrics, yarns, and threads that have incorporate 
conductive fibers and other elements during their material construction (i.e. weaving, printing, 
embroidery). My research is concerned with creating soft electronic sensors using e-textiles that control 3D 
virtual visual assets in virtual reality. 
This contextual review covers the physical aspects of e-textiles, their materials, creation and manufacturing 
techniques as well as offering examples of research projects and construction done within the past fifteen 
years. E-textile materials can be categorized as sensors, actuators, energy sources, and circuit creators 
(Castano and Flatau, 2014). I have specifically used sensors and circuit creators as e-textile materials. I have 
developed several e-textiles sensors and incorporated them with various textile materials as discussed in 
Chapter 5. Sensors can be made from e-textile materials and provide sensing properties of different nature 
including capacitive, resistive, optical, and solar. I have developed various DIY resistive textile sensors for 
my interfaces (see Chapter 1) using conductive thread, conductive wool, and conductive paint (see Chapter 
7). I used conductive yarns and metallic wires to create circuits and connections between sensors and the 
microcontrollers to build my prototypes.  
 
4.1 Conductive Threads and Yarns 
  
 
Fig.18 Conductive thread and yarns 
 
38 
 
E-textiles use conductive yarns (Fig.18), these provide the various interconnectors between the circuit 
elements. The yarns can be made of metal thread wrapped around a non-conductive core or onto fine ﬁbers 
where a metal core has been covered by a non-conducting yarn. Most conductive ﬁbers are made from 
intrinsically conductive materials such as steel. Galvanization is known to increase yarn conductivity by two 
or three orders of magnitude (Bleckley, Eisenberg, Catchen, and Crockett, 2008). Conductive threads and 
yarns are made by either spinning or twisting continuous conductive material with non-conductive material. 
The most commonly used conductive yarns are spun from strands of silver or stainless steel. This allows 
even non-conductive materials to turn into conductive yarns. These yarns and fibers can then be made into 
fabrics using various construction methods like, weaving, knitting, felting etc. A common characteristic of 
conductive yarns is that they are silver grey in color with a shimmery silky look. The resistance of these 
yarns can be lowered by twisting multiple strands of the yarn together. Conductive yarn textile 
manufacturers and suppliers worth mentioning are Bekaert (2018), LessEMF8 (2018), and Lamé Lifesaver 
(2018), which are all located in North America. Lamé Lifesaver is a company in British Columbia that sells 
small spools of conductive silver coated nylon thread that can be used for transmitting low amounts of 
electrical current through a textile. The thread has a resistance of 88.5 Ohms/m and is particularly and can 
be used in the bobbin of a sewing machine (Berzowska and Bromley, 2007). For this thesis, I sourced 
stainless steel conductive thread of 0.2mm thickness and 2 ply from Spark Fun Electronics that had a 
standard resistance of 28 Ohm/ft, and stainless steel conductive yarn with a thickness of 0.4mm, 3 ply 
thread, 1.0 Ohm/inch. 
4.2 Conductive Wool 
 
Fig.19 Conductive wool from Eeonyx 
 
39 
 
This conductive wool has been made by applying Eeonyx’s conductive polymer StaTex to synthetic, staple 
fibers.  These fibers can be further spun into yarns and blended into fabrics but for this project they have 
been used in a number of ways to create pressure sensors (see Chapter 6).  They have a resistance value of 
200-500ohms/sq. 
4.3 Conductive Paint 
Conductive paint (Fig. 20) is electrically conductive, nontoxic, and water-soluble. Conductive paint can be 
applied to various surfaces using a paintbrush or by using printing processes like screen-printing. To be able 
achieve consistent electrical performance, the paint should be applied in an even layer. Using conductive 
paint is a fast and easy way of creating textile circuitry and can easily be made using a textile printing screen 
(43T screen recommended for Bare Conductive Paint). After drying, the paint is somewhat flexible, but this 
flexibility depends on layer thickness and choice of substrate. These paints are intended for use with low 
voltage DC power sources at low currents and have not been tested with sources exceeding 12VDC. Higher 
voltages are not recommended (Bare Conductive, 2018).

The diagram plots the proportional ratio of a sample of electric paint against its approximate resistance.

4.4 Attachment of Hardware Components to Textiles 
Buechley and Eisenberg’s (2009) paper on fabric PCBs, electronic sequins, and socket buttons is concerned 
with one of the most challenging aspects of creating e-textile prototypes, something they describe as the 
issue of “engineering the attachment of traditional hardware components to textiles”. They present three 
techniques for attaching off-the-shelf electrical hardware to e-textiles. The first method is where the design 
is made of fabric PCB or iron-on circuits that can be ironed directly to textiles. I used this technique in the 
creating a DIY fabric flex sensor that used pressure resistive fabric enclosed between two fabrics with ironed 
on conductive strips. In the second method they describe the use of electronic sequins as a way to create 
wearable displays and connect other electronic artifacts that make up the circuit through them. In the third 
method they describe the use of socket buttons to facilitate connecting pluggable devices to textiles 
(Buechley and Eisenberg, 2009).  
 
Influenced by those methods, I developed techniques for attaching e-textile components to fabric 
substrates and the components formed a design on the fabric’s surface. By stitching thread ﬁbers in 
patterns, electronic elements can be made out of conductive thread, possibly with multiple crossings, in 
order to achieve the desired electrical properties. I also developed passive elements formed with 
conductive paints that were developed using painting techniques applied to fabric substrates. I also built 
resistive elements by adjusting the dimensions of an already coated conductive polymer knit fabric and 
created conductive knits from scratch by incorporating conductive yarn in the knitting process as discussed 
in Chapter 5.  A noteworthy resource for any e-textile novice or professional is a public website titled How 
To Get What You Want, where in order to share their ongoing work in e-textiles, Perner-Wilson and Satomi 
(2009) gather documentation and present information in an organized way. The website is organized in 
categories that include example projects, solutions such as circuits, connections, sensors, materials, tools 
and techniques. 
41 
 
4.5 Electronic Textiles 
This section of the contextual review covers a brief history of e-textiles and their applications in projects 
over the past 15 years. These projects are prototyped using materials briefly discussed above. E-textiles can 
be made into clothing and other interior objects such as bedding, curtains, rugs as well as other fabric based 
artifacts. Researchers in the field of e-textiles are creating soft interfaces instead of hard electronic devices 
that are prevalent in the market today.  
Post and Orth (2000) developed both simple and sophisticated e-textile engineering methods that used 
embroidery of conductive yarns to act as data and power busses, resistors, and capacitors on fabric, which 
lead to the development of capacitive sensing cloth touch pads and the use of gripper snaps in e-textile 
applications. 
 
In early 2002, Jayaraman, a researcher at Georgia tech, began a project in e-textiles titled, “Georgia Tech 
Wearable Motherboard. The project was funded by the US Department of Navy. In this research, a vest-like 
garment is woven out of optical fibers and conductive yarns that have been integrated with other 
electronics. The garment can detect bullet wounds and monitor physiological signs like heart rate and 
temperature. This data can be downloaded and analyzed by doctors and researchers to get an indication of 
the wearer’s physiological patterns. 
 
Perner-Wilson and Buechley (2011) describe various textile sensors constructed from a selection of 
electrically conductive fabrics, threads and yarns using sewing needles, pompom makers, crochet hooks 
and spool knitting machines in their paper A Kit-of-No-Parts. This research concentrates on DIY e-textile 
sensors and their application on a fabric tilt sensor. The tilt sensor is a free-swinging metal bead strung on 
a piece of conductive thread surrounded by six petal shaped pieces of conductive fabric. Depending on the 
direction of inclination, the metal bead will make electrical contact with different petals that enable the 
42 
 
differentiation of six different positions of tilt. By replacing the discrete conductive petals with a resistive 
track this sensor becomes a crochet potentiometer (Wilson and Buechley, 2011). 
 
Another project to the intersection of traditional craft and smart materials is Butterfly Lace, a project by 
Kuusk, Kooroshina, and Mikkonen (2015). Butterfly Lace is lace that behaves as both a conductive multi-
color sensor-actuator structure and is made from conductive yarn and thermochromic ink. To control the 
color change on the yarn by human touch, the yarn is set up as part of an electric circuit, which uses the 
yarn itself as a sensor. The duration of the touch is measured by using a capacitive sensor and the heating 
power is set according to the measured duration. Brief touch is needed for a small trigger and maximum 
power is achieved after a few seconds of touch. This can be adjusted to different yarns and required 
feedback as necessary. 
  
In project FlexTiles, Parzer and Vogl (2016) created a flexible, stretchable, pressure-sensitive, tactile input 
sensor consisting of three layers of fabric. They demonstrated in this project how FlexTiles can cover large 
areas, 3D objects, and underlying, deformable shapes. The sensing material consists of two layers of zebra 
fabric with one layer of piezoresistive EeonTexTM LG-SLPA in-between.  The two layers of fabric are 
orthogonally oriented and form a matrix layout. These projects demonstrate how e-textile sensors can be 
constructed out of existing materials by assembling them in a specific ways. 
  
In the projects mentioned above, different e-textile construction techniques have been reviewed through 
available literature. Some e-textiles are constructed from scratch using techniques like crochet and knitting 
(i.e., DIY e-textiles), in others conductive yarn is introduced as a part of the structure (Wilson and Buechley, 
2011) while others are constructed using the assembly of various kinds of commercial e-textile sensors 
(Parzer and Vogl, 2016). For the purposes of this thesis project both of these methods have been used to 
create responsive textiles sensors as detailed in Chapter 6.  
43 
 
5. Methodology 
Research through Design (Frayling 1993; Sanders 2008) is a well-known research methodology. It involves 
researching, conceptualizing, creating, and testing in an iterative manner. This project explores the 
Framework of Tangible User Interfaces and theories of Active Touch and Haptic Visual overlap. During the 
first half of the thesis, the work involved reading and studying these theories and their influence on 
interfaces, haptics, and visual perception. At the same time, I conceptualized ideas that would incorporate 
these theories into my practice of design of e-textile interfaces and its 3D virtual counterpart in virtual 
reality.  
 
During the creation process the first step is materials research. Various commercially available e-textile raw 
materials were purchased (i.e. conductive yarn, wool and paint) along with non-conductive textile materials 
(i.e. nylon, polyester fabrics, yarns and filaments). Several sensors were developed using a combination of 
conductive and non-conductive materials, and further, these sensors were applied to textile explorations 
that work towards the construction of the physical objects/artifacts/interfaces. Also, various e-textile fabric 
constructions were explored to understand the qualities of the material that would accentuate the 
affordances of textiles as described in prototype Chapter 6 (i.e. draped pleated screen, flexible knit disks, 
and deformable ball).  
The development work was specific and customized to each concept and prototype as discussed in Chapter 
6. The data captured by the sensors was translated to the manipulation of 3D visual assets within the virtual 
reality space.  
Certain amount of work was undertaken while building the 3D visual assets in virtual reality that involved 
creating mesh deformation in primitives in the Unity 3D virtual reality platform as well as creating assets in 
Blender with rigging and importing them into the Unity 3D virtual reality platform. The e-textile interface 
44 
 
and the virtual reality asset are coupled together through the framework of tangible user interfaces, thus, 
changes in the physical interface resulted in changes made to the 3D visual asset. 
 
Three dynamics that appear during a Research through Design project during the development phase are: 
coupling, interweaving, and decoupling (Basballe and Halskov 2012). During the initial step of coupling, 
research and design interests are united and the basic frame and constraints of the project serve both levels 
of interests. During the coupling phase the constraints set by the theoretical framework define design 
decisions. This can be seen in the constraints set by Tangible User Interfaces concerning tangible artifacts. 
The framework defines tangible artifacts as having properties such as being physically embodied, physically 
representational, physically manipulable, and spatially reconfigurable. These points guided the design 
constraints and in turn influenced the design of e-textile object/artifact/interface. 
 
During interweaving, research interests and design interests influence each other as processes, methods, 
and validation are established. The process of interweaving can be expressed through the creation of a 
series of prototypes. The research work undertaken through the theory of Tangible User Interface, Active 
Touch and Haptic Visual overlap, helped me understand and define the parameters under which explorative 
e-textile interface could be designed to control 3D assets within virtual reality.  
 
When considering the e-textile squishy ball interface (see Chapter 6.5, Prototype 5) the framework of 
Tangible User Interface suggests the physical objects/artifacts/interfaces to be physically embodied, 
representational, and manipulable. This is literally reflected in the 3D virtual, visual, counterpart of 
Prototype 5 (see Chapter 6.5, Prototype 5). The squishy ball interface accommodates the theory of Active 
Touch through the affordances provided by the e-textile materials. The soft, deformable form and the 
flexible materials guide the user towards exploring affordance of the interface indicating, that the use of 
multifold layered soft fabric textures would be desirable and would further enhance interaction. These 
45 
 
ideas were tested using iterative design and testing of physical objects/interfaces. Haptic Visual overlap 
suggests that 3D mapping of physical interface with the virtual object should be such that visual 
deformation of 3D virtual assets should be distinctly identifiable.  
 
Decoupling appears at later points of the project when the designer/researcher focus on one of the interest 
set (design or research). This happened for me during the time of creating the design 
artifact/object/interface. At this point the design inputs were being consolidated through the making 
process. In the making or creating or the production phase of the physical artifact/object focuses on the 
design process, but is also appeared during the final evaluation and inquiry when the research interests 
become the focus of the work. 
This practice-led research utilizes my skills as a textile designer and my understanding of textile-based 
materials and also merges with my interest in developing e-textile interfaces for virtual reality.

6. Prototypes and Process 
This section covers the conceptualizing and creation of my prototypes. It also unpacks how I’ve applied 
theoretical frameworks to each of these objects/artifacts/interfaces designs.  
6.1 Concept Development 1. Fluid Screen Partitions 
6.1.1 Concept Description 
Concept 1 is a tangible e-textile interface to an existing 3D interactive water system built with the Unity 3D 
virtual reality platform. This iteration is only at the concept stage, but it is important because it illustrates 
my ideal physical situation to exhibit this design; a textile screen made of multiple layers of soft polyester. 
This light, movable, fabric creates a partition that provides both a division of space and concealment.  
 
Fig.21 Artistic visualization, of the virtual reality environment and the e-textile screens. 
 
47 
 
These act as a tangible interface between the real and virtual world depicted in the virtual environment. 
This fabric is made in plan weave, providing no stretch. When draped, it falls straight into many fine pleats. 
This has been illustrated in Fig. 21. where I wanted to create a visual and thematic parallel between the 
fabric, its texture, and the 3D visual asset in virtual reality. (Fig. 22a & 22b).   
The folds of fine fabrics have characteristics similar to the gentle rippling patterns that can be observed in 
water, this prototype embodies the physical representation of water, and symbolically discuss the 
theoretical framework of Tangible User Interfaces (see Chapter 2.3.2).  
 
The tangible interface described was proposed to be created from soft multilayered screens made of sheer 
fabrics, these would hang like partitions within a room space. While interfacing with these, with touch or 
slight sweeping gestures (Fig.21) these would translate into interactions within a 3D virtual water system. 
Here the intangible representation is a 3D virtual asset that is a fluid (i.e.water). 
A sweeping hand, gesturing across the fabric, would causes the fabric to gather and distort, and because of 
this, there is a change in resistance in the e-textile. This change in resistance would be captured as data and 
is used to control a 3D water asset in the virtual reality environment. Points located within the 3D water 
system would be mapped to the x,y points within the e-textile. The data captured by the sweeping hand 
against the e-textile would be plotted against the frequency of wave pattern in the 3D interactive water 
system, causing an increase in ripples. 
Similarly, the hand gesture and the action of pushing the e-textile away from the body would cause the 
parallel layers of e-textile to interact with each other, changing the resistance in the e-textile. Data captured 
during this action would be plotted against the axis that controls the height of the wave pattern in the 3D 
interactive water asset. Hence, giving meaning to individual hand gestures, as they relate to respective 
changes in the 3D interactive water system within Unity platform. The sensors used to create this prototype 
would be a combination of flex sensor (on individual screens) and resistive yarn (between screens). 
48 
 
Concept 1. suggests that “computation” and “interface” are both required to move into the physical 
environment. This means that, the interface is not in the virtual space but in the physical space and also 
that the interface has computational abilities that allows the participant to connect with the virtual 
environment, allowing them to control the 3D visual asset. The interactions described here rely less on logic 
(i.e. pressing buttons on a controller) and more on intuition (i.e. like interfacing with drapes or curtains).

6.1.2 Application of Framework 
Tangible Interfaces are both representation and controls for their intangible representation (Ullmer and 
Ishii 2000) and physical e-textile screens are used to control digital data of water ripples (represented by

the concentric lines), depth and shadows. As the e-textile screens are physically shifted by hand, there is a 
corresponding change in the digital representation of water ripples, depth, and shadows. In this system 
physical representation (rep-p) is the physical position of parallel screens between each other (xyz), and 
displacement of fabric form original location during interaction, while the digital representation (rep-d) is 
the graphically created shadow, graphically created depth and graphical ripple direction. It can also be said 
that the digital representation embodies the characteristic of the physical representation (e-textile 
screens).  
 
Let’s look at this in detail. The position of screens in relation to each other (xyz) and the displacement of 
fabric during interaction (its physical character real-time) directly affect the water ripples in certain areas 
of the 3D water system. Therefore, the water ripple (real-time) embodies the characteristics of the e-
textiles (screen position xyz from each other, and displacement of fabrics real-time). This is also true for the 
digitally created shadows, as the e-textile screens are physically moved by hand, the digital shadows 
transform accordingly. Hence, the digital shadows embody the character of the physical e-textile. The 
computational model for Concept 1. uses a Unity 3D water asset from the Unity store that would create the 
water ripple simulation real-time. The computational model also considers the xyz location between 
screens and displacement of the screen fabrics, and these two aspects, namely the water ripple simulator 
along with e-textiles displacement specifications, are coupled together demonstrating one of the three key 
characteristics of the framework relating to coupling of the computational model and the physical 
representation mentioned in Sectiosn 2.1.1. 
 
Discussion TUI 
I could question the physical elements (fabric screen placement in physical space) ability to spatially 
reconfigure as discussed in Chapter 2.3.4. I could also question how the physical textural qualities (folds 
and drape) of the fabric screens could be altered to represent multiple characteristics of the 3D virtual 
50 
 
water asset, particularly the frequency of water ripples (represented by the concentric lines), and depth 
and shadows. In this prototype the material quality of the soft fabric screens has been connected to water 
to enhance the virtual experience of water within the virtual reality space. The affordances were created 
through the drape fabric form and the pleated texture. 
 
Discussion Active Touch 
 Concept 1. describes a soft, fabric, multilayered, screen partitions in a room that acts an exploratory 
interface to a virtual reality experience. The softness of the fabric allows for an “exploration” based 
interaction.  
 
Discussion on Haptic Visual overlap 
Concept 1. was developed in tandem with Prototype 2. Prototype 2 was an instinctual answer to making a 
more hand centric object/artifact/interface that allows the user to manage and manipulate the interaction 
using their hand. This prototype also relates to a fluid Unity 3D asset that behaves like water only it is now 
a hand-based object. Prototype 2. is illustrated in Fig. 27.a and Fig 27.b ahead.

6.2 Prototype 2. Knitted Disks  
6.2.1 Prototype Description  
Prototype Idea 2. (Fig.24) describes an interface that has multiple, flexible, disk shapes linked together using 
a stretch knit fabric that acts an interface to a 3D water asset in virtual reality. The knit fabric allows the 
interface to be stretchable and tangible, where the flexibility of the disk allows displacement and 
manipulation in the interface. Through the action of pushing, pulling (displacement of fabric) the participant 
interacts with the e-textile interfaces. The user’s manipulation causes the resistances in the e-textile to 
change and this change in resistance is captured as data that is used to control a 3D water system in the 
virtual reality. The sensors used to create this prototype were a combination of pressure sensitive fabric 
(disks) and stretch sensitive knit fabric (outer casing). 
 
Fig.24 Tangible e-textile interface made from resistive knit fabric and flexible insert. 
As the user interacts with the interface (Fig.25, 26) the resistance within the fabric changes. The change in 
resistance is recorded as data and is transferred to an asset in Unity 3D virtual reality platform using a 
Bluetooth module. Points xyz located within the 3D water system is mapped to the xy points within the e-
textile and displacement (z point). 
52

Fig.26 Image demonstrating stretch qualities in the interface. 
This prototype mainly deals with capturing changing resistance within the e-textile. The manipulation of 3D 
assets within virtual reality is directly proportional to the quality of data acquired during the user 
transacting with the interface. When the user interacts with the interface, the interface should be sensitive 
enough to capture finer aspects of the physical change made to it by the user. The data acquired by the 
finer aspects of the user’s actions on the interface and it resultant effect of it on the 3D virtual asset in 
virtual reality, display the control the user has over the virtual asset. The quality of control of the virtual 
asset results in accentuation of virtual sensation. The data captured during the action of pinching or 
squeezing of the e-textile would be plotted against the frequency of wave pattern in the 3D interactive 
water system, causing an increase in ripples.

While the data captured during this action of pressing of fingers against the stretched knit fabric in the 
interface would be plotted against the axis that controls the height of the wave pattern in the 3D interactive 
water asset. Hence, giving meaning to individual hand gestures, as they relate to respective changes in the 
3D interactive water system within Unity platform. In this prototype exploration, the 3D virtual water asset 
was created using pre-existing shaders in Unity 3D (Fig. 29). The 3D virtual water asset was very abstract

and it was modelled from 3D concentric discs to which pre-existing unity shaders were applied and these 
could be controlled with the e-textile interfaces seen in Fig.29, Fig.30 and Fig 31.

Fig.30 The image above describes initial working aspects of Prototype 2 with crochet flex sensor. 
The e-textile interface was created using conductive yarns that were made into a pressure sensor. The data 
acquired from the sensor was applied to the movement of the virtual 3D disk assets. Tapping the surface of 
the interface would result in movement within the virtual water asset causing the 3D virtual disc elements 
within it to rise and fall.

In this prototype exploration (Fig.31), the 3D visual virtual water asset was created using Unity 3D shaders. 
It was modelled from concentric discs elements and could be controlled with the e-textile Bluetooth 
controller.  
 
6.2.2 Application of Framework 
This physical e-textile disk interface represents 
and controls a 3D water asset in Virtual Reality. 
As the e-textile disks are physically shifted, 
manipulated, and spatially reoriented by hand, 
there is a corresponding change in the digital 
representation of volume, form, and texture of 
the 3D water asset within the Virtual Reality 
space. The suggested interaction and the effect 
of it on the 3D asset is described in Fig.32.  In this 
system, physical representation (rep-p) is the e-
textile disk interface, while the digital 
representation (rep-d) is the graphical created 
volume, form, textures in the 3D water asset. 
The digital rep embodies the characteristic of 
the physical rep (e-textile disks) but the 
representation is symbolic, not literal.  
The e-textile, physical position of disks from 
each other (xyz), and displacement of disks 
during interaction (its physical character real-
time) directly affects the water form as

interface and associated effect on 3D water asset

suggested in Fig 32.2. Therefore, it can be said that the water ‘form’ and ‘volume’ (real-time) embodies the 
characteristics of the e-textiles (disk position xyz from each other, and displacement of fabrics real-time). 
The same can be said for spatial orientation of the interface, as suggested in Fig.32.1. As the e-textile disk 
is physically rotated, the digital water transforms accordingly and mimics flowing water. The computational 
model for Prototype 2. would use a Unity 3D water asset from the unity store. This asset would create the 
water form simulation in real-time. The computational model considers the xyz location between disks and 
displacement of the disks that creates the sensor data, these two aspects, namely the water simulation and 
e-textile disk interface physical affordances are coupled together, demonstrating one of the three key 
characteristics of the framework as mentioned in Chapter 2.1.1. 
 
Discussion TUI 
Prototype 2. attempts to give dimension, volume, and movement to water and builds on its 3D fluid quality, 
demonstrating its ability to form 3D shapes (Fig.32). From this I developed a Grasp and Hold e-textile 
interface (Fig 27a). Some of the key characteristics of the framework that informed my decision are 
discussed below. 
 
A. The knitted disk interface (i.e. Physical representations (rep-p)) is coupled to underlying 
 computational model that accounts for 3D water simulation in Unity 3D virtual reality platform 
 as well as sensor data from the knitted disk interface that registers change in the shape or 
 orientation of the interface. 
B. The knitted disk interface (i.e. Physical representations (rep-p)) embodies mechanisms for 
 interactive control of the 3D virtual water asset. By changing the physical form or orientation of 
 the e-textile knitted disk interface, it is possible to change the form of the 3D virtual water asset. 
 This has been illustrated in Fig. 32 through a series of possible suggested interactions.  
57 
 
C. The knitted disk interface is perceptually coupled to the 3D virtual water asset or digital 
 representations (rep-d), these can never been seen apart within the system of the Tangible User 
 Interface. 
D. The stretchable, deformable nature of fabrics (i.e. behavior) allow them to represent fluid, like 3D 
 virtual entities. This ability of fabrics to be molded, deformed, and shaped during interaction 
 enable them to embody characteristics of water. 
 
Distinguishing physical properties of Tangible Artifacts with respect to Prototype 2. is discussed below. 
A. Physically embodied: The shape and form of water as illustrated in Fig. 32. is embodied within the 
 shape and form of the physical artifact/interface. The change in the shape and form of the disks 
 during interaction result in corresponding change of the 3D virtual water asset. 
B. Physically representational: The representation here is symbolic where an interface made of 
 multiple flexible disk shapes linked together using a stretch knit fabric represents  a 3D water asset 
 in virtual reality. 
C. Physically manipulable: These artifacts are made of soft meshes and stretch knit fabric that allow 
 deformation and extension as illustrated in Fig. 32. 
D. Spatially reconfigurable: These artifacts can be spatially reconfigurable in 3D physical space and 
 can be rotated and moved freely as illustrated in Fig. 27a. 
 
Discussion Active Touch 
Prototype 2, an e-textile interface made of a series of disks bound together using a knit fabric, leverages 
the tactile response from a knit fabric that has been stretched over a 3D surface. This prototype can also be 
spatially manipulated, squeezed, and deformed (Fig 25, 26, 32) allowing for various affordances of the 
interface to be used. Active touch can also be described as “tactile scanning” (Gibson 1962, Visell et al. 
2016). Inspired by the current developments of textile sensors and the stretchable nature of knitted fabrics, 
58 
 
I attempt to address these issues and needs by designing haptic sensation intended at amplifying the haptic 
visual overlap in virtual reality through the use of organic forms (i.e. disk shapes) that could overlap and 
depict water.   
Discussion Haptic Visual Overlap 
Haptic visual overlap has been demonstrated through Fig 32. Interaction with e-textile interface results in 
corresponding change in the visual form of the 3D virtual water asset in virtual reality. The nuances here lie 
in the coupling of the interaction and the associated change in the 3D water asset. As seen in Fig. 32.3 that 
tapping gesture would result in creation of splashes while tilting the interface as seen in Fig. 32.1 would 
result in free flow. 
 
6.2.3 Prototyping  
Gesture ‘Tap’ 
I started exploring some of the general gestures that are associated with tangible interaction. ‘Tap’ is 
illustrated in Fig 37.3. This e-textile exploration was done specifically for creating computational surfaces 
for a knitted disk interface as discussed in Prototype 2. In this prototype, two layers of conductive fabric 
have been stretched across a deformable and soft plastic. As the top surface of the fabric is tapped, it hits 
the bottom surface, and this creates a change in the value of the data. Depending on the intensity of the 
tap, the data received from the sensor changes. This data from the sensor is used to manipulate a 3D water 
asset in Unity 3D.  
59 
 
 
Fig.33 In the image above shows a flex/pressure sensor in crochet. 
In this exploration, the fabric has been crocheted out of conductive steel and single ply yarn. The fabric was 
further stretched on to the plastic mesh using single filament nylon thread. This made the construction feel 
bouncy and provided an engaging haptic experience. This bounce was further reflected in the movement 
of the 3D water surface. Two layers of conductive fabric can be seen, these interact to create a flex/pressure 
sensor, where a flex/ pressure sensor output range can be acquired during user interaction. The image 
above shows the sensor in use and Unity 3D assets are controlled through the ‘Tap’ gesture.

6.3 Prototype 3. Crochet Switches and Conductive Ink Resistors 
Gesture ‘Drag’ 
In a second exploration with the same materials as described above (i.e. nylon monofilament and single ply 
steel yarn), various disk-shaped floral crochet switches were created, as shown in Fig 40. The extreme 
peripheries of the switch and the central portion of the switch are made out of conductive steel single ply 
yarn. When contact is made between the edges or periphery of the switch and the center, the circuit is 
complete. This happens when the flexible nylon edge of the disk-shape is turned over towards the center 
with the finger as shown in Fig.34.  
 
Fig.34 The image above shows a number of e-textile crochet switches that are held together. 
 
These switches can be used as digital inputs to control 3D visual assets. When these switches are arranged 
on a flat surface, the act of dragging a finger across the surface triggers them. A combination of fiber and 
electronic textile materials can be used to create an e-textile interface that can input data to control 3D 
virtual visual assets. In another exploration of “drag”, a series of resistors were created using conductive 
paint. 
I created a series of explorations using conductive paints (Fig.35) that were layered on to a fine knit fabric. 
The amount of applied conductive paint applied determined the resistance of the material. As the layers of 
paint increase the conductivity of the material increases. By controlling the layering of conductive paint, it 
61 
 
is possible to tune the resistance value of the textile substrate. These resistors were created on stretchable 
fabric and can be stretched and applied to the surface of various objects rendering them with electronic 
properties that can be made computational when attached to a microcontroller and power source. The only 
disadvantage to these materials and techniques is after conductive paint dry they have a tendency of 
cracking and flaking.

The left image shows a study of creating a resistivity range with conductive ink that can be applied to fabric 
surfaces. The middle image is conductive paint applied on nylon fabric. The right image shows a series of 
explorations using conductive painted layers to create a series of resistances.

Prototype 4. describes a physical handheld fan controlling a virtual air/wind generator that is acting on a

In this prototype, the intangible representation is air, which is visually represented through the flight of the 
fabric within the virtual reality. The virtual fabric asset ’OBI Fabric’ was purchased from the Unity Store in 
2018. 
 
Fig.37 E-textile interface and 3D fabric asset interaction.  
The act of fanning in the physical space leads to correspondence change in the wind condition within 
the virtual reality space. This is visually reflected by the change is fabric flying in the wind. 
63 
 
When compared to the screen-based experience, the virtual reality experience accentuates the feel of the 
interaction. It does this by blocking out other visual, peripheral distractions and centers awareness on the 
movement of the fabric and the feel of air as it bounces off the surface of the skin as the fan moves. The 
visual difference is also experienced by being present in the space with the 3D asset, as opposed to viewing 
it remotely though a screen.  
The 3D virtual fabric asset is rendered in 3D visual space (i.e. virtual reality headset) vs. a 3D virtual asset 
being rendered in 2D visual space (i.e. flat screen), this causes the interactions with 3D assets within 3D 
spaces to be visceral and intuitive instead of cerebral.  
 
6.4.2 Application of Framework 
This physical e-textile hand fan interface represents and controls a virtual air/wind generator, the effect of 
the wind is directly reflected in movement of a 3D fabric asset in virtual reality. As the e-textile fan is opened 
and closed, and reoriented in physical space, there is a corresponding change in the digital representation 
of ‘form’ of the 3D fabric asset within the virtual reality space. The suggested interaction and the effect of 
it on the 3D asset is described in Fig.37.   
In this system the physical representation (rep-p) is an e-textile hand fan interface, while the digital 
representation (rep-d) is a wind generator represented through the graphical created ‘movement’ in the 
3D fabric asset. The digital rep embodies the characteristic of the physical rep (e-textile fan) and the 
representation is literal, where air movement is physical space is being reflected in air generator within the 
virtual space.  
64 
 
In another visualization the e-textile fan 
interface represents and controls a virtual light 
within a concept 3D room as described in Fig 38. 
As the e-textile fan is physically manipulated 
there is a corresponding change in the digital 
representation of ‘light and shadow’ within the 
concept 3D room space. The digital rep 
embodies the characteristic of the physical rep 
(e-textile fan) and the representation is 
symbolic. The e-textile fan interface 
incorporates flex sensor and gyroscope to track 
movement and orientation.

A. The e-textile hand-fan interface (i.e. Physical representations (rep-p)) is computationally coupled 
 to an underlying computational model that takes into account the 3D wind simulator in Unity 3D 
 virtual reality platform, as well as sensor data from the hand-fan interface as it registers a change 
 is movement, when the fan is open and in use. 
B. The e-textile hand-fan interface (i.e. Physical representations (rep-p)) embodies mechanisms for 
 interactive control of the 3D wind simulator in Unity 3D virtual reality. When the fan is in use, the 
 analog data received from the flex sensor attached to the fan triggers the 3D wind 
 simulator in Unity 3D virtual reality. This has been visually illustrated in Fig. 37.  
C. The e-textile hand-fan interface is perceptually coupled to the wind simulator in Unity 3D virtual 
 reality or digital representations (rep-d), these can never been seen apart within the system of the 
 TUI. 
D. When in use the hand-fan interface literally represents the 3D wind simulator wind in virtual 
 reality, in that sense embodying the digital state. 
 
Distinguishing physical properties of Tangible Artifacts with respect to Prototype 4. are discussed below. 
A. Physically embodied: The 3D wind simulator in Unity 3D virtual reality is embodied within the  
 hand-fan interface. When in use the interaction result in corresponding triggering of the 3D wind 
 simulator. 
B. Physically representational: The representation here is literal, a hand-fan when in use generates 
 wind and represents a 3D wind simulator in Unity 3D in virtual reality. 
C. Physically manipulable: These artifacts are made of fabric and can be folded, opened and closed  
 as illustrated in Fig. 38. 
D. Spatially reconfigurable: These artifacts can be spatially reconfigurable in 3D physical space and 
 can be rotated freely as illustrated in Fig. 38.

Discussion Active Touch 
Prototype 4, describes an e-textile fan interface that can be opened and closed and fanned, and can have 
various spatial arrangements. In this prototype, the interaction is opening and closing of the fan rather than 
the exploration of its material surface. 
Discussion Haptic Visual Overlap 
Haptic visual overlap has been demonstrated through Fig 38. interaction with e-textile fan interface results 
in corresponding change in the 3D wind simulator in Unity 3D virtual reality. 
 
6.4.3 Prototyping  
Gesture ‘Swing’ 
This interface uses an e-textile flex sensor that has been attached to the body of the fan (Fig. 39). When 
that fan is in use (i.e. swinging from side to side) the data received from the flex sensor is used to control a 
virtual wind generator in Unity 3D virtual reality.

E-textile interfaces with Bluetooth capability were created using an HC-05 Bluetooth module, as described 
in Fig. 39. These interfaces work with localized Unity 3D virtual reality apps on Samsung S8 mobile. I used a 
67 
 
mobile device with Oculus VR headset to access 3D virtual assets that were controlled through these e-
textile interfaces (Fig.40) 
The first step of making the HC-05 Bluetooth connector was to make it work with Windows 10 to control 
assets within Unity 3D using the serial port and then moved on to doing the same with a Samsung S8 
Android device.

6.5 Prototype 5. Squishy Ball Interface 
6.5.1 Prototype Description 
Prototype 5. Describes a 3D sphere asset being controlled and represented by an e-textile interface that 
incorporates textile pressure sensors within a ball. In this prototype the intangible representation is a 3D 
deformable sphere asset in virtual reality.  In this prototype the squishy deformable character (haptic 
compliance) of the material is explored.

Textile pressure sensors made of conductive wool have been placed within this interface, and the e-textile 
takes the shape of the ball thus easily allowing it to be incorporated within the interface.

the virtual 3D sphere asset.  
 
69 
 
This further allows non-obtrusive interaction with the material (i.e. where the sensor inside the interface 
cannot be felt by the participant). 
 
When compared to the screen-based experience, the virtual reality  experience accentuates the feel of the 
interaction by blocking out other visual distractions in the peripheral vision of the physical space and centers 
awareness on the deformation of the 3D virtual ball asset in virtual reality (Fig. 43) and the feel of physical 
interface in hand as it deforms through Active Touch (Gibson 1962).  The visual difference is also 
experienced in being present in the space with the 3D asset as opposed to viewing it remotely though a 
screen.

The 3D virtual asset is rendered in 3D visual space (i.e. virtual reality head set) vs. a 3D virtual asset being 
rendered in 2D visual space (i.e. flat screen), this causes the interactions with 3D assets within 3D spaces to 
be visceral and intuitive instead of cerebral. With the set up as shown in Fig.43 it was possible control an 
asset in virtual reality using Samsung S8 + Samsung VR gear using e-textile using a Bluetooth enabled 
object/artifact/interface. 
70 
 
6.5.2 Application of Framework 
The physical e-textile squishy ball interface represents and controls a virtual sphere. This is reflected in the 
deformation of a 3D virtual sphere asset in virtual reality. As the e-textile ball is physically squished, there 
is a corresponding change in the digital representation of “form” of the 3D virtual sphere asset within the 
virtual reality space. The suggested interaction and the effect on the 3D asset is described in Fig.42. In this 
system, physical representation (rep-p) is e-textile squishy ball interface, while digital representation (rep-
d) is represented through the graphical deformation in the 3D virtual sphere asset. It can also be said that, 
the digital rep embodies the characteristic of the physical rep (squishy e-textile ball) and the representation 
is literal.  
 
Discussion TUI 
Prototype 5. describes a 3D virtual sphere asset being controlled and represented by an e-textile interface 
that incorporates textile pressure sensors within a ball (Fig 41a). Some of the key characteristics of the 
framework that informed my decision with respect to Prototype 5. are discussed below. 
A. The e-textile squishy ball interface (i.e. Physical representations (rep-p)) is coupled to underlying 
 computational model that takes into account mesh deformation in the 3D sphere simulation within 
 Unity 3D virtual reality platform as well as sensor data from the e-textile squishy ball interface 
 that register deformation or change in the shape or orientation of the interface. 
B. The e-textile squishy ball interface (i.e. Physical representations (rep-p)) embodies mechanisms for 
 interactive control of the 3D virtual sphere asset. By deforming the form of the e-textile squishy 
 ball interface it is possible to change the form of the 3D virtual sphere asset. This has been visually 
 illustrated in Fig. 42 through a series of possible suggested interactions.  
C. The e-textile squishy ball interface is perceptually coupled to the 3D virtual sphere asset or digital 
 representations (rep-d), these can never been seen apart within the system of the Tangible User 
 Interfaces. 
71 
 
D. The stretchable, deformable nature of fabrics (i.e. behavior) allow them to represent semi-solid 
 like 3D virtual entities (i.e. deformable 3D sphere asset). This ability of fabrics to be molded, 
 deformed, and shaped during interaction enable them to embody characteristics of the virtual 
 asset.  
 
After applying the framework, I could question the physical textural quality (haptic compliance) of the e-
textile ball interface and the spatial reconfiguration ability of physical ball element, as discussed in Chapter 
2.1.2 identifying texture through touch. Here haptic compliance is defined as the objects stiffness or 
flexibility. 
 
Distinguishing physical properties of Tangible Artifacts with respect to Prototype 5. is discussed below. 
A. Physically embodied: The shape and form of 3D virtual sphere asset as illustrated in Fig. 42. is 
 embodied within the shape and form of the physical artifact/interface. The change in the shape 
 and form of the squishy ball interface during interaction result in corresponding change of the 3D 
 virtual sphere asset. 
B. Physically representational: The representation here is literal where an interface made of e-textile 
 squishy ball interface represents a 3D visual sphere asset in virtual reality. 
C. Physically manipulable: These artifacts are made of soft conductive wool Eeonyx’s material 
 (see Chapter 4.2) and materials that allow deformation as illustrated in Fig. 42. 
D. Spatially reconfigurable: These artifacts are spatially reconfigurable in 3D physical space. 
 
Discussion Active Touch 
In Prototype 5. the stiffness or plasticity of the object is in focus when a finger presses on a rigid surface or 
squeezes an object with the hand. It is difficult to notice the increased intensity of skin-based sensation, 
but one is aware of the object’s substance and its resistance (i.e. haptic compliance). Likewise, when 
72 
 
pressing or squeezing a non- rigid object (a soft ball) the participant is aware of the deformability softness 
of the substance and not that of their fingers. This phenomenon of awareness towards the deformable 
object has been leveraged in this prototype to make a connection between the physical and the virtual 
world (Gibson 1962). This is further amplified by the physical object/artifact/interface being mapped in 
virtual reality creating a realistic Haptic Visual overlap (Fitzmaurice 1998). The e-textiles interface is an 
unconventional controller that controls an asset within the virtual space.  
 
Discussion Haptic Visual Overlap 
Haptic visual overlap has been demonstrated through Fig 42. Interaction with e-textile interface results in 
corresponding change in the visual form of the 3D virtual sphere asset in virtual reality. Various squishy ball 
shaped prototypes were created as a part of this series of prototyping, these primarily use the tactile, 
tangible and easily manipulative (i.e. displacement) nature of the textile materials to its advantage. These 
have been discussed ahead in Prototype 5.B, 5.C, 5.D and then in the final Prototype 6.

Prototype 5.B     Comparing physical material stiffness (haptic compliance) of three different materials to 
one 3D deformable virtual asset. 
To further understand tangible, material softness, stiffness, or malleability (haptic compliance), a prototype 
was created with three separate ball interfaces, each made from three different materials (i.e. each having 
different material qualities) but controlling the same 3D virtual sphere asset (3D virtual sphere from 
Prototype 4.A) one at a time. I noted that there was discrete difference in material feel (haptic compliance) 
vs. visual 3D asset deformation, when comparing physical material tangibility to the visual counterpart.  
 
Prototype 5.C   Comparing physical material stiffness (haptic compliance) of textile material that have 
three different consistencies to various deformable 3D virtual asset.  
To further understand tangible material softness, stiffness, or malleability (haptic compliance), a prototype 
was created with three separate squishy ball interfaces, each made from the same material (i.e. wool) but 
each having different haptic compliance, each controlling three different 3D virtual sphere assets, one at a 
time. This prototype has been set up for testing the nature of haptic compliance of materials and to 
qualitatively understand if the participants can distinguish between similar stiffness and malleability (haptic 
compliance) of physical interface and match them to their respective 3D visual deformable assets. The 
virtual aspect of this prototype was rendered on Oculus Rift VR.

6.5.3 Testing Prototype 5.C 
This test differentiates physical haptic compliance (i.e. stiffness and flexibility) of e-textile materials when 
compared to their 3D visual assets using qualitative analysis in a virtual reality environment.  
 
Fig. 46 Test Setup for Prototype 5.C 
 
75 
 
During this test, different kinds of physical materials (i.e. different degrees of stiffness or flexibility) that 
create different perceived deformation in 3D virtual visual assets were investigated.  It tests the ability of 
user to discriminate between varying simulated visual deformations in 3D visual assets within a virtual 
reality setup shown in Fig. 46. Qualitative feedback about interacting with an e-textile interface for virtual  
reality applications were collected.  
The task and procedure is set in a virtual reality environment, the participant manipulates three 3D visual 
assets with different virtual deformations using e-textile interfaces created during Prototype 5.C. The 
participant was asked to sort these 3D visual assets with their most preferred choice in ascending order. 
After the participant completed three rounds of the sorting experiment, qualitative feedback was 
requested.  
For the participants to become used to the e-textile interfaces/objects they were shown cues of how to 
interface with them before the study began. During the testing process the participant were allowed to 
freely explore each of these e-textile interfaces with their 3D visual asset for 3 minutes within virtual reality, 
each before being asked to fill out the feedback form.  
 
Reflections on Prototype Feedback 5.C 
This test was designed to understand how stiffness and firmness (i.e. force compliance) of physical materials 
can be matched to corresponding 3D simulations in virtual reality. Several people were asked to physically 
interface with e-textile objects and their observations were recorded both verbally and in a written 
questionnaire. 
Participants mentioned that the objects in their hand (i.e. e-textile interface) felt “soft” and “spongy”. They 
also said that the feel of the objects made them want to continue touching and manipulate them. Learning 
- soft deformable objects encourage active touch (Gibson 1968).  
76 
 
Participants also commented that the corresponding simulation was responsive yet surprising, that it was 
against their expected perception. Learning - the corresponding graphics in virtual reality did not mimic the 
change in physical object manipulation. To make an immediate connection with a user it was important to 
map the simulation to the physical object deformation. 
The user tests also revealed that untethered physical objects are more difficult to haptically locate in space. 
This is due to a lack of depth perception in virtual reality because the placement of the hand in physical 
space doesn’t match the placement of the 3D virtual object. 
 
Prototype 5.D spatial arrangement of three different physical material stiffness (haptic compliance) to 
create an e-textile interface. 
To further promote active touch, the materials and their corresponding 3D visual assets were arranged in 
physical space (Fig. 47a) and also in virtual reality (Fig. 47b). The spatial arrangement of elements is one of 
the key characteristics of the physical properties of tangible objects/artifacts/interfaces as discussed in 
Chapter 2.1.1.

The virtual aspect of this Prototype 5.D was rendered on Oculus Rift VR.  
The first round of virtual reality development took place on a Samsung S8 Mobile device on the Android 
platform, as illustrated in Fig.40 and Fig.43. The 3D visual asset in virtual reality was created in Unity 3D and 
were loaded on the device. The Unity 3D file acted like a localized app that could be accessed through 
Oculus Gear VR headset. I was able to use up to 3-4 sensor inputs using the HC-05 Bluetooth module that 
was connected to the mobile device through the Bluetooth to the phone device. 
The second round of virtual reality development took place on the Oculus Rift device. This allowed for faster 
virtual reality development because it is a far robust system. The microcontroller connects to the PC via 
USB which provided continuous and significantly improved data transfer and improved response time.  
 
6.5.4 Testing Prototype 5.D 
This test differentiates physical, haptic, compliance (i.e. stiffness and flexibility) of e-textile materials. Using 
qualitative analysis in a virtual reality environment, this test compares the stiffness of physical haptic 
objects to deformation of 3D visual assets. 
Utilizing reflections about material softness/stiffness and the placement in objects in physical space from 
the previous prototyping setup, I created another prototype where users interacted with physical objects 
78 
 
that possessed different force compliances. These objects were stacked in physical space in a cactus-like 
configuration (Fig 47a). This arrangement created a continuous surface that users inspected with their 
hands. The virtual object visually represented the physical object and the user was asked to compare the 
various physical stiffness of the e-textile interface to the 3D visual objects in virtual reality. 
 
Reflections on Prototype Test 5.D  
During the testing of this prototype I realized it was tough for the user to move from one object to another 
because the individual, physical, objects were tightly packed against each other. Hand dexterity in physical 
space is difficult if the 3D virtual object position and placement is not well separated. Also, the users 
commented that manipulating objects in virtual space without the presence of a virtual hand was difficult, 
but manageable.  
 
6.5.5 Prototyping 
Gesture ‘Squeeze’ 
These prototypes explored creating sensors from soft, conductive wool Eeonyx’s material. The conductive 
wool was either encased or glued to a stretch knit fabric. Fig. 49 shows an image of a stretchable knit fabric 
with two patches of conductive wool adhered on the surface using industrial glue. Adhering conductive 
wool on the surface of fabric created a point of resistance, and by having multiple such points of resistance 
built into the fabric using this technique, it is possible to create a resistive e-textile surface that was pressure 
sensitive. As the top surface of the e-textile conductive wool patch is pressed, pushed or squeezed the 
resistance within it changes, this creates a change in value of the data recorded. Depending on the intensity 
79 
 
of the pressure, the data received from the sensor changes from high to low as noted in Fig.50 Image 3 
from the right.  
 
Fig.49 Pressure sensor made from conductive wool and adhered to stretchable knit fabric. 
 
 
Fig.50 Conductive wool pressure sensor. (Left) Three pressure sensors created by encasing e-wool 
substrate. (Extreme right) Ball with three sensor inputs. 
In another exploration using conductive wool, pressure sensors were created by encasing the conductive 
wool between two conductive surfaces. The conductive surface was made using conductive iron-on fabric 
as shown in Fig. 50, the second image from the right. When pressure is applied to the sensor, the resistance 
value changes. Higher pressure results in lower resistance values while lower pressure results in higher 
resistance values. 
The data received from the sensor manipulate a 3D deformable sphere asset in Unity 3D virtual reality 
platform. These pressure sensors have been created so that they can be easily incorporated within soft 
moldable fabrics. Due to their soft material nature, these sensors can easily be incorporated within fabrics, 
80 
 
such that, during interaction the user cannot to determine they are present. This leads to a more cohesive 
and non-obstructive interaction. 
 
 
Fig. 51 Three pressure sensor input and HC05 Bluetooth module 
 
At this stage of prototyping, I had shifted to creating interfaces with multi sensor inputs. This is illustrated 
in the setup in Fig.51. where three sensors created from conductive wool can be seen attached to the 
Bluetooth setup. Prototype 5.C and Prototype 5.D use Oculus Rift setup so the sensor data is directly fed 
using USB. 
In conclusion it can be said that a series of e-textile interfaces were made during this project. These were 
created using the framework of Tangible User Interfaces, the theories of Active Touch and Haptic Visual 
overlap. The e-textile interface went through an explorative phase where, I worked and created several 
ideas and then prototypes of them. Further, prototype “Boomerang” (Prototype 6.) reflects a cumulative 
understanding of how the theoretical framework was applied while using the Research through Design 
methodology in creation. 
 
81 
 
6.6 Prototype 6. Boomerang 
6.6.1 Prototype Description 
Prototype 6. describes a series of e-textile objects/artifacts/interfaces created from a combination of 
conductive materials (i.e. soft conductive wool Eeonyx material) and conductive and non-conductive yarn. 
These objects/artifacts were be made from knitted fabrics that allow easy deformation and soft interactive 
surfaces that amplify the haptic experience.  
 
Fig.52 “Boomerang” Prototype 6. Setup 
 
They were displayed in an interaction space (i.e. table) Fig. 48. The objects/artifacts/interfaces in physical 
space was mapped in virtual reality as 3D virtual assets (i.e. similar to Fig. 46a and 46b).  While 
experimenting with the spatial arrangement of objects/artifacts /interface, the arrangement of material 
that leads to more exposed surface areas seemed to promote better interaction. The e-textile 
objects/artifacts/interfaces were constructed from feedback received during testing. 
82 
 
 
Fig.53a “Boomerang” Prototype (left) Physical object details; (right) Virtual environment 
 
The physical interface in prototype Boomerang, is a soft, wool, knitted fabric that’s cast over sponge and 
deformable rubber. Users can easily manipulate this textile interface using their hand and as a result the 
interface can adopt varied shapes. The soft sensors embedded within the textiles can take the form of 
various objects and as the user presses and deforms the shape, the sensors process the changing shape and 
form. A microprocessor reads the collected data and then uses the data to manipulate the actual, 
deformations onto the 3D visual asset in virtual reality. 
 
In prototype Boomerang, various kinds of touch have been explored using the resistive properties of e-
textiles. These are shown in the following illustrations. 
 
83 
 
A. “Grab” type interaction 
 
 
Fig.53b “Boomerang” Prototype (left) “Grab” interaction with physical interface; (right) corresponding 
real-time change in virtual environment 
 
To enable a “grab” interaction, the user tightly grasps the textile object, causing the 3D virtual asset to 
bloom. In this case, the virtual object expands because the e-textile snugly fits the shape of the physical 
object. 
The textile sensor is made from conductive wool that has been sandwiched between two strips of 
conductive fabric. Each time the physical interface is tightly grasped, change is recorded in the resistance 
of the sensor and the received data deforms the virtual asset.  
 
B. “Squish” type interaction 
 
 
Fig.53c “Boomerang” Prototype (left) “Squish” interaction with physical interface; (right) corresponding 
real-time change in virtual environment 
 
In a “squish” interaction, the fabric loosely adheres to the physical object and leaves room for more 
deformation. The virtual object responds to the changing shape of physical object. In the above example, 
the virtual asset contracts. 
 
84 
 
C. “Pat” type interaction 
 
 
Fig.53d “Boomerang” Prototype (left) “Pat” interaction with physical interface; (right) corresponding 
real-time change in virtual environment 
In a “pat” interaction, the user explores a flat, soft, surface. The virtual asset can be deformed and in this 
example, when the fabric is pressed the 3D asset splatters. 
The 3D visual assets in virtual reality have been designed to react to objects in the physical interface. 
Physical objects in the interface are augmented with computational capabilities that allow for data to be 
accessed from them and then this data can be used to control assets in the virtual reality space. The virtual 
reality experience accentuates the feel of the interaction by blocking out other visual, peripheral 
distractions and centering awareness on the changing asset.  
 
In the virtual space, the asset can be deformed. For example in the “Grab” interaction, the 3D asset grows. 
It’s important to note that this change, while triggered in the actual world, is only evident in the virtual 
world. In other words, the virtual asset grows while the e-textile remains the same size. However, in the 
“Pat” interaction, both the 3D visual asset and the physical asset deform in parallel. 
 
 
 
85 
 
 
Fig.53e “Boomerang” Prototype (top) Virtual table layout; (bottom) Physical object layout 
  
The shape and the height of the table were built for human interaction. The user sits or stands in front of 
the table and explores the interact-able objects present on the table surface. The table is arc-shaped and 
this allows for bodily movement of 110 degrees from right to left and left to right.  
In the previous prototypes the physical objects were untethered and could easily be spatially reoriented 
and arranged in 3D space. In prototype Boomerang, the objects are fastened to a stationary table surface. 
This gives the user a better understanding of the physical position in the virtual environment because the 
physical prototype (i.e. table interface) is mapped to the virtual table (i.e. 3D visual asset). Tethering gives 
the user a better understanding of the tangible object placement and makes the grasping objects easier 
and the interaction more responsive. 
86 
 
6.6.2 Testing 
Using qualitative analysis in a virtual reality environment, this setup compared the e-textile’s stiffness and 
flexibility to their 3D visual assets. This setup evaluated if a relationship could be established between the 
physical object and the virtual objects through haptic inclusion. I created an identical 3D, virtual, model of 
the physical table. The textile objects on the table were computationally augmented with soft e-textile 
sensors that allowed for change and deformation. 
 
Fig.54 Testing Prototype Boomerang  
 
87 
 
I tested different kinds of physical materials (i.e. different degrees of stiffness or flexibility) and their ability 
to create variances in perceived deformations. I also tested a user’s ability to discriminate between various 
simulated deformations. My setup is shown in Fig. 54.  
During this test, different kinds of physical materials (i.e. different degrees of stiffness or flexibility) that 
create different perceived deformation in 3D virtual visual assets were investigated.  It tests the ability of 
user to discriminate between varying simulated visual deformations in 3D visual assets within a virtual 
reality setup shown in Fig. 54. Qualitative feedback about interacting with an e-textile interface for virtual 
reality applications was collected. This prototype also explored various kinds of touch as described in 
Chapter 6.6.1. 
Before the study began, participants were shown cues about how to interact with the e-textile interfaces. 
During the testing process participants freely explored each of the interfaces with their 3D visual asset for 
5 minutes before being asked to fill out the feedback form.  
 
Reflections on Boomerang Feedback  
Initial observations indicated that users were intrigued with the table and wanted to know the table’s 
purpose. A few participants mentioned that they instinctively wanted to “touch” the objects on the table 
and that the table was inviting.  
User number one mentioned that that the physical object was almost “anti-climactic” to the virtual table, 
because the physical objects were soft but in the virtual world they were spiky. They were very intrigued 
with the visual experience in virtual reality especially when reacting to the grasp versus the animation of 
the 3D visual assets. User one stated, “the animation is in direct response in virtual reality. That is super 
cool. It's almost like the notion-every action has a reaction”. They also felt that the virtual object and the 
physical objects were “practically the same”.  
88 
 
User number two described the objects on the table as having different textures and mentioned they were 
like “soft toys” (learning- this resonated with the feedback I received in Prototype 5.D). They described the 
visual experience as very calming and like being in the “clouds”. They also found a correlation with the 
physical objects and the virtual experience.  
The third user said the physical interface “reminds me of Mickey Mouse ears and computer mouse pads. 
The furry stuff reminds me of kid’s toys. The shape of the table reminds me of the clouds.” This was parallel 
to my own thinking and partly my impetus to create this work. The third user also commented on the fact 
that it was inconvenient to see their own hands in virtual reality. 
 
Summary 
Prototype Boomerang considerably improved user’s hand movement. Compared to previous prototypes, 
5.C and 5.D, Boomerang users freely navigated from one interactive object to another. Boomerang users 
also took full advantage of the arcing table and turned from end to end, in an arc of 110 degrees. This 
mobility expanded users sense of freedom and made the virtual experience more realistic, especially 
because the user could view the 3D assets up close and therefore have spontaneous interaction with them. 
This spontaneity and magnification was possible because the physical table was mapped to, and 
coordinated with, the 3D virtual asset. Such coordinated mapping allowed users to explore the tangibility 
of each object and gauge its connection and response to the parallel asset in virtual reality. Users were 
fascinated and intrigued by this overlap between the physical object and the visual experience.

8. Conclusions and Future Directions 
Summary 
Over the last decade, there have been numerous efforts in material research that have enabled interactive 
textiles within digital spaces. Most work focuses on integrating sensors for planar touch gestures such as 
swipe or tap, and thus do not fully take advantage of the ﬂexible, deformable and tangible material 
properties of textile. The resulting work aims to address better interfaces in Human Computer Interaction 
that can be further applied to design within virtual reality.  
 
 At the current time it is limited to hand-held controllers, these devices are built to execute a set of 
instructions activated through touch. Human Computer Interaction in this project is very different, since 
the interface and the virtual reality, intuitively connect or the interface acts as an embodied object taking 
on certain character of the 3D visual asset in virtual reality. This kind of interfacing lends itself to a different 
genre of virtual reality games, where game play becomes more intuitive rather than instructional.  
 
The project connects the intrinsic tactile quality of touch and the tangible aspects of a material to a visual 
counterpart. This aspect can be used in cognitive therapy where phobias (Carlin, Hoffman and Weghorst 
1997) and sense-based disorders that are being cured using virtual reality and tactile objects. Virtual Reality 
is also being considered an effective way of teaching skills that are hard to practice in the real world. 
Including haptics element to virtual reality now allow medics to train without having to test out their basic 
skills on an actual patient. 
During this thesis, various explorations were created with the aim of producing more responsive e-textiles. 
A review of the research questions and my findings are provided here. 
 
90 
 
1. How might the physical affordances of textiles be used as part of a tangible user interface for a 
virtual reality experience? 
 In the various prototypes, textile materials (i.e. yarns, fabrics) have been crocheted and knitted and 
physically worked upon to create e-textile materials that can be cast over sponge and deformable rubber 
to form the physical interface conducive for interaction using the hands. The e-textile materials can take 
the shape of objects and also allow the user to manipulate them using their hands freely. The soft sensors 
embedded within the textiles takes the shape and form of the objects and follow the path of deformation 
as the user presses or deforms them. The data collected from the deformation of these textile objects is 
read by a microprocessor and is used to manipulate 3D virtual visual asset in virtual reality. The physical 
object deformation is mapped to the virtual asset transformation.  
 
2. How can the conductive and resistive properties of electronic textiles be used to detect different 
kinds of touch?  
Various kinds of touch have been explored during the creation of various artifacts/objects and interfaces 
during the course of this project. These include “grab”, “squish”, “drag”, and “pat”. These have all been 
constructed through the use of employing e-textile sensors embedded within physical objects that have 
certain shape and size and that promote active touch. The respective shape of the physical object entertain 
certain kind of touch and the interface has been designed to exploit this tendency. 
 
3. How can 3D visual assets in virtual reality respond to changing conditions of objects in the physical 
world?  
The 3D visual assets in virtual reality have been designed to react to objects in the physical interface. 
Physical objects in the interface are augmented with computational capabilities that allow for data to be 
accessed from them and then this data can be used to control assets in the virtual reality space.  
 
91 
 
While previous prototypes showed some promise in integrating e-textiles within virtual reality worlds, 
creating physical interfaces was difficult for several reasons. The main problem was the number of sensors 
that could be incorporated into the interface. In early interfaces like the Knitted Disks, the Hand Fan, and 
the Squishy Ball, I placed 1-3 sensors and used a Samsung S8 device and Gear VR setup. However, in my 
final interface, Prototype Boomerang, I placed twenty sensors and these additional sensors affected the 
frame rate. Additional controllers required additional sensors that led to negatively affect the frame rate 
and cause distortions in the viewing experience in virtual reality. I solved this problem by using fewer 
sensors within each physical object and placing them in a manner that would have maximum impact during 
interaction. 
 
Reflections 
Some reflections in this space are to do with views on ubiquitous computing and its influence on virtual 
reality in the future. Computing is a ubiquitous entity that collects information on the current human 
condition. It’s an insatiable data-collecting machine tracking our likes and dislikes, what we buy and what 
we think about what we buy, what we watch and what games we play, where we travel and even what we 
eat. We often think of machines as teaching us, but in reality, it’s the opposite. Not only are we are complicit 
in their data collection, but by creating devices that easily transmit and share data, we are teaching 
computers how to process and retain information about us.  
 
E-textile sensors can be networked easily and this ease highlights a proliferated, but nascent, visual 
intelligence ready to be taught, molded, and shaped. In the future of embedded technologies it will be 
challenging to differentiate electronics from every day, non-computational, objects. Virtual reality will soon 
exist as a parallel and alternate reality where people will spend large amounts of time in a digital created 
and curated environment. These environments will be efficient spaces to work, shop, entertainment, and 
coordinate with other people and obviously we will access them through our exiting physical environment. 
92 
 
Future Directions 
Moving forward, I am particularly interested in developing my work in the construction of e-textile sensors 
and actuators that are built into the structure of the fabric instead of those that are externally applied to 
the surface of the textile material. I am also interested in aspects of social computing with fabrics where 
the incorporation of cultural identity of textiles will play a larger role in digital spaces. I would like to further 
continue my work with Tangible User Interfaces and on the relationship of the object/artifact and its 
embodiment in digital spaces and also apply my learning on haptic inclusion in VR to other sense based 
interactions within this space. 
 
In conclusion it can be said that the physical interactions within virtual reality spaces are predominately 
through hand-held plastic controllers, featuring buttons and force-feedback cues such as vibration. This 
project attempts to connect the user and the virtual space via haptic links. By utilizing controllers that are 
soft, touch-based, interfaces, users can control 3D visual assets in virtual reality and foreground sense-
based experiences in a virtual space. Haptics influence virtual reality spaces in a myriad of ways.  Passive 
haptics can be computationally enabled and specifically designed to react to touch. After user testing and 
qualitative feedback, Prototype Boomerang successfully proved that the connection between virtual space 
and physical space is possible. Boomerang also proved that users of virtual reality have richer and more 
impactful experiences when haptic input and experience is integrated into their virtual reality experiences. 
With the addition of haptic input and control users reported that they explored space better, and that were 
able to have spontaneous real-time interactions.  
 
Certainly, the days of rigid plastic controllers with simple and limited feedback are numbered. As the virtual 
reality experiences grow more dimensional and sensorial in their attempt to replicate and augment real 
life, users will demand controllers with increased haptic capabilities and an expansive range of intuitive and 
powerful options.  Boomerang is the beginning of such an exploration. Textiles have been a part of society 
93 
 
for centuries and Boomerang is a first and valuable step into taking advantage of a user’s inherent familiarity 
with fabric and using that knowledge to deepen, expand and enrich the virtual reality experiences. By 
combining the known with the unknown, a third level of knowledge is created and this liminal space is rich 
in possibility for both virtual reality developers and virtual reality consumers.

Appendix A.   Test Questionnaire and Answers 5.C 
Verbal questions during the Test: 
A.  Describe how does the physical object (A) feel to touch?  
B.  Describe the visual experience? 
C.  Which of the visuals (A1, A2, A3) is closest to the feel of the physical object (A)?  
Written questionnaire after the Test: 
A. Does the virtual represent the physical objects in the way it “looks”? 
B. How close is the what you “feel” to the virtual experience? 
C. Describe in few words the tangible qualities of the physical interface? 
 
Feedback on Prototype 5.C 
 
Feedback 1. 
The objects in the hand feel “soft” and “spongy”. It feels larger than the object in hand. A2 was 
closest to the physical object. The object in the hand and the visual looked very similar. The 
graphics can be improved, it was a little inconsistent with the hand movement. The softness of the 
material makes me want to touch it more and more. 
 
Feedback 2. 
The ball is “squishy” and good to touch. The space is very empty and strange, the visuals look like 
blobs. A2 is closest to the ball. It is quite similar but the graphics should be improved, it is not very 
enjoyable. The squishy feel and the animation do not match that well, it can be made better. The 
ball is “soft” and “toy like”. 
104 
 
Appendix B.   Test Questionnaire and Answers 5.D 
Verbal questions during the Test: 
A.  Describe how does the physical object feel to touch?  
B.  Describe the visual experience? 
C.  Are the visuals close to the feel of the physical objects?  
Written questionnaire after the Test: 
A. Does the virtual represent the physical objects in the way it “looks”? 
B. How close is the what you “feel” to the virtual experience? 
C. Describe in few words the tangible qualities of the physical interface? 
 
Feedback on Prototype 5.D 
 
Feedback 1. 
The interface was described as a medium-to-hard stuffed animal that is not too soft and not too 
hard “medium squishy”. It was also described as a warm sweater. The virtual objects were 
described to be close in “look” but it was suggested that the overall visual impact could be 
improved. Not much differences were made between the 3D visual assets. 
 
Feedback 2. 
The objects in virtual reality were described to have a very quick response to squeezing actions 
and response to different pressure strength. “It’s very responsive but it still needs to develop, the 
effects in the software can be made more accurate.”  The simulations were described as being “bit 
105 
 
beyond the physics”. For example, when the interface was squeezed it was expected that the 3D 
virtual asset would shrink in the same direction as the object. 
The appearance of the 3D visual asset was described pretty much the same as the physical object, 
but that the texture can be improved and made more fluffy. The experience overall was described 
as very responsive and interesting. 
 
Feedback 3. 
The physical touch was described as delicate and soft, that encouraged touching “again and again” 
also the form was described as being constructed in a manner that “created a relationship with 
the hand”. The virtual reality experience was described as being a good visual impact but that more 
possibilities could be explored in terms of 3D asset deformation “It could be made more reactive 
and responsive.” Overall it was described as a connecting experience.

Appendix C.  Test Questionnaire and Answers Prototype 6 
A.  Describe how does the physical object feel to touch?  
B.   Describe the visual experience in virtual reality? 
C.  How close is what you feel (i.e. physical object) to the virtual experience?  
 
Feedback on Prototype Boomerang 
Feedback 1. 
A. They feel like almost anti-climactic to the virtual world. As in real life they're soft but in the 
virtual world they're spiky. Also doesn't remind me of anything. 
B. The visual experience is intriguing, based on the pressure points of the physical objects, the 
animation is in direct response in VR. That is super cool. It's almost like the notion, ""every action 
has a reaction"": this is a direct relation to this saying. 
C. B and C are connected. They're practically the same. 
 
Feedback 2. 
A. The objects on the table have different textures. It feels like playing with “soft toys”. 
B. The visual experience is very peaceful, it is very calm in the clouds. I like it. 
C. The objects on the table and the visuals in virtual reality are nearly the same when they are 
touched. The response is very good. 
 
Feedback 3. 
A. It reminds me of Mickey Mouse ears and computer mouse pads. The furry stuff reminds me of 
kid’s toys. The shape of the table reminds me of the clouds. 
B. The very good feeling place, although I may fall through the ground. It feels like floating in the 
cloud. 
C. On touching the object, feels very strange at first but I got used to it very fast and also it took a 
while to understand where my hand were because I could not see them in virtual reality.

Objectives  
The main objective of this study was to explore the attitudes towards virtual 
reality gaming and the products surrounding it to identify the reasons why 
consumers choose to purchase and adopt the usage of these devices. The 
study also analyzes the components of added value that virtual reality gaming 
brings on top of a more traditional gaming experience 
 
 
 
Summary  
An extensive examination of already published academic research regarding 
product adoption and value concept was conducted to realize the key notions 
that would act as the cornerstones of the primary research. A quantitative 
survey was designed for the relevant sample to see whether the earlier findings 
on the topics of product adoption and value concept resonated with the results 
gathered from the survey focusing on virtual reality gaming and the products 
surrounding it. 
 
 
Conclusions 
The research shows that the product adoption in the virtual reality gaming 
market essentially operates under the already established concepts of product 
adoption. The emphasis on the influence of early adopters and leading-edge 
users was apparent in the survey results. 
The elements of additional value gained from the virtual reality gaming can be 
categorized to health, social and experimental value that link to utility and 
satisfaction aspects of existing value concepts. 
Virtual reality gaming market has enormous potential for businesses of various 
fields varying from hardware to B2B solutions to eCommerce. As the market 
matures from the hype cycle stage of technology market development towards 
the sustainable market stage, the potential customer base of alternative 
realities should enable mass consumerism.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
This section of the thesis focuses on the introduction of the topic under study. It will delve 
into the reasons of why the subject is a compelling area of inspection and why it deserves 
to be scrutinized further. The section will also include the pivotal research problems 
surrounding the field and proposes questions that should be tapped into to actualize the 
objectives of the research introduced in the end of the section. 
 
 
1.1.  Background 
 
Video games and gaming as a form of entertainment is a phenomenon that has had many 
shapes and forms during its relatively short existence so far. Early 1970s saw the first 
emergence of video game consoles that were connectable to regular television setups 
which opened a whole new market to the consumers to enjoy. Ever since, the product 
designers and developers in the video game industry have attempted to discover the 
ultimate source of competitive advantage over their competitors, offering different solutions 
to their customers varying from handheld consoles to mobile games to virtual reality 
gaming to tap into the different segments.  
 
Virtual reality gaming in its core has changed massively since its infancy. The concept of 
alternative, controllable reality has been a fascinating subject ever since the 1950s but the 
advancements in technology for it to become an affordable reality for an average 
consumer of the video games market have been discovered in the past 10 years. 2010 
saw the first prototype of Oculus Rift which many consider the “grandfather” of the modern 
virtual reality gaming and products. Since then, many large companies in the industry have 
released their own versions of head-mounted displays (HMD) used to enjoy video games 
with virtual reality options, trying to one up their competitors in the new market. 
 
While the predicted growth for the virtual reality gaming market is huge, the adoption of 
this innovative technology has been relatively slow and more traditional gaming options 
still reign supreme over it. This can be due to several factors.

1.2. Significance of Research 
 
According to several sources, the market of virtual/augmented reality gaming is predicted 
to grow massively in the following years from its already relatively large share. Being able 
to contribute to the subject matter with my research will be beneficial for the field that is still 
relatively unexplored. On top of contributing to the field of academic research regarding 
the attitudes towards virtual reality gaming and the products surrounding it, the data 
gathered during the primary research of the thesis could prove to be useful for the existing 
and future designers and entrepreneurs who are still in the process of entering the market 
and are exploring for a source of competitive advantage 
 
 
1.3. Research Problem 
 
The rather slow adoption of virtual reality gaming by consumers and the currently existing 
preference of more traditional gaming experience is most likely a combination of several 
variables. My objective is to provide answers to this by examining the consumer base of 
virtual reality gaming products to discover the components of added value by VR that 
make it more preferred option over a more traditional gaming experience. Discovering the 
alternatives that companies possess to influence the purchase intentions of their 
customers are also an integral part of this study.  
 
 
1.4.  Research Questions 
 
The research questions of this thesis were specifically chosen to establish a common 
thread among the inspected topics and to form a meaningful direction for the primary 
research. The results of the primary research should provide data that aids in answering 
the following research questions: 
 
- What additional value does virtual reality gaming provide in addition to a traditional 
gaming experience? 
- How should companies allocate their resources to effectively influence on the 
purchase intentions of the customers? 
  
3 
 
 
- Does the market of virtual reality gaming operate under the assumptions of already 
established conclusions in the existing academic literature? 
 
 
1.5.  Research Objectives 
 
The objectives of this research are tightly knit into the research questions introduced in the 
former section with the goal of proposing solutions to them. Identifying the value adding 
components of virtual reality gaming over a traditional gaming experience helps us in 
realizing the potential features that could be the focal point when designing a virtual reality 
gaming product. Recognizing the key elements of how a company can influence the 
adoption and purchase decisions of the customers in the virtual reality gaming market aids 
us in determining what kind of marketing strategy could be viable in the different segments 
of the said market. These alternatives will be reached via a carefully crafted survey to the 
relevant sample. The results will also be compared to the existing academic literature to 
detect whether the virtual reality gaming market operates under the same established 
assumptions.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
This literature review was conducted to achieve a better understanding of the existing 
academic and non-academic research and knowledge regarding the themes surrounding 
the subject of the thesis. The review begins with an examination of scholarly work 
published on the topic of adoption of new innovative technologies and products. The 
insight gained from the investigation will be essential in constructing the cornerstones of 
the primary research. 
 
The next section of the literature review will delve into the subject of value for the customer 
and the numerous interpretations of the concept. While this thesis is mainly focused on the 
concept of adoption of new innovative technologies and products, it is necessary to 
scrutinize the research made on customer value as the subject directly ties into the many 
aspects of product adoption and helps in forming a better understanding of the subject 
matter. 
 
Third section of the literature review is reserved for the explanation of virtual reality gaming 
concept and how it came to be. Virtual reality has almost become a synonym for all things 
related to man-made alternative realities, so it is important that we make a clear distinction 
between the existing forms of alternative realities and how they differ from each other. The 
thesis will also present a brief set of information about the current state of the virtual reality 
gaming market as a justification for the importance of the topic. 
 
To conclude, the ending will attempt to synthesize the information acquired from the three 
subjects above in a shape of a conceptual framework to lay a foundation for my primary 
research and what it should consist of.

2.1. New Product/Technology Adoption 
 
Substantial amount of the modern research conducted on the adoption of new 
technologies and products has taken inspiration from the early works of Everett Rogers on 
‘Diffusion of Innovations’ (1962) (Aizstrauta et al., 2014: 73). In his theory, Rogers (1962) 
explains how innovations tend to spread within interactions among societies and divided 
the adopters of products to innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and 
laggards. While the terminology around the subject is rather universal, several different 
theories have been built upon the work of Rogers (1962) to expand on the knowledge of 
product adoption and diffusion.  
 
Franke et al. (2006) and Midgley et al. (2000) concentrated on the importance of 
innovators in the diffusion process and how they ‘are at the leading edge of important 
trends in the marketplace under study and so are currently experiencing needs that will 
later be experienced by many users in that marketplace’ (Franke et al., 2006: 302). Under 
the assumption that these innovators participate in the communities that are potentially 
interested in adopting a new product, they may act as opinion leaders and therefore can 
have a direct influence in the future decisions of customers (Midgley et al., 2000). On top 
of having positive reinforcement from the original adopters of the product, a study 
conducted by Cenamor et al. (2013) argues that having a base product with a consistent 
in-house complementary product portfolio increases the confidence among the potential 
customers in adopting new products early. 
 
The strong effect of peers on the potential adopters was investigated by Timmor & Katz-
Navon (2008) and Xiong et al. (2016). The work of Timmor & Katz-Navon (2008) was built 
upon the Optimal Distinctiveness Theory that explains product adoption as a psychological 
battle. 
 
“This theory states that social identity derives from a fundamental tension between 
human needs for validation and similarity to others – the need for assimilation – and a 
countervailing need for uniqueness and individuation – the need for differentiation” 
(Timmor & Katz-Navon, 2008: 249). 
 
  
6 
 
 
Using the Optimal Distinctiveness Theory as their groundwork, the authors concluded after 
their testing that the size of the group of adopters had a different effect on the potential 
adopters depending whether their need for assimilation or differentiation was higher than 
the other. Both the need for assimilation and need for differentiation are affected by social 
pressure and group norms (Timmor & Katz-Navon, 2008: 250). The human need for 
differentiation and uniqueness was also noted in the research of Fu & Elliott (2013) of how 
product innovativeness and product knowledge affect the adoption decision of a potential 
customer. The acquirement of new product that a consumer considers innovative can be 
considered an attempt for differentiating oneself from the majority. The bandwagon effect 
caused by the need for assimilation and a large group of adopters was also recognized by 
Xiong et al. (2016) in their theoretical framework on peers and their effect on diffusion of 
innovations. This framework divides peer effects into three distinct categories that occur in 
different stages of the diffusion process: the information effect, the experience effect and 
the externality effect. The initial decision for potential product adoption relies on existing 
basic information about the product, followed by the experience effect consisting of word of 
mouth knowledge of experiences from the earlier adopters of the product and ending in the 
externality effect caused by the adoption patterns of the peers of a potential adopter. 
 
While the research conducted by the authors referenced above in this literature review is 
certainly relevant to my research, it remains to be seen whether the same findings apply in 
the market of virtual reality gaming and products related to it. The relatively short existence 
of modern virtual reality gaming makes it rather challenging to draw any groundbreaking 
conclusions on how the diffusion process work in the market of video games aside from 
the work of Cenamor et al. (2013) on platform adoption in the video game console market 
and the positive effect of existing complementary products. Also, according to Davis (1989: 
319), the lack of valid, high quality concepts for measuring user acceptance made the 
investigation of the topic strenuous. While these concepts may exist today, it shows the 
still developing nature of product adoption research.

2.2. Customer Value 
 
The concept of customer value has become increasingly more important as the global 
markets have developed and evolved over the decades. In his paper about customer 
value, Woodruff (1997) referenced Butz & Goodstein (1996), saying that “more and more 
managers lament that product innovation and quality no longer provide the basis for a 
competitive edge”. Numerous organizations claim that they are providing higher customer 
value and thus acquiring competitive advantage over others. Ironically, these claims will 
remain rather ambiguous as clear-cut definition for customer value hasn’t been crafted so 
far by the scholars of the field (Sánchez-Fernández & Iniesta-Bonillo, 2006: 52; Zeithaml, 
1997). Sánchez-Fernández & Iniesta-Bonillo (2006) add that the effect of variables such 
as cultural values, time frame, place and competition on customer value still need to be 
studied further which makes constructing a universal definition even more challenging. 
 
Before delving further into the discussion about the definition of customer value, it needs to 
be clarified that this thesis is focused on the value a customer receives from a transaction. 
The unclear term of ‘customer value’ has been used for both the value a customer gains 
from a transaction and the value a business gains from the customer in the transaction 
(Woodall, 2003). He cleared this confusion in his paper by separating the term into 
customer lifetime value (CLV) and value for the customer (VC). 
 
It has been recognized how the meaning of customer value differs from person to person 
(Zeithaml, 1997; Sánchez-Fernández & Iniesta-Bonillo, 2006; Lindicˇ & Marques da Silva, 
2011). The product attributes of price, utility, quality and satisfaction tends to equate with 
consumer value depending how much importance a customer gives to a certain trait of the 
product. This partially explains why the term customer value doesn’t have a conclusive 
meaning or why many of the existing frameworks only work within a certain context. In 
business-to-business context, Anderson & Narus (1998) define value as ‘the worth in 
monetary terms of the technical, economic, service and social benefits a customer 
company receives in exchange for the price it pays for a market offering’. After their 
extensive literature review on the research done on customer value and based on the 
framework they developed, Sánchez-Fernández & Iniesta-Bonillo (2006) defined customer 
value the following way 
  
8 
 
 
“Consumer value is a cognitive-affective evaluation of an exchange relationship 
carried out by a person at any stage of the process of purchase decision, 
characterized by a string of tangible and/or intangible elements which determine, and 
are also capable of, a comparative, personal, and preferential judgment conditioned 
by the time, place, and circumstances of the evaluation.”  
(Sánchez-Fernández & Iniesta-Bonillo, 2006) 
 
This definition further demonstrates the ever-changing nature of what value means to a 
potential customer at different points of the transaction.  
 
The vague structure of the customer value concept has exerted additional pressure on 
organizations to carefully examine their potential customer base to work out what they truly 
value about the organization and their products. Lusch et al. (2007), referenced in Frow & 
Payne (2011) suggests that ‘an enterprise cannot create value, but can only offer VPs’ (VP 
= value proposition). Payne et al. (2017) referred to Webster (2002) that a customer value 
proposition ‘should be the firm’s single most important organizing principle’. Payne et al. 
(2017) also argue that while the term customer value proposition is one of the most 
popular terms thrown around in the business world, both practitioners and scholars do not 
fully grasp the idea behind the concept, potentially due to the lack of formidable theoretical 
groundwork. Based on their research done on the earlier work on the concept of customer 
value proposition, the authors define the concept as ‘a strategic tool facilitating 
communication of an organization’s ability to share resources and offer a superior value 
package to targeted customers’ (Payne et al., 2017). From the three perspectives 
mentioned in their article, the emphasis on value co-creation linked to the mutually 
determined customer value proposition perspective has also been considered by other 
scholars in the field (Frow & Payne, 2011; Ranjan & Read, 2016). Including your potential 
customers in the customer value proposition process allows an organization to realize their 
true needs and values and thus allows an organization to refine their customer value 
proposition to be closer to the target.  
 
 
The importance of value co-creation has also been notified in the field of video games. 
Several video game studios have pursued towards more active communication with their 
playerbases, enabled by the evolution of internet and communication platforms such as 
  
9 
 
 
user forums and message boards. A splendid and somewhat extreme example of this can 
be observed in the relaunch of old school version of a sixteen-year-old PC MMORPG 
(Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) Runescape by Jagex Ltd. The 2007 
version of the game was resurrected by the developers due to popular demand 
(http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/rs2007-server) and the content updates the game 
receives are solely decided by the community and players via an in-game polling system, 
requiring 75% majority of votes for an update to be implemented 
(http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/index.ws). While this is a borderline case, 
it demonstrates the importance of recognizing what your customer base truly values and 
then acting upon it. 
 
 
2.3. Virtual Reality Gaming 
 
Alternative reality market has been a target of gargantuan capital investments the past 
decade. 2017 saw a combined figure of 3 billion dollars raised by startups (DigiCapital, 
2018) and DigiCapital (2016) predicts that the combined revenue collected from the virtual 
and augmented reality markets will reach 120 billion dollars globally by the end of 2020. 
Large, well-known enterprises such as Facebook, Sony, Samsung, Google and Apple 
among other competitors have already entered the market with their own attempts to 
appetize the hunger of alternative reality enthusiasts. According to Tim Merel 
(CasualConnect, 2016), alternative reality products are currently in the 1st stage of 
technology market development, the hype cycle and as more of the technological 
challenges get solved, the alternative reality hardware has the potential to emerge as a 
mass consumer product in the future (DigiCapital, 2017). Virtual reality business is as 
topical as ever and the term is liberally thrown around in discussions. But what 
distinguishes virtual reality from its close relatives of augmented and mixed reality? 
 
The current forms of virtual reality are mostly experienced via head-mounted-displays 
(Johnson, 2016) with the goal of absolute immersion and presence. Kazuhiro Takahara, 
the leading virtual reality engineer of the award-winning video game Resident Evil 7: 
Biohazard, was interviewed by Alan Bradley (2017) and explained that their goal was to 
get ‘people to forget that they’re wearing headphones and headset and get truly lost in the 
  
10 
 
 
illusion of being in another world’. Tim Merel (CasualConnect, 2016) estimates that the 
potential market for virtual reality will be in tens of millions of customers. Augmented 
reality differs from virtual reality by trying to offer utility over immersion (Johnson, 2016). 
The basic idea is to add virtual elements to your actual environment via augmented reality 
devices. While the augmented reality experience also requires a user to engage in the 
alternative reality via a wearable gadget, the products do not cover the full field of view of 
the user like the head-mounted-displays of virtual reality but rather comes in shapes such 
as wearable glasses presented by Magic Leap and their product Magic Leap One. It has 
been predicted that as mobile AR will develop from its current early stages, augmented 
reality has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of customers (DigiCapital, 2017). 
Mixed reality on the other hand attempts to provide flexibility by providing the best 
aspects of virtual and augmented reality in one product. As an example, mixed reality 
would allow a customer to interact with virtual reality objects in your regular environment. 
Mixed reality is experienced via a heavier wearable apparatus a lot like the head-mounted-
displays of virtual reality but like with augmented reality gadgets, the products do not cover 
the whole field of view of the user, demonstrated by Microsoft and their product HoloLens. 
So, if the potential of augmented reality market is going to be in hundreds of millions of 
customers compared to tens of millions of customers of virtual reality market, why is it 
important to research this section of the alternative reality field? 
 
Out of the three alternative reality markets I mentioned above, virtual reality market is 
currently the most developed and available to regular consumer markets (Tim Merel, 
CasualConnect, 2016). Merel (2016) also highlighted the importance of maintaining the 
awareness of the potential customers if the alternative reality market wants to reach its 
true potential. Judging the current development, virtual reality will be the one to fill these 
shoes. There are still questions and challenges that need to be solved to truly tap into the 
potential customerbase. Rubin (2014) brought up one of the most common headaches for 
the virtual reality developers by saying: 
 
“In traditional videogame, too much latency is annoying – you push a button and by 
the time your action registers onscreen you’re already dead. But with virtual reality, 
it’s nauseating. If you turn your head and the image on the screen that’s inches from 
your eyes doesn’t adjust instantaneously, your visual system conflicts with your 
vestibular system, and you get sick.” (Rubin, 2014) 
  
11 
 
 
 
There’s the reality that developers of VR don’t only compete against each other but also 
against previous forms of entertainment, such as TVs, smartphones and tablets, that 
consume a considerable amount from a day of a consumer (DigiCapital, 2016). The level 
of immersion presented by a head-mounted-display won’t allow a customer to “2nd screen” 
(doing more than one thing at once) like the other older gadgets do. It is clear from the 
numbers that investors believe in virtual reality and its ability to provide additional value 
over traditional gaming experience, but it remains to be seen how this additional value will 
actualize. 
 
 
2.4 Conceptual Framework 
 
To conclude the literature review section of the thesis, a theoretical framework is 
introduced which will act as a guideline for the remainder of the research. The ideas 
presented in the framework are based on the concepts discussed in the earlier portions of 
the literature review with added elements from the author of the thesis to make it more 
fitting to the market of virtual reality gaming devices. 
 
Figure 1. below is a visual presentation of the framework that was followed in designing 
the primary research portion of the thesis. It is an attempt of explaining how product 
adoption intention turns into either positive or negative decision regarding the adoption 
depending on the influencing factors that shape the opinion of a potential product adopter 
in relation to the value gained from the transaction. Outsider influence, company influence, 
and product attribute influence are suggested as the impactful elements that have the 
power to sway the opinion of the potential adopter in either direction. Following this 
framework, it allows the measurement of these factors in the primary research of the 
thesis.

3. METHODOLOGY 
 
Taking into consideration the time constraints and other factors, it was deemed that a 
meticulously created quantitative survey would be the best course of action to achieve the 
desired amount of data. A quantitative survey enables a swift data gathering process and 
allows a variety of opinions to be collected on the subject matter. The rather short and 
straight to the point nature of the survey was an intentional decision to incentivize people 
to complete it without sacrificing too much of their time. 
 
It was clear from the beginning that the survey respondents should be divided into two 
distinct categories based on whether they already own a virtual reality gaming device or 
whether they have only considered purchasing one. This was decided under the 
assumption that the two categories might have differing opinions on the survey questions 
following the categorization. A third option of not owning a device and not being interested 
in obtaining one was included in order to eliminate the respondents that were interested in 
taking the survey but wouldn’t be able to provide the desired data for the survey. Choosing 
this option would simply take the person to the end of the survey. The respondents were 
also asked to share how often they spend time playing video games weekly to see 
whether the gaming habits have any effect on the attitudes and opinions on the topic. 
 
Regardless of which option the respondents chose regarding the possession of a virtual 
reality gaming device, they were directed to the next phase of the survey that asked 
comparable questions from both subgroups. Slight alterations to the questions asked were 
made depending whether the respondent owned a device or only had considered getting 
one in the future. They were then asked about which brand of virtual reality gaming 
devices they had purchased or were interested in obtaining and how much they paid or are 
willing to pay for them. Following these questions, the respondents were presented with a 
five-point likert-scale to uncover which attributes of the products and the marketing efforts 
of the companies producing the virtual reality gaming devices were most effective in 
influencing the purchase decisions or intentions of the customers.

Table 1. Likert-scale for virtual reality gaming device purchase decision influencers 
 
 
The attributes for the likert-scale were selected based on the information presented in the 
literature review section of the thesis. This ensured that the attributes picked had 
theoretical thought behind them, even if the scholars don’t necessarily agree on all the 
definitions and what they should include. 
 
The survey continued with an inquiry of which elements of virtual reality gaming the 
respondents believed to add value to their gaming experience. They were also asked to 
share whether they participated in any online communities based around virtual reality 
gaming and whether they create their own virtual reality gaming themed content in these 
communities. This question enabled the possibility of unveiling the respondents that 
potentially act as influencers within their communities. The content creators were 
requested to tell whether they had participated in endorsing virtual reality gaming products 
to their followers or subscribers by companies and what they had received as 
compensation for the endorsement deal.

The survey was created using the online survey creation service Webropol. It was opened 
on 6th of March 2018 with the goal of receiving approximately hundred responses to have 
a data set worth analyzing. The survey was shared on the personal Facebook timeline of 
the author, on 6 different subcommunities focusing on virtual reality gaming devices on the 
social news aggregation website Reddit, on 2 official developer supported virtual reality 
gaming device discussion forums, on one 3rd party virtual reality enthusiast discussion 
board and on two separate gaming focused servers within the VoIP (Voice over Internet 
Protocol) application Discord. The aggressive distribution of the survey led to unexpected 
success in terms of responses, allowing the closure of the survey to happen already on the 
8th of March 2018 with a total number of 472 submitted responses. The analysis of the 
data was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 analysis program, mostly focusing on 
the frequency analysis of the responses.

4. FINDINGS 
 
This section of the thesis will be focusing on the results gathered from the quantitative 
survey designed for the purpose of answering the research questions. The section will 
start with a presentation of the demographics to learn about the attributes of the sample. It 
will then proceed to introduce the outcomes from the survey questions regarding the 
possession of virtual reality gaming devices and the attitudes of the respondents towards 
them. Finally, the section will conclude by looking into the participation of the respondents 
in online virtual reality gaming communities and whether some of the individuals that 
participated in the survey could be considered as influencers within their communities.

As seen from table 2. above, a substantial portion of the respondents (40,46%) seem to 
fall in the age bracket of 26 to 35. Overall, the majority of the respondents appear to be 
between the ages of 16 and 45. From all the 472 people who participated in the survey, 
92,58% were male, leaving the percentage of female respondents to 5,51%. The 
remaining 1,91% of the participators didn’t identify themselves belonging to either of the 
two categories or didn’t want to disclose their gender for the research. The measuring of 
the gaming habits of the respondents shows that the majority of the participators could be 
defined as “hardcore gamers”, with 41,52% of the people claiming to play video games on 
daily basis and with 27,97% playing video games at least 4 to 6 times a week (Table 4). 
Table 5. is a representation of the nationalities that took part in the survey. Most of the 
responses recorded were from respondents residing in countries with English as their 
native language (70,00%), with United States of America having the majority 
representation of 48,90%. Overall, the survey managed to reach at least one person from 
each continent of the world.

Overall (n=472) 84,32% 6,56% 9,11% 
 
For the purpose of the research, it was beneficial to divide the respondents into two 
distinct categories to be able to compare the results between the groups to see if the 
perception of virtual reality gaming and the several factors influencing their purchase 
decisions or intentions substantially differed from each other. 84,32% of the respondents 
already possessed some type of a head-mounted virtual reality gaming device, leaving the 
comparison group of potential buyers to 6,56% (Table 6). The remaining 9,11% that didn’t 
own a head-mounted virtual reality gaming device and weren’t interested in acquiring one 
were forwarded to the end of the survey as their input wasn’t needed for the purpose of the 
research.

First question directed towards the people who already owned a head-mounted virtual 
reality gaming device was related to the specific brands of devices they own. Out of the 5 
largest providers of head-mounted displays for virtual reality gaming, the respondents 
were asked to choose every type of device they currently own. 42,46% of the respondents 
were owners of Oculus Rift with HTC Vive following with a portion of 30,15%. Third place 
in terms of ownership belongs to Sony Playstation VR with a representation of 26,38%.

list of options. Google’s cheap virtual reality alternative Cardboard appeared as a popular 
option among the respondents. Other popular devices included in the responses were 
Samsung Odyssey and various Windows Mixed Reality headsets from several different 
developers such as Acer, HP, Dell and Lenovo. One of the respondents had gone as far 
as creating their own head-mounted display from parts of other virtual reality gaming 
devices.

 Mean Std. Deviation Minimum Maximum 
Overall (n=396) $539,42 406,8891 $0 $3078 
 
Out of all the participants who already owned a head-mounted virtual reality gaming 
device, the average price they paid for their device was $539,42 with a standard deviation 
of 406,8891. A lot of the respondents told to have received their device as a gift, explaining 
the $0 in the minimum price paid column in table 7. Among the respondents who 
purchased their own device, the minimum price landed to $35. Highest reported price paid 
for the virtual reality gaming device stands at $3078.

Question 8 of the survey focused on the elements that influenced the purchase decisions 
of the respondents. Judging the average scores of the responses to the likert-scale, the 
most crucial factors influencing the purchase decision were “Usefulness of the device to 
gaming experience” with an average score 4,48 and “User reviews” from other users with 
an average score of 3,90. While the average scores of price (3,85) and ease of use” (3,67) 
were in the upper echelon of influencing factors, they weren’t deemed as important. 
According to the respondents, the effectiveness of product related newsletters from the 
companies was rated low (1,45) along with the endorsement efforts of well-known 
personalities (1,47).

First question directed towards the people who were or had considered purchasing a 
head-mounted virtual reality gaming device was related to the specific brands of the 
devices they would like to obtain, much like for the current owners of virtual reality gaming 
devices. The potential buyers were also asked to tick down every type of device from the 5 
largest providers to reveal their preferences. The popularity of Oculus Rift was also seen in 
the responses of the answers of this group, reaching an enormous percentage of 83,87% 
among the choices of the sample. Similarly, the trend continued with HTC Vive being one

of the most popular options for 48,39% of the survey takers. Instead of Sony Playstation 
VR (29,03%) being the third popular option like among the current owners of virtual reality 
gaming devices, Samsung Gear VR surpassed it with the percentage of 35,48%. 
Respondents that couldn’t find their preferred option from the 5 largest providers seemed 
to be favoring different versions of Windows Mixed Reality from various providers. Oculus 
Go was also mentioned several times among the respondents.

Out of all the participants who were or had considered purchasing a head-mounted virtual 
reality gaming device, the average price they would be willing to pay for obtaining one 
landed at $401,90 with a standard deviation of 160,5707. The lowest price that a person 
would be willing to pay for their virtual reality gaming device among the potential buyers 
stands at $100,00. This value is considerably lower than the highest price that someone 
among the potential buyers was willing to pay ($700,00).

Like for the respondents who already own a virtual reality gaming device, the potential 
buyers were also presented with an identical likert-scale that asked them to rate the 
importance of the different influences that led them into considering the purchase of the 
device of their choice. Like among the current owners of virtual reality gaming devices, 
usefulness of the device to gaming experience and user reviews appeared as the most 
influential elements when it comes to purchase intentions of virtual reality gaming devices, 
scoring 4,71 and 4,52 respectively on average. Price averaged a score of 4,16, being the 
3rd most crucial factor. Instead of ease of use (3,84), the potential buyers seemed to value 
the information available in the websites of the device providers (4,13) higher than the 
current owners of the devices (3,06).

4.4.  Additional value to gaming experience & participation in VR online 
communities 
 
This section of the survey findings gathered responses from both the current owners of 
virtual reality gaming devices and people who have considered purchasing one. The 
division to two distinct groups wasn’t deemed necessary for the following questions and it 
is beneficial to gather the opinions of all the participators whose input is relevant for the 
purpose of the thesis

Question 12 of the online survey conducted attempted to unveil the opinions of the 
respondents regarding the value that virtual reality gaming adds to the gaming experience 
on top of the perceived value a person gains from gaming without the added virtual reality 
element. The options included in the survey question were based on the discussions the 
author had with his thesis supervisor and his close acquaintances regarding what could be 
included in the list. The respondents were also given a choice of listing things not included 
in the initial list. 
 
As expected, the immersion value of virtual reality gaming scored very highly among the 
participants with 96,27% including the option in their answer. New gameplay experience 
(90,21%) and use of new device (75,99%) were the next highest scoring options from the 
list with enhanced control (47,32%) and social aspects (32,87%) being the least important 
value bringers. Other aspects disclosed by the respondents included activities such as 
physical exercising, overcoming social anxieties in multiplayer virtual reality games, 
usefulness of virtual reality in work related instances credited to more intuitive interfaces 
and increasing overall happiness and enjoyment in social gatherings. Some wanted to 
hone their virtual reality gaming skills as an early adopter of the technology as they believe 
that the future of gaming lies in virtual reality. Overall, the users felt that the possibility of 
transforming the games into experiences instead of just games was fulfilling and the fact 
that one can experience new locations without having to physically travel makes it exciting. 
These aspects heavily relate to the high scoring immersion received from the question.

The last four questions of the online survey were designed for the purpose of finding the

who don’t participate in any virtual reality gaming related online communities (170 
respondents) were directed to the end of the survey. 
 
After the division, the people participating in virtual reality gaming related online 
communities (259 respondents) were asked to reveal all the online communities the 
participate in. The question presented the respondents with 8 different generic options that 
the author thought would be most popular among the sample. Majority of the respondents 
were participators in separate subcommunities of the website Reddit (87,69%). YouTube 
(40,77%) and Discord (36,15%) appeared as the 2nd and 3rd most popular locations of 
virtual reality gaming communities with over third of the remaining respondents being part 
of them. The share of people participating into official and 3rd party user discussion forums 
appeared to be rather low with only 29,23% of the participants having them as the 
community of their choice. 
 
Participants were also asked to share their virtual reality gaming related online 
communities that weren’t mentioned in the list of general options. Different communities 
within virtual reality games themselves such as VRChat and RecRoom appeared several 
times in the answers. Steam, a digital distribution platform by Valve, was also mentioned 
several times with its numerous message boards and gaming communities. 
 
Table 16. Do you create virtual reality gaming related content? 
 
 Yes No 
Overall (n=252) 25,79% 74,21% 
 
The overall number of respondents for the question regarding creating virtual reality 
gaming related content is lower due to some of the given 8 communities not including a 
follower/subscriber system for their content creators. Despite this, only one fourth of the 
participators of virtual reality gaming online communities actively created unique content 
for their communities. The content creators were also given an option to share their 
follower/subscriber count with the goal of retrieving more information about the potential 
influencer status of theirs. This question wasn’t a requirement for the completion of the 
survey due to the possibility contractual or personal factors not allowing the participants to 
share the number. The follower/subscriber bases of the respondents varied massively, 
  
29 
 
 
being as small as 0 to 80 to the biggest one being around 1,5 million subscribers. Overall, 
the vagueness of the question made it difficult for some of the respondents to define what 
counts as a subscriber/follower for their content which resulted in some ambiguous 
answers. 
 
Table 17. Have you participated in endorsing a virtual reality gaming device by a 
company’s request? 
 
 Yes No 
Overall (n=69) 7,25% 92,75% 
 
The content creators of virtual reality online communities were asked if companies had 
approached them with any kind of request to endorse their virtual reality gaming devices to 
their followers/subscribers. Surprisingly, only a tiny portion of the content creators (7,25%) 
had been approached with an endorsement deal. 
 
The content creators participating in product endorsement were given an option to tell 
what they received as compensation from the deal. As expected, the compensations 
varied from simple monetary compensations to receiving free video games and a free copy 
of the product they were endorsing. None of the respondents were able to disclose exact 
amounts they received from the endorsement deals.

5. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 
This section of the thesis is reserved for the thorough discussion and analysis of the online 
survey conducted. It will be following the same structure as the previous section, starting 
from an overview of the demographics of the sample, continuing with a comparison of the 
results between the groups of current owners and potential buyers of virtual reality gaming 
devices and the analysis of why the results differed from each other. The section ends with 
an inquiry of the participation of the respondents in virtual reality gaming related online 
communities and a potential explanation of the observed results received from the survey. 
 
As seen from the findings, it can be summarized that a sizable portion of the survey 
participants were young adult males that could be considered “hardcore gamers”, with 
considerable portion playing video games at least 4 to 6 times a week and majority 
enjoying them daily. Almost half of the respondents were from the United States of 
America and already owned some sort of head-mounted virtual reality gaming device. 
These results could be an indication of higher interest of virtual reality gaming or video 
games in general among the male gender or of the gender distribution of the communities 
the survey was shared in. The survey was shared most aggressively in different virtual 
reality gaming related subcommunities of the website Reddit which is based on USA. 
Therefore, it could be an explanation of the highest participation percentage from the 
United States of America. The choices regarding the distribution locations of the survey 
most likely also relate to the high percentage of people already owning a head-mounted 
virtual reality gaming device as the discussions occurring in these locations mostly focus 
on conversations between current owners. 
 
Both the current owners and potential buyers of virtual reality gaming devices seemed to 
have the same preference of devices with Oculus Rift and HTC Vive scoring the highest 
among the participants. This could be due to several factors. The highest score of Oculus 
Rift may be a result of the device being one of the first modern day virtual reality gaming 
headsets in the market, gaining a lot of coverage in the media all over the world. There 
might also be a direct correlation to the response rates from the different virtual reality 
gaming device communities with Oculus and HTC Vive subcommunities of Reddit being 
the most active participators to the survey. The results could also mean that the 
respondents simply perceive these devices to be of higher quality than the other options

currently in the market. From the devices not included in the list of the survey, Windows 
Mixed Reality devices from different companies were frequently mentioned by the 
participators. This is a great reminder that the survey takers should have been made 
aware of the differences between various alternative realities and why virtual reality was 
chosen as the focus for the research. The cheap virtual reality alternative of Google 
Cardboard was mentioned several times among the owners while none of the potential 
buyers showed interest towards the product. This could be explained with the differences 
between early adopters and later adopters. The interest of early adopters towards virtual 
reality experience is more than likely higher than of the people who are still in the process 
of obtaining one. Google Cardboard is an affordable alternative for virtual reality 
experience for a person that just wants to obtain the experience while later adopters most 
likely have stricter demands in terms of the device they’re planning to obtain. Other 
differences between the groups in terms of devices mentioned could be credited to 
companies entering the market with their new devices. 
 
Current owners of virtual reality gaming devices paid $137,52 more for their device on 
average than what the potential buyers are expecting and willing to pay for theirs. This 
also relates to how early adopters tend to operate when it comes to obtaining a new 
product or service. An early adopter tends to be more interested in obtaining the product or 
service and is not as price conscious as they tend to value the new experience over the 
potential monetary loss. On the other hand, it could simply be a reflection of pricing 
changes in the market as the devices have become more common and companies aren’t 
as capable of charging premium for their devices as they no longer are one of the few 
actors in the market. 
 
Both current owners and potential buyers rated user reviews and the usefulness of the 
device to gaming experience as the biggest influencing factors regarding their purchase 
decision or consideration. The usefulness to gaming experience being one of the highest 
rated elements is rather self-explanatory as the survey itself was directed at people using 
virtual reality for gaming purposes. The high rating of user reviews might be due to the 
respondents perceiving the experiences of their peers to be more valid and truthful about 
all the aspects of the devices compared to the information provided by the companies who 
gain nothing from highlighting the potential negative features of their device or 
endorsement of well-known personalities who are paid to persuade their followers in 
  
32 
 
 
obtaining the device. Leading edge users are also considered as big influencer when it 
comes to product adoption. While the price element scored fairly high among both groups, 
it was rated higher on average among the potential buyers. This relates to the same 
explanations about the tendencies of early adopters compared to later adopters already 
discussed in the paragraph discussing the pricing. The higher scoring of website 
information among the potential buyers most likely relates to being able to make 
comparisons between the specifications of the products they have considered obtaining. 
 
According to the respondents, the immersion provided by virtual reality gaming is by far 
the biggest value adding element on top of the traditional gaming experience. This makes 
sense as it is often the most marketed and sought-after feature of these products. Overall, 
the value adding elements the participators listed for the survey question can be compiled 
into 3 separate categories. People felt that virtual reality gaming provided additional 
physical and mental health related value, allowing them to exercise and overcome existing 
social anxieties in a stress-free environment. They identified the added social value of 
virtual reality gaming, increasing the overall happiness and enjoyment in gatherings 
among friends. The experiment value of virtual reality relates to the immersion element of 
virtual reality gaming, allowing the users to transform gaming into an experience that 
doesn’t feel like gaming. 
 
The massive popularity of Reddit as a virtual reality gaming online community can be 
explained in two ways. The design of the website and the user-friendly interfaces are 
made for fostering communities with similar interests. On the other hand, it wasn’t 
surprising to see Reddit as the option receiving the biggest supporting as it was the 
platform that was used the most in distributing the survey. This was due to the highest 
chance of receiving impressions for the survey with the effort required for it. The combined 
number of 351,792 followers among the subcommunities the survey was distributed to 
made it very probable that it would end up being the most popular online community for 
the survey. Discord has risen among the ranks of online community platforms due to its 
features of allowing both text and voice communication within the communities. The 
decline of traditional user forums could be due to the user interfaces and overall usability 
of them being outdated compared to their counterparts. 
 
 
  
33 
 
 
From the members of virtual reality gaming online communities who created their own 
virtual reality gaming content, only a tiny fraction (7,25%) had participated in endorsing a 
virtual reality gaming device by a request of a company. This is either due to the 
participators not being recognized as effective influencers by the companies or companies 
not considering content creator endorsement as an effective method of gaining customers. 
Either way, this seems to resonate with the earlier data gathered of the influencing factors 
regarding the purchase decisions or considerations of virtual reality gaming devices where 
both groups rated the effect of endorsement as one of the lowest influencers. 
 
 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this section of the thesis, the main findings of the survey will be concluded. These 
findings will be used as a reference to explain the implications of the research for 
international business. The section continues by acknowledging the limitations to the study 
conducted and suggests areas of improvement in the future research regarding the topic 
of attitudes towards virtual reality gaming and products. 
 
6.1. Main Findings 
 
To reflect on the findings of the survey, the section will go through each of the research 
questions set in the beginning of the thesis and tries to provide answers to them. 
 
The survey investigated the elements of virtual reality gaming to find out what the current 
and potential future owners of virtual reality gaming devices perceived as value adding on 
top of the traditional gaming experience. As already mentioned in the literature review, the 
product attributes of price, utility, quality and satisfaction tends to equate with consumer 
value depending how much importance a customer gives to a certain trait of the product. 
(Zeithaml, 1997; Sánchez-Fernández & Iniesta-Bonillo, 2006; Lindicˇ & Marques da Silva, 
2011). After the analysis of the survey results, it can be concluded that the respondents 
found the utility and satisfaction as the most value adding factors of virtual reality gaming. 
The health, social and experiment groups of value discussed in the survey findings section 
of the thesis can all be linked to these factors. 
 
  
34 
 
 
The survey also investigated the biggest influencing elements affecting the purchase 
decisions of the respondents to determine how companies should allocate their limited 
resources to effectively persuade their potential customers. The high average score of 
user reviews can be linked to already mentioned aspect of product adoption in the 
literature review. Under the assumption that these innovators participate in the 
communities that are potentially interested in adopting a new product, they may act as 
opinion leaders and therefore can have a direct influence in the future decisions of 
customers (Midgley et al., 2000). However, while Cenamor et al. (2013) argued for the 
importance of consistent in-house complementary product portfolio in increasing the 
confidence of potential customers for product adoption, the survey participators didn’t 
identify with the sentiment as firmly. 
 
Essentially, it can be said that the market of virtual reality gaming devices seems to mostly 
operate under the same conditions already identified in earlier academic research. Judging 
the survey results, emphasizing the importance of leading edge users and early adopters 
as opinion leaders for the potential customers seems to be the way forward. 
 
 
6.2. Implications for International Business 
 
DigiCapital (2016) predicts that the combined revenue collected from the virtual and 
augmented reality markets will reach 120 billion dollars globally by the end of 2020. The 
sheer enormous potential of the virtual reality gaming should be a valid reason itself for 
innovative designers to search for an entry to the market. According to Tim Merel 
(CasualConnect, 2016), the alternative reality devices have the potential to emerge as 
mass consumer devices once the market progresses from the hype cycle towards the later 
stages of technology market development as more technological challenges get solved. 
Additionally, the market isn’t only limited to simple hardware sales of devices. The demand 
for B2B solutions, eCommerce sales, In-app purchases and similar aspects demonstrates 
that the market potential is tangible to wide array of professionals. 
 
 
 
 
  
35 
 
 
6.3. Limitations to the Study 
 
As already mentioned in the literature review section of this thesis, the fact that there is no 
universal consensus on the definition of customer value and what it should entail 
(Sánchez-Fernández & Iniesta-Bonillo, 2006: 52; Zeithaml 1997) makes it rather 
challenging to reach a conclusion on whether the knowledge obtained from the survey 
results can be used as a generalization for other customer value related topics. The way 
an individual comprehends value gained from a transaction and from the use of a product 
or service may differ greatly from person to person which further complicates the process 
of studying customer value. 
 
In the survey, the respondents were asked to provide information of how much they paid 
or were willing to pay for a virtual reality gaming device. While the information is valuable 
and may prove to be useful as a guideline towards pricing of virtual reality gaming 
products, it doesn’t consider the relationship between the price and the purchasing power 
of individuals from various parts of the world. For example, a virtual reality gaming device 
of $200 could be a totally reasonable price for someone when it could be the salary of a 
whole month for someone else. 
 
Due to the short structure of the survey, the chosen aspects of virtual reality gaming 
investigated were chosen on the basis of including the most important elements under the 
magnifying glass. Therefore, the survey isn’t a fully comprehensive analysis of all the 
matters that could have been investigated regarding the subject. Also, the fact that no 
published academic research on the topic was found during the secondary research in the 
context of virtual reality gaming market made singling out the most important components 
somewhat demanding. 
 
The survey included a question of whether the respondent was a content creator within 
their online virtual reality gaming communities and asked to disclose their 
follower/subscriber count with the goal of learning if they could be counted as an influencer 
or not. However, the everchanging nature of what number of followers/subscribers counts 
a person as an influencer can be troublesome. The effectiveness of the messages of a 
more interactive influencer with a smaller follower base can also, in some cases, be 
considerably higher than of an influencer with an enormous following and number of 
  
36 
 
 
impressions per message that isn’t able to connect with their followers/subscribers on such 
a personal level. 
 
Finally, the fact that almost half of the respondents (48,90%) were from the United States 
of America sets an unavoidable bias for the results of the survey which could imply that the 
survey findings cannot be directly implemented in other parts of the world. 
 
 
6.4. Suggestions for Further Research 
 
This thesis focused solely on the virtual reality gaming and products aspect of the 
alternative reality market. Similar research questions could also be investigated in the 
markets of augmented and mixed reality to see whether they significantly differ from each 
other. The scope of the research could also be widened to examine the other segments of 
alternative reality business to actualize the existing potential of them. It would also be 
interesting to see whether the opinions of the potential buyers of virtual reality gaming 
hardware change when the market matures and transitions from the hype cycle stage to 
sustainable market in the technology market development cycle model.

The study also analyzes the components of added value that virtual reality gaming brings on top of a more traditional gaming experience.


An extensive examination of already published academic research regarding product adoption and value concept was conducted to realize the key notions that would act as the cornerstones of the primary research. A quantitative survey was designed for the relevant sample to see whether the earlier findings on the topics of product adoption and value concept resonated with the results gathered from the survey focusing on virtual reality gaming and the products surrounding it.


The research shows that the product adoption in the virtual reality gaming market essentially operates under the already established concepts of product adoption. The emphasis on the influence of early adopters and leading-edge users was apparent in the survey results. The elements of additional value gained from the virtual reality gaming can be categorized to health, social and experimental value that link to utility and satisfaction aspects of existing value concepts.


Virtual reality gaming market has enormous potential for businesses of various fields varying from hardware to B2B solutions to eCommerce.

Key word: Virtual Reality, CALL, Descriptive Text. 
Regarding to the development of the technology, many schools begin to 
adapt technology-based media in purpose of facilitating the learning 
process and attracting students' interest in learning, especially in 
language learning. However, the use of a computer-based media 
commonly called CALL must be attended by an understanding of how 
to adapt the specific media so that the teacher can apply the media in the 
classroom without causing negative effects to students or teachers. This 
study aims to examine how the implementation of using VR as a CALL 
media in the classroom and obtaining the students‘ perceptions toward 
the use of this media in learning English. This research was conducted in 
SMA AL-ISLAM Krian at 10 ips 1 class only. In analyzing the data, the 
researcher wrote the implementation VR clearly and used questionnaire 
to obtain the student‘s perception toward the use of VR by using 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) theory form Davis (2000). The 
result of the research showed that the teacher implemented 5 among 9 
concepts implementing VR in CALL. Whilst the concept which were 
not implemented by the teacher were the reflection of awareness of self 
and awareness of other, interacting with native speaker, and 
manipulation in virtual environment. The reason why the teacher did not 
implement those concepts was because it required an advanced 
technology. Besides, concerning about the student‘s perceptions toward 
the use of VR, many of students considered it as interesting, comfortable 
and useful to use in English language learning.

Kata Kunci: Virtual Reality, CALL, Descriptive Text. 
Berkaitan  dengan berkembangnya teknologi, banyak sekolah yang 
mulai mengadaptasi perangkat media berbasis teknologi dengan maksud 
agar dapat mempermudah proses pembelajaran dan menarik minat siswa 
untuk belajar, khususnya dalam pembelajaran bahasa. Namun 
penggunaan suatu media berbasis komputer yang  biasa disebut CALL 
haruslah disertai dengan pemahaman agar guru dapat menerapkan media 
tersebut di dalam kelas tanpa menimbulkan dampak buruk baik bagi 
siswa ataupun guru. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menguji bagaimana 
penerapan VR sebagai media CALL di dalam kelas dan mengetahui 
presepsi siswa terhadap penerapan media ini dalam pembelajaran bahasa 
inggris. Penelitian ini dilakukan di SMA AL-ISLAM Krian pada siswa 
kelas 10 IPS 1 saja. Dalam menganalisa data, peneliti menulis prosedur 
penerapan VR dengan jelas dan menggunakan kuesioner untuk 
mengetahui presepsi siswa terhadap penerapan VR dengan 
menggunakan Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) oleh Davis. Hasil 
penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa dalam prosedur penerapan VR, guru 
menerapkan 5 dari 9 konsep implementasi VR ke dalam CALL. Adapun 
konsep yang tidak diterapkan oleh guru adalah refleksi terhadap dari 
kesadaran orang lain, berinteraksi dengan orang asli, dan manipulasi 
dalam lingkungan virtual. Alasan tidak diikutsertakannya tahap ini 
adalah karena tipe VR yang digunakan guru tidak mampu mendukung 
aspek tersebut dalam pembelajaran bahasa inggris.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter contains why the researcher is concerned about the use 
of Virtual Reality. It includes (1) research background (2) research 
problem (3) objective of the study (4) significance of the study (5) scope 
and limitation (6) definition of key terms.  
A. Research Background 
Today technology has growth fast. Every aspect in the world 
especially in teaching learning process integrated and helped so much by 
the technology. Therefore, a creative teacher must be able to bring the 
technology in the learning process to create a good learning experience 
for students. In Indonesia, it was attached in PEMENDIKNAS No 16 
tahun 2007 that the teacher must be able to use information and 
communication technology in the learning process
1
. Reeves (1998) 
defined that learning with technology means to use the technologies as 
cognitive tools to create constructivist learning environment
2
.  
The use of technology as a media in the learning is very 
important especially in the English Language Teaching (ELT). Linfors 
(1987) state that vision and hearing are the two dominant senses that 
media technology can provide to the students and present greater 
opportunities for learning linguistic input
3
. It is also important for the 
teacher in selecting media to be used in the classroom. Wright (1989) 
mentioned some consideration in selecting media: it should be easy to 
prepare, it should be easy to organize, it should be interesting to the 
student and teacher, and the language must be authentic
4
. By the passing 
of the time, many kind of technology that can be used as media in 
language learning, one of them is Virtual Reality (VR).

Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer technology that gives the 
illusion to those who use it, of being immersed in a virtual environment 
that does not really exist.  It is a computer simulation of real situation 
where the human subject may interact with the virtual environment. 
Sometimes by the mean of non-conventional interface like glasses and 
helmets in which the scene represented and the sound reproduced
5
. Most 
of people already have known today‘s VR for much different kind of 
application such as video games, 3D video through smartphone and 
tablet. At this time, the majority of educators have not yet understood 
that VR could be used as a teaching and learning tool to enhance 
student‘s learning experience by implications of these developments in 
the learning process
6
.  
In this study, the researcher focused on identifying the 
implementation process of Virtual Reality (VR) as a media to teach 
descriptive text. VR is considered as appropriate media in learning 
descriptive text, because by using VR students can observing the object 
or thing that will be descripted clearly in the virtual environment. The 
researcher will also examine the student‘s responses about the use of VR 
in learning descriptive text to provide the reflection for the English 
teacher in order to make the better way in developing of the usage of VR 
for other material. Freiberg and Stein stated that the perception of the 
student is the key components to analyse the classroom climate
7
.  
Virtual Reality device has been used in the teaching process by 
the English teacher at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian. Each class in SMA AL-
ISLAM Krian has LCD, Projector, and other supporting facility. Wi-Fi 
access with the fast connection speed is also provided at whole of the 
school, so the teachers and the students can connect to the internet 
easily. Almost 95 % of SMA AL-ISLAM students have a smartphone 
that can support the use of VR devices in the learning process. The 
material could be obtained from the YouTube or App store such as 
Playstore. Based on conversation researcher with the English Teacher of

SMA AL-ISLAM Krian, the limited amount of VR glasses is the only 
problems faced by the English teacher. To overcome that problem the 
English teacher asks the students to make a group and use the VR by 
turn. Finally, the researcher chooses SMA AL-ISLAM as the Setting of 
the research, because the English teacher has used VR to teach 
descriptive text in his class. 
The researcher will take one class as an object to conduct the 
research. The researcher will analyze and observe the whole learning 
process by comparing the English teacher‘s lesson plan and the real 
learning process in the class. The researcher will also give questionnaire 
to measure how much students are aware of the use of VR as a media in 
learning descriptive text.  According to Slameto (2003), in measuring 
the perception is almost the same as measuring the attitude. The attitude 
scale can be used or modified to uncover perception that can be known 
whether perception of one‘s positive or negative toward something or 
object
8
. Considering this, the researcher will use Likert scale to 
obtaining the responses of students toward the use of Virtual Reality. 
The other research talking about Virtual Reality is the research 
by I Putu entitled Aplikasi Virtual Reality Media Pembelajaran Sistem 
Tata Surya. In this research I Putu Focused on the implementation of 
Virtual Reality as the media in learning the solar system. The object is 6 
grade students of SD Sukabirus. The finding of the research is the users 
agree that Virtual Reality as a media in learning solar system is effective 
can make the learning process easier and more fun. The conclusion 
obtained from the questionnaire with 60% for the agreement on content 
aspect
9
. Another research done by Mubarak Alfadil entitled Virtual 
Reality Game Classroom Implementation: Teacher Perspective and 
Student Learning Outcome. The researchers focused on the influence of 
the Virtual Reality Game (VRG) House of Languages on ESL 
vocabulary acquisition of intermediate school students and establish 
how the VR technology aids in improving vocabulary skill. The finding 
from the study indicated that students using the VR game House of

E. Scope and Limitation of The Study 
According to the topic above, the scope of this study is 
the teacher‘s way in implementing virtual reality as media in 
English language learning especially in learning descriptive 
text. The limitation of this study is using virtual reality that will 
be conducted at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian. The object of this 
research will be limited to tenth grade of SMA AL-ISLAM 
Krian. The reason why researcher takes the tenth grade because 
the students has high motivation in learn English  and the 
teacher has an innovation to enhance the student‘s learning 
experience by using an interesting media. 
F. Definition of Key Terms   
To avoid misunderstanding and misinterpretation, the 
researcher would like to describe some terms used in this 
research as follows: 
1. Virtual Reality 
 Kimer defined virtual reality as a computer interface 
that permits the user to interact in real time, in a 
tridimensional space generated by a computer, using their 
feelings, through special devices
11
. In this research, 
English teacher in SMA AL-Islam Krian using VR glass 
and Smartphone to display virtual environment.  
2. CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) 
Beatty stated that CALL is any process in which a 
learner uses a computer and, as a result, improves his or 
her language.
12
 In this research, CALL is the technology 
media which is provided by the English teacher of SMA 
AL-Islam Krian in form of Virtual Reality Devices. 
3. Student’s Responses 
Student‘s response described as a student‘s idea or 
reaction as an experience about an object that gained by 
using information and interpret a message. This output 
process means the student as an individual can give the 
judgment of belief and as a result it affects the way the

student think and feel.  In this research, students‘ response 
means student‘s idea or reaction and their judgment toward 
the use of virtual reality that will affect to their learning 
outcomes in learning descriptive text. 
4. Writing 
Writing is an activity to express human taught, ideas, 
and opinion about everything in mind that written in 
symbol language. In this research writing means the 
student‘s ability in described the object or thing in form of 
descriptive text. 
5. Descriptive 
Descriptive, according to Pardiyono, concerns with 
describing an object such as human or animal. It focuses 
on the characteristic‘s representation by using adjective 
(quality or quantity).

CHAPTER II 
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE 
This chapter deals with the theories related to the use of Virtual 
Reality as media and student‘s responses of using Virtual Reality in 
English language learning. It contains review of related literature and 
previous study. 
A. Review of Related Literature 
1. Media 
a. Definition of Media 
In teaching process teacher transfer the 
knowledge to the students in various way. Teacher 
needs some tools to be used in the learning process to 
make the learning process more effective and easier 
for student. The use of appropriate learning aids also 
can create an active classroom situation. Moreover, 
Harmer stated that ―as a language teacher, we use a 
variety of teaching aids to explain language meaning 
and construction, engage students in a topic or as the 
basis of a whole activity.
14‖  
According to Gerlach and Elly, there are six 
general categories of media.
15
 They are: 
1) Picture 
Picture consists of photographs of any object 
or event, which may be larger or smaller than the 
object or event it represents. 
2) Audio Recording 
Recording made on magnetic tape, discs, 
motion picture, and soundtrack. These are 
reproduction of actual events or sound track. 
3) Motion Picture 
A motion picture is a moving image in color 
or black and white produced from live action or 
from graphic representation.

Jersey: Prentice Hall.198). P. 297

8 
 
 
4) Television 
This category includes all types of audio 
video electronic distribution systems; which 
eventually appear on television monitor. 
5) Real things, simulation or model. 
This category includes people, events, object 
and imitation of real things. Imitation of real 
things can use as a substitution for the actual 
object or event. They are, in fact, life itself, often 
in its natural setting. Simulation is the replication 
of real situation, which has been designed to be as 
near the actual event or process as possible. Many 
media, including computer, tape recordings, and 
motion picture can be used for simulation. A 
model is replication or representation of reality. It 
is often in scale and may be miniature, exact size 
or an enlargement. 
6) Program and computer-assisted instruction. 
Programs are sequences of information 
(verbal, visual, or audio) which are designed to 
elicit predetermined response. The most common 
examples are programed textbooks or 
instructional programs prepared for computers. 
From the six categories above, not all of them can 
be applied in the classroom. According to Gerlach and 
Elly, to select the appropriate media, the teacher must 
consider the characteristics of the students which 
directly relate to the learning process, such as verbal 
abilities, visual and audio perception skill, experience, 
intelligence, motivation, personality and social skills
16
 
. In addition, Brown stated that there are six principles 
in selecting media
17
: 
1) Content 
Media (i.e. interactive CD) have significant 
relation with the lesson. The choice of certain

9 
 
 
media must be conformed to the lesson (message) 
that will be given to the students. 
2) Purposes 
The use of the visual aids should contribute 
to the teaching and learning process significantly. 
It means that the media can facilitate the teaching-
learning process. 
3) Price 
Before buying certain visual aids, a teacher 
should consider whether the cost or money spent 
is accordance with the educational result derived 
from its use. 
4) Circumstance of use 
In choosing a visual aid, a teacher should 
take into account the environment (school) where 
he/she teaches. He/she should think whether the 
aid would function effectively in that 
environment. 
5) Learner‘s verification  
A teacher should think whether the aid has 
been tested to certain students. He/she should 
consider if the tested are similar to the students 
whom he/she teaches. 
6) Validation 
A teacher must think whether there are data 
providing that the students learnt accurately 
through the use of aid. 
Considering some principles about media above, 
it should be better if the teacher follows the principles 
to make the use of teaching aids more effective and 
the goal of the lesson can be achieved accurately. 
b. Function of Media in Teaching-Learning Process. 
The use of media in teaching-learning process is 
crucial. According to Levie and Lentz in Arsyad 
Azhar (2005: 16), Revealed the four function of the 
media, especially visual media, namely
18
:

10 
 
 
1) Attention Function 
Attention function visual media is a core, that 
is interesting and directing students to focus 
attention to the contents of subjects relating to the 
meaning of the visual display of text or attached 
to the lesson material. 
2) Affective Function 
Affective function visual media can be seen 
from the comfort level when students learn (or 
read) the text image. 
3) Cognitive Function 
Cognitive functions of visual media seen 
from the findings of research which revealed that 
a visual symbol or picture expedite achievement 
of the goal to understand and remember the 
information or messages contained in the image. 
4) Compensation Function 
Compensation function of teaching media 
seen from the results of research that the media 
provide a visual context to understand the text to 
help students weak in reading to organize 
information in text and remember it again. In 
other words, the media work of teaching to 
accommodate students who are weak and slow to 
accept and understand the content of subjects 
presented with the text or presented in verbal. 
c. Teaching Writing Using Technology Media  
A technology such as Virtual Reality can be used 
as a tool to facilitate learning-teaching activity. There 
are many advantages of employing that media. As a 
result this can give a unique experience not only for 
students but also for teacher. 
Writing method according to Bowen Barbara has 
been developing along with the advancement of 
technology and its availability for students in the 
classroom. The research has shown that students are 
more engage in learning activity while the teacher uses

a technology.
19
 In this case, the use of technology in 
teaching writing can help facilitate teaching and 
learning process. 
Xiao and Katsipataki stated that the digital 
technology is considered as a supportive tool rather 
than as a replacement for conventional teaching.
20
 So, 
it is important to understand the technology as 
additional means in regard to the learner‘s experience. 
It can be concluded that technology such as 
Virtual Reality belong to digital technology. In this 
era, technology becomes a part of human life. This 
means that technology can support human‘s daily 
activity not only for social purpose but also for 
educational purpose. 
It emerges a term ―CALL‖ which is the 
involvement of electronic online media in teaching-
learning process. By applying CALL in that process, it 
can give some benefits:  
 A variety of sources and media such as video, 
recording, and internet. 
 A unique activity. 
 Diverse linguistic input 
 Accessibility of huge linguistic corpora. 
 Create independent learning awareness. 
 Supportive tool to facilitate student‘s task or 
project. 
 Improve student‘s self-confidence and freedom to 
experiment. 
 Students access for publication. 
 A wider connection with other students from 
other country.

2. Virtual Reality 
a. Definition of Virtual Reality. 
According to Rodriguez, Virtual Reality is 
―Technology that allows us to create environments 
where we can interact with any object in real time, 
and that has been widely used for training and 
learning process‖.22  Virtual reality is usually used by 
the most people for a different kind of movie going 
experience at theatre to navigate virtually new places 
through smartphone application. Although most 
experience of VR in entertainment form, there are 
other uses for it including culture heritage, education, 
military, art and industrial section
23
. Moreover, 
According to Clark (2006) the Virtual reality can be 
used to make the learning more interesting and fun 
with the purpose of improving the motivation and 
attention, decreasing costs when using the objective 
and the real environment no matter how expensive 
the simulation is. It also makes possible that 
situations that were impossible to explore in the real 
world can be done
24
. 
By the passing of the time, the components of VR 
device become simpler than when it first created. The 
user only needs smartphone such as Android or 
Iphone and the VR glasses. The VR glasses also easy 
to get through the popular online shop such as 
Lazada or Tokopedia. 
b. Types of VR System and Hardware 
1) Immersion Systems (Fully-immersive). 
The immersion type of VR systems requires 
the user to wear a data glove and HMD that

tracks the user‘s head movements that then 
changes the view.
25
 This type of VR system 
encases the audio and visual perception of the 
user in the virtual world and cuts out all outside 
information so that the experience is fully 
immersive. This type of technology is expensive 
and has some disadvantages, including less 
determining images, burden and environmental 
problems concerning simulators.
26
 The user 
using full immersion of VR technology has the 
ability of feeling of being part of the virtual 
environment. An example of using this type of 
VR is in a virtual walk-through of buildings as 
one application of full immersion.
27
 
2) Non-Immersive system 
The non-immersive system is often called 
desktop virtual reality (without any input 
devices) and based on the displayed screens as it 
is a window to the virtual world without 
additional devices such as HMD, and it is 
sometimes called Window on World (WoW) 
systems.
28
 The desktop VR system is the least 
types of immersion and lowest cost of the VR 
systems. Non-immersive type of VR is the least 
sophisticated components and mostly used in 
education.
29
 Another form of desktop VR system 
is a virtual world. It used in education to support 
the learning and enhance the user to understand 
and observe the information. Pull together 
systems of the virtual world provides

interactions among humans through many 
avatars.
30
 
3) Semi-Immersive system 
The third type of VR systems also called 
hybrid systems. The semi-immersive is a 
development desktop VR and include additional 
devices such as Data Gloves. It keeps the 
simplicity of the desktop VR system, but with a 
high level of immersion and using physical 
models.
31
 The semi-immersive system consists 
of VR and real world attributes by embodying 
objects of computer graphic into the scene of the 
reality. The input to this type of system is 
entered and controlled by the users such as a 
mouse, keyboard, interaction styles, glasses, and 
joystick.
32
 It allows the user to interact by using 
the hands and sometimes wear glasses or Data 
Gloves. 
The following table 2.1 displayed the main 
differences among the three types of immersion 
VR system:

c. Basic Operation of Virtual Reality 
The basic operation of the virtual reality as media 
in learning descriptive text described on the picture 
2.1.

The first stage from the use of virtual reality is the 
user run virtual reality video player on smartphone. If 
the app has not installed, the user can download from 
the Appstore. Then put in the smartphone into the 
VR glasses. The user can see the virtual environment 
and interacting with the object which displayed on 
the VR glasses. The information or knowledge sent 
to the user can be form of text and sound such as 
general information about historical place by the 
narration or the text. 
d. The Advantages of Virtual Reality 
The advantages of using Virtual reality to teach 
educational objectives are similar in many ways to 
the advantages of using computer or interactive 
simulation, particularly a three-dimensional computer 
simulation. Computer-based simulations have been

used for many years in computer-assisted instruction 
(CAI)
33
. 
According to Pantelidis (1995) there are some 
advantages of using Virtual reality as a media in the 
teaching-learning process
34
: 
a) Virtual reality provides new forms and methods 
of visualization, drawing on the strengths of 
visual representation. 
b) Virtual reality can motivate students. 
c) Virtual reality allows the learner to proceed 
through an experience during a broad time 
period not fixed by a regular class schedule, at 
their own pace. 
e. The Disadvantages of Virtual Reality 
The disadvantages of using virtual reality are 
primarily related to cost, time necessary for learning 
how to use hardware and software, possible health 
and safety effects, and dealing with possible 
reluctance to use an integrate new technology into a 
course or curriculum
35
. So, before deciding to use VR 
as media in learning, the teacher should consider 
what kind of VR which appropriate with the class. 
f. Virtual Reality Concepts in Computer-Assisted 
Language Learning 
Many researchers have come to see VR not so 
much in the context of new tools and programs but in 
terms of a new concept, a paradigm shift in human 
computer interfaces, and a fundamentally different 
way of using computers. According to Veronica 
Pantelidis (1993), ―VR has been defined as a highly 
interactive, computer-based, multimedia environment

in which the user becomes a participant with the 
computer in a ‗virtually real ‘‘world‖.36 
Klaus Schwienhorst formulated the concepts for 
implementing virtual reality in computer-assisted 
language learning through exploring three different 
approaches: an individual-cognitive view by Kelly, 
emphasizing learner awareness; a social-interactive 
view by Vygotsky, emphasizing interaction and peer 
collaboration; and an experiential and experimental 
view by Bruner. The concept is formulated as 
follows: (a). Supporting reflection: Awareness of 
self, others, and language resources. (b). supporting 
interaction: Collaborating with native speakers, 
peers, and virtual agents/bots. (c). Supporting 
interactivity and experimentation: Self-access, self-
regulation, and manipulation in virtual 
environments.
37
 
a. Supporting reflection: Awareness of self, others, 
and language resources. 
Reflection is essential to deep learning and 
problem solving. From a socio-cultural 
perspective, reflection is developed through 
social interaction and semiotic mediation.
38
 To 
reflect, students need to be given opportunities to 
review their own and other‘s mental process and 
to use techniques such as writing or verbal report 
to organize and revise though.
39
 In the concept 
implementing VR in CALL, it has been noted 
that VR can record conversations in so-called

logs and the user‘s activities log as their role in 
the virtual environment which can form valuable 
material for reflective offline work. These 
records cannot only serve to provide learners 
with, by definition, personally meaningful 
authentic material in the target language but 
allow them to critically examine their own 
performance, or rather, the performance of their 
virtual selves. 
b. Supporting interaction: Collaborating with native 
speakers, peers, and virtual agents/bots. 
The most important benefit of VR is 
interaction. Any telecommunication tool needs 
to support the multitude of communication 
scenarios in the language classroom and target 
language community. This involves the 
provision of asynchronous and synchronous 
communication tools in the same environment 
but also the dynamics of group formation that 
usually occur in classroom interaction. Thus, the 
teacher may work with a student, two students 
may work together, a group of four students 
work together, and so forth, and this is a 
constantly changing process. VR in general and 
text-based VR in particular can contribute 
toward language and linguistic awareness, while 
providing a more stress-reduced and fair learning 
environment for collaboration and interaction 
between peers. This also means that learners 
who have not developed a high degree of learner 
autonomy can benefit more from a VR 
environment where they are encouraged to 
communicate, collaborate, and participate in the 
learning process, where they are encouraged and 
sometimes even forced to take control and 
assume responsibility of their own learning. 
Moreover, VR also supports the implementation 
of natural language processing (NLP) tools. 
Kaplan successfully implemented a bot using 
  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id

NLP for the limited register of military 
language.
40
 Although they cannot provide the 
flexible and individualized feedback function of 
peers or other native speakers, they can be useful 
for limited functions such as vocabulary training 
or message delivery, or as cognitive tools for 
learners to experiment with language. 
c. Supporting interactivity and experimentation: 
Self-access, self-regulation, and manipulation in 
virtual environments. 
In a context of self-access and self-
regulation, VR systems allow learners to actively 
participate in the collection and organization of 
their own learning resources and tools. For 
example, learners can explore their own rooms 
and experiment with a variety of objects such as 
bots. This may be supported by a multimodal 
interface that allows users to access the virtual 
world by text commands, hypertext links, or 
through 3-D objects. Trueman (1996), using 
QuickTime technology, showed how the 
manipulation of objects in real time leads to 
learning. Turner (1995), using text-based VR, 
used virtual treasure hunts and similar activities. 
In their experience, the 3-D aspect enhances 
attention and awareness of language resources, 
which in turn enhances classroom work.  
3. Response  
a. Definition of Response 
There are 2 kind of response according to 
Skinner, they are (1) Response respondents or flexible, 
is the response generated by stimuli (certain stimuli). 
Such stimuli are called elitist stimulation because they 
produce a relatively fixed response, (2) the response of 
the operand or the response involved is the response 
                                                          
40 Kaplan, J. D.,&Holland,V. M. (1995). Application of learning principles to the design of 
a second language tutor. In V. M. Holland, J. D. Kaplan, & M. R. Sams (Eds.), Intelligent 
language tutors (pp. 273-287). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.

20 
 
 
that arises and is then developed followed by certain 
stimuli or stimulants. This stimulus is called 
strengthening the stimulus or strengthening because it 
reinforces the response.
41
  
In another definition, John H. Harvey states 
that the response is ―response as one the main 
functions of the soul can be interpreted as a memory 
image of observation, has stopped, just an 
impression.‖42 Meanwhile, according to Rachmat, the 
response is the activity of organizing it, not just a 
positive movement, of all types of activity caused by 
stimulants, can also be interpreted as a result or 
impression gained (left behind) from observation. As 
for this is what is meant by the response is the 
experience of the subject, event or relationship 
obtained by summing up information and interpreting 
the message.
43
 The term response in communication is 
a communication activity that is expected to have a 
result or effect. Communication activities are 
communication between two or more people that give 
effect in the form of a response from communication 
to the message launched by the communicator.  
In conclusion, response is formed from the 
process of stimulation or giving an action or causes 
that result in reaction and result from the stimulus 
process. Response will arise from message reception 
after a series of communications.  
b. The Factor of Response 
A response can occur if the causal factor is met. In the 
initial process, the individual not only responds to the 
stimulus caused by the circumstances around him. Not 
all stimuli get an individual response, because 
individuals do the appropriate stimulus and withdraw.

Hence then the individual besides dependent on the 
stimulus also depends on each country itself.  
Factors that will get individual stimuli are two factors: 
1. Internal Factors are the factors that exist in the 
individual human being. It consists of two 
elements: spiritual and physical. Then someone 
who responds to something from the stimulus still 
affects one of the elements alone and they will 
stand the result of a different response of intensity 
in the individual that respond or will different the 
response between the person and the other person. 
Physical or physiological elements include 
existence, integrity, and workings of sensory 
devices. Nerves and specific part of the brain. 
Spiritual and psychological elements of existence, 
feeling, reason, fantasy, mental, mind, and 
motivation. 
2. External factors are factors that exist in the 
environment. It‘s the intensity factor and the type 
of stimulant or people call it by the stimulus 
factor. According to Bimo Walgito in his book, 
states that the psychic factors associated with the 
object because of the stimulus, and the stimulus 
will be about the sensing device.
44
 
c. Student Response 
Many of the studies into CALL focus on 
discovering what technologies and resources are 
available and on how students are using the 
technological tools at their disposal.
45
 In other words, 
students are being asked to evaluate the ways in which 
they are using technologies to support their learning. 
Other studies have searched for answers in areas of 
motivation and CALL, difficulties or ease of use, and 
perceived usefulness, to name a few. Perceived ease to 
use marks a person belief toward the instant use of

particular technology and shows an individual 
intrinsic motivation to use technology. Then, 
perceived usefulness is regarded as a sign whether a 
person belief that technology can improve their 
performance and shows an individual extrinsic 
motivation to use the technology.
46
 Based on TAM 
model, it is believed that technology can influence the 
user‘s attitude toward how they will use the 
technology.
47
 
Furthermore, the learner autonomy with CALL 
technologies is important because the whole idea 
behind using technology in language study is tied to 
the notion that students do not have to rely on a 
teacher for all their language study needs.  If students 
are motivated to learn on their own via computer, they 
will feel empowered by their own ability to use their 
knowledge and skills to enhance their own learning. In 
other words, they are able to take control of their 
language learning.
48
  
4. Writing 
a. Definition of Writing 
Writing is the one of the most important skill 
in language learning. Writing means composing the 
idea into well-organized sentence or paragraph so the 
reader can get the meaning easily. Writing, according 
to Bryne is considered as a means of communication 
between the writer and reader in non-physical 
interaction.

b. Element of Writing 
Writer must be aware about the writing situation 
before they start to write something. According to 
Hughey, there are three important elements of writing, 
there are
50
: 
1) The Message/Subject 
The subject is about which is writer will write 
a message of the information that the writer wants 
the readers know without a message, the writer 
will not get the sense of his writing. In other 
word, writing is about how the writer delivers a 
massage.  
2) The Writing Purpose 
In this process, the writer determines whether 
the writing is aimed for entertaining, informing or 
describing. 
3) The Reader 
The reader is the one who will read the 
writing. In this case, the writer has to consider 
what the reader need to know.
51
 
c. Purpose of Writing 
In the writing process, the writer must know 
about what he/she want to convey. According to Cox, 
writing has some purposes. The purposes of writing 
requires
52
: (1) expressing ideas (2) providing 
information (3) persuading the reader (4) creating 
literary work. 
5. Descriptive Text 
a. Definition of Descriptive Text 
Descriptive is kind of writing which describe the 
characteristic about an object such as human or 
animal. While, Oshima and Hogue stated that 
descriptive overture to the feels, so it describes how

 Moreover, in 
writing descriptive text, the writer should be able to 
interpret and imaging the thing which he/she wants to 
describe clearly. 
b. Purpose of Descriptive Text 
The aim of descriptive text is to give brief 
explanation about things, place, or people through 
some detailed paragraph. According to White, there 
are some purposes of descriptive text:
54
 
1) To inform the reader about how the object looks 
like. 
2) To interpret the characteristic of a subject. 
3) To make the reader interested to the object being 
described. 
4) To give a demo about something 
c. The Generic Structure of Descriptive Text. 
The structure of descriptive text according to 
Gerot and Wignel are formulated as bellow:
55
 
1) Identification is general illustration of the object 
being described.

object which is described. 
 
B. Previous Study 
Many research study about the use of Virtual reality in 
teaching-learning process in different focus. Virtual reality 
considered as multimedia which contain rich of visual and 
audio content that can make the student interesting to use and 
interact with the object in the virtual environment. Many 
people in the education area do not know how the use of virtual 
reality as media and how to develop it to create the best 
learning experience for the learner. 
In this study, the researcher wants to examine the use 
of virtual reality in learning process especially learning 
descriptive text. The researcher also wants to obtain the 
student‘s response about their learning experience in using 
Virtual reality as a media at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian. 
Furthermore many researches discuss about the use of Virtual 
reality in different object of learning. So it will different with 
other study about the use of Virtual reality in learning 
descriptive text. 
In addition, the researcher considered some previous 
research related with this study, the researches are: 
The first study entitled ―Virtual reality game 
classroom implementation: Teacher perspective and student 
learning outcome” by Mohammed Mubarak Alfadil discuss 
about the influence of the virtual reality game (VRG) House of 
Languages on ESL vocabulary acquisition of intermediate 
school student and establish how VR technology aids in 
improving the ESL vocabulary skill. The researcher takes 64 
students as the participants and divides into experimental group 
Borobudur is well-known all over the world. Its 
construction is influenced by the Gupta 
architecture of India. The temple is constructed on 
a hill 46 m high and consist of eight step like stone 
terrace. The first five terrace are square and 
surrounded by walls adorned with Budist 
sculpture in bas-relief.

and control group. Each group contains 32 students and the 
teacher from local suburban intermediate school in the eastern 
region of Saudi Arabia. The finding indicated that students that 
using the VR game House of Language had greater 
achievement in learning vocabulary than those using traditional 
method in learning vocabulary. 
Second study by Jeremy N. Bailenson and Nick Yee 
entitled ―The use of immersive virtual reality in the learning 
sciences:Digital transformations of teachers, students, and 
social context”. They focused on the use of Virtual 
environment to transform social interaction via behavior and 
context, with the goal of improving learning in digital 
environment. The result shows that Virtual environments will 
have a unique ability to alter the social dynamics of learning 
environments via transformed social interaction.  
The third study entitled ―Use of Virtual-Reality in 
Teaching and Learning Molecular Biology” by Sandra Tan and 
Rusell Waugh. The study focus on the use of Virtual reality as 
simulation-based learning environment in learning molecular 
biology. The researchers use the experimental study and 
intervention described leverage on novel computer-based 
virtual-reality technologies to help students understand the 
three-dimensional structures and the molecular interactions 
between them that enable function. Results indicate significant 
increases in Molecular Biology achievement in male students. 
Focus group interviews reveal that, prior to this intervention, 
students relied heavily on memorization, and the visualization 
exercises helped to clarify understanding while increasing 
interest and engagement.

used by the researcher. It includes (1) research approach and design (2) 
setting of study (3) participant (4) data and source of data (5) data 
collection technique (6) data collection instrument (7) data analysis 
technique. 
A. Research Approach and Design 
When the researcher conduct qualitative research, the 
researcher collects data to learn from the participants in the study 
and develop forms, called protocols, for recording data as the study 
proceeds. These forms pose general questions so that the 
participants can provide answers to the questions. Often questions 
on these forms will change and emerge during data collection.
56
 In 
this research, the researcher wants to get information about the use 
of virtual reality in the learning process of descriptive text and the 
student‘s response about the use Virtual reality as media in learning 
at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian.   
This study is using descriptive qualitative approach. The 
researcher aims to describe and explore the use of Virtual reality as 
media in learning descriptive text. According to Creswell, a 
qualitative study seeks to build interpretive analysis based on 
specific data, within a flexible structure. This study using a 
qualitative analysis will emphasize on methods of collecting, 
analyzing data, and describing the results of the analysis.
57
 The 
researcher takes the data from the student‘s learning process of 
descriptive text in the class to resolve the first research problem. 
Then the researcher will use questionnaire technique to obtain the 
student‘s response about the experience in using Virtual reality as 
learning media to obtain the answer of second research problem. 
B. Setting of Study 
The study will be held at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian. The subject 
of the study is tenth grade students of IPS 1 class at SMA AL-

1. The researcher will do observation to know the process of 
using Virtual reality as media in learning descriptive text 
in the tenth grade class at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian. 
2. To obtain the data about second research problem, the 
researcher will distribute quistionaire to tenth grade 
students at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian. The result of the 
questionnaire will be used to know the student‘s response 
in using Virtual reality as media in learning descriptive 
text. 
F. Data Collection Instrument 
To answer the research questions, the researcher uses some 
instruments. The instruments that the researcher uses are: 
1. Observation 
According to Creswell, observation is the process of 
gathering open-ended, firsthand information by observing 
people and places at a research site.
58
 The researcher will 
observe the teaching-learning process in the classroom. By 
doing the observation, the researcher wants to know the process 
of using virtual reality as media in learning descriptive text. To 
assist in observation in this study, the researcher used an 
observation guide (see appendix 1). 
2. Questionnaire 
The best way to design a questionnaire according to Maria 
Teresa is the researcher must already determine variable and 
indicator of his/her interest then the researcher can continue to 
arrange the quetionaire instrument that will be given to the 
correspondent.
59
 In this research, the researcher will distribute 
the questionnaire sheets after the class over. In this study a 
questionnaire to obtain the student‘s response toward the use of 
virtual reality used by the researcher (see appendix 2). 
G. Data Analysis Technique 
The researcher analyzes the data from observation and 
questionnaire result by using descriptive quantitative method. Then 
the researcher classified the data into quantitative data. It will help

the researcher to conclude the answer of research question. The data 
analysis procedure is defined as follow: 
1. Observation 
To analyze the observation data, the researcher matches the 
result from observation with the theories which provided in the 
review related literature. The researcher described the 
implementations of using Virtual reality in learning descriptive 
text. The researcher observes the implementation of using 
Virtual reality in the classroom by using observation checklist 
based on Klaus Schwienhorst‘s concept about how to 
implementing Virtual reality in CALL and make a field note. 
The description explained the aspects and activities then 
compare it with the concept. The researcher also concludes the 
activity which is matched with the concept.  
2. Questionnaire 
After get the data from questionnaire, the researcher did 
some steps to analyze the data: 
a. The researcher calculates and count the students‘ answer 
through the total of each item will be multiplied with a 
hundred percent then the result will be divided with the 
number of the students.  
b. To measure attitudes, opinions, responses of a person or 
group of people about a problem, it is use Likert scale.

 It 
was explained as follows: Students‘ responses 
questionnaire was arranged based on the Likert scale. It 
was assessed with the following scale:
61
 
1) Sangat tidak setuju = 1 
2) Tidak setuju = 2 
3) Ragu = 3 
4) Setuju = 4 
5) Sangat setuju = 5 
c. The score of students‘ response was calculated with every 
single question and was looked for the percentage by using 
formula as follow:

CHAPTER IV 
FINDING AND DISCUSSION 
A. Research Findings 
The research conducted by the researcher on October 1
st
, 2018 
until October 3
th
, 2018. To answer the research problems in this 
research, the researcher used two instruments to analyzing the data. 
Based on the result of observations and giving questionnaire to the 
students that already did by the researcher in 10
th
 grade of English 
class at SMA Al-Islam Krian about the use of virtual reality in 
learning descriptive text and then achieved the following research 
result: 
1. The implementation of the use of virtual reality in learning 
descriptive text at SMA Al-Islam Krian 
The researcher gathered the data related to the first 
research problem of the study which is how is the 
implementation of the use of virtual reality in learning 
descriptive text. The learning process throughout the use of 
Virtual Reality had been examined by the researcher according 
to what occurred in the classroom observation. There are three 
main stages done by the teacher in implementing virtual reality 
device as media in learning descriptive text, there are (1) lead 
in activities (2) while activities (3) closing activities. The 
researcher describes the stages as follows: 
a. Lead in Activity 
In the beginning of the class, to avoid the technical 
problem the teacher does some activity for preparing the 
media and the students to start the lesson, the activities as 
bellow: 
1) The teacher gives information about the relevance 
of previous lesson. In order to relating the 
previous lesson about simple present tense, the 
teacher asks the students to concluding the 
previous lesson. The teacher said: 
―Okay students, in the last meeting we have 
learned about simple present tense. Today, we 
will learn about descriptive text which is used that 
tense”

The teacher said that: 
“Descriptive text is….the purpose of descriptive 
text is….descriptive text usually use simple 
present tense.” 
4) The teacher prepares VR glasses on his desk. 
The teacher prepares some VR devices on his 
desk before start to use those devices. The teacher 
said: 
“okay before we start to observe some objects, let 
me prepare the tool first” 
5) The teacher divides the students into some group. 
The teacher divides the students in the class 
become some group. The teacher said: 
“now, I will divide you into some group to do a 
group work, and the member just same with the 
group we determined”  
b. While Activities 
In the while activity, the teacher begin to apply the 
virtual reality and start the students‘ observation 
activity. 
1) Teacher gives a picture on the projector about 
animal. The teacher shows a picture about animal 
and describes that in order to make the students

know how to make a descriptive text. the teacher 
said: 
“Okay students, now look at the projector, what 
picture do you see? Yaa, that is an elephant.” 
2) The teacher read the text and explains the 
structure of the text and the language features. 
The teacher explains about the structure, function, 
characteristic about descriptive text. the teacher 
said: 
“Now, let’s read the description about the 
elephant together, and find out where is the 
identification and description part of the text.” 
3) The teacher invites the students to play guessing 
game. The teacher asks the group to choose one 
students for sit in front of the class. The teacher 
said: 
“Let’s play guessing game together, each group 
must choose one of their member to explain the 
clue about the object displayed in the virtual 
reality device.” 
4) The teacher gives the student VR headset and 
asks the student who is sitting in front of the class 
to tell the clue about the animal which displayed 
in the virtual environment. The teacher said: 
“Are you ready, now wear this glasses, then 
observe the animal in the virtual reality while you 
describe the clue of its characteristics.” 
5) The teacher asks the other students try to guess 
what animal in the virtual environment. The 
teacher said: 
 “For the other students, you can guess if you 
sure about animal which described.” 
6) The teacher distributes the VR headset and the 
instruction sheets to each group. The teacher said 
that: 
“Now, each group will get one VR devices and 
instruction sheets, before do the group work, 
please read the instruction first.”

7) The teacher asks the students use VR headset 
according to instruction from the instruction 
sheets and the virtual agent they see in the virtual 
environment. The teacher‘s instruction as bellow: 
“Beside you get the instruction sheets, you will 
find some avatar in form of the animation that 
will guide you to explore the virtual environment, 
follow its instruction.” 
8) The teacher asks the students to observe the 
object in the virtual reality then describe the result 
into good descriptive text. the teacher said: 
“While you observe the object in the virtual 
environment, don’t forget to take a note and the 
end of observation you will see the important 
information about the object which you have been 
observed.” 
c. Closing Activities 
In the closing activity, the teacher wants to make 
sure that the students understand what they have 
learned and shows the next lesson material. 
1) Students and teachers conclude the benefits and 
the learning outcomes about descriptive text. To 
make sure the students understand what they have 
learned, the teacher asks them to conclude the 
lesson together. The teacher said: 
“Okay after you observe the object, then you 
make the descriptive text about the object. Now, 
can you conclude what is the purpose, how is the 
general structure of descriptive text? 
2) Students listen the follow-up plan about the next 
lesson. The teacher informs about the next lesson 
material. The teacher said: 
“for next meeting, we are going to travel to the 
some historical place virtually. So, we will 
describe about historical places”

descriptive text using virtual reality media is very interesting” 
82% or 27 students are Strongly Agree. Other 18% or 6 
students in the class choose Agree. Same with previous item, 
there is no students who choose Doubt, Disagree and Strongly 
Disagree option. 
In the item 4: “I enjoyed using the virtual reality 
technology equipment” 55% or 18 students in the classroom 
choose Strongly Agree. Then 36% or 12 students choose agree 
as their answer. There are 3 students or 9% students in the 
classroom who answer doubt option. 
In the item 5: “I like learning through virtual reality 
experience” as much 70% or 23 students choose Strongly 
Agree option.  Then, there are 9 students or 27% students in 
the class choose Agree option. Meanwhile, only 3% or 1 
student who choose Doubt option. For Disagree and Strongly 
Disagree option get 0% from the participants. 
In the item 7:”the virtual reality media challenged me 
in make the descriptive text” there are 64% or 21 students 
who choose Strongly agree option. Meanwhile, 36% or 12 
students in the classroom choose Agree option. For other 
options have 0% percentage of participants. 
Based on the result of the questionnaire, there were 
two responses toward the use of Virtual reality in learning 
descriptive text, they were usefull and easy to use. Perceived 
usefulness of Virtual reality were Virtual reality are students 
feel they learned descriptive text because they used virtual 
reality, students think their school should continue to use the 
virtual reality in the learning process, students believe Virtual 
reality helped them learn thing they need to know, Virtual 
reality helped students to develop ideas in making the 
descriptive text, and the students would like to use virtual 
reality to learn other content. Moreover, perceived ease of use 
Virtual reality were the presentation of descriptive text using 
virtual reality media is very interesting, students enjoyed using 
the virtual reality technology equipment, students like learning 
through virtual reality experience, and the virtual reality media 
challenged students in make the descriptive text.

B. Research Discussion 
In this discussion, the researcher will reviews those findings by 
reflecting on some theories related to each problem that are the 
implementation and students‘ response toward the use of Virtual 
Reality as media in learning descriptive text. Then, the discussion 
is classified based on the research question of the study. 
1. The implementation of the use of virtual reality in learning 
descriptive text at SMA Al-Islam Krian 
Based on findings, there are 9 aspects of implementing 
Virtual Reality in CALL used by the English teacher at tenth 
grade students of SMA AL-ISLAM Krian. There are some 
aspects which are applied and there are some aspects which 
are not applied. Therefore, the discussion of finding as 
follows: 
a. Supporting reflection 
1) Awareness of self. 
Based on the findings, the teacher did not 
provide or implement the activity in the classroom 
which is containing the awareness of self-aspect. 
According to Klaus Schwienhorst the awareness of 
self in the use of virtual reality is the activity where 
the user can control by themselves their virtual body 
to do experimentation in the virtual environment.
62
 
Whereas, supporting reflection: awareness of self is 
the capability of virtual reality devices can displayed 
the reflection or activity log of the virtual body done 
by the user in the virtual environment.
63
 From those 
reflection the user is expected be able to examine and 
understanding their own performance in order to be 
better in the next activity.  
In the use of VR device done by the teacher 
in the class, the teacher did not give the self-
awareness reflection. The Vr‘s software used by the 
teacher cannot record the activity or action which is

done by the students in the virtual environment. The 
software is only able to display the virtual 
environment and object that will be taught by the 
teacher. In conclusion, the students can only see and 
explore virtual environment according to object 
determined by the teacher without be able to know 
their own performance in controlling their virtual 
body. 
2) Awareness of other. 
As well as awareness of self, according to 
Klaus Schwienhorst awareness of other is the 
student‘s capability of knowing their role in social 
context.
64
 In the use of Virtual reality, there are 
several applications or software that can record every 
social interaction carried out by it user, for example 
is MOO (MUD, Object-Oriented). Whereas, the 
reflection awareness of other in the use of virtual 
reality means the capability of devices to record the 
user interaction with other user which can be re-
displayed as the learning reflection or material.
65
 
Based on the findings, the researcher found 
out that the teacher did not provide this aspect. Seen 
from the type of headset and software used by the 
teacher, become the reason why the teacher did not 
supporting or implementing this aspect. The 
technology used by the teacher cannot provide a 
medium for students to interact socially with other 
online user in a virtual environment. 
Therefore, the way the teacher implementing 
virtual reality devices in the English learning is not 
suitable with the concept.

3) Awareness of language resources. 
Based on the observations result, the teacher 
provides reflection aspect in the form of awareness of 
language resources implemented in the VR‘s 
software used by the teacher. In its use, this software 
provides reflection to students in text-based about 
linguistics elements they have learned. Take an 
example from the activities carried out by the teacher 
and students in the classroom, the teacher asks the 
students to observe the object to be studied and then 
take a note the important information displayed by 
the VR device at the end of the activity. 
According to Klaus Schwienhorst one of the 
important function of VR is it can provide a 
reflection of learning about the use of word or 
linguistic elements which is displayed in the virtual 
environment.
66
 Therefore, this aspect is very helpful 
both for the teacher and for students because it can 
provide authentic material for learners. 
b. Supporting Interaction 
1) Interacting with native speaker. 
According Clark and Marshall, VR needs to 
support the multitude of communication scenarios in 
the language classroom and target language 
community in order to give the mutual knowledge to 
students which involve physical copresence, 
linguistic copresence, or community membership of 
the interlocutor.
67
 In the use of VR the teacher must 
considering to give or provide communication aspect 
between students and the other VR user from other 
place. Beside can give the authentic conversation 
scenario it also build intercultural knowledge 
between students and the interlocutor.

Based on classroom observation results, the 
researcher did not find this aspect implemented by 
the teacher. The teacher only emphasizes the 
communication between students in the classroom. 
Therefore, the way teacher implementing the VR is 
not suitable with the concepts.  
2) Interacting with peers. 
Based on the observation result, the teacher 
implemented this aspect in form of guessing game. 
The teacher asks the students to do role play game 
using VR headset. The game called guessing game. 
The teacher set some ruler to play this game. The 
winner is the group which can guess the most. The 
teacher said that the aim of this game is to build the 
interaction between students with the fun way in the 
classroom. As Klaus said the benefits of VR for the 
learning tool are VR can emphasize cooperation to 
learner autonomy, develop linguistic and 
metalinguistic awareness, and provide a more stress-
reduced and egalitarian learning environment for 
collaboration and interaction between peers.
68
  
Besides that, the teacher also gives the 
students group work. In the every meeting using VR, 
the teacher has organized the group, so the students 
did not confuse to choose their group member. This 
gives beneficial both for students and the teacher 
because by doing group work the time can manage 
effectively and the classroom atmosphere become 
enjoy and make the students more active. 
3) Interacting with virtual agents/bots. 
Virtual agents/Bots is an artificially 
intelligent agent which can deliver command in the 
computer software usually in form of avatar created 
by human.
69
 Although they cannot provide the

flexible and individualized feedback function of 
peers or other native speakers, they can be useful for 
limited functions such as vocabulary training or 
message delivery, or as cognitive tools for learners to 
experiment with language.
70
 According to finding, 
the researcher found that the teacher using Bot to 
guide the students collecting information in the 
virtual environment. The virtual agent/Bot can be 
found in the Google Cardboard application as a tour 
guide in exploring the virtual environment displayed 
in the VR headset.  
c. Supporting Interactivity and Experimentation 
1) Self – Access. 
According to Klaus in a context of Self – Access 
and Self – Regulation, VR System allow learners to 
actively participate in the collection and organization 
of their own learning resources and tools.
71
 For 
example, learners can create their own rooms and 
experiments with variety object such as bots. Based 
on observation result, the teacher allows students to 
operate and collect the VR headset and information 
in the virtual environment by themselves. So, it can 
be concluded that the teacher‘s way in implementing 
this aspect is suitable with the concepts of 
implementing VR as language learning tool to allow 
learners use the VR headset independently.  
2) Self – Regulation. 
Based on the findings result, the teacher 
implemented this stage by allow the students to 
collect information in the virtual environment 
displayed by VR device. The teacher only gives a 
few directions in the form of instruction for using VR 
device, then the students observe object and explore 
the virtual world independently. As Tunner said that

the 3-D aspect in VR can enhances attention and 
awareness of language resources, when in turn 
enhance classroom work.
72
 Therefore, the teacher 
asks the students to work together but students must 
remain active in the collection of information process 
independently.  
3) Manipulation in Virtual Environment. 
According to Holmevik and Haynes, the recently 
VR software can provide a particularly easy-to-use 
interface for the creation of new objects.
73
 Donaldson 
and Kötter also demonstrate how learner take control 
of the learning resources in VR by allows them to 
organize relevant multimedia material from the 
internet.
74
 Based on the observation result, the 
Google Cardboard app used by teacher can allow the 
user to choose multimedia material but the teacher 
did not utilize this feature. The teacher prefers to 
determine his own learning material in form of 3-D 
video to be distributed to students. Furthermore, the 
way teacher implementing the VR is not suitable 
with the concepts. 
2. Student’s response toward the use of virtual reality in 
learning descriptive text at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian 
The previous research by Mubarak Alfadil obtained 
the responses of intermediate school students who use a 
virtual Reality vocabulary learning game as a learning method 
for developing vocabulary according to the usefulness of 
Virtual reality.
75
 In this research, to answer the second 
research question, the researher obtained the student‘s

response toward the use of Virtual reality in learning 
descriptive text regarding with the ease of use and perceived 
usefulness.  
Based on the questionnaire given to the 33 students, 
28 students Strongly agree that they learned descriptive text 
because they used virtual reality, 27 (82%) students in the 
classroom Strongly agree that the presentation of descriptive 
text using virtual reality media is very interesting, 24 students 
(73%) Strongly agree that their school should continue to use 
the virtual reality in the learning process, 18 students (55%) 
students Strongly agree that they enjoyed using the virtual 
reality technology equipment, 23 (70%) of students in the 
class Strongly agree that they like their learning experience 
using virtual reality, 22 students (67%) strongly agree that 
Virtual reality help them learn thing they need to know and 21 
(64%) students Strongly agree that the virtual reality media 
challenged them in make the descriptive text. Meanwhile, 18 
(55%) students Strongly agree that Virtual reality helped them 
to develop ideas in making the descriptive text. Then, 23 
(70%) students in the class Strongly agree that they want to 
use virtual reality to learn other content. It showed that Virtual 
Reality is perceived to be usefull to use in English learning. 
Perceived usefulness is an indicator of the extent to which a 
person believes that using a particular technology will 
enhance their performance and therefore represents and 
individual‘s extrinsic motivation to use technology.76 
Therefore, based on the result above we can conclude 
that the students‘ response toward the use of Virtual reality is 
useful to use in English learning. This response makes the 
students interesting to use Virtual reality in English learning. 
It is suitable with the technology acceptance model (TAM) 
that is perceived usefulness which has a significant effect in 
behavioral intention to use a technology.

CHAPTER V 
CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION 
This research discussess the area of the study that has been 
explain in the previous chapter. This chapter is divided into two part, 
those are conclusion and suggestion. In conclusion, the researcher will 
conclude the research based on the findings. Meanwhile, in Suggestion 
the researcher give suggesstion for the English teacher, the next 
researcher and for the readers. 
A. Conclusion 
The result of the research are the implementations and students 
response toward the use of Virtual reality in learning descriptive 
text at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian. The conclusion of the research can 
be explained as follow: 
1. The implementation of the use of virtual reality in learning 
descriptive text at SMA Al-Islam Krian 
There are some activities done by the teacher in the 
classroom in using Virtual Reality as the media in learning 
descriptive text. The activities as follows: 
a. Preparation 
 The teacher prepares Virtual Reality devices on his 
desk before starting the main activity. 
 The teacher asks the students connecting their 
smartphone into Wi-Fi connection. 
 The teacher asks the students to download VR 
application on the Appstore through their smartphone. 
b. Main Activity 
 The teacher uses Virtual reality to play guessing game 
with the students. 
 The teacher distributes the Virtual Reality glasses and 
manual paper about instruction to use Virtual reality to 
the students. 
 The teacher gives a barcode contains about the 
material to the students. 
 The teacher asks the students to observe the object 
which is displayed on the virtual reality. 
  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
47 
 
 
 The teacher asks the students to write description 
based on the object that they have observed in the 
virtual reality. 
c. Closing Activity 
 The teacher asks the students to watch the video on the 
Virtual reality App which displayed what they have 
learned in the current activity.  
 The teacher asks the students to conclude the learning 
outcome which they got in the classroom meeting. 
Based on the concept of implementing Virtual Reality 
by Klaus Schwienhorst, the ways which is used by the teacher 
in implementing VR in the classroom is not suitable with the 
concept. In the concept of implementing VR in CALL, there 
are 9 aspects must considered by the teacher in applying 
Virtual reality. The aspects are: (1) self-awareness reflection 
(2) awareness of other reflection (3) reflection of language 
resources (4) interacting with native speaker (5) interacting 
with peers (6) interacting with virtual agents/bots (7) self-
access experimentation (8) self-regulation (9) manipulation in 
virtual environment.  
The teacher only implement 5 from 9 aspects, that are 
awareness of language resources (closing activity first point), 
interacting with peers (main activity first point), interacting 
with bots (main activity third point), self-access (main activity 
second point), and self-regulation (main activity at fourth 
point). 
2. Student’s response toward the use of virtual reality in 
learning descriptive text at SMA AL-ISLAM Krian 
Based on the questionnaire result there is 82% of 
students who Strongly Agree  to consider the use of Virtual 
Reality as interesting in response to the point 2. On the other 
hand, there is 55% of students who Strongly Agree to assume 
that the use of Virtual Reality is comfortable in response to the 
point 4. In addition, 67% of students who strongly agree to 
think that Virtual Reality is useful in response to point 6. 
However, the findings also show that there is surprisingly 0% 
of students who hesitate that the use of Virtual Reality is 
interesting. Besides, the students who hesitate that the use of 
Virtual Reality is comfortable is estimate as 9%. Moreover, the 
  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id  digilib.uinsby.ac.id   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
48 
 
 
students who hesitate that the use of Virtual Reality is useful is 
3%. In conclusion, the use of Virtual Reality is considered as 
an appropriate media to facilitate the classroom activity 
especially in learning descriptive text. 
B. Suggestion 
Based on the result of the study the researcher recommends 
some suggestion in the following: 
1. For the teacher 
The result of this research indicates that in 
implementing Virtual reality, the teacher did not implement 
some important aspects such as awareness of self and 
awareness of other reflection, interacting with native speaker, 
and manipulation in the virtual environment. Those are due to 
the type of VR hardware and software used by the teacher. The 
researcher suggests the teacher to choose appropriate VR 
software such as ―mondly vr‖. Even though it‘s paid software, 
it has more complete features than other software. Instead of 
buy new VR hardware which is more expensive than buy the 
software which is almost has all the aspects mentioned. 
2. For further researcher. 
The finding of this study are expected to be used as 
consideration for the next researcher who want to conduct  the 
study related to the use of Virtual reality in English learning. 
Regarding with the result of this study, the future researcher 
can conduct the resaerch about teacher‘ or students‘ challenge 
in using VR in English learning, the effect of using VR, and the 
next researcher can conduct the research to obtain teacher‘ 
perception toward the use of VR. Hopefully, the result of this 
research can be inspiration for the further researcher.

However, the use of a computer-based media commonly called CALL must be attended by an understanding of how to adapt the specific media so that the teacher can apply the media in the classroom without causing negative effects to students or teachers. This study aims to examine how the implementation of using VR as a CALL media in the classroom and obtaining the students’ perceptions toward the use of this media in learning English. This research was conducted in SMA AL-ISLAM Krian at 10 ips 1 class only. In analyzing the data, the researcher wrote the implementation VR clearly and used questionnaire to obtain the student’s perception toward the use of VR by using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) theory form Davis (2000). The result of the research showed that the teacher implemented 5 among 9 concepts implementing VR in CALL. Whilst the concept which were not implemented by the teacher were the reflection of awareness of self and awareness of other, interacting with native speaker, and manipulation in virtual environment. The reason why the teacher did not implement those concepts was because it required an advanced technology. Besides, concerning about the student’s perceptions toward the use of VR, many of students considered it as interesting, comfortable and useful to use in English language learning","['Thesis', 'NonPeerReviewed', 'Media', 'Bahasa Inggris']",disabled
