The Near Earth
Network
The NEN uses ground-based antennas to provide “best-
value” tracking, telemetry and command services to NASA 
missions operating in the near-Earth region. The NEN’s 
resources continuously evolve to meet the changing 
communications needs of the missions it supports. 
EXPLORATION AND SPACE COMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS DIVISION NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
NEN Capabilities 
Polar-orbiting missions
High data rates
Data transmission to missions 
beyond LEO out to libation point
NASA owns a number of ground stations, 
such as those in Wallops Island, Virginia, 
and the Alaska Satellite Facility, but the 
network also contracts out coverage from 
commercial stations. Together, they 
comprise more than 20 sites covering more 
than 40 spacecraft.

NASA’s CubeSats
CubeSats, also known as nanosatellites, offer a low-cost way to get science data 
from space. These missions typically last 90 days and are intended for small-scale 
research projects. NASA often partners with universities and schools to create some 
of these short-term research projects.

The Space Network
The TDRS Constellation
EXPLORATION AND SPACE COMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS DIVISION NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
The Space Network
• The Space Network (SN) is a combination of 
national and international ground stations 
paired with NASA’s Tracking and Data Relay 
Satellite (TDRS) fleet
• Currently, there are 10 TDRSs 
geosynchronously orbiting the Earth at 
22,000 miles 
WSGT GRGT
• Using radio frequency (RF) the SN is capable of 
transmitting to and receiving data from spacecraft 
with 100% coverage of the satellites orbit
• Data collected on user spacecraft is sent to a 
TDRS, which then downlinks the data to the White 
Sands Ground Terminal (WSGT) or the Guam 
Remote Ground Terminal (GRGT).  This data is 
then sent to the customer. 
Dr. Harry Shaw | Utah State Radio Frequency and Microwave Day | Sept. 12-13, 2018
EXPLORATION AND SPACE COMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS DIVISION NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
Space Network Capabilities
• S-band RF capabilities
• Increased transmission rates
• Coverage of 3 major oceanic 
regions
• The SN provides tracking and 
data acquisition services 
between low Earth orbiting 
(LEO) spacecraft and data 
processing facilities. 
• The position, time and 
frequency data provided by the 
SN enables users to maintain 
precise spacecraft orbit 
prediction, orbit determination 
and attitude determination and 
control.

Figure 2-2:  Some Possible Combinations of Space Communications Protocols 
In figure 2-1, there are two protocols that do not correspond to a single layer.  CCSDS File 
Delivery Protocol (CFDP) has the functionality of the Transport and Application Layers.  
Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol has the functionality of the Data Link and Physical Layers. 
Although CCSDS does not formally define Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for the 
space communications protocols, most CCSDS standards provide service definitions in the 
form of primitives following the conventions established by ISO (see reference [21]).  A 
primitive is an abstract representation of an API that does not depend on any implementation 
technology and thus should be used as the baseline for an API. 
In the following subsections, the protocols shown in figure 2-1 are briefly introduced.  Major 
features of these protocols will be explained in section 3. 
CCSDS 130.0-G-2 Page 2-5 December 2007 
Example of CCSDS Protocol Stack - Consistency and Interoperability
Standardization of Communications Protocols and 
Space Internetworking
• Application Layer Protocols
– SCPS File Protocol (SCPS-FP)
– Lossless Data Compression
– Image Data Compression
– CFDP provides the functionality of the both the Application Layer 
(i.e., functions for file management), as well as the Transport Layer.
• Transport Layer Protocols
– SCPS Transport Protocol (SCPS-TP) Version 6 
– The CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) 
– TCP and UDP can  be used on top of SCPS-NP, IP Version 4  and IP Version 6 
• Network Layer Protocols:
– Space Packet Protocol 
– SCPS Network Protocol (SCPS-NP)
– Internet Protocol (IP), Version 4 
– Internet Protocol (IP), Version 6 
• Data Link Layer 
– Data Link Protocol Sublayer of the Data Link Layer:
• TM Space Data Link Protocol 
• TC Space Data Link Protocol 
• AOS Space Data Link Protocol 
• Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol - Data Link Layer 
– Synchronization and Channel Coding Sublayer of the Data Link Layer:
• TM Synchronization and Channel Coding
• TC Synchronization and Channel Coding 
• Proximity-1 Space Link Protocol - Coding and Synchronization Layer
• Physical Layer
– Recommends the characteristics of the RF/Optical and modulation systems 
used for Communications over space links between spacecraft and ground stations.

Motivation
• Rotorcraft transmission require multiple gear 
stages to decrease turbine speed to rotor speed
• Pericyclic transmission can replace multiple 
gear stages through its ability to achieve high 
reduction ratios (40:1 or greater)
• Additional benefits shown by Mathur were fewer 
total components, reduced weight,  and 
decreased noise due to many teeth in contact

Abstract: Intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes enable agents to
autonomously sample goals to explore efficiently complex environments with
high-dimensional continuous actions. They have been applied successfully to
real world robots to discover repertoires of policies producing a wide diversity
of effects. Often these algorithms relied on engineered goal spaces but it was
recently shown that one can use deep representation learning algorithms to learn an
adequate goal space in simple environments. However, in the case of more complex
environments containing multiple objects or distractors, an efficient exploration
requires that the structure of the goal space reflects the one of the environment. In
this paper we show that using a disentangled goal space leads to better exploration
performances than an entangled one. We further show that when the representation
is disentangled, one can leverage it by sampling goals that maximize learning
progress in a modular manner. Finally, we show that the measure of learning
progress, used to drive curiosity-driven exploration, can be used simultaneously to
discover abstract independently controllable features of the environment. The code
used in the experiments is available at https://github.com/flowersteam/

1 Introduction
A key challenge of lifelong learning is how embodied agents can discover the structure of their
environment and learn what outcomes they can produce and control. Within a developmental
perspective [1, 2], this entails two closely linked challenges. The first challenge is that of exploration:
how can learners self-organize their own exploration curriculum to discover efficiently a maximally
diverse set of outcomes they can produce. The second challenge is that of learning disentangled
representations of the world out of low-level observations (e.g. pixel level), and in particular,
discovering abstract high-level features that can be controlled independently.
Exploring to discover how to produce diverse sets of outcomes. Discovering autonomously a
diversity of outcomes that can be produced on the environment through rolling out motor programs
has been shown to be highly useful for embodied learners. This is key for acquiring world models and
repertoires of parameterized skills [3, 4, 5], to efficiently bootstrap exploration for deep reinforcement
learning problems with rare or deceptive rewards [6, 7], or to quickly repair strategies in case of
damages [8]. However, this problem is particularly difficult in high-dimensional continuous action
and state spaces encountered in robotics given the strong constraints on the number of samples
that can be experimented. In many cases, naive random exploration of motor commands is highly

inefficient due to high-dimensional action spaces, redundancies in the sensorimotor system, or to the
presence of “distractors” that cannot be controlled [3].
Several approaches to organize exploration can be considered. First, imitation learning can be used
to take advantage of observations of another agent acting on the environment [9]. While observing
the environment changing as a consequence of other agent’s actions can often be leveraged, there
are many cases where it is either impossible for other agents to demonstrate how to act, or for the
learner to observe the motor program used by the other agent. For these reasons, various forms of
autonomous curiosity-driven learning approaches have been proposed [10], often inspired by forms of
spontaneous exploration displayed by human children [11]. Some of these approaches have used the
framework of (deep) reinforcement learning, considering intrinsic rewards valuing states or actions
in terms of novelty, information gain, or prediction errors, e.g. [12, 13, 14, 5]. However, many of
these approaches are not directly applicable to high-dimensional redundant continuous action spaces
[12, 15], or face complexity challenges to be applicable to real world robots [16, 17].
Another approach to curiosity-driven exploration is known as Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration
Processes (IMGEPs) [3, 18], an architecture closely related to Goal Babbling [19]. The general idea
of IMGEPs is to equip the agent with a goal space, where each point is a vector of (target) features of
behavioural outcomes. During exploration, the agent samples goals in this goal space according to a
certain strategy. A powerful strategy for selecting goals is to maximize empirical competence progress
using multi-armed bandits [3]. This enables to automate the formation of a learning curriculum where
goals are progressively explored from simple to more complex, avoiding goals that are either too
simple or too complex. For each sampled goal the agent dedicates a budget of experiments to improve
its performance regarding this particular goal. IMGEPs are often implemented using a population
approach, where the agent stores an archive of all the policy parameters and the corresponding
outcomes. This makes the approach powerful since the agent is able to leverage each encountered
past experience when facing a new goal. This approach has been shown to enable high-dimensional
robots to learn very efficiently locomotion skills [3], manipulation of soft objects [19, 20] or tool use
[18]. Related approaches were recently experimented in the context of Deep Reinforcement Learning,
such as in Hindsight Experience Replay [21] and Reverse Curriculum Learning [22] (however using
monolithic goal parameterized policies), and within the Power Play framework [23].
Learning disentangled representations of goal spaces. Even if IMGEP approaches have been
shown to be very powerful, one limit has been to rely on engineered representations of goal spaces.
For example, experiments in [3, 7, 18, 22, 21] have leveraged the availability of goal spaces that
directly encoded the position, speed or trajectories of objects/bodies. A major challenge is how to
learn goal spaces in cases where only low-level perceptual measures are available to the learner (e.g.
pixels). A first step in this direction was presented in [24], using deep networks and algorithms such
as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to learn goal spaces as a latent representation of the environment.
In simple simulated scenes where a robot arm learned to interact with a single controllable object,
this approach was shown to be as efficient as using handcrafted goal features. But [24] did not study
what was the impact of the quality of the learned representation. Moreover, when the environment
contains several objects including a distractor object, an efficient exploration of the environment is
possible only if the structure of the goal space reflects the one of the environment. For example,
when objects are represented as abstract distinct entities, modular curiosity-driven goal exploration
processes can be leveraged for efficient exploration, by focusing on objects that provide maximal
learning progress, and avoiding distractor objects that are either trivial or not controllable [18]. An
open question is thus whether it is possible to learn goal spaces with adequate disentanglement
properties and develop exploration algorithms that can leverage those learned disentangled properties
from low-level perceptual measures.
Discovering high-level controllable features of the environment. Although methods to learn
disentangled representation of the world exist [25, 26, 27], they do not allow to distinguish features
that are controllable by the learner from features describing external phenomena that are outside
the control of the agent. However, identifying such independantly controllable features [28] is of
paramount importance for agents to develop compact world models that generalize well, as well as
to grow efficiently their repertoire of skills. One idea to address this challenge, initially explored
in [29], is that learners may identify and characterize controllable sets of features as sensorimotor
space manifolds where it is possible to learn how to control perceptual values with actions, i.e. where
learning progress is possible. Unsupervised learning approaches could then build coarse categories
distinguishing the body, controllable objects, other animate agents, and uncontrollable objects as
2

entities with different learning progress profiles [29]. However, this work only considered identifying
learnable and controllable manifolds among sets of engineered features.
In this paper, we explore the idea that a useful learned representation for efficient exploration would
be a factorized representation where each latent variable would be sensitive to changes made in a
single true dregree of freedom of the environment, while being invariant to changes in other degrees of
freedom [30]. Further on, we investigate how independently controllable features of the environment
can be identified among these disentangled variables through interactions with the environement.
We study this question using β-VAEs [25, 31] which is a natural extension of VAEs and have been
shown to provide good disentanglement properties. We extend the experimental framework of [24],
simulating a robot arm learning how it can produce outcomes in a scene with two objects, including a
distractor. In order to assess the role of the representation we use a two-stage process, which first
learns to see and then learns to act. The first stage consists of a representation learning phase where
the agent builds a representation of the world by passively observing it (events in the environment are
assumed to be produced by another agent in this phase, see [24]. In the second phase the agent uses
this representation to interact with the world, by sampling goals that provide high learning progress,
and where goals are target values of one or several latent variables to be reached through action.
This procedure was adopted for two reasons. For one, it is similar to the developmental progression
in infant development, where the infant first spends most of his time observing the world due to
limitations in motor exploration. Secondly, it helps in understanding the impact of disentanglement
given the multiple components of the architecture.
The first contribution we make in this paper is to study the impact of using a learned disentangled
goal space representations on the efficiency of exploration and discovery of a diversity of outcomes in
IMGEPs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the role of disentanglement is studied
in the context of exploration. Precisely, we show that:
• using a disentangled state representation is beneficial to exploration: using IMGEPS, the
agents explores more states in fewer experiments than when the representation is entangled.
• disentangled representations learned by β-VAEs can be further leveraged by modular
curiosity-driven IMGEPs to explore as efficiently as using handcrafted low-dimensional
scene features, in experiments that include both controllable and distractor objects. On the
contrary, we show that representations learned by VAEs are not sufficiently structured to
enable a similarly efficient exploration.
The second contribution of this article is to show that identifying abstract independently controllable
features from low-level perception can emerge from a representation learning pipeline where learning
disentangled features from passive observations (β-VAEs) is followed by curiosity-driven active
exploration driven by the maximization of learning progress. This second phase allows in particular to

distinguish features related to controllable objects (disentangled features with high learning progress)
from features related to distractors (disentangled features with low learning progress).
2 Modular goal exploration with learned goal spaces
This section introduces Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes with modular goal spaces
as they are typically used in environments with handcrafted goal spaces. It then describes the
architecture used in this article where the handcrafted goal space is replaced by a representation of
the space that is learned before exploration and then used as a goal space for IMGEPs. The overall
architecture is summarized in Figure 1.
2.1 Intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes with modular goal spaces
To fully understand the IMGEP approach, one must imagine the agent as performing a sequence
of contextualized and parameterized experiments. The problem of exploration is defined using the
following elements:
• A context space C. The context c represents the initial state of the environment. It corre-
sponds to parameters of the experiment that are not chosen by the agent.
• A parameterization space Θ. The parameterization θ corresponds to the parameters of the
experiment that the agent can control at will (e.g. motor commands for a robot).
• An observation space O. Here we consider an observation o to be a vector representing all
the signals captured by the agent sensors during an experiment (e.g. raw images).
• An environment dynamic D : C,Θ → O which maps parameters performed in a certain
context, to observations (or outcomes). This dynamic is considered unknown.
For instance, as presented in Figure 2, a parameterization could be the weights of a closed-loop neural
network controller for a robot manipulating a ball. A context could be the initial position of the ball
and an observation could be the position of the ball at the end of a fixed duration experiment. The
exploration problem can then be simply put as:
Given a budget of n experiments to perform, how to gather tuples
{(ci, θi, oi)}i=1...n which maximize the diversity of the set of observations
{oi}i=1...n.
One approach that was shown to produce good exploration performances is Intrinsically Motivated
Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs). This algorithmic architecture uses the following elements:
• A goal space T . The elements τ ∈ T represent the goals that the agent can set for himself.
We also use the term task to refer to an element of T .
4
• A goal sampling policy γ : T 7→ [0, 1]. This distribution allows the agent to choose a goal in
the goal space. Depending on the exploration strategy being active or fixed, this distribution
can evolve during exploration.
• A Meta-Policy mechanism (or Internal Predictive Model) Π : T , C 7→ Θ, which given a
goal and a context, outputs a parameterization that is most likely to produce an observation
fulfilling the goal, under the current knowledge.
• A cost function C : T ,O 7→ R, internally used by the Meta-Policy. This cost function
outputs the fitness of an observation for a given task τ .
When the environment is simple, such as for experiments presented in [24] where a robotic arm
explore its possible interactions with a single object, the structure of the goal space is not critical.
However, in more complex scenes with multiple objects (e.g. including tools or objects that cannot be
controlled), it was shown in [32] that it is important to have a goal space which reflects the structure
of the environment. In particular, having a modular goal space, i.e. of the form T = ⊕Ni=1 Ti,
where the Ti are different modules representing the properties of various objects, leads to much better
exploration performances. In that case a goal can correspond to achieving an observation where a
given object is in a given position.
The algorithmic architecture works as follows: at each step, the exploration process samples a module,
then samples a a goal in this module, observes the context, executes a meta-policy mechanism to guess
the best policy parameters for this goal, which it then uses to perform the experiment. The observation
is then compared to the goal, and used to update the meta-policy (leveraging the information for
other goals) as well as the module sampling policy. The general idea of IMGEPs is depicted in
Figure 2. Depending on the algorithmic instantiation of this architecture, different Meta-Policy
mechanisms can be used [3, 32]. In any case, the Meta-Policy must be initialized using a buffer
of experiments {ci, θi, oi} containing at least two different oi. As such, a bootstrap of several
Random Parameterization Exploration iterations is always performed at the beginning. This leads to
Algorithmic Architecture 1. The reader can refer to Appendix 6.1 for a detailed explanation of the
Meta-Policy implementation.

In a modular architecture the goal sampling policy reads:
γ(τ) = γ(τ |i)p(i), (1)
where p(i) is the probability to sample the Ti module, and γ(τ |i) is the probability to sample the goal
τ given that the module i was selected. The strength of the modular architecture is that modules can

where Υi(t) is an interest measure based on the estimation of the average improvement of the
precision of the meta-policy for fulfilling goals in Ti, which is a form of learning progress called
competence progress (see [3] and Appendix 6.1 for further details on the interest measure). The
second term of Equation (2) forces the agent to explore a random module 10% of the time. The
general idea is that monitoring the learning progress allows the agent to concentrate on objects which
can be learned to control while ignoring objects that cannot.
2.2 Modular Unsupervised Goal-space Learning for IMGEP
In [24], an algorithm for Unsupervised Goal-space Learning (UGL) was proposed. The principle
is to let the agent observe another agent producing a diversity of observations {oi}. This set of
observations is used to learn a low-dimensional representation which is then employed as a goal-space.
In these experiments, there is always a single goal space corresponding to the learned representation
of the environment. However, if one wishes to use the algorithm presented in the previous section, it
is necessary to have different goal spaces: one for each module.
In order to use a Modular Goal Exploration strategy with a learned goal space, we propose Algorithm
2, which performs Modular Unsupervised Goal-space Learning (MUGL) and is represented in
Figure 3. The idea is to learn a representation of the observations in the same way as UGL. The
modules are then defined as subsets of latent variables. For example, a module could be made of the
first and second latent variables. Accordingly, goals sampled by this module are defined as achieving
a certain value for the first and second latent variables of the representation of an observation. The
underlying rationale is that, if we manage to learn a disentangled representation of the observations,
each latent variable would correspond to a single property of a single object. Thus, by forming
modules containing only latent variables corresponding to the same object, the exploration algorithm
may be able to explore the different objects separately.
After learning the representation, a specific criterion is used to decide how the latent variables should
be grouped to form modules. In the particular case of VAEs and βVAEs, the grouping is made by
projecting latent variables which have similar Kullback-Leibler on their respective subspace (see
Appendix 6.1). Since representations learned with VAEs and βVAEs come with a prior over the
latent variables, instead of estimating the modular goal-policies γ(τ |k), we used the Gaussian prior

assumed during training. Finally, the cost function Ck(τ, o) is defined, using the distance between
the goal and the k-th projection of the latent representation of the observation.
The overall approach combining IMGEPs with learned modular goal spaces is summarized in Figure 1.
Note that the algorithm proposed in [24] is a particular instance of this architecture with only one
module containing all the latent variables. In this case there is no module sampling strategy, and only
a goal sampling strategy. This specific case is here referred to as Random Goal Exploration (RGE).
3 Experiments
We carried out experiments in a simulated environment to address the following questions:
• To what extent is the structure of the learned representation important for the performance
of IMGEP-UGL in terms of efficiently discovering a diversity of observations?
• Is it possible to leverage the structure of the representation with Modular Curiosity-Driven
Goal Exploration algorithms?
• Can the learning progress measure of goal exploration be used to identify controllable
abstract features of the environment?
Environment We experimented on the Arm-2-Balls environment, where a rotating 7-joints robotic
arm evolves in an environment containing two balls of different sizes, as represented in Figure 4.
One ball can be grasped and moved around in the scene by the robotic arm. The other ball acts
as a distractor: it cannot be grasped nor moved by the robotic arm but follows a random walk.
The agent perceives the scene as a 64 × 64 pixels image. For the representation learning phase,
we generated a set of images where the positions of the two balls were uniformly distributed over
[−1, 1]4. These images were then used to learn a representation using a VAE or a βVAE. In order to
assess the importance of the disentangled representation, we used the same disentangled/entangled
representation for all the instantiations of the exploration algorithms. This allowed us to study the
effect of disentangled representations by eliminating the variance due to the inherent difficulty of
learning such representations.
Baselines Results obtained using IMGEPs with learned goal spaces are compared to two baselines:
7
(a) Small exploration noise (σ = 0.05) (b) Large exploration noise (σ = 0.1)
Figure 5: Exploration ratio during exploration for different exploration noises.
• The first baseline is the naive approach of Random Parameter Exploration (RPE), where
exploration is performed by uniformly sampling parameterizations θ. In the case of hard
exploration problems, this strategy is regarded as a low performing one, since no previous
information is leveraged to choose the next parameterization. This strategy gives a lower
bound on the expected performances of exploration algorithms.
• The second baseline is Modular Goal Exploration with Engineered Features Repre-
sentation (MGE-EFR): it corresponds to a modular IMGEP in which the goal space is
handcrafted and corresponds to the true degrees of freedom of the environment. In the
Arm-2-Balls environment it corresponds to the positions of the two balls, given as a point
in [−1, 1]4. Since essentially all the information is available to the agent under a highly
semantic form, it is expected to give an upper bound on the performances of the exploration
algorithms. We performed experiments with both one module (RGE-EFR) and two modules
(one for the ball and one for the distractor) (MGE-EFR).
4 Results
To assess the performances of the MGE algorithm on learned goal spaces, we experimented with
two different representations coming from two learning algorithms: β-VAE (disentangled) and VAE
(entangled). In each case, we ran 20 trials of 10,000 episodes each, for both the RGE and MGE
exploration algorithms. One episode is defined as one experimentation/roll-out of a parameter θ.
Exploration performances The exploration performance of all the algorithms was measured
according to the number of cells reached by the ball in a discretized grid of 900 cells (30 cells for
each dimension of the ball that can be moved; the distractor is not accounted for in the exploration
evaluation). Not all cells can be reached given that the arm is rotating and is of unit length: the
maximum ratio between the number of reached cells and all the cells is approximately pi/4 ≈ 0.8.
In Figure 5, we can see the evolution of the ratio of the number of cells visited with respect to all the
cells through exploration. First, one can see that all the algorithms have much better performances
than the naive RPE, both in term of speed of exploration and final performance. Secondly, for both
RGE and MGE with learned goal spaces, using a disentangled representation is beneficial. One can
also see that when the representation used as a goal space is disentangled, the modular architecture
(MGE-βVAE) performs much better than the flat architecture (RGE-βVAE), with performances
that match the modular architecture with engineered features (MGE-EFR). However, when the
representation is entangled, using a modular architecture is actually detrimental to the performances
since each module encodes then only partially for the ball position. Figure 5 also shows that the MGE
architectures with a disentangled representation performs particularly well even if the exploration
noise is low whereas the RGE architectures or MGE architectures with an entangled representation
relies on a large exploration noise to produce a large variety of observations. We cross-refer to
Appendix 6.7 for examples of exploration curves together with exploration scatters.
Benefits of disentanglement and modules
The evolution of the interest of the different modules through exploration is represented in Figure 6a.
First, in the disentangled case, one can see that the interest is high only for the modules corresponding

Figure 6: Interest evolution for each module through epochs. In the case of a disentangled representa-
tion the algorithm shows interest only for the module which correspond to latent variables encoding
for the position of the ball (which is unknown by the agent, which does not distinguish between the
ball and the distractor).
to the latent variables encoding for the ball position.1 This is natural since these latent variables are
the only ones that can be learned to control with motor commands. In the entangled case, the interest
of each module follows a random trajectory, with no module standing out with a particular interest.
This effect can be understood as follows: the entanglement introduces spurious correlations between
the observations and the tasks in every module, which bring the interest measures to follow random
fluctuations based on the collected observations. These correlations, in turn, lead the agent to sample
more frequently policies that in fact did not have any impact on the observation, making the overall
performance worse (see Appendix 6.1 and 6.6 for details).
When the representation used as a goal space is disentangled, the modular approach is particularly well
suited in the presence of distractors. Indeed, thanks to the projection operator, the noise introduced in
the latent variables by the random walk of the distractor is completely ignored by the module which
contains the latent variables of the ball. This allows to learn a better inverse model for modules which
ignore the distractor, which in turn yields a better exploration (see Appendix 6.1 and 6.6 for details).
Independently Controllable Features
As explained above and illustrated in Figure 6a, when the representation is disentangled, the MGE
algorithm is able to monitor the learnability of certain modules (possibly individual latent features,
see 6.5), and leverage it to focus exploration on goals with high learning progress. This is illustrated
on the interest curves by the clear difference in interest between modules where learning progress
happens and those where it does not. It happens that modules that produce high learning progress
correspond precisely to modules that can be controlled. As such, as a side benefit of using modular
goal exploration algorithms, the agent discovers in an unsupervised manner which are the features
of the environment that can be controlled (and in turn explores them more). This knowledge could
then be used by another algorithm whose performance depends on its ability to know which are the
independantly controllable features of the environment.
5 Conclusion
In this paper we studied the role of the structure of learned goal space representations in IMGEPs.
More specifically, we have shown that when the representation possesses good disentanglement
properties, they can be leveraged by a curiosity-driven modular goal exploration architecture and
lead to highly efficient exploration. In particular, this enables exploration performances as good as
when using engineered features. In addition, the monitoring of learning progress enables the agent to
discover which latent features can be controlled by its actions, and focus its exploration by setting
goals in their corresponding subspace.
1The semantic mapping between latent variables and external objects is made by the experimenter.
9
The perspectives of this work are twofold. First it would be interesting to show how the initial
representation learning step could be performed online. Secondly, beyond using learning progress to
discover controllable features during exploration, it would be interesting to re-use this knowledge to
acquire more abstract representations and skills.
Finally, as mentioned in the introduction, another advantage of using a disentangled representation
is that, as was shown in [31], it evinces superior performances in a transfer learning scenario.
Both approaches are not incompatible and one could envision a scheme where one would learn
a disentangled representation in a simulated environment and use this representation to perform
exploration in a real world environment.

6.1 Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes
In this part, we give further explanations on Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes.
Meta-Policy Mechanism This mechanism allows, given a context c and a goal τ , to find the
parameters θ that are most likely to produce an observation o fulfilling the task τ . The notion of an
observation o fulfilling a task τ is quantified using a cost function C : T ×O 7→ R. The cost function
can be seen as representing the fitness of the observation o regarding the task τ .
The meta-policy can be constructed in two different ways which are depicted in Figure 7:
• Direct-Model Meta-Policy: In this case, an approximate phenomenon dynamic model D˜
is learned using a regressor (e.g. LWR). The model is then updated regularly by performing
a training step with the newly acquired data. At execution time, for a given goal τ , a
loss function is defined over the parameterization space through L(θ) = C(τ, D˜(θ, c)). A
black-box optimization algorithm, such as L-BFGS, is then used to optimize this function
and find the optimal set of parameters θ (see [3, 32, 33] for examples of such meta-policy
implementations in the IMGEP framework).
• Inverse-Model Meta-Policy: Here, an inverse model I˜ : T × C 7→ Θ is learned from the
historyH which contains all the previous experiments in the form of tuples (ci, θi, oi). To
13
do so, every experiments observations oi must be turned into a task τi. The inverse model
can then be learned using usual regression techniques from the set {(τi, ci, θi)}.
In our case, we took the approach of using an Inverse-Model based Meta-Policy. We draw the
attention of the reader on the following implementation details:
• Depending on the case, multiple observations, and consequently multiple parameters can
optimally solve a task, while a combination of them cannot. This is known as the redundancy
problem in robotics and special approaches must be used to handle it when learning inverse
models, in particular within the IMGEP framework [3]. This has also been tackled under
the terminology of multi-modality in [34]. To solve this problem, we used a κ-nn regressor
with κ = 1.
• Turning observations {oi} into goals {τi} may prove difficult in some cases. Indeed, it may
happen that a given observation does not solve optimally any task in the goal space, or that
it solves optimally multiple tasks. In our case, we assumed that the learned encoder is a
one-to-one map from observation space to goal space and thus, that every observation solves
optimally a unique task in each module. Hence, tasks were associated to observations using
the encoder R: τi := R(oi).
• Since the different modules are associated to projection operators, each produced observation
o optimally solve one task for each module. Indeed, if we consider projections on the
canonical axis of the latent space, o will solve one task for each module, corresponding to
each component of R(o). This mechanism allows to leverage information of every single
observation, for all goal-space modules. For this reason, one κ-nearest-neighbor model was
used for each module of the goal space. At each exploration iteration all the modules are
updated using their associated projection operators on the embedding of the outcome.
Our particular implementation of the Meta-Policy is outlined in Algorithm 3. The Meta-Policy
is instantiated with one database per goal module. Each database store the representations of
the observations projected on its associated subspace together with the associated contexts and
parameterizations. Given that the meta policy is implemented with a nearest neighbor regressor,
training the meta policy simply amounts to updating all the databases. Note that, as stated above,
even though at each step the goal is sampled in only one module, the observation obtained after an
exploration iteration is used to update all databases.

where Υi(t) represents the interest of the Ti module after t iterations. Let H(i)t ={(τk, θk, PiR(ok))}τk∈Ti be the history of experiments obtained when the goal was sampled in

where ot and τt are respectively the observation and goal for the current exploration step and o′ is
the observation associated to the experiment in H(i)t for which the goal τ ′ is the closest to τt. The
interest of a module is designed to track the progress. Specifically, the interest of each module is
updated according to:

will go to zero over time. One can refer to [32] for details on this approach.
Projection criterion for VAE and βVAE An important aspect of the MUGL algorithm is the
choice of the projection operators {Pk}. In this work, the representation learning algorithms are VAE
and βVAE. In this case, two projection schemes can be considered:
• Projection on all canonical axis: nd projection operators, each projecting the latent point
on a single latent axis.
• Projection on 2D planes sorted by DKL: nd2 projection operators, each projecting on a
2D plane aligned with latent axis. The grouping of dimensions as 2D planes is performed
by sorting the dimensions by increasing DKL, i.e. the divergence is computed for each
dimension, by projecting the latent representation on the dimension and measuring its
divergence with the unit gaussian prior. Latent dimensions are then grouped two by two
according to their DKL value.
In this work we mainly considered the second grouping scheme. The first grouping scheme could
be considered to discover which features can be controlled. Of course in practice one often does
not know in advance how many latent variables should be grouped together and it can be necessary
to consider more advanced grouping schemes. In practice it is often the case that latent variables
which correspond to the same objects have similar KL divergence value (see Figure 8 for an example
of a training curve and appendix 6.2 for an explanation of this phenomenon). As such it could be
envisioned to group latent variables which have similar KL divergence together.
6.2 Deep Representation Learning Algorithms
In this section we summarize the theoretical arguments behind Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and
βVAE.
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) Let x ∈ X be a set of observations. If we assume that the
observed data are realizations of a random variable, we can hypothesize that they are conditioned
by a random vector of independent factors z, i.e. that p(x, z) = p(z)pθ(x, z), where p(z) is a prior
15
distribution over z and pθ(x, z) is a conditional distribution. In this setting, given a i.i.d dataset
X = {x1, . . . ,xN}, learning the model amount to searching the parameters θ that maximizes the
dataset likelihood:
logL(D) =
N∑
i=1
log pθ(x
i) (5)
However, in most cases, the marginal probability:
pθ(x) =
∫
p(x, z)dz (6)
and the posterior probability:
pθ(z|x) = p(x, z)
p(z)
=
p(x, z)∫
p(x, z)dz
(7)
are both computationally intractable, making the maximum likelihood estimation unfeasible. To
overcome this problem, we can introduce an arbitrary distribution qφ(z|x) and remark that the
following holds:
log pθ(x) = L(x; θ, φ) + DKL [qφ(z|x)‖pθ(z|x)] , (8)
where DKL denotes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and
L(x; θ, φ) = Ez∼qφ(z|x)[log pθ(x|z)]− DKL[qφ(z|x)‖p(z)]. (9)
Since the KL divergence is non-negative, it follows from (8) that:
L(x; θ, φ) ≤ log pθ(x)− DKL[qφ(z|x)‖pθ(z|x)] (10)
for any distribution q, hence the name of Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). Consequently, maximizing
the ELBO has the effect to maximize the log likelihood, while minimizing the KL-Divergence
between the approximate qφ(z|x) distribution, and the true unknown posterior pθ(z|x). The approach
taken by VAEs is to learn the parameters of both conditional distributions pθ(x|z) and qφ(z|x) as
non-linear functions. This is done by maximizing the ELBO of the dataset:
L(θ, φ) =
N∑
i=1
L(xi; θ, φ) (11)
by jointly optimizing over the parameters θ and φ. When the prior p(z) is an isotropic unit Gaussian
distribution and the variational approximation qφ(z|x) follow a Multivariate Gaussian distribution
with diagonal covariance, the KL divergence term can be computed in a closed form.
β Variational Auto-Encoders (βVAEs) In essence, a VAE can be understood as an AutoEncoder
with stochastic units (qφ(z|x) plays the role of an encoder while pθ(x|z) plays the role of the decoder),
together with a regularization term given by the KL divergence between the approximation of the
posterior and the prior. This term ensures that the latent space is structured. The existence of a prior
over the latent variables gives the ability to use a VAE as a generative model, and latent variables
sampled according to the prior p(z) can be transformed by the decoder into samples.
Ideally, in order to be more easily interpretable, we would like to have a disentangled representation,
i.e. a representation where a single latent is sensitive to changes in only one generative factor while
being invariant to changes in other factors. When the prior distribution p(z) is an isotropic unit
Gaussian distribution (p(z) = N (0, I)) the role of the regularization term can be understood as a
pressure that encourages the VAE to learn independent latent factors z. As such, it was suggested in
[25, 31] that modifying the training objective to:
L(x; θ, φ) = Ez∼qφ(z|x)[log pθ(x|z)]− βDKL[qφ(z|x)‖pθ(z)], (12)
where β is an additional parameter, will allow one to control the degree of applied pressure to learn
independent generating factors by tuning the parameter β. In particular values of β higher than 1
should lead to representations with better disentanglement properties.
One of the drawbacks of βVAE is that for large values of β the reconstruction cost is often dominated
by the KL divergence term. This leads to poor reconstructed samples where the model ignores some
16
of the factors of variation altogether. In order to tackle this issue, it was further suggested in [35] to
modify the training objective to be:
L(x; θ, φ) = Ez∼qφ(z|x)[log pθ(x|z)]− β|DKL[qφ(z|x)‖pθ(z)]− C|, (13)
where C is a new parameter that defines the capacity of the VAE. The value of C determines the
capacity of the network to encode information in the latent variables. For low values of the capacity
the network will mostly reconstruct properties which have a high reconstruction cost whereas high
capacity ensures that the network can have a low reconstruction error. By optimizing the training
objective (13) with a gradually increased capacity the network will start to encode features with
high reconstruction cost and then progressively encode more factors of variations whilst retaining
disentangling in previously learned factors. At the end of the training one should thus obtain a
representation with good disentanglement properties where each factor of variation is encoded into a
unique latent variable.
In our experiments we used the training objective of Eq. (13) as detailed in Sec. 6.4.
6.3 Disentanglement properties
We compared the disentanglement properties of two representations. One with the procedure outlined
in Sec. 6.2 with β = 150 and a capacity linearly increased to 12 over the course of the training. The
other representation was a vanilla VAE with β = 1. In order to assess the disentanglement properties
of the two representations we performed a latent traversal study. The results of which are displayed
in Figure 9.
It was experimentally observed that the positions of the two balls were indeed disentangled in most
cases when the representation was obtained using a βVAE even though the data used for the training
was generated using independent samples for the position of the two balls. As explained in the
previous section, this effect can be understood as follows: since the two balls do not have the same
reconstruction cost, the VAE tends to reconstruct the object with the highest reconstruction cost first
(in this case the largest ball), and when the capacity reaches the adequate value, it starts reconstructing
the other ball [35]. It follows that the latent variables encoding for the position of the two balls are
often disentangled.
6.4 Details of Neural Architectures and training
Model Architecture The encoder for the VAEs consisted of 4 convolutional layers, each with 32
channels, 4x4 kernels, and a stride of 2. This was followed by 2 fully connected layers, each of 256
units. The latent distribution consisted of one fully connected layer of 20 units parametrizing the
mean and log standard deviation of 10 Gaussian random variables. The decoder architecture was the
transpose of the encoder, with the output parametrizing Bernoulli distributions over the pixels. ReLu
were used as activation functions. This architecture is based on the one proposed in [25].
Training details For the training of the disentangled representation we followed the procedure
outlined in Sec. 6.2. The value of β was 150 and the capacity was linearly increased from 0 to 12
over the course of 400,000 training iterations. The optimizer used was Adam [36] with a learning rate
of 5e−5 and batch size of 64. The overall training of the representation took 1M training iterations.
For the training of the entangled representation the same procedure was followed except that β was
set to 1 and that the capacity was set to 0.
6.5 Interest curves for Projection on all canonical axis
In the main text of the paper we discussed the case of 5 modules. In general one can imagine having
one modules per latent variable. In this case the agent would learn to discover and control each of the
latent variables separately.
In Figure 10 is represented the interest curves when there are 10 modules, one for each latent variable.
When the representation is disentangled (βVAE), the interest is high only for modules which encode
for some degrees of freedom of the ball. On the other hand, when the representation is entangled, the
interest follows some kind of random walk for all modules. This is due to the fact that all the modules
encode for both the ball and the distractor position which introduces some noise in the prediction of
each module.

latent variable and rows are ordered by KL divergence (lowest at the bottom). Each row represents
the reconstruction obtained from the traversal of each latent variable over three standard variation
around the unit Gaussian prior mean while keeping the other latent variables to the value obtained
by running inference on an image of the dataset. From the picture it is clear that the first two latent
variables encode the x and y position of the Ball and that the third and fourth latent variables encode
the x and y position of the Distractor. At the end of the training the remaining latent variables have
converged to the unit Gaussian prior. (b) Similar analysis for an entangled representation (VAE). No

environment with a distractor that does not move.
6.6 Effect of noise in the distractor
We also experimented with different noise level in the displacement of the distractor. As expected,
when the noise level is low, the distractor does not move very far from its initial position and no longer
acts as a distractor. In this case there is no advantage of using a modular algorithm as illustrated
by Figure 11. However, it is still beneficial to have a disentangled representation since it helps in
learning good inverse models.
6.7 Exploration Curves
Examples of exploration curves obtained with all the exploration algorithms discussed in this paper
(Figure 12 for algorithms with engineered features representation and Figure 13 for algorithms with
learned goal spaces). It is clear that the random parameterization exploration algorithm fails to
produce a wide variety of observations. Although the random goal exploration algorithms perform
much better than the random parameterization algorithm, they tend to produce observations that are
cluttered in a small region of the space. On the other hand the observations obtained with modular
goal exploration algorithms are scattered over all the accessible space, with the exception of the case
where the goal space is entangled (VAE).

Abstract. This paper proposes an exploration method for deep rein-
forcement learning based on parameter space noise. Recent studies have
experimentally shown that parameter space noise results in better ex-
ploration than the commonly used action space noise. Previous methods
devised a way to update the diagonal covariance matrix of a noise distri-
bution and did not consider the direction of the noise vector and its cor-
relation. In addition, fast updates of the noise distribution are required to
facilitate policy learning. We propose a method that deforms the noise
distribution according to the accumulated returns and the noises that
have led to the returns. Moreover, this method switches isotropic ex-
ploration and directional exploration in parameter space with regard to
obtained rewards. We validate our exploration strategy in the OpenAI
Gym continuous environments and modified environments with sparse
rewards. The proposed method achieves results that are competitive with
a previous method at baseline tasks. Moreover, our approach exhibits
better performance in sparse reward environments by exploration with
the switching strategy.

1 Introduction
Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent to learn an optimal strategy that
maximizes the cumulative reward through experience. Exploration has an impor-
tant role in the learning process because an agent does not have prior knowledge
of an environment. The optimal action in the agent’s knowledge at that time
is not necessarily the globally optimal action. The agent should activate explo-
ration to acquire a better policy. By contrast, excess exploration leads to bad
performance and does not lead to acquiring better knowledge.
Various strategies have been used to manage this trade-off. One is the Upper
Confidence Bounds (UCB) approach [1]. This method executes exploration by
choosing an arm that maximizes the expected reward and that an agent has

explored less than the other arms. The UCB approach in a multi-armed bandit
has the benefit that its performance can be evaluated theoretically in terms of
regret. However, using this approach in continuous state-action is difficult.
Exploration in continuous state-action space is conducted using some heuris-
tics. Intrinsic motivation is one of the approaches. This method activates ex-
ploration by adding another reward signal (exploration bonus) to the original
task reward. The exploration bonus has various formats. One is the prediction
error of the state or action [17]. An agent learns a predictor of the forwarding or
inverse transition model in parallel with the policy. Another method considers a
novelty of the state using a pseudo-count of visitation with a probability density
function [3]. There is also an approach that calculates the exploration bonus as
the information gain of the transition model [10]. Additionally, there is a style
that automatically generates the simplest tasks that are not achievable by a
current policy to support learning [26]. The intrinsic motivation approach can
perform structured exploration even in continuous state-action space. However,
as mentioned in [8], adding an exploration bonus to the original reward can alter
the optimal solution to which the agent aims.
Injecting noise is another exploration method. Noise can be classified into
three types: -greedy, action space noise and parameter space noise. -greedy
performs exploration by taking a random action with probability . This method
is feasible in discrete state-action space, but infeasible in continuous state-action
space. Action space noise is the most common method in recent deep rein-
forcement learning. It perturbs the output of the policy at each step. Action
space noise can be implemented straightforwardly for most reinforcement learn-
ing methods. Additionally, it is used to implement a stochastic policy. However,
action space noise is less suited to tasks in which subtle positioning is essential be-
cause noise is injected at each step. Parameter space noise performs exploration
by perturbing parameters of the policy. This noise enables agent consistent ex-
ploration because noise is injected at each episode and outputs the same action
in the same state, unlike action space noise. Additionally, the perturbation of
policy parameters leads to a complex change of exploratory behavior. Some re-
searchers have experimentally shown that parameter space noise performs better
exploration than action space noise [20,19].
The evolution strategy (ES) and genetic algorithm (GA) are highly related
to parameter space noise. Recently, ES and GA have been applied to deep re-
inforcement learning [21,25]. The features of these methods were analyzed in
[29,13] and they were experimentally shown to be able to acquire a diverse and
robust policy. These methods have the benefit that they can be applied to a
broad range of problems for which the Markov decision process (MDP) is less
suited. However, they are less sample efficient than the conventional RL algo-
rithm. These methods use only the final result, whereas the conventional RL
algorithm uses all step information in each episode.
To summarize, parameter space noise has the benefit that it can manage con-
tinuous state-action space, does not alter the optimal policy, has the same sample
efficiency as the conventional RL approach and performs better exploration than
action space noise.
2 Related Works
The effectiveness of parameter space noise was first investigated by Ru¨cksiteß
[20]. Ru¨cksiteß conducted experiments with a policy that had relatively small
parameters and specific learning methods: REINFORCE [28] and Natural Actor-
Critic [18]. Recent research has shown that parameter space noise also works well
in deep RL, which includes a large parameter policy [19,8].
Plappert et al. formulated how to update a policy with parameter space noise
both in an off-policy and on-policy manner [19]. Parameter space noise can per-
form better than -greedy and action space noise in Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
[16], Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) [14], and Trust Region Policy
Optimization [22]. Plappert et al. also proposed a method that can connect the
variance of parameter space noise to action space noise. A problem is that this
method perturbs a policy by only using isotropic noise. Isotropic noise can be
inefficient in large parameter space, such as deep neural networks. Fortunato et
al. proposed using factorized functional noise in a DQN [16] and Asynchronous
Advantage Actor-Critic [15]. This approach samples noise from a multivariate
normal distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix. An agent learns both
the covariance matrix and a policy using gradient method [8]. This method only
manages the orthogonal scale of noise distribution and does not consider the cor-
relation between policy parameters. Additionally, learning a covariance matrix
using a gradient method is likely to take a longer time to converge than policy
parameters, as mentioned in [19]. Colas et al. proposed a method that switches
the exploration stage and exploitation stage sequentially [5]. They indicated that
this procedure works well in sparse reward and deceptive reward environments.
This method uses a style of parameter space noise in the exploration stage. This
work still has the problem of when to switch the two stages. The current param-
eter space noise method has three problems: (1) it considers both the scale and
correlation of parameter space noise, (2) it updates covariance quickly for noise
to effect policy learning, and 3) it continuously switches the exploration stage
and exploitation stage.
To overcome the problems (1) and (2), we combine a part of a method: Policy
Improvement with Black Box (PIBB) [24] with Plappert et al.’s method [19].
PIBB updates the policy and covariance matrix using one of the ES methods. We
update only the covariance matrix of parameter space noise using this method
and update the policy with the commonly used RL method. Updating a large
dimension policy using ES requires many training steps because ES can only use
the overall results of an episode, whereas the common RL approach can use all
step information in each episode and use temporal information. Moreover, we
propose a method to switch exploration and exploitative exploration to solve the
problem (3).

Learn policy and Q-function by DDPG
Fig. 1. Overview of the learning system
3 Proposed Method
We consider a standard RL setting. An environment is modeled as an MDP.
The environment consists of state space S, action space A, and reward function
r : S × A 7→ R. An agent learns a policy pi : S 7→ A through interactions with
an environment. θ˜ and p˜i denote the perturbed policy parameter and perturbed
policy parametrized by θ˜, respectively. An overview of the learning system is
shown in Fig.1. The update of the policy is conducted by one of the deterministic
policy gradient [23] methods: DDPG [14]. We propose a method to perturb the
policy.
The proposed method samples parameter space noise ε from the following
distribution:
ε ∼ N (0, (1− α)Σ + ασ2I) . (1)
This method consists of three parts: directional and scalable exploration by co-
variance matrix Σ ∈ RN×N , isotropic exploration by a diagonal matrix σ2I ∈
RN×N and switching the two types of exploration using α ∈ R. N is the num-
ber of policy parameters. We describe how these modules are interrelated and
construct the distribution (1) in the following subsections.
3.1 Directional and Scalable Exploration by Σ
The part of covariance matrix Σ in (1) was designed to solve the two problems
(1) and (2) in related works. Σ can consider the scale and correlation between
policy parameters. The update of Σ is conducted by a part of PIBB [24] based
on Covariance Matrix Adaptation[9]:
Pk =

, (3)
where variable h is a hyper parameter, Jk is the acquired return in the kth
episode, θ denotes the parameters of the policy and θ˜ denotes the parameters
of the perturbed policy. If Jmax = Jmin, then Pk = 1/K. An agent explores an
environment with a policy perturbed per episode and obtains rewards. Equation
(2) calculate weights Pk to reflect the goodness of each perturbation εk on the
next noise distribution. Dividing by Jmax − Jmin enables the use of the same
hyper-parameter h in various environments with different scales of the reward
function. The exponential function expands the gap between returns Jk. This
process makes a weight Pk sensitive to the difference between the returns.
The scale and correlation of the noise is managed by (3). Weighting by Pk
creates a covariance matrix, which generates more noise with the scale and corre-
lation, which led to higher returns in previous episodes. This feature can perturb
large parameter space efficiently. Additionally, it updates the covariance matrix
instantly because it does not use a gradient method. We use small interval K
to update Σ quickly. The frequent update of Σ can reflect the current policy
parameter on current noise.
3.2 Exploration problem of Σ for Sparse Reward Environments
The update manner (2)–(3) can deform Σ adaptively in standard environments.
By contrast, it disables exploration in a sparse reward environment. A sparse
reward environment is a type of environment in which an agent cannot obtain any
rewards until it has achieved or almost achieves a task. In such an environment,
exploration is more critical. An agent with only Σ cannot explore a sparse reward
environment because the variance of the noise distribution decreases rapidly. In
a sparse reward environment, an agent generally receives zero returns in the
environment. Returns with the same value cause the same weights Pk according
to (2). The probability of generating a small noise is high because the noise
is generated from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Σ is updated by a large
population of small noises and the same weights using (3). This process causes
a small variance of the next distribution and generates a small noise with higher
probability. By repeating this, the variance of the distribution of parameter space
noise decreases sharply. As a result, the policy is barely perturbed by the noise
and the agent cannot explore the environment. Additionally, when all weights Pk
have the same value and a bias emerges in the generated noise, the correlation
is accumulated per update, and then an agent can only perturb the policy in a
particular direction.
3.3 Isotropic exploration by σ2I
To solve the variance reduction and fixed correlation of the noise distribution
described in 3.2, isotropic and certain scale exploration is required until an agent
obtains rewards. A part of the covariance matrix σ2I performs this type of
exploration. σ is updated by Plappert et al.’s method [19]:

]
(4)
σ =

, (5)
where |A| is the dimension of actions, δ is a desirable standard deviation of
actions caused by perturbing policy, distance d between the policy and perturbed
policy is calculated as an averaged expected standard deviation and σ is modified
to achieve certain degree of change δ in action space (d ≈ δ).
This method can calculate the variance of noise in parameter space that
causes a certain degree of change in action space. Therefore, an agent can con-
duct a certain amount of exploration despite the current policy parameters. Ad-
ditionally, this part of the covariance matrix is not biased because it considers
no correlation, and all of its diagonal values are the same.
3.4 Switching the two types of exploration using α
Finally, we describe how to switch the two types of exploration. We propose
switching the types using the difference between the acquired returns as a key
to overcome problem (3):
α = exp
(
−h2
Jmax − Jmin
Jmax
)
, (6)
where h2 is a hyper parameter, J is the return, and Jmax and Jmin are the maxi-
mum and minimum returns in certain episodes, respectively. If Jmax is negative,
then α is calculated after Jmin is subtracted from Jmax and Jmin. If Jmax = 0,
then we set α = 1. Σ becomes dominant in (1) when the difference is large and
α becomes close to zero. Directional and scalable exploration by Σ is expected
to be effective when the direction and scale can be inferred by the difference
between the acquired returns.
Equation (6) makes σ2I dominant by setting α close to one when the dif-
ference between the returns is small. The isotropic and a certain amount of
exploration by σ2I are expected to be effective to determine a good direction
of exploration when returns have not been improved. This part of covariance
matrix also seems to be effective in a sparse reward environment to prevent the
variance reduction of Σ.
Moreover, isotropic exploration is useful when a policy converges to local
optima. In this case, returns tend to be the same. With further exploration, an
agent can escape from local optima. Additionally, even if the variance of Σ has
reduced, then the variance of Σ recovers because the next Σ is calculated with
the current σ2I dominant noise.
In this approach, the agent activates exploration using the difference between
the returns as a trigger. Unlike intrinsic motivation, this approach does not alter
the optimal solution of the policy because no exploration bonus is directly added
to the reward function. We summarize the learning procedure in Algorithm 1.

4 Evaluation of a Simple Optimization Problem
First, we evaluate the proposed method using a simple optimization problem for
exploration. We compare the following three methods: fixed variance (FV), adap-
tive covariance (AC) and the proposed method (Pro). FV, AC and Pro generate
parameter space noise from N (0, σ2fixI), N (0, Σ) and N

the experiment in Algorithm 2. Dense and sparse reward functions are defined

θ˜ denotes the perturbed policy parameters. At the start of each episode, θ˜k is
created by perturbing θ. Then the reward acquired is calculated by θ˜k. After the
K episode, θ is updated by the averaged gradient of each θ˜k. The toy problem
above is conducted with a fixed 100 sets of random seeds. The initial parameter
is θ = (0, 0) and the optimal parameter is set to c = (3, 3). In this experiment,
‖θ − c‖ < 0.01 is regarded as the completion of the optimization. “Step when
optimized” is calculated with the data of “Optimized”.
4.1 Results of the Simple Optimization Problem
The results are summarized in Table1. Pro performed better optimization from
the viewpoint of the combined speed and stability. Pro completed optimization
faster than FV. Additionally, AC had a difficulty optimizing in a sparse reward
environment. By contrast, Pro optimized the policy in all scenarios in these
experiments.
Additionally, the optimization processes are visualized in Fig.2. FV took
more time to optimize than Pro; however, it completed the optimization. AC
could not reach the optimal parameter for the random seeds. As mentioned in
subsection 3.2, the variance of parameter space noise decreased sharply and could
not conduct the exploration. Pro did not reduce the variance of the distribution.
When it acquired rewards, it generated directional noise toward the axis of the
rewards. This method achieved much faster optimization than FV.

5 Experiments
We evaluated the proposed method for baseline tasks of deep RL and a sparse
reward environment. We compared it with Plappert et al.,’s method [19].
5.1 Experimental setup of the baseline tasks
The proposed approach was tested on the continuous control tasks from OpenAI-
Gym [4] using the MuJoCo [27] physics simulator. The architecture of the neural
networks and hyper-parameters was almost same as previous work [19]. Both the
actor and critic consisted of two hidden layers, which each had 64 neurons and the
ReLU activation function. The output layer of the actor had tanh as an activation
function. The actions were calculated by multiplying the torque limit and actor
outputs. The critic received actor tanh outputs at its second hidden layer. Input
states were normalized by estimating their mean and variance online. Layer
normalization [2] was applied to all hidden layers. The replay buffer contained
a transition of up to 1,000K states. The actor and critic were soft updated at
τ = 0.01 with the target network. The learning rate of the actor was 10−4
and that of the critic was 10−3. Discount rate γ = 0.99 was used. The Adam
optimizer [11] was applied to optimize both the actor and critic with batch size
64. The critic was regularized using an L2 penalty with coefficient 10−2. The
initial variance of parameter space noise σ2 was set to σ = 0.2 in the dense
reward environment and σ = 0.6 in the sparse reward environment for the prior

method. The hyper parameters of the proposed method were as follows: h = 8.0
in (2), number of episodes to update the covariance K = 10 in (3) (6) and
h2 = 10.0 in (6).
5.2 Results of the baseline tasks
The results are shown in Fig.3. The proposed method achieved competitive per-
formances compared with the previous method. These results suggest that the
agent explored sufficiently with both directional and non-directional noise in
dense reward environments.
5.3 Experiments for sparse reward environments
The proposed method was also tested in continuous control tasks with sparse
reward environments. We used three sparse reward environments: SparseCart-
poleSwingup, SparseDoublePendlumSwinup and SparseHalfCheetah. These en-
vironments were created by modifying environments in rllab [7], and were used
in previous works for evaluation [19,10]. In the SparseCartpoleSwingup task,
an agent received reward +1 only when the agent swung up the pole within a
specific range. SparseDoublePendlum only yielded a reward if the agent reached
the upright position. SparseHalfCheetah only yielded reward +1 when the agent
was beyond 5 m. All the tasks had the same time horizon of 500 steps.

The colored lines and shading correspond to medians and interquartile ranges of the

in 10 sets of fixed random seeds. The return was acquired using the perturbed policy.
5.4 Results for sparse reward environments
The results are summarized in Fig.4. The proposed method achieved better
median performance in SparseCartPoleSwingup than the previous method. In
SparseDoublePendlum, it obtained a competitive policy. In SparseHalfCheetah,
our approach showed better results overall. In the sparse reward environment, it
was essential to acquire a reward continuously. If adaptive covariance acquired
the reward, then it led an agent to explore in the direction of the reward. Al-
though the previous method also acquired a reward with a small probability,
the ratio to transient states with non-zero rewards was small. Therefore, the
previous method had a difficulty in optimizing policy. The results of SparseDou-
blePendlum were not substantially different because this environment did not
seem to require exploration. It was shown in [19] that agents without exploration
can learn the policy.
5.5 Analysis of exploration
We analyze how the proposed method managed exploration in the sparse reward
environment. We analyze two variables relating to exploration. One is the vari-
ance of the noise distribution. The variance indicates the degree of exploration
because it controls the power of noise. We evaluate only a part of the covariance
matrix Σ. It reflects the feature of current noise using (3) whichever part of the

The horizontal axis corresponds to the number of updating Σ. The colored lines and
shading correspond to means and standard deviations in 10 agents. We calculate them
from the start to the minimum “update times” because it changes according to how to
reset an episode. We display values clipped by the domain of each variables.
covariance matrix is dominant. We calculate the trend of the standard deviation
of noise distribution using
σ =
√√√√ 1
N
N∑
i=1
Σii, (10)
where N is the number of policy parameters.
The other variable is α in (6). This parameter switches exploration types by
modifying the dominance between σ2I and Σ. α=1 corresponds to an isotropic
exploration. α=0 corresponds to directional and scaled exploration.
The results are shown in Fig.5. In SparseCartPoleSwingup, isotropic explo-
ration was dominant in the first stage of learning. The scale of noise was large at
the same stage. We believe the reason is that the policy parameters were still far
from the optimal policy, and more perturbation led to better performance. After
the middle stage of the learning process, σ became small. It is expected that the
policy matured, and a smaller perturbation led to a higher return. In SprseDou-
blePendulum, σ had a tiny value and α= 0, except for the first few iterations.
This environment did not seem to require exploration because it was shown in
[19] that agents without exploration can learn the policy. In the SparseHalfChee-
tah environment, agents performed more exploratory behaviors. σ had a larger
value overall. This environment may have required exploration because it had
larger state-action space than the other two environments. In some phases, α
had a small value and exploited the adaptivity of Σ. This may have enabled an
agent to efficiently gather information that contained a high return and learn
faster.
6 Discussion
We experimentally demonstrated competitiveness in a dense reward environment
and an advantage in a sparse reward environment by comparing the proposed
method with a previous method. The proposed method managed the correlation
of parameter space noise, which was not used in previous works [19,8]. Our ap-
proach continuously switched isotropic exploration and directional exploration.
Our switching method can be a solution to the problem that remained in the
previous work [5].
To investigate the performance at convergence is important. In this paper, we
do not show that our approach acquired a better final policy than the previous
method because we terminated learning halfway because of time constraints.
Our approach can be trapped in local optima because it perturbs the policy
along the axis, where locally higher rewards are observed. However, it is possible
that our approach can eventually escape local optima. Equation (6) activates
exploration when the return has converged in addition to when an agent cannot
obtain any return.
The limitation of our approach is a deceptive reward environment. The maze
task with a rat guard is one of the examples. The proposed method cannot escape
from such a trap because it uses a reward signal directly to determine the ex-
ploration strategy. In this environment, intrinsic motivation with an exploration
bonus performs better.
The computational complexity is another problem. The larger the network,
the faster the increase in the amount of noise to sample because noise is needed
for all weights and biases. In this case, the Local Reparameterization Trick [12] is
one of the solutions. This method can reduce the amount of noise to the number
of all neurons.
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a new parameter space noise method for efficient
exploration in reinforcement learning. The proposed method switched isotropic
exploration and directional exploration using the differences of accumulated re-
turns as a key. The direction is determined by the correlations and scales of
noises which have led to higher returns in previous episodes.
Experiments in sparse rewards environments verified that our method could
learn better policy in those environments than Plappert et al.’s method [19]. The
proposed method could proceed stable learning in the SparseCartpoleSwingup
and SparseHalfCheetah environment which the previous method was difficult
to learn. Our experiments also demonstrated that the proposed method did
not improve the performance in the dense reward environment, though it could
acquire competitive performance with the prior method.
Our analysis of exploration showed that our approach first executed explo-
ration with isotropic and large-scale noise and then switched exploration type
to directional and small-scale noise in SparseCartPoleSwingup and SparseDou-
blePendulum. In SparseHalfCheetah, although the noise had large values, an
agent used directional exploration in some phases. These results suggest that
biasing exploration is important especially in sparse reward environment to con-
tinuously obtain rewards and learn policy.
Our proposed method is one of the approaches to modify the strategy of
exploration automatically. Although we switched exploration just using return,
more structured exploration like using Bayesian, which is closely related to pa-
rameter space noise, is future work.

based on parameter space noise. Recent studies have experimentally shown that
parameter space noise results in better exploration than the commonly used

the noise vector and its correlation. In addition, fast updates of the noise
distribution are required to facilitate policy learning. We propose a method
that deforms the noise distribution according to the accumulated returns and
the noises that have led to the returns. Moreover, this method switches
isotropic exploration and directional exploration in parameter space with
regard to obtained rewards. We validate our exploration strategy in the OpenAI

American outer space exploration has been progressively privatized since the end 
of the Cold War. The choice of privatization was a strategic geopolitical decision in the 
interest of maintaining American hegemonic leadership on Earth and in the solar system. 
American Congressional legislation and presidential speeches in the nearly three decades 
since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the “victory” of the American neoliberal form 
of capitalism, show support for the expansion of free-market principles into lower-Earth 
orbit and beyond. However, this is not a new trend. From the beginning of the American 
entry into the space race, the goal has been to achieve and maintain the dominant position 
in outer space. The aim of this thesis is to argue that the move towards American 
privatization of outer space aligns with the American quest for hegemonic 
leadership.  This thesis draws on the historical development of the past 60 years and 
v 
 
relies on presidential speeches and congressional legislation to reveal how American 
governments has justified and explained changing trends in US space policy. The thesis 
assesses the ability of two key international relation theories, Realism and Marxism, to 
help explain the different factors behind the American privatization trend and its 
implications for US power.

INTRODUCTION: THE FINAL FRONTIER 
 
 
Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, described the series as follows: “Star 
Trek speaks to some basic human needs: that there is a tomorrow – it’s not all going to be 
over with a big flash and a bomb; that the human race is improving; that we have things 
to be proud of as humans.”1 Outer space captures the wonderment of individuals and 
communities across the globe and through the course of history. It has been a key piece 
of American foreign policy since the early days of the Cold War. Space exploration 
during the Cold War was a state led endeavor with significant financial and political 
support directed to reaching new heights.  
American outer space exploration has been progressively privatized since the end 
of the Cold War. The choice of privatization was a strategic geopolitical decision in the 
interest of maintaining American hegemonic leadership on Earth and in the solar system. 
American Congressional legislation and presidential speeches in the nearly three decades 
since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the “victory” of the American neoliberal form 
of capitalism, show support for the expansion of free-market principles into lower-Earth 
orbit and beyond. However, this is not a new trend. From the beginning of the American 
entry into the space race, the goal has been to achieve and maintain the dominant position

in outer space. With that in mind, the question is, why did the United States choose to 
privatize its space exploration efforts to assert American hegemonic leadership? 
The move towards American privatization of outer space aligns with the 
American quest for hegemonic leadership.  This thesis draws on the historical 
development of the past 60 years and relies on presidential speeches and congressional 
legislation to reveal how the American government has justified and explained changing 
trends in US space policy.  The thesis assesses the ability of two key international 
relations paradigms (realism and Marxism) to help explain the different factors behind 
this privatization trend and its implications for US power.    
Prior to the 1991 privatization shift, American leadership, reflected in presidential 
speeches and Congressional legislation, utilized the language of common heritage to 
promote American space efforts. Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy established a 
framework for scientific advancement in space for the betterment of humanity, but 
always through American leadership. The first space treaty was signed under President 
Johnson, who heralded the international treaty as the next step in mitigating global 
conflict and, at a minimum, preventing the spread of human conflict into orbit and the 
wider solar system.  
Americans entered the space race in second place, trailing the Soviet Union in 
several space “firsts.”2 Early Soviet achievements included: the first satellite successfully 
                                               
2 The space race began in 1957 with the successful launch of the Soviet Sputnik satellite. 
The Americans entered the following year with the successful launch of the Explorer 1 
satellite. The space race concluded (arguably) with the successful 1969 American lunar 
 
 
3 
 
launched into orbit (Sputnik 1, October 1957), the first human launched successfully into 
orbit (Yuri Gagarin, April 1961), and the first woman to orbit Earth (Valentina 
Tereshkova, June 1963). The Americans followed Sputnik a year later with the 1958 
launch of the Explorer 1 satellite. Alan Shepard, the first American in outer space, 
followed Gagarin not a month later. The first American women in space, however, would 
not occur until Sally Ride successfully launched into orbit in 1983. Though the United 
States started behind, it ultimately won the space race with the successful 1969 Apollo 
Moon Landing - a crowning achievement for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA). The Moon served as the ultimate goal of the space race, 
carrying a significant symbolic weight: “for the United States, coming in first in the 
moon race would tend to confirm the general disposition to believe that once the United 
States makes up its mind to do something it follows through.”3 By the end of the Cold 
War, the United States was the clear leader in space technology and low-Earth orbit. If 
NASA was so successful in achieving American national security goals and enshrining 
US orbital leadership, why did the federal government push privatization so strongly?  
Realist scholars of International Relations theory would argue American 
unilateral action to privatize outer space exploration is a natural act of the hegemon, freed 
from the constraints of balance of power politics under a bipolar world. Marxists would

argue that privatization was deliberate act during the rise of the neoliberal practice of 
capitalism. By critiquing the rise of neoliberal capital to hegemonic status, Marxism 
highlights key pieces that are missed by the realist explanations of the privatization of 
outer space: the role of private property, the influence of commercial interests in 
American government, and the constructed definition of “freedom” and deregulation. 
This chapter will establish the international legal context necessary to understand 
Space policy more generally and the regulations set out in international treaties to define 
and guide state led outer space exploration. It provides an important context for 
understanding US space policy as well as the following two chapters. What follows is a 
discussion of the five international outer space treaties that sought to apply what came to 
be known as the common heritage principles that were developed during the height of the 
Cold War. The common heritage principles were drafted with the idea of closing the 
inequalities among the various states and containing conflict (particularly in light of the 
global nuclear threat). 
The Context: a War so Cold 
Between 1967 and 1979, five international space treaties were drafted, signed, and 
ratified to varying degrees by the international community. The backbone of the treaties, 
the ethos of the treaty system, are the Common Heritage Principles of Humankind. In 
short, the common heritage principles define four main principles to guide and be 
maintained by all states in their quest to conquer outer space. These are: a ban on the 
extension of state sovereignty claims over the moon and any celestial body, the 
redistribution of any scientific and economic benefit to all states, a demilitarized peaceful 
 
 
5 
 
exploration, and a nuclear weapons free outer space. The aim of these principles is that, 
“all of humankind must benefit from sharing the natural resources that are subject to this 
policy.”4 The inclusion of the common heritage principles into the outer space treaties is 
the result of efforts by members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) representing the 
Third World.5 The treaties, as written, act as a constraint on the two superpowers to 
preserve resources and territory for the wider global community, namely the developing 
world.   
 Common heritage was proposed on a global stage in the U.N. General Assembly 
by the Maltese Ambassador, Arvid Pardo in 1967.6 Ambassador Pardo argued for the 
inclusion of the common heritage principle in the Law of the Sea Treaty; laying the 
groundwork for adoption into the space treaties. Pardo urged the classification of the deep 
sea as common land, requiring equal redistribution of economic benefit across the state 
system.  At the time, “both the deep seabed and outer space were believed to contain 
untold riches that were years or decades away from human reach, and by asserting a 
pseudo-beneficial ownership right over them, developing nations hoped to effect a 
redistribution of their benefits that would result in sharing of wealth.”7 Developing

nations were staking a partial ownership, over the unclaimed resources. The ownership 
worked within the established state based system, respecting the sovereignty of borders 
by claiming resources falling within national territory. Deep sea and space resources were 
beyond state borders and thus were untouchable. A state could be (and appeared to be by 
the treaty signatures) more willing to restrict access to resource if their extraction was 
inconceivable. Fighting for the economic redistribution of the common resources, Pardo, 
and by extension Malta as a member of the Non-Alignment Movement, presented the 
views and fears of other recently independent and developing states, particularly those in 
the Global South.8 Namely, the fear of continued wealth accumulation by the Global 
North at the expense and exclusion of the Global South. As the concept of common 
heritage evolved and was incorporated into subsequent treaties, interpretations clashed, 
particularly over the redistribution principle and its impact on notions of private property 
and property classification.  
In the early stages of the space race, the Soviet Union and the United States were 
locked in a balance of power competition, striving to maintain the same level of 
technological advancement and political influence. Further, the United States was 
actively practicing a containment foreign policy, aimed at the Soviet Union.  The 
international system was operating under a bipolar structure, however other states still 
wielded influence and international pressure. NAM is but one example. The two 
superpowers work to court influence and support NAM members and other third world

countries. The United States presented its leadership role in moralistic terms, tying liberal 
economics and politics together as the promotion of freedom. Outer space speeches by 
American presidents during the Cold War reaffirmed the United States commitment to 
the advancement of humankind, as led by the United States. Related legislation, namely 
the NASA authorization acts, provided the action for such grand speeches, declaring the 
driving mission as scientific pursuit (always through American leadership). American 
hegemony has remained tied to a moral stance, that the United States is the leader of the 
“free world,” meaning liberal democracy and liberal markets. 
The US discursive shift occurred clearly and forcefully in 1991. No longer forced 
to balance a competing superpower, American hegemony spread across the wider globe, 
namely through American market practices. American presidential speeches post-1991 
lead the shift, calling for the commercialization of outer space exploration, in the name of 
cost cutting and budgetary responsibility. The presidential tones are set in legislation with 
NASA authorization acts and new legislation on space commercialization calling for 
financially efficient maneuvers, the privatization of American launch capability, and the 
deregulation of outer space access. The new language of outsourcing and commercial 
benefit is a drastic deviation from the pre-shift language (Eisenhower to Carter) which 
promoted scientific advancement for the betterment of humanity (under American 
leadership). However, what is consistent is the language of American leadership and 
protecting the strategic interest of outer space: defending the hegemon.  
American administrations, including NASA, have publicly stated that the 
commercialization of low earth orbit frees government resources, allowing for NASA to 
 
 
8 
 
focus on exploration of the rest of the solar system. The reduction in investment for 
NASA has allowed the reallocation of state resources to other sectors back on Earth. 
American private industry has been more than willing to accept the invitation. SpaceX, in 
particular has met the invitation with gusto, shattering a number of records in recent years 
with ambitious plans to lead the human colonization of Mars.9 If humans will (relatively) 
soon reach the red planet on a permanent basis, a question has to be answered: who does 
outer space belong to? Does the American government possess the international legal 
right to allow its private companies to exploit outer space resources and permanently 
place humans of their choosing out there? The answer depends on the theoretical 
approach used to explain the shift from an approach more in line with the common 
heritage principles (scientific advancement for the betterment of humanity) to 
privatization. 
Debate over legal interpretations of the international outer space treaty system 
provides insight to the motivations of states and regional blocs. One camp, led by the 
United States, adheres to the property classification of res nullius, in regards to the 
potential resources in outer space. Under this interpretation, resources are non-exclusive 
by nature, meaning they do not belong to a single entity. But, the resources are attainable 
and capable of possession by an entity, such as a private corporation enjoying state

support.10 The other main interpretation is that of res communis which classifies a 
resource as beyond individual possession by nature, capable of capture only by joint, 
international ventures.11 The interpretation favored by the Americans, res nullius, 
provides a clear path for commercial exploitation. Technically, both interpretations 
satisfy the ban on the extension of state sovereignty - from a strict government 
perspective. Meaning, neither interpretation allows for a state to plant a flag on Ceres and 
declare a new territory.12 However, the res nullius interpretation allows for American 
companies and other private actors to extract resources from an asteroid or a planet (for 
example), remove them, claim then, and, ideally, profit off of the resource. This becomes 
a route for the expansion of American influence through the solar system. This is evident 
in the post-1991 privatization shift where Congressional legislation states outer space 
must be developed under the principles of free market capitalism. 
Outer space and the celestial bodies were not the first realms to fall under the 
common heritage principles. The principles have been applied “...to areas beyond the 
limits of natural jurisdiction and to natural resources found there...” such as the 
unclaimed deep sea and Antarctica.13 The Law of the Deep Sea and the Antarctic Treaty 
also embodied various forms of the common heritage principles sharing a common ban

11 Hedges, “How the rest was Won,” p382. 
12 Based off of Ian Hedge’s article: Both classifications, res nullius and res communis 
refer to the commons themselves, which by definition are beyond national claim. It is a 
question of, claimed territory as the commons or unclaimed territory that can sectioned 
off as private property at a later date. See Hedges, p382.

on sovereignty claims, nuclear free zones, demilitarized, and with some goal of shared 
knowledge.14 The technological and geo-political limits of the time effectively protected 
unclaimed territory from unilateral claims of ownership and extraction. The intention is 
to preserve access to resources (and wealth) beyond current political and technological 
reach, until a mechanism for redistribution is established. It was a delay tactic. The deep 
sea was beyond the reach of the exclusive economic zones and Antarctica was remote 
enough that no country could secure it against rival claims. And humans had only just 
barely touched outer space. 
 The question becomes, why would such a diverse group of states ban together and 
demand redistribution? The nuclear conflict was at its peak, under the policy of mutually 
assured destruction. Common heritage, and the treaty systems it inspired, was an attempt 
to counter the superpower dominance and to mitigate escalations in conflict. Essentially, 
the developing world sought to prevent the international legalization of the colonial 
structure in space. The global legal structure under the UN was still new, growing 
through adolescence. One wing of NAM advocated for redistribution of the planet’s 
resources; pointing to colonialist capitalism as the cause for global inequality.15 
Protecting resources from unilateral exploitation granted NAM members time to develop, 
time to close the gap between developed and developing states. From a realist 
                                               
14 The Antarctic Treaty entered into force in 1961, before Ambassador Pardo advocated 
for the common heritage principles in 1967. However, elements of what will be known as 
the common heritage principles appear in the Antarctic Treaty.

perspective, protecting unfeasibly exploitable resources increases the chances of the 
developed states agreeing to the binding rules of the space treaties.  
The Republic of India is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and played an 
instrumental role in the promotion of the NAM agenda throughout the Cold War. India is 
a successful and rising space power, currently committed to a public led space 
development process. From the founding of the Indian Department of Space (DOS), the 
union government has been committed to the practice of the common heritage 
principles.16  
Uniquely, the DOS was founded, in 1972, with the primary objective to promote 
“development and application of space science and technology to assist in all-around 
development of the nation.”17 The DOS was a civilian endeavor where other space 
agencies grew out of military organizations. To accomplish its founding mission, the 
DOS created the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) which has met and 
continues to meet its original objective of domestic development, while shattering global 
space records. Launching of satellites, for example, has facilitated critical infrastructure 
development from “linking stock exchanges to relaying cricket broadcasts from around to 
                                               
16 Granted, there is a question over just how committed the union government will remain 
with increased outer space success in light of the increased liberalization of the Indian 
economy, but that is for a different paper.

the world” to providing real time data on weather systems.18 India reached the Moon with 
the Chandrayaan-1 satellite in 2008.19 In 2013, India became the first Asian state to reach 
Mars with the successful launch of the Mangalyaan satellite. Mangalyaan also carries the 
distinction of the world’s cheapest, successful Martian mission. And, India is the first 
state to reach the red planet on a first attempt.20 Indian space efforts are certainly 
increasing. But, India is not necessarily a contender for space dominance, at least not yet.  
Cold War competition forced the United States to simultaneously cooperate and 
compete with its Soviets rivals while considering the demands of the developing world. 
The 1990s shift in American rhetoric and posturing allowed for a cooperative foreign 
policy, on the hegemon’s terms. Collaboration on the International Space Station and the 
decommissioning the American space shuttle program are examples of such a foreign 
policy and the level of self-assurance felt in the halls of Washington. Allowing private 
capital to shoulder the funding burden at this point in time revealed Washington’s 
confidence in its leadership in lower earth orbit and permitted the reallocation of 
resources to others realms of the hegemon’s leadership priorities. Privatization was a 
strategic move. American corporations are now responsible for developing lower earth 
orbit with room to reach the Moon and Mars. Washington’s resources are now focused,

space wise, on expanding to the asteroid belt and beyond, such as through the Orion 
project. The American state fostered the domestic space industry for its own interests. 
The Five Outer Space Treaties 
The common heritage principles form the ethos of the five outer space treaties. 
This next section examines each of the five treaties, highlighting the common heritage 
aspects in the treaties. The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the 
Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, the 
Outer Space Treaty, of 1967 is the progenitor of current international space law and 
frames the treaty system and has been ratified by 104 states.21   The Outer Space Treaty 
begins by “reaffirming the importance of international cooperation in the field of 
activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and 
other celestial bodies, and the importance of developing the rule of law in this new area 
of human endeavor.”22  From the beginning, common heritage asserts itself side by side 
with the need for international cooperation. It asserts that a single state should not explore 
space on its own; from a cooperation viewpoint as well as a balance of power view point. 
The treaty enshrines the “common-interest” of humanity in the peaceful exploration of 
outer space, which should benefit all of humanity over specific nations and peoples.23 As,

Article 1 states in the first paragraph, “The exploration and use of outer space, including 
the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the 
interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific 
development, and shall be the province of all mankind.”24 Article 2 expressly bans 
“national appropriation by claims of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by 
any other means.”25 From the opening of the treaty, the authors classify outer space and 
all celestial bodies as international domain, protected from sovereignty claims. As an 
international domain, any benefits reaped by one nation are to be shared with all, for the 
betterment of the global community. The legally binding treaty enforces the ideals of 
common heritage banning any and all nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction, and 
the placement of military personnel and equipment (except to aid peaceful, scientific 
exploration) in outer space. Space exploration is to be pursued strictly for peaceful 
purposes and discoveries are to be shared with the international community, in addition to 
the United Nations.26 The treaty promotes an ideal of cooperation among the states, with 
the intention, the hope, of growing “friendly relations between States and peoples.”27 The 
Outer Space Treaty sets the tone for the space treaty system – seeking to stave off 
military conflict in Earth’s orbit while recognizing the structural inequalities of the 
international system.28 The treaty also mentions that space resources are an opportunity

global system. Example: The annex includes: “Believing that the exploration and use of

for a technological and scientific boom; the treaties recognize this by requiring 
redistribution of knowledge acquired to all states equally. The redistribution is an effort 
to ensure segments of the global community are not left behind and continue to face 
domination by the dominant states. 
The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts, and the 
Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space, the Rescue Agreement, of 1967 was 
ratified by 94 states.29  The treaty opens with a call for peaceful exploration of space. Its 
preamble adding a “sense of urgency” to the development of the liability treaty, 
recognizing the need for codified space law.30 The agreement requires all members to 
notify the respective state and the U.N. in the event of astronaut distress and to render all 
possible assistance31 Mirroring similar rules on the high seas; the Rescue Agreement 
establishes a community a space travelers. Regardless of state agenda, astronauts are 
human explores, perusing an exploration mission for humanity. State and corporate 
squabbles should not interfere with rescuing astronauts in distress. 
The Convention on the International Liability for Damage Caused by Space 
Objects, the Liability Convention, of 1971 (ratified by 92 states32) begins in a similar

fashion, “reaffirming the importance of international cooperation in the field of the 
exploration and peaceful uses of outer space,” continues with “recognizing the common 
interest of all mankind in furthering the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space.”33 
The treaty assigns liability, in the case of damage of a space object, to the launching state, 
requiring compensation.34 Article 5 provides for joint-missions, including countries that 
provide the facilities for launching.35 Article 21 opens the door for third state intervention 
in the case of a catastrophic accident, yet still respecting the state-based system by 
requiring permission from the impacted state.36   This is effectively a compromise with 
the state based system to encourage more states to sign the treaty, borders will be 
respected. The Liability treaty allows for the intervention of the international community, 
while respecting state sovereignty. This again reaffirms the treaty system as a product of 
the state system. 
The Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, the 
Registration Convention, of 1974 was ratified by 62 states.37 The treaty begins by 
“reaffirming the importance of international cooperation in the field of the exploration 
and peaceful uses of outer space” and recognizes “the common interest of all mankind in

furthering the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes.”38 The treaty 
requires all nations to register objects launched into outer space and to provide 
identifying data when feasible to a central, international registrar under the authority of 
the Secretary General of the United Nations.39 All states, regardless of scientific 
advancement are entitled to full and equal access to the register of launched space 
objects.40 This provision ensures the redistribution of scientific knowledge, facilitating 
peaceful exploration by limiting the need for competition over scientific discoveries. 
According to the U.N.’s Office for Outer Space Affairs, 92% of all craft launched into 
outer space have been registered on the Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space.41 
Only 62 states have ratified the convention, but compliance is high due to the high 
registration rate. The treaty carries legitimacy.  
Ratified by sixteen non-space faring states, the Agreement Governing the 
Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies of 1979 is considered a failed 
treaty.42 Known as the Moon Treaty, the language in the agreement follows its 
predecessors by reflecting the ethos of the Common Heritage principle.43 The treaty 
opens with stating the importance of the natural satellite to the peaceful exploration at

space with the intention of preventing “the moon from becoming an area of international 
conflict.”44 In keeping with the Common Heritage principle, the treaty addresses the 
economic benefit the Moon represents. In the preamble, the treaty states “Bearing in 
mind the benefits which may be derived from the exploitation of the natural resources of 
the moon and other celestial bodies.”45 This consideration is addressed in Article 4: 
“The exploration and use of the moon shall be the province of all mankind and 
shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective 
of their degree of economic or scientific development. Due regard shall be paid to 
the interests of the present and future generations as well as the need to promote 
higher standards of living and conditions of economic and social progress and 
development in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.”46 
Article 4 embodies the Common Heritage principle of common ownership and economic 
redistribution. Following the Common Heritage principle, Article 11 protects the moon 
from declarations of state claims of sovereignty and calls for the creation of “an 
international regime including appropriate procedures to govern the exploitation of the 
national resources of the moon.”47 However, the subsequent article allows for state 
jurisdiction to remain over the respective equipment, infrastructure, and citizens on the 
moon.48 A state may not establish a national claim of territory on the moon, yet its 
equipment and citizens remain under its protection while on the moon. States are allowed

to establish crewed facilities, but only in such a way that does not restrict access to the 
Moon itself.49 Following its companion treaties, the Moon treaty enforces a demilitarized 
nature of the moon, but does allow for the “use of military personnel for scientific 
research or for any other peaceful [purpose].”50  
The key to this treaty and one of the main goals of the space treaty system is to 
facilitate peaceful scientific research on the moon and the sharing of newfound 
information with the wider scientific community. States are required to share “activities 
concerned with the exploration and use of the moon,” in line with the Liability and 
Registration Conventions, and the Outer Space Treaty.51 Article 5 continues, specifically, 
that each participating state must inform the U.N., though the Secretary-General, “the 
public, and the international scientific community, of any phenomena they discover in 
outer space, including the moon, which could endanger human life or health, as well as of 
any indication of organic life.”52 Furthermore, the freedom of scientific investigation 
must be respected and protected by all participating states.53 States are allowed, by the 
Moon treaty, to explore and to extract resources yet, in a progressive move, states must 
avoid damaging the “existing balance of its environment, whether by introducing adverse 
changes in that environment, by its harmful contamination through the introduction of

extra-environmental matter or…extra-terrestrial matter…or otherwise.”54 Reflecting an 
awareness of the environmental degradation experienced on Earth, the treaty writers seem 
to be pre-empting potential resource exploitation on the moon. Embracing the state-based 
structure that is the current international system, the treaty states in Article 14, “State 
Parties to this Agreement shall bear international responsibility for national activities on 
the moon, whether such activities are carried out by governmental agencies, or by non-
governmental entities…”55  States are responsible for their non-state actors. This article is 
key to the future of space development and exploration as private companies are 
preparing to reach the stars. Additionally, Article 14 is a point of affirmation for the state-
based system; agency lies with the state not with private enterprise.  
Developing states and the Non-Aligned Movement attempted to use international 
space law “to establish an international regime that would regulate the exploitation of 
resources according to the CHM principle – a challenge to the dominance of spacefaring 
superpowers through the mechanism of international law.”56 The Moon Treaty is 
representative of this initiative: using the international system established by the 
dominant powers to constrain the dominant powers. This explains, at least partially, why 
the Moon Treaty was not ratified. The space powers (United States, Russia, India, China, 
and the majority of the E.U.) did not ratify it; which leaves the door open to “coercively

develop international [space] law by unilateral action.”57 Meaning, individual countries 
and regional blocs will frame future exploration and development outside of international 
agreements. The American choice of commercial development is an example of this, seen 
through unilateral legislative action such as the SPACE Act of 2015.58 The SPACE Act 
allows American citizens to extract and profit from outer space resources directly.59 In 
this regard, it is clear that the US does not want to restrict itself and its corporations from 
pursuing an economic benefit. The Moon is closer to exploration and development than it 
was in 1967. The US is still under obligations of the Outer Space Treaty. But, American 
corporations do not share these obligations, thanks to the failure of the Moon Treaty. This 
is significant as the global economy has liberalized since the close of the Cold War, 
expanding the role of non-state actors in international relations. The gaps in the treaty 
system have being utilized by states (the United States) and non-state actors (SpaceX for 
example) for expansion.

jurisdiction over ‘any asteroid resource’..” and requiring the U.S. President ‘to facilitate 
the commercial exploration and utilization of space resources to meet the national 
needs…’ which “is a form of national appropriation by ‘other means.’” In other words, 
this act is dangerously pushing the bounds of American jurisdiction (unilaterally) onto 
asteroids and other celestial bodies.

CHAPTER 2  
AMERICAN OUTER SPACE RHETORIC 
 
The collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War with the “victory” of 
the United States brought a drastic shift in American outer space policy. Throughout the 
course of the Cold War and the Space Race, American rhetoric focused on the scientific 
imperative of outer space exploration and the need to keep outer space “Free.” American 
presidents, such as John F. Kennedy, passionately defended a heavy federal investment in 
outer space with calls for “Free men” to lead the way in order to stop the spread of 
tyranny. Lyndon B. Johnson described the outer space treaties as the best method to 
constrain the Cold War conflict to the planet, preventing the spread of war to outer space. 
But, as soon as the Cold War tensions ebbed, American rhetoric shifts to cost-saving 
measures and deregulation to ensure entrepreneurial innovation is allowed to flourish. 
The question of this chapter, and this thesis, is why? Why did American rhetoric swing so 
drastically from tacitly supporting aspects of the common heritage principles (enshrined 
in the space treaties) to supporting the privatization of outer space exploration?60 The 
answer lies in the protection of American hegemonic leadership. 
This chapter will examine two sets of documents related to American outer space 
exploration that will help explain how the US sought to maintain its hegemonic 
leadership in outer space through the changing of geopolitical realities in the international 
                                               
60 In this case, American “support” for the common heritage principles in the outer space 
treaties refers to American ratification of 4 out of the 5 treaties.

system. First, this chapter will examine U.S. Presidential speeches and executive 
documents from each president from the beginning of the space race. Second will be an 
examination of NASA authorization and reauthorization acts, additional related 
Congressional legislation, and related testimony during Congressional hearings. Both sets 
of documents will demonstrate a commitment (by the American government) to 
promoting, expanding, and protecting American hegemonic leadership in outer space. 
The two sets of documents will also highlight a shift in the presidential and congressional 
language at the Cold War: a shift away from the common heritage language to the 
language of privatization and capital expansion. 
Each speech and presidential document addresses a topic of outer space 
exploration, from advocating for a moon mission to celebrating the successes of a private 
space company. Dwight Eisenhower’s farewell address and recorded satellite 
transmission with Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural address, his 1961 special address to the 
Congress, and his 1962 moon speech established a consistent, guiding philosophy for 
American efforts in the space race. The approach established by Kennedy and 
Eisenhower, prior to the signing of the outer space treaties, was one of peaceful, scientific 
discovery to better humankind, but through American leadership. Johnson delivered brief 
remarks at the signing ceremony of the first outer space treaty in 1967, reflecting the 
current state of war the country was in. Richard Nixon announced the shuttle program in 
a 1972 speech, defending the investment by listing the material benefits of outer space 
exploration over the geostrategic motivations of exploration. Jimmy Carter recorded a 
speech in 1977 to be placed on the Voyager satellite, the first extrasolar human 
 
 
25 
 
spacecraft.61To this point in the chronological rhetoric, each speech and set of remarks 
were delivered at a key time in the development of the space program. The shift towards 
privatization begins during the Reagan administration with his 1984 State of the Union 
and “Star Wars” speech. Remarks by George H.W. Bush in 1989 reflect the intimate 
relationship between national policy in outer space and the expansion of American 
economic practices; meaning the connection between freedom and open markets. The 
final four speeches and documents from George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and the current 
presidential administration demonstrate the increasing support for privatization of low 
earth orbit, culminating in the attempted commercialization of the International Space 
Station.  
Examining the narrative chronologically, from the launch of the Explorer I 
satellite in 1958 to the recent announcement of privatizing the International Space 
Station, depicts clearly the tidal shift in the American perspective across the various 
presidential administrations while highlighting the commitment to the promotion and 
defense of American hegemony. Presidential speeches establish a framework for U.S. 
policy, particularly defense policy, and can provide an indication of the president’s 
political priorities and what he believes the American people need to know and support.62 
I selected at least one speech or document from each president following the launch of 
Explorer I in 1958, with the exception of Presidents Ford and Clinton.

62 As of the writing of this thesis, each of the 44 American presidents have identified as 
male. It is the hope of this writer that this will change sooner rather than later.

The presidential speeches and remarks provide insight into the kind if outer space 
related legislation that the United States Congress was encouraged to pass and eventually 
adopt. The NASA authorization acts are the tangible actions of the presidential speeches 
reflecting the sentiments expressed in the presidential speeches of its time. This chapter 
will examine one per decade, beginning with the first NASA authorization of 1958, to 
trace the changing sentiments and priorities of American space development. Particular 
attention is paid to the acts of 1984 and 1991 as they sandwich the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and the global power shift from a bipolar world to a unipolar one. The NASA 
authorizations examined in this chapter were passed by both major American political 
parties, demonstrating a level of consensus on legislative intent. The remaining 
legislation and policy directives examined were drafted and passed in the new, unipolar 
world of the 1990s and 2000s.  
Eisenhower to Carter 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower established a framework to govern US space 
policy intended, at least in formal terms, to benefit humanity. His framework 
incorporated aspects of what will be the common heritage principles: the betterment of 
humanity and containment of global conflict and warfare. 
 Eisenhower recorded the first human message transmitted from orbit to Earth via 
satellite. In that brief, technologically significant message, Eisenhower set the tone for 
early space exploration: “Through this unique means, I convey to you and all mankind, 
 
 
27 
 
America’s wish for peace on earth and good will to men everywhere.”63 It is a simple 
message that is constantly repeated by subsequent presidents to sum up American 
intentions in outer space. It is a peace led by American efforts.  
Eisenhower’s “Military-Industrial Complex” speech, delivered as his farewell 
address in January 1961, is not directly related to outer space exploration. However, the 
tension in Eisenhower’s warning foreshadows the tension in future American outer space 
exploration (public versus private led and the role of non-state actors in US government 
foreign policy): 
But each proposal must be weighted in the light of a broader 
consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national 
programs – balance between the private and the public economy, balance 
between cost and hoped for advantage – balance between the clearly 
necessary and the comfortably desirable; balance between our essential 
requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the 
individual; balance between actions of the moment and the national 
welfare of the future. Good judgement seeks balance and progress; lack of 
it eventually finds imbalance and frustration.64 
 
Eisenhower is advocating a measured and balanced policy approach at a time of new 
strength and prosperity for the United States, fearing the new military might and wealth 
will tip the country too far in one direction. Eisenhower claims, “…American leadership 
and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and

military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human 
betterment.”65 Americans must act in a benevolent manner, always striving to improve 
human society for both the present moment and for the future. Eisenhower is establishing 
a presidential framework of human progress through American leadership. 
Eisenhower devotes a paragraph to describing the “conflict now engulfing the 
world.”66 The conflict “commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings.”67 The 
singular focus on global conflict threatens American efforts to “foster progress in human 
achievement.” Mitigation of conflict and war therefore supports global human progress.  
Though Eisenhower’s military-industrial speech does not directly address outer 
space it highlights the emerging tensions between the public and private realms while 
establishing a framework for America’s new global leadership role. 
Eisenhower established a framework of American leadership through dominance 
using the moral argument: all for the betterment of humankind. President John F. 
Kennedy expanded on this arguing in his 1962 “Moon Speech” at Rice University in 
Texas. American boots on the lunar surface would eventually lead to American victory in 
the space race. The significance of the Moon is a recurring theme in American space 
endeavors: it was seen as the crown jewel of the space race, will be a potential launching 
point for missions further afield, and will be a contentious point in future administrations.

Kennedy’s moon speech was delivered during a time of global instability and the 
speech was a recognition of that, telling the crowd, “...we meet in an hour of change and 
challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance…”68 
To meet that fear, to conquer it, Kennedy advocates for increased scientific investment, in 
order to understand the marvels of the universe. A national security planning document 
from May, 1963 called for a continued “emphasis in the field of space exploration on 
broadening our horizon of knowledge...with particular attention to the political 
implications of our achievements measured against those of the USSR, and the assurance 
of our national security.”69 The scientific advancement will serve to close the gap in the 
space race with the Soviets. But, Kennedy urges a form of restraint. Echoing 
Eisenhower, Kennedy states: “We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with 
weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.”70 
He thereby upholds two of the key tenets of what will become the common heritage 
principles: peaceful exploration of outer space through demilitarization and establishing a 
nuclear weapons free zone. Kennedy continues, despite the “hazards” space holds “to all 
of us,” scientific advancement must be the primary driver of space exploration, “for the

with the American embargo of Cuban goods and the Cuban Missile crisis sandwiching

good of all men…” and to ensure the U.S. becomes “the world’s leading space-faring 
nation.”71 The speech recognizes the communal nature of space exploration that space 
does not, cannot, belong to any one nation (Kennedy is now echoing three of the four key 
tenants). But, one nation can lead in space exploration, one nation can (and should) 
dominate the process: “Whether [space] will become a force for good or ill depends on 
man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help 
decided whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of 
war.”72 In his moon speech, Kennedy fills out Eisenhower’s guideline by reiterating that 
peaceful scientific advancement of outer space will serve humanity, but only when the 
United States is in the lead of outer space exploration and discovery.  
If Kennedy builds on Eisenhower’s guidelines by establishing a clear direction for 
outer space exploration, President Lyndon B. Johnson puts into action Kennedy’s 
guidelines. Johnson signed the Outer Space Treaty in January, 1967. The first of the five 
treaty system (counting the failed Moon treaty), the Outer Space Treaty established the 
standards for international outer space behavior.73 The common heritage principles form 
the frame of the treaty, including sentiments previously expressed by Kennedy and 
Eisenhower. In his brief remarks at the signing ceremony, Johnson summarizes the treaty 
as ensuring “the moon and our sister planets will serve only the purposes of peace and not 
                                               
71 Kennedy, ""Moon Speech.” 
72 Kennedy, ""Moon Speech."" 
73 The four key tenets of the common heritage principles (as related to the outer space 
discussion) are: demilitarized zone, nuclear weapons free zone, redistribution/shared 
knowledge and economic benefit for human advancement, and a ban on unilateral 
sovereignty claims.

war.”74 Johnson continue with, “we have never succeeded in freeing our planet from the 
implementations of war. But if we cannot yet achieve this goal here on earth, we can at 
least keep the virus from spreading.”75 Johnson is furthering the moral argument of his 
immediate two predecessors: committing the United States to an international treaty 
system dedicated to common exploration and benefit through peaceful exploration. 
Johnson’s remarks are, in a way, resigned yet hopeful.  
The year 1967 was a year of cold and hot conflict with the Vietnam War raging 
on and the threat of nuclear annihilation ever present (granted, it was LBJ’s campaign 
that aired the famous “Daisy” ad). Johnson’s remarks are defending an action that could 
be seen as threatening American sovereignty by restricting American range of action in 
outer space. Under the Outer Space treaty, American nuclear weapons have to remain on 
earth, the military could not deploy more conventional weapons in outer space, and the 
government cannot extend territorial control to the Moon or other celestial bodies. In his 
remarks, Johnson states his hope that thanks to the Outer Space treaty, “astronaut and 
cosmonaut will meet someday on the surface of the moon as brothers and not as warriors 
for competing nationalities or ideologies.”76 The moon will be a place of international 
cooperation, not an extension of the Cold War.

President Richard Nixon’s administration saw the next step in the scientific 
leadership of the United States, as the launch of the shuttle program. Nixon announced 
the shuttle in 1972 by espousing the material benefits of space exploration from “the 
tremendous potential of satellites for international communications and world-wide 
weather forecasting” to “agricultural applications, and in pollution control.”77 Nixon 
claimed that “it will go a long way toward delivering the rich benefits of practical space 
utilization and the valuable spinoffs from space efforts into the daily lives of Americans 
and all people.”78 Nixon espoused the material benefits of outer space exploration for the 
American population while also including the benefit to the global community, in a nod 
to the common heritage principle. 
Nixon expanded the US declared moral mission to better humankind by adding an 
ecological argument to the America motivation in space. The Blue Marble photograph 
will be released to the public in December, 1972, taken during the Apollo 17 mission. 
This first, color photograph of the Earth will be broadcast to the global public providing 
visualization for how tiny the planet is in compared to the wider universe. Nixon’s 
statement of guardianship sounds similar to the preservation calls in the common heritage 
treaties. But, following the framework established by his predecessors, Nixon calls for 
guardianship through American leadership. The new space shuttle is the next step in 
space technology, the next step in continuing American dominance in outer space (by this

time, the US had beaten the Soviets to the Moon). Nixon adds a dimension to the 
framework by including the material benefits of outer space. Yes, scientific advancement 
is the motivator, but it brings with it civilian benefits in the form of consumer goods. 
Privatization won’t enter the conversation for another decade, but the focus on material 
wealth is already present in the presidential conceptions of outer space politics. 
The satellite Voyager I was launched in 1977 containing the Golden Record. 
Included in the recordings was a letter penned by President Jimmy Carter:  
We are a community of 240 million human beings among the more than 4 billion 
who inhabit planet Earth....We are attempting to survive our time so we may live 
into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a 
community of galactic civilizations...This record represents our hope and our 
determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.79 
 
In his letter to a potential galactic community, Carter speaks of a global community, a 
recognition that advancement in space exploration can and will impact the planet. 
Carter’s letter aligns closely with the common heritage principles and Gene 
Roddenberry’s motivations for creating Star Trek. The primary connection to common 
heritage is the last line of the quote, orienting space exploration as one of peaceful 
intentions, instead of conquering and resource exploitation.

Reagan and Beyond 
The first indication of US inclination towards the privatization of space conquest 
can be traced back to the presidency of Ronald Reagan.80 Reagan’s 1984 State of the 
Union Address to a joint session of Congress sets clear, national priorities geared to 
“rigorous economic growth” that leads to a “sparkling economy [that] spurs initiatives, 
sunrise industries, and makes older ones more competitive.”81  The key “to a dynamic 
decade is vigorous economic growth” through “[bringing] Federal deficits down” and by 
“[limiting] the size and scope of government…” through reducing “the growth of Federal 
regulations by more than 25 percent…”82 Reagan’s focus is clear, a reduction in federal 
spending and federal regulations will spur economic growth. Reagan also call for the 
development of a “permanently manned space station” in collaboration with international 
partners who will aid in the American mission to “strengthen peace, build prosperity, and 
expand freedom.”83 Following his predecessors, Reagan boasts American outer space 
efforts have “pushed civilization forward with our advances in science and technology” 
and that Americans should “be proud to say: We are first; we are the best; and we are so 
because we’re free.”84 The specific outer space privatization turn comes when Reagan 
                                               
80 This was an extension of a wider pattern of privation through the dismantling of the 
state structure experienced across the federal government throughout the 1980s.

argues that “space holds enormous potential for commerce.85 The market for space 
transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it. Companies interested in putting 
payloads into space must have ready access to private sector launch services.”86 Reagan 
directs the Department of Transportation and other executive offices to “promote private 
sector investment in space.”87 The presidential rhetoric is beginning to shift towards 
favoring privatization. Elements of Reagan's State of the Union do follow his 
predecessors, declaring American leadership benefits human advancement and touting 
the scientific strength of American space research. But, within the context of cutting 
federal spending and regulations the presidential privatization shift is clear. 
The legislative shift in support of Reagan’s vision, however, took some time to 
materialize. The 1985 NASA Authorization bill follows the same path as its predecessors, 
declaring “that it is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be 
devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of humankind.”88 The 1985 authorization 
cites “the expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and space…” 
as justification for the continued funding of NASA. 89 Nestled in that justification is the 
heart of American space policy: “the preservation of the role of the United States as a 
leader in aeronautical and space science technology…”90 The legislative justifications

and rhetoric remains similar to previous decades, focused on maintaining and promoting 
American leadership in outer space through peaceful exploration of outer space. The 
legislative rhetoric remains closer to the common heritage principles as the presidential 
rhetoric pivots away from the principles and towards privatization.  
 On the 20th anniversary of the 1969 Apollo Moon landing, President George 
H.W. Bush delivered a speech at NASA headquarters to commemorate the event. Bush 
claimed “space is the inescapable challenge to all the advanced nations of the Earth.”91 
Exploration and expansion into outer space is natural to the powerful nations of the 
planet, Bush says. He continues, “in the 21st century, humans will again leave their home 
planet for voyages of discovery and exploration.”92 The allure of space makes it 
impossible to ignore, for the advanced nations. Bush is separating developed nations 
(such as Japan, the EU, Canada, Russia, and the US – future partners in the International 
Space Station) from the developing nations. This is a divergence from one of the key 
tenets of the common heritage principle that all states, regardless of development level, 
enjoy the benefits of outer space exploration. The “benefit of humanity” rhetoric is 
sliding away. The National Space Council Authorization Act of 1990 reestablished the 
defunct national policy council. The council was tasked with examining “the 
consequences of the entry of nonmarket providers of launch services and satellites into 
the world market…[and] the importance of the United States launch vehicle and satellite

industry to the national and economic security.”93 The council was tasked with 
commercialization of outer space exploration. 
Commercialization of space came into force through the 1991 NASA 
Authorization bill which, for the first time, added “to the functions of NASA those of: (1) 
seeking and encouraging the fullest commercial use of space, and (2) encouraging and 
providing for Federal Government use of commercially provided space services and 
hardware.”94 The additions to NASA’s guiding document breaks from previous NASA 
authorizations which, at a minimum, appeal to the common benefit of space exploration 
(breaking from the common heritage principles). The act further “adds to the list of duties 
of the Secretary of Transportation in carrying out the Act that of facilitating private sector 
involvement in commercial space transportation activity and promoting public-private 
partnerships to build, expand, modernize, or operate space launch infrastructure.”95 The 
Federal executive through the cabinet secretaries is required to pursue the private space 
industry. The 1991 act merges the presidential rhetoric of privatization with legislative

action. The key result is the allowance of “the private sector to acquire U.S. launch 
property and services which are not needed for public use.”96 
Allowing private industry access to launch facilities begins the process of 
dismantling what had previously been strict state control over outer space access. Reagan 
set the precedence for allowing private actors direct access to outer space by connecting a 
healthy private space sector to the national security. If private actors are integral to the 
national security, then the next step would be to allow private actors direct access to outer 
space itself. Why should the state be the gatekeeper?   
Commercialization continued without subtlety. The 1998 Commercial Space Act 
unabashedly states: 
The Congress declares that a priority goal of constructing the International Space 
Station is the economic development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further 
declares that free and competitive markets create the most efficient conditions for 
promoting economic development, and should therefore govern the economic 
development of Earth orbital space.97 
 
One key priority, according to the legislation, of the International Space Station is the 
creation of a market in outer space. Outer space, and the development of it, are in the 
national interest of the United States; that is reiterated with each administration and 
related piece of legislation. The national interest of the United States, in outer space, is 
now the development of markets.

The International Space Station (ISS) was a collaborative endeavor involving the 
space agencies of: the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, and the Europeans. In line 
with Bush’s Apollo anniversary speech, the station was a club of “advanced” nations. 
Russia, the former rival and competitor in space, was folded into the American sphere of 
influence in outer space. The Cold War ended and the competition disappeared: the 
United States stood (continues to stand) alone in outer space. Without competition, 
American priorities shifted towards developing a profitable market environment in low 
earth orbit. The 1998 Commercialization Act required the NASA administrator to pursue 
“the fullest possible commercial use of space” including through privatizing the space 
shuttle program.”98 The focus of American outer space foreign policy became “safety and 
cost effectiveness.”99 
Prior to the privatization shift, the United States responded to the Cold War 
rivalry with a policy of power balancing and competition. Under the bipolar structure, the 
goal was to meet the Soviets, then beat them, in outer space. The justification was that 
humanity could only benefit from space under the banner of a free nation, namely the 
United States. Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the rival Soviet 
Union, the banner of “freedom” was extended to the ISS, but under a policy of economic 
expansion. Without concern for a geopolitical rival, the US could afford to look at market 
development through private actors while joining with its former rival.

Two years following the commercialization act, the 2000 NASA Authorization 
bill codified the new, cost-saving focus of the federal executive into NASA’s funding 
document. The bills allowed for international cooperation in the exploration of outer 
space only when it: “reduces the cost of undertaking missions the United States 
government would pursue unilaterally” and “is undertaken in a manner that is sensitive to 
the desire of United States commercial providers to develop or explore space 
commercially…”100 The lofty language of common heritage was set aside in favor of the 
commercial benefit disguised in the language of adventure.  
President George W. Bush continued the extension of privatization in his 2004 
speech laying out his vision for the next phase of American space policy. The second 
President Bush prefaced his announcement with NASA’s achievements of having 
“expanded human knowledge, [having] revolutionized our understanding of the universe, 
and [producing] technological advances that have benefited all of humanity.”101 The lofty 
language returned to support George W. Bush’s vision of returning to the moon “to gain a 
new foothold” into outer space to “vastly reduce the costs of further space exploration, 
making possible even more ambitious missions.”102 The Moon returned as the focal point

of space policy. Before it was the first human on the Moon,  but the new focus was a 
permanent presence on the Moon to facilitate exploration beyond Earth’s orbit. 
The key difference between the Cold War and the post-Cold War lunar goal and 
discourse is one of method: private industry. George W. Bush’s grand plan does not call 
for a new infusion of government investment; instead “most of the funding...for new 
endeavors will come from reallocating $11 billion within the [NASA] budget.”103 
NASA’s budget line items were redistributed, not grown. The 2004 reallocation of 
NASA’s budget pales in comparison to Kennedy’s proud statement in 1962: “This year’s 
[NASA] budget is three times what it was in January 1961, and it is greater than the space 
budget of the previous eight years combined.”104  Kennedy ballooned NASA’s budget to 
reach the Moon, whereas George W. Bush reallocated the existing budget for his Moon 
goals.105 Downgrading NASA’s budget creates the space for commercial providers to 
step in. The United States could afford to pull NASA back from outer space to focus on 
cost-saving measures: there was no direct competition for space dominance, and the 
expansion of the American commercial space market can still protect American 
superiority.

Commercialization of outer space was underway and a key aspect of American 
outer space policy and the national interest by the time President Barack Obama took 
office in 2009. George W. Bush justified the de-prioritization of NASA, the 
decommissioning of the shuttle program, and the focus on cost-saving measures by citing 
the benefit of space exploration to all of humanity. The Obama administration followed 
suit. The 2010 National & Commercial Space Programs law reconfirmed the federal 
government’s commitment to the progenitor 1998 law. The law restated the necessity of 
peaceful intent in space and the commercial development of space while maintaining the 
tie with the national interest.106 Obama followed the framework established by George 
W. Bush. The 2010 National Space Policy document began with, “The utilization of 
space has created new markets…” which benefit humanity in a number of ways from 
weather monitoring to facilitating global communication. Obama’s stance is clear:  
The United States hereby renews its pledge of cooperation in the belief that with 
strengthened international collaboration and reinvigorated U.S. leadership, all 
nations and peoples - space-faring and space-benefiting - will find their horizons 
broadened, their knowledge enhanced, and their lives greatly improved.107 
 
Obama’s outer space policy has echoes of his Cold War predecessors, particularly 
Kennedy. Obama championed international cooperation in outer space to benefit all of 
humanity, but through American leadership. Interestingly, the policy makes note of both 
space-faring and non-space-faring nations by including “space-benefiting” peoples.

However, Obama followed the framework established by his more immediate 
predecessors (George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush in particular) with the second 
principle of the national security policy, namely stating: 
 A robust and competitive space sector is vital to continued progress in space. The 
United States is committed to encouraging and facilitating the growth of a U.S. 
commercial space sector that supports U.S. need, is globally competitive, and 
advances U.S. leadership in the generation of new markets and innovation-driven 
entrepreneurship.108 
 
Under the 2010 policy, outer space remained in the American national interest. The 
American commercial space sector is vital to expansion of the American presence in 
outer space and to the defense of American leadership in outer space, to the American 
outer space hegemony. 
The nearly two and a half decades of direct commercialization resulted in the 
current policies of the 45th U.S. Presidential Administration. The first space directive re-
oriented American policy towards the Moon to “lead an innovative and sustainable 
program of exploration with commercial and international partners to enable human 
expansion…”109 Soon after, the administration signed an order to privatize the 
International Space Station after 2014, calling for NASA to be merely a customer of the 
privately-operated station. The long-stated goal of privatization of earth’s orbit has been 
achieved.

Commercializing earth’s orbit and permitting (and actively supporting) private 
launches into outer space have been a part of U.S. outer space policy since the end of the 
Cold War. The Reagan and subsequent administration’s active support for privatization is 
a significant shift from previous administration’s motivations that were more in line with 
the common heritage principles of peaceful scientific discovery and benefits for 
humankind. The post-Reagan shift seems more in line with a society Eisenhower warned 
against in his farewell address. Outer space policy in the US overwhelmingly favors 
corporate development, referring to the commercial benefit and future industrial growth. 
But, there is a common thread through each administration, that of American leadership 
and dominance. Whether cloaked in the language of commercialization, common 
heritage, or both, the common line is the United States must lead at all costs. The 
American hegemony must be protected. But, that is not to discount the importance of the 
rhetorical shift to privatization.  
During his farewell address, Eisenhower warned the growing military-industrial 
complex threatens the American ethos, defined by him as the desire “to enhance liberty, 
dignity and integrity among people and among nations.”110 Global peace and prosperity 
can only be achieved through American leadership, and that cause is threatened by the 
intimate relationship between private actors and military. Kennedy, in his 1961 address to 
Congress, advocated “for a great new American enterprise - time for this nation to take a 
clear leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our

future on earth.”111 The US lagged behind the Soviets in the space race of 1961 and 
Kennedy was determined to catch up. The focus is on the improvement and the progress 
of the United States, not the global community. Kennedy directly invoked the conquering 
empire during his moon speech arguing “this country...was not built by those who 
waited...this country was conquered by those who moved forward and so will space. 
Outer space will be developed as the American west was developed.”112 And, Kennedy 
continued, “whether [space] will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only 
if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this 
new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war.”113 The irony is lost 
on Kennedy as the United States waged wars and skirmishes across the globe, Vietnam 
an example of many other cases. The U.S. will maintain a peace, after the national 
objectives are met. 
Reagan continued with the need for continued American leadership, with fervor. 
In his 1984 address to Congress, Reagan spoke of the “time for America to take 
freedom’s next step” and to “be proud to say: We are first, we are the best; and we are so 
because we’re free.”114 Such blatant nationalist rhetoric is used to ferment political 
support yes. But, Reagan used this speech to set the goal of developing “America's next

frontier” by stoking “America’s pioneer spirit.”115 Reagan continued Kennedy’s call to 
conquer this next ocean. The call to explore the “frontier” will be announced by W. Bush 
with allusions to Lewis & Clark. And, Obama will add his take by addressing American 
productivity and adventure to his call for space exploration.  
There is an additional dimension in the presidential speeches that must be 
addressed: the colonial undertone of space conquest. The first President Bush compared 
space exploration to the Oregon Trail and the explorer Columbus, speaking grandly that 
“history proves that [Americans] have never lost by pressing the limits of our 
frontiers.”116 His son will connect the waves of adventurers, prospectors, and settlers that 
conquered the American west to astronauts and future space prospectors. Is outer space 
exploration going to start a new period of American Manifest Destiny? Language from 
the common heritage principles was laced through the early presidential outer space 
speeches and pieces of federal legislation. The shift away from common heritage to the 
language of cost-saving and commercialization began during the Reagan era (in the 
presidential rhetoric). The language of commercialization carried through the subsequent 
administrations, with the occasional nod to specific common heritage ideals. Yet, the 
shared theme across the decades is the need to advance the United States to the front and 
maintain the dominant position. The effort of continued dominance through further space 
exploration is cloaked by positive language of the settlement of the American west.

However, the shift to the language of privatization is key and can provide insight into

outer space paradigm. Further, the shift in the presidential rhetoric foreshadows the 
legislative shift. The new dominance of the privatization language

CHAPTER 3 
INTERNATIONAL POWER PLAY OR CAPITAL EXPANSION 
 
 The data has shown a shift in the U.S. presidential rhetoric at the close of the Cold 
War and how it is reflected in U.S. outer space legislation. But, despite the shift, the true 
goals have remained the same: maintaining and protecting U.S. hegemonic control in 
outer space.118  Prior to the 1980s, the American national aim in outer space was to 
challenge the Soviet Union's lead in the space race. Once American leadership was 
achieved, the goal was to protect it. The end of the Cold War brought the shift. The 
question that is chapter tries to answer is why the US government decided to privatize its 
successful outer space endeavor without endangering its hegemonic position.119 The 
realist help answer the former while the Marxist provide new insight into the dynamics of 
the latter.  
Two theoretical schools of thought provide insight into this question: realism and 
Marxism. Each seeks to explain why the American government privatized outer space 
exploration by examining the impact of the international system and the role of various 
domestic and international actors in impacting a state’s. Realist scholars focus on 
questions of balance of power politics highlighting how the shift from a bipolar world to 
                                               
118 The true goals as determined by the consistent message across the presidential 
speeches. Each outer space speech and policy document (from Eisenhower through 
today) emphasizes the need to ensure American leadership in outer space. 
119 In this context, NASA was successful in terms of mission success. Through NASA, 
the United States kept pace with the Soviet Union in satellite then crewed missions. 
NASA “won” by successfully landing the first humans on the Moon in 1969. 
 
 
49 
 
an unipolar world can explain the U.S. decision to privatize outer space exploration. 
Kenneth Waltz considers the impact of domestic practices and behaviors of international 
neighbors in foreign policy decisions, arguing that “each state arrives at policies and 
decides upon actions according to its own internal processes, but its decisions are shaped 
by the very presence of other states as well as by interactions with them.”120 Realists 
maintain that state actors are rational agents acting within an anarchic international 
system. They calibrate their domestic priorities or decisions in function of the 
international power structure. Thus in attempting to explain state actions with regards to 
space politics, realists would argue that the U.S. is acting to defend its own hegemonic 
status and the decision to privatize its space exploration is a function of how it 
rationalizes its ability to do so without endangering its hegemonic power globally.  
Marxism, on there other hand, is far more interested in how the capitalist structure 
impacts state and international relations. Marxist’s argue that state behavior is purposeful, 
adding that economic interests, rather than assumed natural prerogatives of budget 
deficits, explain state decision.  In this regard the theory focuses on the rise of the 
neoliberal approach, to the point of influencing (capturing) state policy and decision. 
 
Balance of Power Politics 
Realism views the international system as an anarchic one composed of states, 
acting in their own self-interest. Powerful states will act “internationally only when the

Politics, (New York: Routledge, 2008), 21.

spirit moves it.”121 Meaning, a dominate state such as the United States will act 
internationally (such as signing onto the outer space treaties) if the act serves the national 
interest. A powerful state, under the anarchic system, cannot be compelled to act in the 
name of a common good, such as the common heritage, if it is not in its interests to do so.  
This is because it fears that other countries will not adhere to such a principle. Waltz 
argues “American [foreign] policy was generated not by external security interests, but 
by internal political pressure and national ambition.”122 In short, the American 
government acts rationally to meet the national interest.  
During the Cold War, the American national interest was to challenge the Soviet 
Union. In the realm of outer space, the challenge to the Soviets took the form of the space 
race. The Soviet Union led the beginning of the space race with the U.S. playing catch up 
until the 1969 Moon landing. American responses to outer space exploration were driven 
by Soviet advances. Such a tit-for-tat approach to policy is what creates a “solid bipolar 
stance.”123 Under the realist view, this brings a certain level of stability in geopolitics. 
The two superpowers will keep up with each other, fearing “that a downward slide or a 
sudden technological breakthrough by one great state or the other would decisively alter 
the balance between them.”124 The motivation to balance the other superpower translates

into joining international regimes. U.S. President Johnson’s statement during the signing 
ceremony of the initial Outer Space Treaty is an example of such an endeavor, stating his 
hope that this treaty system will contain war prevent its spread to the solar system.125 
Balance can come from superpowers meeting technological improvements and willingly 
constraining sovereignty; as both superpowers did with the international outer space 
treaty system. 
American presidential rhetoric during the space race adopted the moral argument, 
tying American space leadership and advancement to the betterment of humanity – 
focused on the word ""freedom."" The American moral stance aligned with elements of the 
common heritage principles enshrined in the outer space treaties: outer space exploration 
for the betterment of humanity. Each Cold War president looked at since 1958 referenced 
growth for humanity through American leadership. The treaties were a piece of the 
bipolar balance of power, but as a function of American leadership. Promoting and 
defending American leadership in outer space was and remains the primary goal of U.S. 
outer space policy.  
Following the privatization shift and the end of the Cold War, the American 
hegemon drastically changed tactics. Waltz points out that “since the end of the Cold 
War, the United States has been alone in the world; no state or combination of states

provides an effective counterweight.”126 Without the counter weight of the Soviet Union 
and the pressure of the Third World, the US practiced its own form of hegemonic control. 
There was no longer a need to play the balance of power game. Without a counter weight, 
the United States was free to act as it desired. In an anarchic system “without central 
governance, the influence of the units of greater capability is disproportionately large 
because there are no effective laws and institutions to direct and constrain them.”127 The 
United States was free to interpret the treaties as it saw fit, choosing which parts applied 
and which parts did not. The stated desire to privatize the International Space Station by 
the current American administration is one example of that. The United States is 
relatively independent of other powers and states, due it its political and economic 
supremacy.128 The realist explanation for the choice of privatization and the switch away 
from the moral argument lies in the global shift from a bipolar world to a unipolar world.  
The international structure changed practically overnight when the Berlin Wall 
fell and the Soviet Union collapsed, “upon the demise of the Soviet Union, the 
international-political system became unipolar.”129 The United States was the sole 
remaining superpower, with no state providing an effective counter balance. Through the 
realist lens, a unipolar international system is inherently unstable, arguing “international

politics abhors unbalanced power…[so] some states [will] try to increase their own 
strength or they ally with others to bring the international distribution of power into 
balance.’130 In the realm of outer space this can be seen with the rise of both the Indian 
and Chinese space programs, attempting to build a challenge to the dominance of the 
American space program and activities. However, Waltz points out that “American 
leaders seem to believe that America's preeminent position will last indefinitely. The 
United States would remain the dominant power without rivals rising to challenge it - a 
position without precedence in modern history.”131 American confidence in its 
preeminent position in outer space partially explains the decision to privatize access to it. 
Without a competitor for dominance, the United States could afford to limit and withdraw 
government support and create space for private development, it could afford to take a 
wild move. In a bipolar system the constant presence of a threat leads to a consistent 
policy path, while an “absence of threat permits policy to become capricious...a country’s 
policy becomes sporadic and self-willed.”132 To the remaining superpower (to the 
hegemon), international law holds limited enforcement, allowing for a more flexible (or 
convenient) interpretation of the existing treaties.  Realism, however does not examine 
motivations beyond traditional notions of security such as military strength nor term 
definitions or domestic context (beyond its relation to foreign policy). Examining state

behavior in the anarchic system through the lens of rational behavior does not allow for 
examination of other domestic and international structures such as dominate economic 
policy within the U.S. Congress. 
Space Marxism 
Marxists argue behavior on the international level is not a natural process, instead 
it is a series of choices and actions. It is above all a function of the development in the 
capitalist system.  According to Marxists the privatization of American outer space is a 
result of neoliberalism which began to dominate the American zeitgeist in the 1980s. 
Neoliberalism is defined by David Harvey as:  
a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can 
best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills 
within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, 
free markets, and free trade.133 
 
The institution of neoliberalism was elevated to the level of ‘common sense’ (on par with 
the promotion and protection of freedom) following the series of crises within capitalism 
through the 1960s and 1970s. Harvey utilizes ‘common sense’ through the Gramscian 
definition meaning ‘sense held in common.”134 This is significant particularly in the 
relationship with the word freedom. Moreover Harvey argues that “the word ‘freedom’ 
resonates so widely within the common-sense understanding of Americans that it 
becomes a ‘button that elites can press to open the door to the masses’ to justify almost

anything.”135 Marxism allows for the examination of American outer space policy by 
looking at how its neo-liberal expansion is tied to class benefit interests. It highlights how 
neoliberalization is “…as a political project to re-establish the conditions for capital 
accumulation and to restore the power of economic elites.”136  
Marxism critiques, which is the strength and the unique feature the theory brings 
to the conversation of American outer space privatization. Realism provides an 
explanation based on international behavior in relation to power dynamics, under an 
anarchic international system. An actor’s (a state) behaves rationally when it pursues its 
own self-interest which is the natural result of the anarchic system. The United States 
privatized its outer space efforts simply because it could following the loss of a geo-
political rival (the Soviet Union).  
Prior to the privatization switch in the outer space rhetoric, “freedom” and the 
“betterment of humanity” were spread across the presidential speeches and congressional 
legislation. The language of “freedom” (protecting and promoting it and the critical 
nature of it) remained in the outer space rhetoric following the privatization shift, this 
time accompanying the language of deregulation and cost-cutting. Harvey argues, 
“common sense can...be profoundly misleading, obfuscating or disguising real problems 
under cultural prejudice. Cultural and traditional values can be mobilized to mask other

realities.”137 Joining ‘deregulation’ with ‘freedom’ masks the economic impact and 
consequences of such an act. 
 By the time privatization appears in the NASA authorization bills of the early and 
mid 1990s, “neoliberalism has, in short, become hegemonic as a mode of discourse.”138 
Meaning, the motivations and the language of neoliberalism dominate. This is seen in the 
U.S. Congress declaring free-market principles as the only way to develop low-Earth 
orbit. 
Marxism would thus explain the privatization switch in the outer space rhetoric as 
one piece of the larger retraction of the American state through the 1980s. The Volcker 
Shock in 1979 kicked off the neoliberal process by drastically changing U.S. monetary 
policy and leading the charge in the “unfolding of government policies in many other 
arenas.”139 Reagan’s 1980 election added political weight to this new movement with a 
particular focus on “deregulation, tax cuts, budget cuts, and attacks on trade unions and 
professional power.”140 Harvey continues that “it took less than six months in 1983 to 
reverse nearly 40 percent of the decisions made during the 1970s that had been, in the 
view of business, too favourable to labour. Reagan constructed all regulation (except for 
labour) as bad.”141 Outer space exploration was merely the next frontier of deregulation

and the retraction of the state, to create room for newly freed commercial enterprise. 
Deregulation and free enterprise became common sense.  
Such a transformation of social and economic behavior is neither an accident nor 
a natural outcome. Harvey argues: 
For any way of thought to become dominant, a conceptual apparatus has to be 
advanced that appeals to our intuitions and instincts, to our values and our desires, 
as well as to the possibilities inherent in the social world we inhabit. If successful, 
this conceptual apparatus becomes so embedded in common sense as to be taken 
for granted and not open to question.142 
 
Neoliberalism as an institution and theoretical approach became the dominant form of 
thought through joining with existing approaches, namely the promotion and protection 
of the ambiguous “freedom.” Freedom, as an abstract and ever-changing  concept is a 
long piece of “U.S. tradition” that aligned closely with founding scholars of 
neoliberalism: “the founding figures of neoliberal thought took political ideals of human 
dignity and individual freedom as fundamental…”143 Beginning with Reagan and 
continuing through each subsequent presidential administration, the exploration of outer 
space through commercial partners is tied directly the promotion of freedom.  
Marxist theory offers a new way to understand the concept of conquest of the 
American “frontier” that is referenced across the outer space rhetoric. Kennedy and 
George W. Bush cite the Lewis and Clark expedition in reference to grand plans for outer 
space exploration. Anna Tsing defines the frontier as “an edge of space and time: a zone 
                                               
142 Harvey, A Brief History, 5. 
143 Harvey, A Brief History, 5. 
 
 
58 
 
of not yet - not yet mapped, not yet regulated...Frontiers aren’t just discovered at the 
edge; they are projects in the making of geographical and temporal experience.”144 Outer 
space is the frontier. 
Tsing’s description of the frontier is significant to the neoliberal expansion into 
outer space in two ways. First, frontiers are crafted and created, a result of a deliberate 
decision by the actors involved (namely, the state). Declaring outer space as a “frontier” 
comes from a purposeful process of deregulation with the goal to enclose the ‘common’ 
land. Outer space is not a part of the global commons, nor is its potential wealth. And 
second, the allure of claiming a piece of the frontier is a powerful motivator, especially 
under the “freedom” of private exploitation. The frontier becomes a zone, unregulated, 
shifting between “...public and private ownership.”145 Outer space, under the Outer Space 
treaties, cannot be claimed as sovereign territory by any one state, but the interpretation is 
debated on private property claims. 
Private property is key to market development. From the neoliberal viewpoint, 
“the absence of clear private property rights...is seen as one of the greatest of all 
institutional barriers to economic development and to the improvement of human 
welfare.”146 Following the res nullius interpretation of the common heritage principles 
(specifically regarding the sovereignty ban) allows the United States to establish a legal 
(American) pathway for its corporate actors to extract space resources and claim them as

their own - the 2015 SPACE Act. The United States argues such a maneuver does not 
extend state sovereignty, merely that it is creating a “free” market for its own companies 
to exploit unclaimed territory (a frontier). 
The United States is extending, at a minimum, its sphere of influence. American 
actors are legally authorized (under American law) to extract any outer space resource 
they can obtain. The American government has declared through national space security 
policies that the American government will act to defend its interests and citizens (aka 
commercial actors) in outer space. The American state is acting to protect private 
property claims, to keep outer space deregulated, and to extend “free” market principles 
into low-earth orbit. The American state is making deliberate choices to further neoliberal 
practices. 
Deregulated markets become the focus, after all “the assumption that individual 
freedoms are guaranteed by freedom of the market and of trade is a cardinal feature of 
neoliberal thinking, and it has long dominated the US stance towards the rest of the 
world.”147 And, should a market not exist, then it must be created by the state.148 Post-
1990, the American government is actively seeking to create a market in outer space. 
This is seen through the legislative requirement that the presidency consults the 
commercial outer space industry on favorable regulation and the desire to turn the 
International Space station over to commercial enterprises - under the principles of a 
‘free’ market.

A Marxist examination of outer space privatization counters the realist claim of a 
natural, rational approach to international power politics. International action is instead a 
series of decisions made by individuals, communities, and organizations, which in turn 
influence the international system. Marxism focus on the role of neoliberal economics in 
the foreign policy of the United States. David Harvey traces the rise of neoliberalism 
through the crisis of capital, showing how deregulation and market expansion subsumed 
the language of freedom. Anna Tsing argues how the declaration of a frontier plays into 
capital expansion. The delineation of private property becomes key.  
Private property is at the heart of the tension in the international outer space 
treaties and the common heritage principles. The United States, as a signatory to four of 
the five treaties and reiterated through Congressional legislation, has agreed to the ban on 
unilateral sovereignty claims. However, allowing private entities to extract resources, 
claim them, and profit off of them raises questions of de facto sovereignty in light of 
declared American protection of its citizens (including its corporations). The realist 
theoretical approach can provide insight into surface reasons of why the American state 
signed and ratified the first four outer space treaties, cooperated with and depended on a 
former rival (Russia) in outer space exploration following the Cold War, and even why 
American private enterprises are allowed to launch their own equipment. But, the 
answers are surface and unsatisfying. Marxism fills the gap left by realism. Marxism 
shows how the rise of neoliberalism directly influenced American domestic and foreign 
policy. The privatization shift in American outer space exploration was not a simple 
regulatory change to allow commercial actors to launch into outer space. The shift was a 
 
 
61 
 
retreat of the state from the realm of outer space. It was the near complete deregulation of 
outer space in the specific interest of market expansion. The common territory of outer 
space was made open for private claim by American actors; the American state had 
become a neoliberal state. The American state has opened outer space to capitalist 
conquest (at the expense of human ownership) through privatization outer space 
exploration.

CHAPTER 4 
CONCLUSION: PRIVATIZATION IS A TOOL 
 
The story of American outer space exploration begins with the Cold War and runs 
through the rise of the neoliberal practice of capitalism. The rhetoric of privatization 
emerged in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan, as merely the next step in the retraction of 
the American state in favor of deregulation and corporate expansion. Beginning in 1990, 
US Congressional legislation caught up with the presidential rhetoric, creating the 
necessary legal pathway for direct commercial entry into outer space. Subsequent NASA 
Authorization acts in addition to various acts such as the National Space Council Act of 
1990, and the SPACE Act of 2015 authorized private companies to launch their own 
equipment into outer space, required the federal executive to seek out commercial 
opportunities, and grants the legal ability to individual American citizens (including 
corporations) to extract thus own any resource in outer space.  
The story is incomplete without considering the international treaty system and 
the recent historical context. American efforts in outer space, reflected through the 
presidential rhetoric and congressional legislation, were focused on extending and 
protecting American hegemonic presence in outer space. Prior to the privatization shift in 
the outer space rhetoric (that occurs in the 1980s), the presidential rhetoric and related 
legislation spoke of scientific advancement and peaceful exploration for the betterment of 
all humanity, through the leadership of “free men” (the United States). This sentiment is 
more in line with the ethos of the five international outer space tries (including the failed 
 
 
63 
 
Moon treaty): the common heritage principles of humankind. The key aspects of the 
common heritage principles (as it relates to outer space law and discussed in the treaties) 
are: a ban on unilateral sovereignty claims, peaceful (demilitarized) exploration of outer 
space, and redistribution of the economic and scientific benefit. In short, the whole of the 
planet must benefit. The common heritage principles were initially proposed and long 
supported by member states of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). NAM’s strong 
support for the common heritage principles was a response to the both Cold War conflict 
and political decolonization. NAM worked to represent and protect the interests of the 
Third World (most of which were recently independent). Within the bipolar balance of 
power struggles of the Cold War, NAM was a third voice. The common heritage 
principles (which were also applied to the deep see and Antarctica, in their own forms) 
are part of an effort to constrain the two warring super powers (demilitarization) and 
protect out of reach resources for future generations (an attempt to slow the development 
gap).  
Reagan’s introduction of commercialization into the outer space rhetoric began 
the movement further away from the common heritage principles in the treaty. The new 
paradigm focused on cost cutting, budget efficiency, deregulation, and the expansion of 
“free” markets (at the expense of discussing scientific, peaceful exploration for the 
betterment of humanity). By 1990, Congress declared that free market capitalism was the 
only route to successfully develop outer space. Reagan and his successors’ language 
differed from that of their predecessors. Eisenhower and Kennedy established a 
framework dedicated to American leadership as the beacon of “free men.” Eisenhower 
 
 
64 
 
began with a warning of threats to such moral leadership while Kennedy presented a 
grand vision of propelling American leadership literally to the moon. Johnson presented a 
hope that the new international outer space treaties would contain the ravages of war to 
the planet, keeping outer space a realm of peaceful exploration, stating his hope that 
astronauts and cosmonauts would interact peacefully on missions of scientific discovery. 
Reagan introduced privatization and the need for commercial development while 
highlighting the American space “victories” particularly focusing on being the first and 
only state to reach the moon. George H.W. Bush continued to emphasize this exception 
noting the only flag on the surface is the American flag. His son, George W. Bush, and 
Obama continued the privatization rhetoric. Both of the Bush’s followed a precedent 
established by previous presidents (such as Kennedy) in connecting outer space 
exploration to the colonization of the American west. Obama added legislative and policy 
strength to that endeavor by signing the SPACE Act of 2015 and releasing the 2010 
National Outer Space Policy Security document. The 2010 policy document recommitted 
outer space to the national security of the US (which includes commercializing outer 
space through expanding the “free” market into orbit and beyond). The policy further 
stipulated that the American government will defend its national security interests in 
outer space including its own citizens and actors working to develop it (private 
companies).  This steady progress of commercialization has led to the current 
administration announcement to sell the International Space Station to private operators. 
Nearly thirty years after Reagan introduced privatization into the outer space rhetoric, the 
 
 
65 
 
goal is well on its way to completion: low earth orbit is being developed under free 
market principles. 
The Marxist theoretical approach to international relations provided a more 
complete understanding of the causes of privatization of American outer space 
exploration. Realist approaches explain the motivations only within the context of rigidly 
defined national security interests, the natural result of states operating in an anarchic 
international system. The United States chose to privatize its successful outer space 
endeavors because it no longer faced a geo-political rival for dominance; the Cold War 
ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The ratification of the outer space treaties 
was part of a balancing act with the Soviet Union while peddling influence with the Non-
Aligned Movement. However, approaching privatization of outer space exploration as a 
simple matter of national security misses significant shifts in American foreign policy 
and domestic rhetoric. For example, Reagan and his presidential predecessors added 
“free” and “open” markets (re: deregulation) to the definition of American freedom. The 
national security definition has been expanded to include liberal market extension and 
protection. This contrasts with the realist approach which presents a narrow definition of 
national security, focusing on hard power definitions: such as military and political 
strength.  
Marxism, in the context of American outer space exploration, critiques the rise 
and dominance of neoliberal principles within the United States. Neoliberal thought 
gained influence during the crisis of capitalism during the 1960s and 1970s (inflation, 
rising unemployment, OPEC embargo, etc..) and found political support in the Reagan 
 
 
66 
 
administration. Reagan began and his predecessor’s continued deregulation of the 
American economy, opening of free trade routes, limits on government spending, and the 
promotion of neoliberal market practices. Since the beginning of the neoliberal practice, 
the American federal government has reduced the NASA budget, shuttered the shuttle 
program, allowed commercial actors to directly launch into outer space, and transferred 
government obligations (such as the ISS resupply missions) to commercial actors. 
Further, American market practices have been extended beyond Earth’s orbit with the 
SPACE Act of 2015. Neoliberal proponents seek to expand markets into new territory, 
creating new ones if necessary (under the Marxist interpretation). Private property, thus 
the enclosure of common land, is necessary for market expansion. The territory in 
question has to be opened to private enclosure. Anna Tsing argues that is what a frontier 
is: a label applied to a time and a place, that exists beyond regulation, though it is created 
by governments. Under treaty, outer space is available to all humanity but free from 
unilateral sovereignty claims. The legal interpretation of the ban on sovereignty claims is 
in dispute with one side arguing the ban prevents any piece of outer space from being 
claimed. The United States supports the interpretation that resources removed from a 
celestial body can be claimed as private. This interpretation is codified into US law. The 
American government has provided a domestic legal pathway for its citizens to claims 
resources in outer space. The American government has stated and codified into law that 
it will defend its interests and those of its own actors in outer space and defend against 
external interference. The American government is creating the structures of a market in 
outer space, stating it will defend it while supporting American commercial interests in 
 
 
67 
 
reaching outer space.149 American control and influence is established in low-earth orbit 
with plans to extend to the moon and beyond (the laws are falling into place). 
Privatization of American outer space exploration is a tool, a function, of 
expanding and protecting American hegemonic influence in orbit and beyond. The 
presidential and legislative rhetoric reveals a multi-decade support for American 
leadership in outer space, focus around the idea of “freedom.” The post-privatization shift 
rhetoric extends the definition of freedom to directly include “free” and open markets 
while maintaining the need for American leadership.

and BRF rockets.

Title of Study: THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND ITS ROLE IN THE 
FUTURE OF SPACE EXPLORATION 
 
Major Field: APPLIED EDUCATIONAL STUDIES 
 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to: (1) emphasize and evaluate the past and 
present scientific and societal contributions the International Space Station (ISS) has 
provided the United States, (2) determine support for NASA and their efforts to stimulate 
a new interest for future lunar, planetary and deep space exploration, and (3) decide if the 
continued benefits of U.S. space exploration, including new discoveries and successful 
research findings, justify the associated financial costs. The ISS plays an important role 
in human exploration in space and has made significant contributions to the scientific 
community through research. By taking an in depth look at how the ISS was used in the 
past, present, and is intended to be used in the future we determine how it has benefited 
and will continue to benefit the aerospace industry as well as the global population.  This 
will also allow us to identify challenges faced and come up with possible solutions.  
Additionally, this study will take a look at the funding opportunities and how they can be 
addressed.  This study will focus on the contributions the ISS has provided in the past, the 
partnerships of countries and opportunities for cooperation it offers, and what it can offer 
to the future of space exploration and research initiatives, by evaluating the influence and 
achievements and examining the effects the ISS has had on the aerospace industry, 
scientific community, and the population of the world.

CHAPTER I 
 
INTRODUCTION 
In the beginning, the International Space Station (ISS) was intended to be used for 
conducting a broad range of NASA-funded experiments in numerous disciplines.  These 
disciplines included: life sciences, combustion science, fluid physics, materials science, 
and technology demonstration.  The ISS is the most complex international scientific and 
engineering project in the history of mankind and the largest structure to have ever been 
put into space.  In 2005, Congress designated the ISS as a national laboratory and asked 
NASA to increase station research utilization by including other federal entities and the 
private sector.  This increase in utilization could be accomplished through partnerships, 
cost sharing, and other arrangements that would supplement NASA funding of ISS 
research, as well as NASA entering into a contract with a nongovernmental agency to 
operate the ISS national laboratory, subject to all applicable federal laws and regulations 
(GAO, 2009).   
The ISS was built by five different space agencies; representing 15 countries, all 
of who continue to operate it today.  In the past, research was conducted on the effects of 
microgravity, as well as other factors that affect everyday lives.  In fact, there have been 
significant research accomplishments achieved by astronauts and scientists on board the 
ISS, including: (1) bone loss minimization, (2) virulence of bacteria in space, (3) 
activities that inspire students about the values of STEM fields, (4) studies of dark matter 
in the universe, (5) manipulation of nanoparticles, and (6) improvements in robotics 
2 
 
(Robinson, 2013).  From 2001-2010, more than 400 experiments had been 
conducted on the ISS.  On a daily basis, ISS astronauts conduct science across a wide 
variety of fields, including human life sciences, biological science, human physiology, 
physical and materials science, and Earth and space science (NASA, 2011).     
Statement of the Problem 
There are many challenges affecting the ISS and its continued viability.  The first 
challenge is the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011 which resulted in reduced launch 
capabilities and the question of when another United States (U.S.) space vehicle, capable 
of reaching the ISS, will be available after the shuttle’s retirement.  Another challenge is 
the high costs for launches and developing research hardware and a lack of dedicated 
funding streams for ISS research (GAO, 2009).  Additionally, the ISS crew will be fixed 
in size and the time available for that crew to do research will be limited due to other 
requirements.  The maintenance and cost as well as how to fund this global research 
facility will perhaps remain the greatest challenges.   
With the ISS now fully assembled, astronauts are spending additional time on 
science.  The U.S. and its partners have now entered a period of full exploitation of the 
ISS.  However, the year of retirement for the ISS, 2024, is fast approaching and solutions 
need to be developed to keep this international asset operable.  And yet the challenges the 
ISS faces are so significant that the future use of the ISS remains an uncertainty.   
Unless the scheduled 2024 retirement date for the ISS is extended at the federal 
level, the scientific community will no longer consider the space station as a platform for 
fundamental research.  In order for successful research to be completed, sufficient time is 
required to develop and conduct experiments.  NASA has a vision for the ISS and the 
3 
 
role it will play in the future of space exploration; however, if an extension to the 
retirement date is not executed, NASA will have limited time to execute their robust 
research program before the ISS is deorbited (NASA, 2011).  Even with the challenges 
facing the ISS, it offers the potential as a unique testing facility for new technologies and 
applications, for scientific breakthroughs, and a platform for increased international 
collaboration in research.  As previously mentioned, a viable user base will not develop 
without sufficient launch opportunities, sufficient crew time to conduct research, and 
longevity of the ISS (GAO, 2009).   
Lastly, the Review of Human Space Flight Plans Committee has proposed 
extension of the ISS until 2024 in three of its possible five scenarios and Congress has 
instructed NASA to take steps to ensure that it remains capable of being a viable and 
productive facility, but as of yet there is still not a commitment to continue operations 
(Foust, 2017).  NASA has limited experience managing the type of diverse scientific 
research and technology demonstration portfolio that the ISS could eventually represent; 
therefore, it may become necessary for NASA to solicit assistance from an outside 
contractor or nonprofit organization to oversee the operations of this orbiting laboratory 
(GAO, 2009).  Regardless, all viable opportunities of extending the ISS retirement date 
and additional funding initiatives for the ISS will need to be investigated to ensure that 
the 2024 retirement date does not bring an end to space exploration and the valuable 
research performed aboard the ISS.    
Purpose of the Study 
 The purpose of this study was to: (1) emphasize and evaluate the past and present 
scientific and societal contributions the ISS has provided the United States, (2) determine 
4 
 
support for NASA and their efforts to stimulate a new interest for future lunar, planetary 
and deep space exploration, and (3) decide if the continued benefits of U.S. space 
exploration, including new discoveries and successful research findings, justify the 
associated financial costs. 
Research Questions 
According to NASA (2011), the ISS has conducted over 400 experiments and the 
most important knowledge gained from the ISS may still be unknown as amazing 
discoveries wait in the future.  Several recent patents and partnerships have already 
demonstrated Earth benefits of the public’s investment in ISS research (NASA, 2011).  
The following research questions have been developed to direct this quantitative study 
regarding the ISS:   
RQ1: Do Americans fear that the U.S. will lose its dominance in space exploration and 
research to other countries that have further outlined robust plans for lunar and 
other space exploration?   
RQ2: Do Americans believe that the U.S. space program, including the International 
Space Station, benefits the nation’s economy by inspiring young people to 
consider an education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics 
(STEM) fields?   
RQ3: Do Americans support increasing NASA’s budget?   
RQ4: Do Americans believe the benefits of space exploration and associated research 
outweigh the risks of human space flight?   
RQ5: Do Americans believe that the benefits of space exploration justify the financial 
costs?  
5 
 
RQ6: Do Americans believe that additional funding for the ISS will not result in  
increased technological advances, endless research opportunities, and the  
continued growth of U.S. space exploration; therefore, NASA should not extend  
the ISS expectancy of use past the year 2024? 
In addition, for comparative purposes, the researcher included participant data 
from a series of four research polls and focus groups conducted between 2005 and 2008 
by The Gallup Organization.  This series of studies, commissioned by The Space 
Foundation, were conducted to determine the magnitude of advocacy and public outlook 
towards America’s space program, including the International Space Station.  The sample 
population for this 2005-2008 study encompassed approximately 1,000 U.S. adult men 
and women aged 18 years and older.  The survey questions used in the 2005-2008 studies 
included:  
1. Do Americans believe that the space program benefits the nation’s economy by 
inspiring young people to consider an education in science, technology, math or 
engineering fields?   
2. Are Americans supportive of a new plan for space exploration?   
3. Do you think the space program has brought enough benefits to this country to 
justify its costs, or don’t you think so?   
4. Do you think spending on the U.S. space program should be increased, kept at the 
present level, reduced, or ended altogether?   
The research data analyzed from this study will be compared to the data that was 
collected over a decade ago by the Gallup Organization.  By comparing the two sets of 
data, the researcher can determine if the perceptions of U.S. adults regarding the U.S. 
6 
 
space program, the significance of the ISS, and continued funding for space exploration 
has changed during the past ten to thirteen years.   
Significance of the Study 
Through the ISS program, the world has come together in a common goal for 
space exploration.  Analyzing the past and present use of the ISS and the experiments 
conducted and how they benefit planet Earth and the global society will also provide 
insight into the future possibilities of the ISS.  
Assumptions and Limitations 
 For the purpose of this study, the following assumptions and limitations were 
identified: 
• It is assumed by the researcher that the sample population selected will have 
personal knowledge of the ISS and its objectives. The sample population are 
adults who live in the U.S. and the researcher assumed they have access to 
television, internet, or other means of information on past and present U.S, space 
exploration projects.   
• It is assumed that the sample population will answer these questions honestly and 
to the best of their knowledge. 
• Another assumption is that the sample population will be a representative sample 
of the American people interested in U.S. space exploration. 
• This study will be limited based on the voluntary participation of U.S. adults 
asked to participate in this study.

CHAPTER II 
 
REVIEW OF LITERATURE 
This chapter provides an overview of the existing body of literature as it relates 
to: development of the International Space Station; research and experiments conducted 
onboard the ISS; social and environmental benefits; observation and remote sensing 
opportunities; commercial/private industry partnerships, and the Gallup studies 
commissioned by The Space Foundation.  The conceptual framework for this study was 
built upon the historical and current understanding of the ISS and its numerous functions 
and benefits. 
The ISS is a part of the global multimodal transportation system.  Currently, there 
are 15 countries that fund and resupply the ISS:  U.S., Russia, Canada, Japan, Belgium, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
and the United Kingdom.  Collectively, the ISS brings together international flight crews, 
multiple launch vehicles, globally distributed launch operations, training, engineering and 
development facilities, communications networks, and the international scientific 
research community (NASA, 2011).  The ISS was constructed by the countries involved. 
Development of the ISS 
The ISS is an unprecedented achievement in global human endeavors regarding 
conceiving, planning, building, operating, and utilizing a research platform in space 
(NASA, 2011).  The ISS is relative to the size of a football field, including its large solar 
arrays.  It weighs approximately 860,000 pounds, not including visiting vehicle weights.  
8 
 
It has more livable room than a conventional five-bedroom house and has two 
bathrooms, a gymnasium, and a 360-degree bay window (NASA, 2017).  Through 2017, 
161 spacewalks have been conducted in support of the ISS assembly, totaling more than 
1,015 hours. The fifteenth anniversary of the ISS was on November 2, 2015.  As of 
January 2018, the ISS has been visited by 230 individuals from 18 countries (Howell, 
2018).

Operating the ISS is more complex than other space flight endeavors because it is 
an international effort.  Each partnering country is responsible for the hardware it 
provides in support of the ISS.  NASA exercises management over the NASA Field 
Centers, establishes management policies, and analyzes all phases of the space station 
program (NASA, 2011).  Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency oversees 
Russian flight activities.  The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) provides the resources, 
9 
 
equipment, and expertise needed for the engineering and monitoring of the Mobile 
Servicing System (MSS) and also for crew training.  The MSS is made up of a 17-meter 
long robotic arm, a two-armed robotic appendage, and a moveable work platform and 
storage facility (CSA, 2018). 
 
 
Figure 2. The Canadian MSS. (Source: NASA) 
 
The European Space Agency (ESA) is exclusively responsible for two key Station 
elements: the European Columbus laboratory and the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) 
(ESA, 2017).  The ATV can carry up to seven tons of cargo including provisions, 
scientific payloads and propellant.  Once docked, the craft uses its engines to boost the 
ISS to a higher orbit counteracting the faint drag of Earth's atmosphere.  Since 2008, five 
expendable ATVs have been launched to the ISS. In 2012, the ESA stated that the ATV 
program would be terminated following the launch of the fifth ATV in July 2014 (Clark, 
2012).

Historically, the first segment of the ISS was launched in November 1998.  
However, the years leading up to the launch of that segment, a control module called 
Zarya, were quite bumpy.  In Russia, the construction of the service module fell behind 
schedule due to lack of funds; however, this allowed NASA the additional time for on-
ground testing of hardware which significantly reduced the risk of costly integration 
problems during the orbital assembly (Zak, 2018).  The Russian delay meant that the 
original launch timeframe of November 1997 would not happen for another year.   
In December of 1996, NASA initiated the development of the Interim Control 
Module (ICM) based on the propulsion module of a classified military satellite.  The 
launch of the service module was scheduled for April 1999 but would be delayed for 
several months.  In November 2000, the first resident crew of the station including U.S. 
astronaut Bill Shepard and Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev 
docked to the ISS aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft (Zak, 2017).  In December 2000, 
the first U.S. Space Shuttle docked to the station and brought the first set of solar arrays 
and radiators to the station, making it the biggest orbital structure.  On February 7, 2001, 
11 
 
the Shuttle Atlantis delivered Destiny, the U.S. laboratory module to the ISS.  However, 
financial issues threatened the ISS project and as a result of the multi-billion-dollar cost 
overruns, NASA was forced to cancel the development of the U.S. habitation module and 
reusable rescue vehicle for the ISS.   
In February 2003, the loss of Shuttle Columbia at the end of the STS-107 mission 
stalled the construction of the station and essentially grounded the U.S. manned space 
program for an indefinite period of time (Zak, 2018).  In 2005, the U.S. Congress selected 
the U.S. portion of the ISS as the nation’s newest national laboratory to maximize its use 
for other U.S. government agencies, as well as for academic and private institutions 
(CASIS, 2018).  As anticipated in 2005, the U.S. cancelled the shuttle flight that was 
scheduled to deliver a Russian science and power platform that was to serve as a 
cornerstone of a future Russian space station.

In March 2006, the global partners of the ISS project approved a new assembly 
sequence that dedicated 16 Space Shuttle flights.  At this point, without any major delays 
or accidents in the Shuttle program it was expected that the ISS would be capable of 
sustaining a six-person crew by the year 2009 (Cowing, 2006).    
Furthermore, the U.S. had to find a way to execute ISS missions without the use 
of the Space Shuttle program which was scheduled to conclude in 2011.  The retirement 
of the shuttle program resulted in a four-year gap, between the years of 2010 and 2014 in 
which the U.S. turned to Russia to accomplish their ISS missions.  During this same time 
frame, Russia had scheduled its own Soyuz flights to the ISS; aiding in the U.S missions 
would double Russian transport traffic to the ISS.  To offset Russia’s flight costs, NASA 
announced in April 2007 that it signed a contract with Russia for $719 million dollars.  
This contract was for the modification to the ISS and crew and cargo services through 
2011.  In addition, NASA purchased the capability for the Russian Docking Cargo 
Module to carry 1.4 metric tons of NASA cargo to the station in 2010 (Zak, 2018).  
Lastly, NASA purchased a flight opportunity to and from the ISS that would meet an 
obligation to its international partners.  The flight would permit an astronaut from the 
global partners to spend roughly six months on board the ISS in 2009.

In September 2008, Congress extended a waiver to the Iran, North Korea and 
Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA) that would allow NASA to purchase seats on 
Russian Soyuz spacecraft after a previous waiver was set to expire at the end of 2011 
(Zak, 2018).  The extension of this waiver provided a constant habitation of U.S. and 
European astronauts on the ISS at the same time of the projected Shuttle retirement.  
Prior to the decision being made by Congress, NASA Administrator announced to the 
media that there would be an interruption of U.S. and European manned space flight 
beginning in 2012.   
Continuing efforts to develop alternative options extending the life span of the 
ISS were being considered during this time.  Space officials were confident that the ISS 
would remain in orbit until at least 2020 even though the final decision on the expectancy 
and use was not anticipated until 2010.  But when the Obama administration published a 
proposed budget in February 2010 that decreased funding for the Constellation program, 
the ISS would require a new charter for existence.  The Constellation program was a 
14 
 
manned spaceflight program designed to complete construction of the ISS, as well as 
return to the Moon by 2020.       
Research and Experiments Conducted Onboard the ISS 
  As of 2016, there have been 376 expeditions to the space station since the launch 
of the first module, Zarya, on November 20, 1998 (NASA, 2017).  The ISS has had 221 
visitors, 100 of which have resided on the ISS.  The mission of the ISS is to conduct 
research and experiments.  There have been 54 expeditions made to the ISS that have 
conducted experiments on a wide variety of disciplines.  The research experiments 
conducted onboard the ISS are classified into six categories: biology and biotechnology, 
earth and space science, educational activities, human research, physical sciences, and 
technology.  At any given time onboard the space station, a large array of different 
scientific experiments are underway within a wide range of disciplines (NASA, 2017).   
In order to sustain life aboard the ISS, life support systems on the ISS remove 
carbon dioxide from the station atmosphere and supply oxygen.  They also prevent gases 
like ammonia and acetone, which people emit in small amounts, from building up to 
dangerous levels.  The environment of the ISS is a challenge for astronauts to both work 
and live.  Astronauts are required to change their sleeping patterns, diets, sanitation, wear 
space suits, and conduct specially designed experiments.  Crew members perform the 
daily functions of life in space using special products and procedures.

Many of the experiments conducted in space have significantly benefited society.  
Onboard the ISS exists the ideal environment to grow and study high quality protein 
crystals.  According to NASA research, there are more than 100,000 proteins in the 
human body and as many as 10 billion in nature; and every protein holds key information 
related to human health and each structure is dissimilar (NASA, 2015).  Additionally, 
they are valuable to the global environment.  The environment on board the ISS, 
specifically in space allows for optimal growth of the unique and complicated crystal 
structures of proteins leading to the development of medical treatments due to 
microgravity.  An example of a protein that was successfully crystallized in space is 
hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS), which may be directly involved in 
developing useful drugs for treating muscular dystrophy (NASA, 2015).

Basic human survival relies heavily on quick, adequate, and easily available 
medical attention when a health emergency occurs.  When medical facilities are not 
easily accessible, it can mean the difference between life and death.  On board the ISS, 
250 miles above the Earth, that specific issue was examined through the Advanced 
Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM) investigation.  In partnership with the 
World Interactive Network Focused on Critical Ultrasound (WINFO-CUS), the ADUM 
scientists took techniques originally developed for ISS astronauts and adapting them for 
use on Earth by developing protocols for performing complex procedures rapidly with 
remote expert guidance and training (NASA, 2017).  The ultrasound technology and 
remote guidance techniques developed for astronauts living on board the ISS has enabled 
medical care to be readily available in remote locations on Earth that would otherwise not 
have the quick access to medical facilities and treatment.  
Another experiment that has been developed on the ISS and used on Earthly is the 
eye tracking device.  Laser surgery on the human eye has become more common and 
enhancing eye surgery using space hardware has played a key role in the success of laser 
surgery.  The use of tracking technology that was initially developed for use in space is 
17 
 
now being used to track a patient’s eye and accurately manage the laser scalpel.  
According to NASA, (2017), the eye tracking device experiment gave researchers insight 
into how a human’s frames of reference, balance and the overall control of eye movement 
are affected by weightlessness; concluding that the device could be significantly 
beneficial to society.  
Another societal contribution that originated from the ISS is making inoperable 
tumors operable with the use of a robotic arm.  In fact, since 2008, this technology has 
been used extensively in clinical experiences with patients who were considered 
otherwise inoperable. Paige Nickason had an egg-shaped brain tumor successfully 
removed with the aid of a gentle touch and a world-famous arm, not a surgeon’s arm but 
a robotic arm. 
“The technology that went into developing neuroArm, the world’s first robot 
capable of performing surgery inside magnetic resonance machines was born of 
the Canadarm, developed for the U.S. Space Shuttle Program; as well as 
Canadarm2, the robotic arm that performs the heavy lifting and maintenance 
aboard the International Space Station” (NASA, 2012, pg. 1).  
Research on board the ISS has also led to development of improved vaccines.  
Ground research determined that bacteria, especially Salmonella, has the potential to 
become more able to cause disease during spaceflight.  In the U.S. alone, Salmonella is 
responsible for thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of annual deaths.  During 
analysis in space, scientists found a pathway for bacterial pathogens to become virulent, 
by identifying the genetic pathway activating in Salmonella, and allowing the increased 
likelihood to spread in microgravity (NASA, 2017).  
18 
 
Furthermore, improving air quality is another experiment that has benefited the 
astronauts on the ISS and society on Earth.  The solutions that allowed for growth of 
crops in space now enables solutions for mold prevention in wine cellars, homes, medical 
facilities, and other industries on Earth.  Looking to the future, NASA is monitoring the 
crop growth on the ISS to establish the ability for astronauts to grow their own food as 
part of the agency’s journey to Mars.  
Lastly, through research and analysis came the Advanced Astro-culture or 
ADVASC, which is an ethylene removal system in space.  It aided in keeping plants alive 
by discarding bacteria, viruses, and mold from the plant growth chamber.  Scientists 
adjusted the ADVASC system for application in air purification.  This technology is now 
able to prolong the shelf-life of fruits and vegetables.  Additionally, winemakers are 
utilizing it in their storage cellars.

Social and Environmental Benefits 
 The ISS is an extensive part of the commercialization of space research.  Aboard 
the ISS, selected industries have participated in research by conducting experiments and 
studies aimed at developing new products and services.  The results of these experiments 
have greatly benefited those on Earth; not only by providing innovative new products, but 
also by creating new jobs to manufacture and market these new products.   
Environmental aspects of the ISS include both onboard effects on the crew from 
prolonged space exposure, as well as the observations of the Earth from orbit that will 
help the study of large-scale, long-term changes in the environment.  These studies assist 
in understanding the effects of volcanoes, meteorite impacts, hurricanes, typhoons, forest, 
oceans, and mountains.  In addition, changes to the Earth that are caused by the human 
race can be observed from the ISS.  The effects of: (1) air pollution, (2) deforestation, and 
(3) water pollution are visible from space and can be captured in images that provide a 
global perspective unavailable from the ground (Shuttle Press Kit, 1999).   
One system in particular captures photographs of Earth from space for application 
in developing countries affected by natural disasters.  That system is known as the 
Environmental Research and Visualization System (ISERV).  Additionally, another 
shared effort by NASA and the U.S. Agency for International Development, known as 
SERVIR, collaborates with developing nations to involve satellites as a means of making 
decisions related to the environment.  The ISS passes over more than 90 percent of the 
Earth’s populated areas daily, allowing the ISERV system to provide imagery to 
developing nations quickly, collecting up to 1,000 images per day, these images in turn 
can aid in a quick response to efforts for floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, deforestation, 
20 
 
harmful algal blooms and other types of natural events (NASA, 2017).  The ISS 
continues to confirm its contribution to the planet as a priceless platform for observation 
of the Earth.

When the first astronauts went to the ISS, they were losing almost two percent of 
their total bone mass density each month.  Using diet and an exercise regimen, scientists 
have developed a way to reduce bone loss.  These scientists discovered that high-intensity 
resistive exercise, as well as dietary supplementation for vitamin D and specific caloric 
intake can minimize the loss of bone mass in space (NASA, 2017).  These types of 
scientific discoveries will continue to provide a huge benefit for the support of astronauts 
and crew on the ISS; the future of deep space exploration and incorporating the 
possibility of a journey to Mars or an orbiting asteroid.  
Pharmaceutical companies have benefited from ISS research focusing on the 
mechanisms of osteoporosis.  By using model organisms, such as mice, scientists 
21 
 
conducted a study in orbit to understand mechanisms of osteoporosis.  Model organisms 
are non-human species with specific characteristics that allow them easily to be 
reproduced and studied in a confined laboratory (NASA, 2017).  This study that involved 
mice onboard the ISS led to the availability of a pharmaceutical medication called Prolia, 
which helps treat humans with osteoporosis.   
Observation and Remote Sensing Opportunities 
The ISS provides a unique opportunity to capture a variety of sites on Earth by 
providing repeated overflight passes of the Earth with different lighting and viewing 
angles (NASA, 2017).  The crew on the ISS conducts Crew Earth Observations (CEO) 
defined as photographing human-made and natural events on Earth.  The photographs 
record the Earth’s surface changes over time, along with dynamic events such as storms, 
floods, fires and volcanic eruptions (NASA, 2017).  These images offer researchers data 
from a perspective on the ISS, allowing them to understand the planet from that vantage 
point.  Earth observations from space serves as a unique record of environmental change 
on Earth and the destructive impact caused by humans; such as city growth, agricultural 
expansion, and reservoir construction.  Short- and long-term events documented by CEOs 
have included hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, climate change, forest fires, 
urban sprawl, and pollution (NASA, 2017).  
The ISS crewmembers use commercial and professional handheld cameras with a 
suite of lenses (from wide angle to an 800mm lens equivalent) to take the Earth 
observation photographs that support research in a wide variety of Earth Science sub-
disciplines.  The crew is also provided with a daily list of targets of the greatest scientific 
interest; ranging from educational and research tools, as well as historical records of 
22 
 
global environmental change, special geological and weather events, and the growth and 
change of human-made features (NASA, 2017).  
  Commercial/Private Industry Partnerships 
As the future continues to unfold for NASA and the longevity of the ISS, the 
commercial/private industry will play a vital role in the success of the U.S. space 
exploration.  To accomplish the goals of the National Space Policy and achieve NASA’s 
strategic plan for future space exploration, NASA is maintaining its efforts to promote the 
development of advanced industrial space-related capabilities towards new space 
markets.  According to NASA, (2017), the Human Exploration and Operations Mission 
Directorate was initiated to allow authorization of the Commercial Space Capabilities 
Office to solicit and manage Space Act Agreements with U.S. private sector enterprises 
that wish to collaborate with NASA on the development of new space-related 
capabilities.   
“The purpose of the Space Act Agreements (SAAs) is to advance commercial 
space-related efforts by facilitating access to NASA’s vast spaceflight resources 
including technical expertise, assessments, lessons learned, and data so that the 
emerging products or services are commercially available to government and non-
government customers within approximately the next five years (NASA, 2017, 
pg. 2).”   
In 2017, NASA released its list of the 1,200 active SAAs the space agency had 
with commercial companies, non-profit entities, and state and local governments. 
Included in this list are the thirty-one SAAs that NASA has signed with SpaceX 
(Messier, 2017).  NASA’s decade-long collaboration with SpaceX, a private U.S. 
23 
 
aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company, has resulted in numerous 
successful funding, organization, and research initiatives for NASA.   
“Space X is involved in the development of space transportation capabilities for 
unmanned science, crew missions, deep space communication and navigation, 
Mars entry, descent and landing, methane-oxygen propulsion, propellant 
management, and large scale in situ resource utilization systems (NASA, 2017, 
pg. 2).”   
Since the NASA and SpaceX partnership, SpaceX has flown thirteen missions to 
the ISS, delivering various payloads.  The most recent NASA-contracted ISS mission 
launched from a Florida Air Force station on April 2, 2018, delivering 6,000 pounds of 
supplies and science equipment to the ISS.  The astronauts onboard the ISS docked the 
SpaceX cargo capsule to the ISS by using the Canadaarm2 robotic arm.  The SpaceX 
capsule will remain docked to the ISS for a month while the ISS crew packs the capsule 
with 4,000 pounds of cargo that the ISS no longer needs in space. 
The science equipment will be used to support 50 of the 250 science experiments 
that are currently being conducted onboard the space station (Weitering, 2018).  Two of 
the research studies involve the optimization of plant growth in space, as well as the 
production of red blood cells by bone marrow in a microgravity environment (Wall, 
2018).  In addition to the cargo contract with NASA; in 2014, NASA and SpaceX had 
also partnered to develop a manned launch vehicle capable of transporting astronauts to 
the ISS and return them to Earth (NASA, 2017).  SpaceX has projected that it will be able 
to conduct a manned test flight in December 2018.  This test flight will be one step closer 
the NASA’s goal of launching its astronauts to the ISS from U.S. soil.  Ever since 2011 
24 
 
when the U.S. Space Shuttle program retired, the U.S. has relied on the Russia’s space 
program to launch U.S. crews to the ISS.

The Gallup Studies 
 The Gallup World Poll tracks the most important issues worldwide.  One of those 
topics is the space program and space exploration.  Gallup uses telephone surveys in 
countries where telephone coverage represents at least 80% of the population (Gallup, 
2018).  The Gallup organization uses a random-digit-dial (RDD) method or a nationally 
representative list of phone numbers.  The list of phone numbers used are contacted up to 
three times by Gallup.  The results of the Gallup polls used for comparison in this study 
were based on telephone interviews with randomly selected national samples of 
approximately 1,000 adults, aged 18 years or older (Gallup, 2018). 
A series of four polls commissioned by The Space Foundation in an effort to 
determine the extent of support and public attitudes toward America's space program 
25 
 
were conducted by the Gallup Organization.  The polls were conducted in June 2005, 
March 2006, August 2006 and May 2008.  The results from the polls revealed that in the 
midst of a varying world and national circumstances and uncertainties, Americans still 
strongly supported U.S. space exploration and were willing to support its funding at 
current levels or even slightly increased levels, according to Mary Engola, chairwoman of 
the Coalition for Space Exploration's Public Affairs Team (Gallup, 2009).

CHAPTER III 
 
METHODOLOGY 
 This chapter describes the methodology used in this research study, to include: 
purpose of the study, selection of the research population, description of the research 
instrument, quantitative data collection, quantitative data analysis, and ethical issues and 
assurances.   
Purpose of the Study 
 The purpose of this study was to: (1) emphasize and evaluate the past and present 
scientific and societal contributions the ISS has provided the United States, (2) determine 
support for NASA and their efforts to stimulate a new interest for future lunar, planetary 
and deep space exploration, and (3) decide if the continued benefits of U.S. space 
exploration, including new discoveries and successful research findings, justify the 
associated financial costs.  
Selection of the Research Population 
The research population for this national study was determined by convenience 
sampling and snowball sampling.  Convenience sampling is a nonrandom sampling 
technique where representatives of the target population that meet certain criteria, 
established by the researcher, are included for the purpose of the study (Etikan, Musa, 
and Alkassim, 2016).  The primary objective of convenience sampling is to collect 
information from participants who are easily accessible to the researcher.  In addition, 
nonrandom sampling is useful when randomization is impossible, for instance when the 
27 
 
population is extremely large.  Lastly, this sampling technique can be useful when 
the researcher has limited resources, including time, workforce and monetary funds 
(Explorable, 2018).  Convenience sampling was used for the participants who responded 
to the survey via email responses. 
Snowball sampling refers to a non-probability sampling technique in which a 
researcher begins with a small population of individuals and through the course of the 
research, the population expands as those initial participants recruit others to participate 
in the study. In other words, the sample population starts small but snowballs into a larger 
sample (Lewis-Beck, Bryman & Liao, 2004). Snowball sampling was used by the 
researcher when the social media links were created and posted; asking for participants to 
complete the research survey. Snowball sampling is often used by researchers who are 
working with a population that is difficult to identify or locate, because it allows for 
additional discovery of characteristics about a population that may not otherwise be 
identifiable (Spreen, 1992).  However, a disadvantage of this sampling technique is that it 
becomes more difficult to determine the sampling error.   
The U.S. adult men and women participating in this study remained anonymous 
as a result of the researcher using the following methods: (1) the research questionnaire 
did not ask for the participants’ names, (2) the data provided by the participants could not 
be linked back to an identifiable email or social media account, (3) the data submitted by 
the participants were anonymously coded and electronically sent to an Excel spreadsheet, 
and (4) the spreadsheet was electronically entered by the researcher into a statistical 
software program, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), for analysis.  In 
addition, all participants were notified in the introductory section of the research 
28 
 
questionnaire that the information they provided would be kept confidential and would be 
anonymously coded for statistical analysis.  The participants were also notified in the 
cover letter (Appendix A), that contributing to this research study was strictly voluntary. 
Description of the Research Instrument 
Guided by descriptive methodology, this research study used a research 
instrument (survey), The International Space Station and its Role in the Future of Space 
Exploration (Appendix B) authored by the researcher.  The instrument was developed by 
the researcher to quantitatively investigate the perceptions of U.S. adult men and women 
age 18 and older, as well as obtain demographic data and personal comments from each 
participant related to their perceptions on U.S. space exploration and the International 
Space Station.  
The research survey consisted of three parts: demographic information, closed-
end questions, and a personal comment section.  The first part of the instrument prompted 
demographic (personal) information characterizing each adult man and woman 
participating in the study.  The personal information sought by the researcher included 
the participant’s age and level of completed education.  The second part administered a 
series of closed-end questions; requiring a yes or no response from the participant.  The 
list of questions were considered with the intension to gain insight into the participating 
adults’ perceptions of the International Space Station, its future in U.S. space exploration, 
and the financial costs of U.S. space exploration including the continuous operation and 
maintenance of the ISS.  The third and final part of the research questionnaire presented a 
text box providing the participant an opportunity to provide their own personal remarks 
29 
 
regarding the historical significance of the ISS, as well as its future role in space 
exploration and research initiatives.   
Quantitative Data Collection 
 A research instrument (survey) was chosen to collect the necessary data for this 
study; that is to determine if American adults continue to: (1) support the purpose of the 
ISS, (2) support further funding of the ISS for research experimentation, and (3) support 
U.S. deep space exploration.  The survey method was chosen because surveys are 
comparatively cost-effective.  Related to cost effectiveness is a survey’s potential for 
generalizability.  Of all the known data-collection methods, survey research is one of the 
best methods to use when the researcher wants to obtain a representative picture of the 
attitudes and characteristics of a large population group (Blackstone, 2012).   
The survey developed for this study was distributed using Qualtrics, a web-based 
academic survey platform that allows for easy distribution of the survey to the 
participants and creation of a data analysis report after the submission of all completed 
surveys.  The survey was distributed and administered electronically via email and social 
media using a secure password-protected web link from Qualtrics.   
Prior to completing the survey, the participants were presented a cover letter that 
provided a brief background of the ISS, as well as the researcher’s purpose of the study 
(Appendix A).  The participants then completed the survey (Appendix B).  In addition, 
the participants were required to read a consent form (Appendix C) before completing the 
survey and electronically submitting it back to the researcher.  After the survey was 
initially sent to participants, two weeks later the researcher sent reminder emails and 
social media messages encouraging potential participants to complete and submit a 
30 
 
completed survey (Appendices D & E).  The distribution of the research instrument 
through social media (snowball sampling) and email (convenience sampling) allowed for 
a date stamp of the initial post or sending of the survey and provided an opportunity for 
the researcher to repost or send an additional email reminder after two weeks.  After 
thirty days, the researcher confidentially coded and analyzed the data from each 
completed survey electronically returned to the researcher.  The researcher collected, 
coded, and analyzed all of the survey data by the end of January 2018.  The researcher 
was the only individual who had access to the password-protected, private, and encrypted 
website to receive and analyze the participants’ data. 
Quantitative Data Analysis 
Following the data collection, all participant information from the surveys were 
categorized in terms of quantitative data.  The demographic data and the perceptions of 
the U.S. adult men and women were examined and explained by the researcher through 
descriptive statistics.  Descriptive statistics are commonly used to present quantitative 
descriptions in a manageable form; simplifying a large amount of data in a more practical 
way (Social Research Methods, 2006).  
A benefit of using descriptive statistics is to allow the researcher to effectively 
describe and communicate patterns that might emerge from the data.  Descriptive 
statistics helps define and summarize data through the use of percentages, rates, graphs, 
and frequency distributions (Laerd Statistics.com, 2015).  The results and interpretation 
of this statistical analysis of data is discussed by the researcher in Chapter IV. 
Ethical Issues and Assurances 
31 
 
Human subjects were an integral part of this study; therefore, this research study 
was conducted in accordance with Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements 
established by the OSU Office of University Research Compliance (URC).  The 
researcher obtained IRB approval (IRB Application Number: ED17129, December 2017) 
from the URC before conducting any research and collecting data from participants.   
Potential ethical issues discussed include personal disclosure of information from 
the participants, perception of involuntary participation in the study, confidentiality issues 
involved with coding and analyzing the data provided by the participants.  Each issue was 
discussed, and ways were identified to alleviate each issue.  Prior to completing the 
survey, each participant read and reviewed a cover letter explaining that participation in 
this research study is strictly voluntary.  The letter also stated that the responses to each 
survey question will remain confidential and will be used solely for statistical analysis.  
The statement detailing that it will be understood by the researcher if a participant 
completes the survey and submits their responses to the researcher meant that the 
participant had agreed and given consent to participate in this study which was also 
included in the cover letter.   
The participants who volunteered to provide their own information all chose to do 
so by clicking on the “I choose to participate and consent to begin” button.  The 
researcher clearly explained that the study had been approved by the IRB (Appendix F) 
and met all requirements to begin distributing the data, prior to forwarding the survey to 
participants. 
The established IRB protocol has been systematically followed and complied with 
by the researcher.  All quantitative data collection regarding the participants has been 
32 
 
protected and secured through all IRB requirements, and all confidential information and 
issues have been maintained through IRB standards and consent forms.  All appropriate 
citations and references have been included in the final draft of the dissertation study.

CHAPTER IV 
 
FINDINGS 
The purpose of this research study was to: (1) emphasize and evaluate the past 
and present scientific and societal contributions the ISS has provided the United States, 
(2) determine support for NASA and their efforts to stimulate a new interest for future 
lunar, planetary and deep space exploration, and (3) decide if the continued benefits of 
U.S. space exploration, including new discoveries and successful research findings, 
justify the associated financial costs.  
In addition, for comparative purposes with the participant perception data 
collected for this study, the researcher included selected participant data from a series of 
four research polls and focus groups conducted between 2005 and 2008 by The Gallup 
Organization.  This series of studies were conducted to determine the magnitude of 
advocacy and public outlook towards America’s space program, including the 
International Space Station during the time span of 2005 - 2008.  The sample population 
for this 2005-2008 study encompassed approximately 1,000 U.S. adult men and women 
aged 18 years and older.  The survey questions used in the 2005-2008 studies to collect 
the perception data included:  
5. Do you think America’s space program benefits the nation’s economy by 
inspiring students to pursue careers in technical fields?   
6. This year, a new plan or goal for space exploration was announced. The plan 
includes a stepping stone approach to return the space shuttle to flight, complete 
34 
 
assembly of the space station, build a replacement for the shuttle, go back to the 
moon, and then on to Mars and beyond. If NASA’s budget did not exceed 1% of 
the federal budget, to what extent would you support or oppose this new plan for 
space exploration? Would you strongly support it, support it, oppose it, or 
strongly oppose it?   
7. Do you think spending on the U.S. space program should be increased, kept at the 
present level, reduced, or ended altogether? 
8. It is now 40 years since the United States first landed men on the moon. Do you 
think the space program has brought enough benefits to this country to justify its 
costs, or don’t you think so?   
Data Summary 
 In December of 2017, the researcher posted the survey through social media; 
posting the survey in four distinct groups to help facilitate participation.  Additionally, 
the researcher emailed the survey to 950 co-workers, college students, and professional 
colleagues.  It is impossible to calculate how many potential participants saw the survey 
posted through social media due to the snowball sampling discussed earlier; however, the 
researcher received 294 completed surveys as a result of the social media post.  In 
addition, the researcher received 201 completed survey that were emailed to the 950 co-
workers, college students, and professional colleagues.  The surveys from the email 
responses yielded a response rate of 21% (201/950).  At the end of the time allotted for 
collection, 495 completed surveys from the social media post and the emails were 
received by the researcher.

The research survey had a total of eight questions, seven questions were closed-
end questions and one question was open-end.  There were two questions related to 
demographic information regarding the participant, five questions related to the 
participant’s perceptions regarding U.S. space exploration and the International Space 
Station, and one personal comment box allowing for any additional participant comments 
regarding the International Space Station and its role in the future of space exploration.   
The first survey question asked participants about their age.  Table 1 indicated 
different age ranges for each of the participants. The findings for this first question show 
that the majority of the adult participants (74%) were under the age of 35 years old. In 
addition, only 4% of the participating U.S. adults were 55 years old or older.

In comparison, the results from The Gallup Organization studies conducted 
between 2005 and 2008 studies (Figure 11) also showed that the majority (76%) of U.S. 
adults participating in these studies agreed with the following Gallup statement, 
“America’s space program benefits the nation’s economy by inspiring students to pursue 
careers in technical fields.” 
 
Figure 11. Space program inspires students (Gallup study). 
When asked the question, “Do Americans fear that without public support and 
further funding, the U.S. will lose its dominance in space exploration and research to 
other countries that have outlined robust plans for lunar/solar system exploration?”, the 
majority (80%) of participants agreed that as a nation it is important to support, as well as 
fund U.S. space exploration; otherwise, the nation could lose its dominance to competing 
countries who have outlined their own plans for lunar and deep space exploration.

A similar question regarding public support and further funding for space 
exploration was asked during the Gallup studies, “This year, a new plan or goal for space 
exploration was announced.  The plan includes a stepping stone approach to return the 
space shuttle to flight, complete assembly of the space station, build a replacement for the 
shuttle, go back to the moon, and then on to Mars and beyond.  If NASA’s budget did not 
exceed 1% of the federal budget, to what extent would you support or oppose this new 
39 
 
plan for space exploration? Would you strongly support it, support it, oppose it, or 
strongly oppose it?” 
 
 Figure 12. Support for a new U.S. space exploration plan (Gallup study). 
 
 
The participants’ responses to this Gallup study (Figure 12) indicate that more 
than half (68%) of the participating U.S. adults strongly agreed or agreed in support of a 
new plan for space exploration that would include a stepping-stone approach to return the 
space shuttle to flight, complete the assembly of the ISS, build a replacement for the 
shuttle, go back to the Moon, and then on to Mars or beyond.   
Table 5 identified that 406 participants (82%) agree the overall benefits of U.S. 
space exploration and associated scientific research discoveries outweighs the risks of 
human space flight; even though 17 NASA astronauts have been killed in either a training 
exercise (Apollo 1) or actual Space Shuttle flights (Challenger and Columbia).

Question six in the survey specifically asked if Americans support increasing the 
NASA budget.  Most of the U.S. adults (58%) participating in the study indicated that 
Americans support increasing NASA’s budget; while less than half (42%) of participants 
did not believe that Americans would support increasing NASA’s budget.

During the Gallup studies, participating U.S. adults were asked the question, “Do 
you think spending on the U.S. space program should be increased, kept at the present 
level, reduced, or ended altogether?”  The results (Figure 13) indicated that the majority 
of the participants (60-70%) stated that space program spending should be increased or at 
least kept at the current spending level.

A comparative research question, “It is now 40 years since the United States first 
landed men on the moon.  Do you think the space program has brought enough benefits 
to this country to justify its costs, or don’t you think so?”, was included in the Gallup 
studies (Figure 14).  The results showed that most (63%) of participating adults (ages 18 
to 49) agreed that the benefits of the U.S. space program have justified the overall costs, 
and about half (54%) of participating adults (age 50 or older) agreed as well that the 
benefits of the U.S. space program have justified the overall costs.

In Table 8, only a small amount (26%) of participants believe that additional 
funding for the ISS will not result in increased technological advances, endless research 
opportunities, and the continued growth of U.S. space exploration; so therefore, NASA 
43 
 
should not extend the ISS expectancy of use past the year 2024.  The support to extend 
the ISS and that additional funding will result in increased technological advances, 
endless research opportunities, and continued growth in the realm of space exploration 
was represented by the majority (74%) of the participants.  In addition, these participants 
agree that NASA should continue to operate and maintain the ISS past the year 2024.

The last section of the questionnaire asked the participants to add any additional 
comments regarding the International Space Station and its role in the future of space 
exploration.  The survey information showed that 71 participants (14%) left personal 
comments.  Thirty participants (42%) specifically commented on the ISS and/or the U.S. 
space program.  There were seven participants that provided their personal opinions of 
the ISS.  Two of these participants commented, “The ISS is our chance at great scientific 
breakthroughs” and “I believe the ISS is extremely important for the future of the world, 
not just our country.”  Another participant stated that not enough people knew about the 
44 
 
benefits of the ISS or its function in space.  There were 16 participants that discussed 
how most Americans do not understand government budgets and offered suggestions on 
how private institution(s) could replace NASA.  These comments provided good insight 
on how to incorporate the private sector to assist in financial responsibility, but still 
provide opportunities for growth in space exploration.  Lastly, seven participants shared 
information regarding their academic backgrounds and/or professional experiences 
related to the U.S. space program; or left their contact information to further discuss the 
study with the researcher. 
The remaining 41 participants (58%) provided comments that were not 
specifically-related to the ISS and its future role in U.S. space exploration.  Fourteen of 
the participants stated that most Americans do not have an educated opinion on U.S. 
space exploration and/or the ISS due to their lack of knowledge.  There were eight 
participants who were confused by the survey questions, believing they could not give 
their perception on what Americans as a whole thought.  Contradicting the participants 
who said the survey questions were confusing and could not provide an overall American 
perception; 19 participants stated they answered the questions with what they believed 
would be the average American’s perception instead of providing their own opinion to 
the questions.

CHAPTER V 
 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
 
There have been many challenges affecting the International Space Station and its 
continued viability.  A major challenge was the retirement of the Space Shuttle program 
in 2011; resulting in the reduction of launch capabilities to the ISS, as well as identifying 
and building another manned U.S. space vehicle capable of reaching the ISS. Another 
challenge has been the increasing expense of space launches and required research 
hardware; occurring at the same time there was a general lack of funding and political 
support for the U.S. human space program (Powell, 2016).  Additionally, the astronaut 
crew will remain fixed in size and the time available for the crew to do research will be 
limited due to other requirements onboard the ISS.  Even though the ISS is now fully 
assembled, the required maintenance of the station and the financial whereabouts to fund 
the ISS past its predetermined retirement date of 2024 will remain constant challenges.   
Even with the challenges the ISS has faced or is continuing to face, it remains a 
unique test bed for new technologies and applications, for scientific discoveries, and a 
platform for increased international collaboration in research and space exploration.  But 
regardless how much public support still exists today for U.S. space exploration, as 
evidenced in this study; unless the scheduled 2024 retirement date for the ISS is extended 
at the federal level, or can transition to a fully-qualified private enterprise - the global 
scientific community will no longer be able to rely on the station for fundamental 
46 
 
research and exploration.  If an extension to the retirement date is not granted or a 
seamless transition is not completed, the ISS could likely be deorbited by NASA (NASA, 
2011).   
Summary of Findings 
This research study was designed to evaluate the past and present scientific and 
societal contributions the ISS has provided the United States; determine public support 
for U.S. space exploration and its efforts to stimulate a new interest for future lunar, 
planetary and deep space exploration; and decide if the continued benefits of U.S. space 
exploration, including new discoveries and successful research initiatives, justify the 
associated financial costs.  
In addition, for comparative purposes with the participant perception data 
collected for this study, the researcher included selected participant data from a series of 
research polls and focus groups conducted between 2005 and 2008 by The Gallup 
Organization.  This series of studies were conducted to determine the level of advocacy 
and public support towards America’s space program, including the International Space 
Station.  The purpose of comparing the previous Gallup studies with this study was to 
determine if the perceptions of U.S. adults regarding space exploration have changed 
since 2008; especially after it was confirmed in 2015 that Congress would only extend 
NASA’s operations of the International Space Station through 2024.   
 In reference to the five research questions directing this study and one of the 
survey questions, the following findings emerged after the researcher analyzed the data 
collected from the participating 495 U.S. adults: 
47 
 
1. The first research question asked if Americans fear that without public support 
and further funding, the U.S. will lose its dominance in space exploration to other 
countries that have outlined robust plans for lunar/solar system exploration.  
Eighty percent of the adult participants were concerned that the U.S. will, at some 
point, lose their dominance in space exploration once Congress removes NASA 
funding from the federal budget after 2024.  A similar question regarding public 
support and further funding for space exploration was asked during the Gallup 
studies, “This year, a new plan or goal for space exploration was announced.  The 
plan includes a stepping stone approach to return the space shuttle to flight, 
complete assembly of the space station, build a replacement for the shuttle, go 
back to the moon, and then on to Mars and beyond.  If NASA’s budget did not 
exceed 1% of the federal budget, to what extent would you support or oppose this 
new plan for space exploration?”  Sixty eight percent of participants that 
answered this Gallup question agreed they would support a new plan for U.S. 
space exploration. 
2. Overall, approximately 80% of the U.S. adults that participated in the survey 
agreed that Americans believe that the space program, including the ISS, benefits 
the economy by inspiring young people to consider an education in STEM fields.  
This percentage was slightly higher than the percent of U.S. adults (76%) asked a 
similar question a decade ago, “Does America’s space program benefit the 
nation’s economy by inspiring students to pursue careers in technical fields?”  
3. One of the survey questions specifically asked if Americans support increasing 
NASA’s budget. Even though the federal price tag to annually fund NASA has 
48 
 
only been about $19 billion dollars, equating to 0.5 percent of a $4-trillion-dollar 
federal budget (Anapol, 2018), only 58% of participants would support a NASA 
budget increase.  During the Gallup studies, a larger percentage of the participants 
(60-70%) indicated that space program spending should be increased or at least 
kept at the current spending level. 
4. Even though 17 U.S. astronauts have lost their lives since NASA was founded in 
1968, 82% of participants believed the benefits of U.S. space exploration and 
associated scientific discoveries outweigh the risks of human space flight.   
5.  When asked the question, “Do Americans believe that the benefits of U.S. space 
exploration, including the ISS, justify the financial costs?” approximately two-
thirds (66%) of participants agreed with the question.  In 2008, U.S. adults were 
asked a similar question, “It is now 40 years since the United States first landed 
men on the moon.  Do you think the space program has brought enough benefits 
to this country to justify its costs, or don’t you think so?”  The results indicated 
that 63% of participating adults (ages 18-49) agreed the U.S. space program 
brought enough benefits to justify its costs; but only 54% of participants (age 50 
or older) agreed with the question. 
6. The final question asked, “Do Americans believe that additional funding for the 
ISS will not result in increased technological advances, endless research 
opportunities, and the continued growth of U.S. space exploration; therefore, 
NASA should not extend the ISS expectancy of use past the year 2024?”  Almost 
three-fourths of the participants (74%) believed that additional funding for the ISS 
will, indeed, result in an increase in technological advances, research 
49 
 
opportunities, and continued growth in space exploration.  Additionally, these 
participants agreed that NASA should continue to operate and maintain the ISS 
past 2024.  
Conclusions 
 Since the construction of the ISS began in November 1998, the space station has 
been involved in bringing together: (1) international flight crews; (2) multiple launch 
vehicles; (3) globally distributed launch, operations, engineering, and development 
facilities; (4) communications networks; and (5) a global scientific research community 
(NASA, 2011).  Operating the ISS for the past twenty years has been more complex than 
any other space flight endeavor, primarily because it has always been an international 
effort.  Perhaps one of the most impactful benefits of the ISS has been the opportunity for 
different nations to come together and collaboratively work on common goals and 
objectives.  For each international partner to set aside political differences and cooperate 
with NASA and other space organizations demonstrates how unifying space exploration 
can adapt and provide solutions to life-changing global issues.   
There have been numerous research technologies and scientific discoveries that 
have been successfully tested, developed and perfected; providing significant societal 
benefits to the global population.  In addition, the ISS has provided an abundance of 
environmental benefits over the past two decades.   
  ISS crew members have been living and working in space for extended periods 
of time and examining each crew after long-duration missions provides the necessary 
information for physicians and scientists to determine exactly what the human limitations 
are in this type of environment.  Peggy Whitson, a biochemistry researcher and NASA 
50 
 
astronaut has accrued 665 days in space over the course of her career.  This is more time 
in space than any other U.S. astronaut (Held, 2017).  During her time aboard the ISS, she 
contributed to hundreds of scientific experiments, including research on antibodies that 
will increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs and the changes that an astronaut’s 
eyes undergo in environment with very little gravity (Held, 2017).  Whitson’s remarkable 
career alone supports the finding that two-thirds of the participants in this study agreed 
that the benefits of U.S. space exploration, including the ISS, justify the financial costs. 
The continued research conducted on human endurance onboard the ISS has 
greatly improved the knowledge of long-term space exposure and its effects on the 
human body.  Understanding an astronaut’s physiological, chemical, and behavioral 
changes while working in space will be critical in the years to come as astronauts 
continue to explore deeper and deeper in space.  The future of U.S. space exploration is 
dependent on the research performed onboard the ISS to determine if interplanetary space 
travel and further exploration of the vast universe will ever be possible.   
In February 2018, President Trump’s 2019 federal budget proposal sought to end 
U.S. government funding for the International Space Station (ISS) at the end of 2024; 
even though the federal price tag to annually fund NASA equates to 0.5% of a $4-trillion-
dollar federal budget.  Instead, the Trump administration would allot millions of dollars 
of funding to pursue privatization of the ISS and return U.S. astronauts to the lunar 
surface.  But many of these emerging private space companies have already made it clear 
that they are not yet prepared to be fully involved with the ISS by the time federal 
funding ends in 2024 and are cautious of accepting the risks of the ISS without any 
administrative and financial support from the U.S. government (Anapol, 2018). 
51 
 
Regardless when these commercial companies will be able to fully support the 
ISS and other U.S. space initiatives, they will be forced to play a key role in the future of 
the U.S. space program, including the ISS.  Even though federal funding of the ISS will 
terminate in 2024, the 2019 budget proposal will provide: (1) robotic missions to the 
moon, (2) development of the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, (3) 
momentum to lead astronauts back to the moon in 2023, (4) funding for the next Mars 
rover launch in 2020, and (5) a step towards more ambitious deep space exploratory goals 
(Rivera, 2018).   
According to the findings from this study and the previous Gallup studies, U.S. 
adult perceptions regarding past, present and future space exploration including the 
evolvement of the ISS has remained consistently positive for the past twenty years.  But 
the future of space discovery and experimentation will primarily depend on the emerging 
role of the private space companies; however, NASA has strongly urged Congress to plan 
a smooth and seamless transition with budding commercial space companies (Klotz, 
2017).  
At a March 2017 hearing on the future of the ISS, the President of the 
Commercial Spaceflight Federation commented, “The commercial sector is moving in 
the right direction but to fully privatize the ISS it would be difficult, you would need that 
expertise that NASA offers, fifty-fifty would be a great starting off point (Fernholz, 2017, 
pg. 1).”  A U.S. representative expressed concern stating, “Another reason to delay the 
closure of the ISS might be increasing concern over other countries’ space ambitions, as a 
fear of turning over human presence in low-Earth orbit to China (Fernholz, 2017, pg. 1).”  
This opinion was similar to participant responses in this study, referring to the question 
52 
 
that the U.S. can lose its dominance in space exploration and research to other countries.  
The desire and support for the U.S. to continue to lead in space exploration and discovery 
is still present; however, the ISS (with or without federal funding) will be required to play 
a vital role in preserving U.S. leadership in future space initiatives.  This echoes some of 
the personal comments from the participants in this study, “The ISS is our chance at great 
scientific breakthroughs” and “I believe the ISS is extremely important for the future of 
the world not just our country.”   
Final Remarks 
By evaluating the influential achievements and examining the overall effects the 
ISS has had on the perceptions of a sample of U.S. adults;  the researcher focused on the 
exploratory contributions and research benefits the ISS has provided to the global 
population during the past twenty years; the international collaboration of space 
partnerships centered around the ISS; and what the ISS, as a long-duration space 
platform, can continue to offer to the future of U.S. space exploration and research 
initiatives. 
The mission of the International Space Station (ISS) was to enable long-term 
exploration of space and provide benefits to people on Earth.  During the past two 
decades, the scientific studies conducted onboard the ISS have successfully tested a 
variety of technologies, systems, and materials that have proven beneficial to society, as 
well as future long-duration space exploration missions (NASA, 2017).  Furthermore, the 
research accomplishments onboard the ISS have significantly improved technology in 
aiding future space exploration.  But as 2024 nears, all of these new private space 
companies must continue to unite in their goals and objectives as they apply their own 
53 
 
knowledge gained through space station research in human physiology, radiation, 
materials science, engineering, biology, fluid physics, and technology to enable the future 
of exploratory missions beyond the space station.  
Lastly, the International Space Station must remain a critical asset for U.S. space 
exploration as new leadership champions the continued exploration and research that is 
still needed to fully understand and overcome the challenges of long-duration spaceflight 
required for deep space exploration missions.  The U.S. space program has the support of 
the American people, but without the ISS, the future of U.S. space exploration could 
easily be in jeopardy.   
Recommendations 
 Based on the conclusions and findings of this study, the researcher offers the 
following recommendations. 
1. After reading and reviewing the participants’ personal comments, a large 
percentage of the American population is not knowledgeable of the ISS; including 
its past, present and possible future contributions to American and global 
societies.  Even though a tremendous amount of factual information regarding 
U.S. space exploration and NASA is readily available, Americans seem to have 
lost interest in the ISS.  Perhaps it is simply old news because the ISS had been 
operational for twenty years.  This is a similar result of the Space Shuttle program 
which lost public interest because it was a successful twenty-year human 
spaceflight program.  There needs to be a public reawakening of the U.S. space 
program, especially as future space exploratory plans are being discussed with 
private industry.  Public educational systems need to continue to demand STEM 
54 
 
curriculum and funding initiatives with private partners to provide the necessary 
K-12 classroom technology.  Even though the results from this study showed that 
U.S. adults support increasing NASA’s budget, and that the benefits of U.S. space 
exploration and scientific discovery outweigh the risks of human spaceflight; the 
American population and media outlets must continue to be more responsible for 
obtaining and sharing knowledge of U.S. space exploration.  
2. This study was conducted during the timeframe of a successful Space X rocket 
launch that was livestreamed to the American population.  It was clearly observed 
through reactions on news stations, social media, and in person that this privately-
funded launch created a resurgence of excitement and interest in the U.S. space 
industry among Americans.  In 2018, the Space X rocket company has already 
completed seven successful launch missions including missions for NASA to send 
supplies and experiments to the ISS (CNBC, 2018).  As the federal government 
begins to transition the U.S. space program toward privatization; these private 
space companies like SpaceX, Orbital ATK, and Sierra Nevada Corporation will 
need to take the initiative to develop and implement marketing and advertising 
campaigns to reintroduce the benefits of U.S. space exploration to younger 
generations of Americans who may not have received the same public exposure of 
the Space Shuttle and ISS successes as their parents and grandparents.  
3. The findings from this study were very similar to the results from the Gallup 
studies conducted from 2005 to 2009.  The overall findings of support for 
continued funding, belief in benefits, and increase in motivation for STEM career 
provided encouragement to the researcher.  During the twelve-year difference in 
55 
 
time between these two studies, Americans witnessed the successes, and some 
failures, of the Space Shuttle program, the ISS, the rover launches to Mars, and 
the Hubble telescope.  It is recommended that additional studies regarding 
perceptions of U.S. space exploration be conducted with the hope that Americans 
will stay as fascinated and supportive in the future as they witness manned 
spaceflight back to the Moon, deep space exploration to Mars, photographs of a 
vast universe we have yet to visualize, and the possibility of affordable 
spaceflight opportunities for the American citizen.

The International Space Station and Its Role in The  
Future of Space Exploration 
 
 
The International Space Station (ISS) is a large spacecraft in orbit around Earth. The ISS 
serves as a unique science laboratory and consists of modules/parts that were assembled 
in space by astronauts. It orbits Earth at an average altitude of 220 miles and travels at 
17,500 mph; orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes. NASA is using the space station to 
learn more about living and working in space. These lessons will make it possible to send 
humans farther into space than ever before. The first piece of the International Space 
Station was launched in November 1998. The first crew arrived on November 2, 2000 
and astronauts and cosmonauts have lived and worked on the ISS ever since. NASA and 
its global space partners completed final construction of the space station in 2011. 
 
The participants for this research study will consist of approximately 500 U.S. adult men 
and women aged 18 years and older. This research study is designed to examine 
America’s perception of U.S. space exploration, including the role of the ISS. Are 
Americans still supportive of the U.S. space program and space exploration and are 
Americans supportive of using more tax dollars to pay for space exploration including the 
maintenance of the ISS. The useful life for the ISS is expected to end in 2020 and at that 
time the ISS could be de-orbited.  
 
The researcher, Mrs. Jessica Devett, Oklahoma State University doctoral candidate 
strongly believes the information obtained in this research initiative can be a springboard 
to facilitate discussion and offer a way for the nation’s collegiate aviation community to 
proceed proactively in addressing emerging areas of concern. 
 
Your participation in this research study is strictly voluntary. Your response to each 
survey question will remain confidential and will be used solely for statistical analysis. It 
will be understood by the researchers if you complete this survey and submit your 
responses back to the researchers, you have agreed and given your consent to participate 
in this study. 
 
The researcher of this research study personally thank you for your feedback and support 
of this research. The final research report will be presented at a professional aviation or 
educational conference and published in a peer-reviewed aviation or educational journal.

Abstract 
 
We document how the narrative and the policies of space exploration in the United States have 
changed from the Eisenhower through the Obama administrations. We first examine the history of U.S. 
space exploration and also assess three current conditions of the field of space exploration including: 1) 
the increasing role of the private sector, 2) the influence of global politics and specifically the emergence 
of China as a global space power, and 3) the focus on a human mission to Mars. In order to further 
understand the narrative of U.S. space exploration, we identify five rhetorical themes: competition, 
prestige, collaboration, leadership, and “a new paradigm.” These themes are then utilized to analyze the 
content of forty documents over the course of space exploration history in the U.S. from eight U.S. 
presidential administrations. The historical narrative and content analysis together suggest that space 
exploration has developed from a discourse about a bipolar world comprised of the United States and the 
Soviet Union into a complicated field that encompasses many new players in the national to the industrial 
realms. The results also suggest that the United States was at a crossroads in 2017 on the issues of how it 
participates in this changing field of space exploration. From this, we make three observations regarding 
recent U.S. space policy: 1) there is a disconnect between stated policy goals in American space 
exploration efforts and the implementation of those goals, 2) the United States communicates mixed 
messages regarding its intent to be both the dominant leader in the field of space exploration and also 
committed as a participant in international collaboration, and 3) the United States cannot remain a true 
pioneer of space exploration if it does not embrace the realities of globalization and the changing 
dynamics within the field of space exploration. We conclude with three suggestions: 1) the U.S. 
government and NASA should critically examine space exploration priorities and commit to 
implementing a program that will further realistic and robust stated policy and goals, 2) the U.S. should 
re-examine its intention to play a dominant leadership role in space exploration and consider emphasizing 
a commitment toward active participation in international collaboration in space, and 3) the U.S should 
fully embrace the new paradigm of space exploration by lowering barriers like ITAR that hinder the 
competitiveness of the American space industry. The U.S. should review the challenges and advantages 
of collaborative endeavors with rising space-faring nations such as China and abandon Cold War era 
thinking, thus paving the way to Mars by encouraging the participation of many nations and space 
agencies on future human missions.

1. Background 
 
 In the summer of 2015, astrophysicist and science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson conducted 
a podcast interview with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Administrator 
Charles Bolden. Tyson spoke of a shift in how the United States conducts itself in the arena of space 
exploration, explaining, “We have entered a new era...now we’re in a different world, where other 
countries are rising in their presence on the space frontier.” Bolden responded, “We [now] teach people, 
we act as a model for how people of different cultures, different races, different nationalities can in fact 
work together” [1]. In discussing NASA’s recent emphasis on international collaboration as the model for 
how the United States (U.S.) will explore space in the future, Tyson and Bolden also highlight how this 
emphasis affects the meaning and purpose of space exploration for the Nation as a whole. They also 
contrast the past to the present, which suggests that the American space program is at an important 
crossroads. 
 The history of space exploration in the United States is often spoken of with a great sense of 
national pride. It is evident that the American persona, which values ideals such as innovation, curiosity, 
and determination, is reflected in how the U.S. has interpreted its role in international space exploration in 
the past and continues to be an important factor in the present. But how has the understanding of that role 
changed over time? By examining the rhetorical themes within U.S. national space policy, leadership 
statements, and policy recommendations throughout American history, we see that the way the United 
States presents its role in international space exploration directly mirrors the Nation’s motivations in 
foreign policy and national security. The question this article explores is: how has the narrative of space 
exploration in the U.S. changed from the birth of the space program through the Obama Administration? 
By following the narrative of space exploration in the United States, it is possible to trace the country’s 
development of national and international goals. As these goals have changed since the beginning of 
space exploration, so has the U.S. voice in space exploration. However, due to the struggle to actualize 
ambitious goals in space, the U.S. national space policy agenda often remains purely rhetorical. Today, 
America finds itself at a crossroads between the familiar position of geopolitical posturing to maintain 
national prestige and showing leadership in promoting the next steps toward a truly global, collective field 
of space research. 
 
1.1 Space Exploration During the Cold War (1955-1991) 
 
Although the inception of the American space program was influenced by the development of the 
space technologies of the Soviet Union (U.S.S.R.), it was not created to serve as a symbol of national 
pride or international competition. Under Eisenhower, U.S. space exploration was designed to represent 
American scientific achievements, not perpetuate political objectives [2]. Though Eisenhower’s vision for 
American space exploration saw space as a scientific arena in which nations could further globally 
progress instead of competition, this vision would fall to the side as the relationship between space and 
nationalism became stronger in later administrations. On September 12, 1962, President John F. Kennedy 
proclaimed before a crowd of 35,000 that the United States had chosen to forge the pathway to the Moon 
[3]. He called out to the American pioneering spirit, stretching out a vision of success and prestige for the 
U.S. in the new frontier of space. The conquest of space was to become intrinsically tied to what it meant 
to be American, and with his rallying speech, Kennedy solidified the rhetorical link between U.S. prestige 
and dominance in space exploration [4]. This set the predominant tone for the Cold War era of U.S. space 
endeavors. Although interest in collaboration and cooperation remained, prestige and competition would 
take precedence. The political bipolarity of the Cold War, between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, was so 
prolific in every facet of society that space, the next step for human exploration, quickly became a proxy 
for competition.

1.2 Space Exploration in the Post-Cold War Era (1991-2016) 
  
The aftermath of the success of the Apollo missions left the United States as the self-perceived 
“winners” of the Space Race, but rather than serving to encourage the American space program to 
continue making monumental achievements in space, Apollo and the “lavishness” of the Kennedy era 
became a benchmark to hold up as a comparison to the relative frugality of the modern era [5]. The 
United States has moved into the next stage of American space exploration, in which NASA stretches to 
achieve similar accomplishments to the lunar landings, but with an inadequate budget and decreasing 
public interest. In the post-Cold War era, the United States struggles to decipher its identity as a space-
faring nation [6]. It hesitates to relinquish its status as the preeminent leader, but yet is also unwilling to 
commit to space on the same level as the Apollo period. The new paradigm of space exploration that has 
arisen in the post-Cold War period also influences the decision making of the U.S., complicating the 
question: what does the United States want from space exploration? 
 
2. Methodology 
 
In order to investigate how the narrative of space exploration has changed over time, we 
conducted an analysis of forty documents and looked at the policies and rhetoric concerning U.S. space 
exploration across eleven U.S. presidential administrations, from the Cold War era through the Obama 
Administration. We specifically examined three types of documents: policy releases from various 
presidential administrations, statements made by those presidents and other prominent voices in space 
exploration leadership, and policy recommendations made to the U.S. government for advised action in 
space exploration. 
 To more rigorously evaluate how the rhetoric and priorities of space exploration in the United 
States have changed throughout the course of space history in the United States, we conducted a 
summative content analysis on the documents using five general themes (Table 1). This method was 
chosen in order to analyze space policy documentation over a long period of time, because it is a useful 
tool for identifying how different patterns emerge from a larger body of material [7]. Content analysis is 
used when examining how language embodies intent, attitudes, and biases beyond its literal textual 
meaning. Hsieh and Shannon write that a summative content analysis is the analysis of overarching 
patterns within the content of a text or speech [7]. This type of analysis can be used to understand the 
larger picture, rather than focusing solely on isolated words and sentences, allowing the researcher to 
understand the latent meaning of the content as a whole [7]. By examining the presence or absence of 
certain themes within these documents, historical changes emerged that can be interpreted as an 
evaluation of policy rhetoric surrounding the role of space exploration in the U.S. over the course of time. 
 Five themes were selected for coding after allowing rhetorical patterns to emerge from a close 
reading of the collected data. Following Hsieh and Shannon’s example, the method of content analysis 
aided in evaluating the rhetorical patterns that emerged. In addition to revealing the evolution of these 
rhetorical themes, the method of content analysis aided in the understanding of the nuanced nature of 
space exploration history. Each document was coded for those themes directly, and it was recorded how 
many times each theme occurred within a document. Those numbers then added up to total counts per 
theme per administration. 
 For the purposes of this study, prestige and leadership were understood to be two separate 
themes. Prestige was identified as rhetoric in which the United States utilized space exploration to 
increase its status globally, and leadership were statements in which the United States expressed 
specifically a desire to have a leadership role in space exploration. 
 The summative content analysis in this study is from the Eisenhower through Obama 
Administrations. We acknowledge the current administration but found that it would be premature to try 
to apply our analysis to the Trump administration after only one year.

Figure 1. Summative content analysis results depicted as a histogram, showing the evolution of the identified themes 
throughout each of the eight administrations. The histogram demonstrates trends for certain themes, such as a 
decrease in competition over time and an increase in a new paradigm of space exploration. Other themes, such as 
prestige, collaboration, and leadership, are more complicated and do not show obvious trends. 
 
While some simple trends are apparent in the data, such as the dominance of competition as a 
theme in early U.S. space program rhetoric and the emergence of the theme of a new paradigm in later 
years, the results show that space exploration rhetoric is complex and varies from one administration to 
another. Each new U.S. president sets out their own goals for space exploration, and there is variation 
and, in some cases, conflicting messages. Some administrations may desire to increase American prestige 
and leadership in space exploration, while others seek to reach out to other space-faring nations and 
develop collaborative ties. The analysis of these themes reveals how space exploration is an arena where 
many different, sometimes mutually exclusive, ideals and values interact and conflict with each other. 
Understanding the development of these themes is important to comprehending the development of the 
symbol of space exploration in the United States as a whole. 
 
3.1 Theme 1: Competition with the Soviet Union 
 
The space exploration narrative begins with a strong presence of Theme 1 in the Eisenhower 
through Nixon administrations. The psychological impact of the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik 1 is 
evident in the Eisenhower era, and despite President Eisenhower’s dismissal of the Sputnik successes as 
anything meaningful, competition with the Soviet Union dominated early American efforts in space 
exploration. Well before the launch of the world’s first space satellite, the National Security Council 
brought recent Soviet activities in developing space technology to Eisenhower’s attention and explained 
that future explorations into space would be a race against the Soviet Union that the United States could 
not afford to lose [9]. After Eisenhower, the Kennedy administration fully embraced the Space Race, and 
set out to specifically match or exceed the Soviets’ space program [12]. In the Nixon era, Congress 
8 
 
 
requested an entire study titled, “United States and Soviet Rivalry in Space: Who Is Ahead, and How Do 
the Contenders Compare,” [13] in order to determine who had the upper hand in space exploration. In the 
earlier days of U.S. space efforts, space exploration served as a competitive proxy between the United 
States and the Soviet Union, symbolizing the general rivalry that was the Cold War. The presidents and 
policymakers of these eras were unable to escape the overall atmosphere of “beat the Soviets,” and even if 
the Soviet Union was not explicitly mentioned when space exploration goals were stated, the Cold War 
and competition with the Soviet Union was heavily embedded in the American psyche. However, Theme 
1 decreases over time, until it disappears entirely after the Reagan administration. This signifies the shift 
in space exploration rhetoric from competition to collaboration, as the world moves from the Cold War to 
the post-Cold War era. From our document analysis, we can surmise that competition is no longer the 
primarily dominant theme in space exploration and other rhetorical themes have risen to make the overall 
field more complicated. 
 
3.2 Theme 2: American Prestige 
 
The consistent presence of Theme 2 in space exploration rhetoric directly demonstrates how 
space exploration serves a metaphorical purpose in the United States. Space exploration successes are 
often used as a symbol of the strength of American ideals and values, and those successes bring prestige 
to America. During the Eisenhower era, the United States was predominantly reacting to recent Soviet 
Union advances in space technology - specifically the launch of Sputnik 1. While Eisenhower himself 
devoted little attention to this event, his administration was well aware of the psychological benefits of 
being the first nation to launch a satellite [9] and related this back to the need of the U.S. to improve its 
own international image with successes in space. Before the launch of Sputnik 1, as both the United States 
and the Soviet Union were making preparations for launching satellites during the International 
Geophysical Year from 1957-1958, both countries understood that the first nation to launch would 
achieve great psychological and prestige benefits. After the Soviet Union achieved those benefits, the 
National Security Council acknowledged that the Soviet Union had surpassed the United States in terms 
of prestige
 
and advised that the United States should work to improve its own image as a successful 
space-faring nation [14]. After a handful of presidential administrations and impressive U.S. space 
missions like Apollo, the George H. W. Bush administration had the ability to look back on 30 years of 
history in space exploration in the United States with praise. The President was fully aware that space 
exploration served as a symbol of American prestige and was proud of America’s space exploration 
program, which he acknowledged in his speech on the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing 
[15]. However, at this point in time, the United States was beginning to look to the future in order to plan 
ahead but maintaining American prestige in space was revealed to be an important goal during the George 
H. W. Bush administration. Our document analysis suggests that prestige remains an important theme 
throughout U.S. space exploration history, and although it is never at the forefront of rhetoric, it plays an 
important role in the decision making of the United States in its goals for its space program. 
 
3.3 Theme 3: International Collaboration 
 
International collaboration as a theme was continually present in U.S. space policy, even during 
the earlier days of competition with the Soviet Union. It also dominated rhetoric during the Cold War era 
administrations of Nixon and Reagan. The earlier rhetoric of international collaboration was generally 
limited to calls for collaboration with countries “friendly” to the United States. However, there were 
occasional dealings with the Soviet Union for exchange of some minimal technical data [16] within the 
Kennedy administration. Under Nixon and Reagan, Theme 3 becomes the key theme in space exploration 
rhetoric. As the Cold War reaches its height, America looked to its allies to maintain momentum against 
the Soviet Union in space endeavors. Nixon himself stated he believed that the successes of space 
exploration “should be shared by all peoples” [17], and Reagan reiterated this sentiment during his 1984 
State of the Union Address when he stated, “NASA will invite other countries to participate so we can 
9 
 
 
strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand freedom for all who share our goals” [18]. The most 
important American goal during this period of history was without a doubt to achieve advantage over the 
Soviet Union. However, once the Soviet Union fell and began to look less like an enemy and more like a 
possible partner, Russia was included in this list of possible partnerships for milestone space exploration 
endeavors like the Space Station Freedom (or as it is later to be known, the International Space Station). 
Theme 3 maintains its importance over time as globalization and the increasing number of space-faring 
nations necessitates international collaboration. Additionally, due to the multiple interpretations of what it 
means to collaborate internationally, this theme is constant throughout all administrations. This theme 
also dominates rhetoric by a wide margin during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, where 
the construction and assembly of the International Space Station is paramount. By the post-Cold War era, 
the emphasis has shifted away from projects that America can achieve solely on its own, toward more 
collaborative endeavors.  
 
3.4 Theme 4: American Leadership 
 
In the documents we found that American leadership in space is also consistently present in U.S. 
space exploration rhetoric. In the Kennedy administration, it ranks evenly with competition as the 
dominating theme, demonstrating that not only did the U.S. view space exploration as a struggle with the 
Soviet Union, but that there was also the goal of becoming the leader of the field. This theme is relevant 
throughout the rest of the Cold War and reaches a peak during the Reagan Administration. However, 
instead of decreasing as the number of space-faring nations increases, and themes like international 
collaboration become important, Theme 4 maintains its prevalence. The crests in this theme during the 
Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations are due to the fact that the United States was enjoying its 
established leadership role in space exploration and sought to maintain this role and exert dominance over 
the Soviet Union. Reagan remarked that “being a leader in space is a very wonderful accomplishment” 
[18], and the National Space Council under the George H. W. Bush administration advocated that the 
“fundamental objective” of U.S. efforts in space exploration is leadership [19]. Theme 4 decreases 
somewhat during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations but re-emerges during the Obama 
administration. This underscores that although the United States advocates for international collaboration 
in space, it still seeks to be a leader in the space exploration and commercialization. 
 
3.5 Theme 5: A New Paradigm 
 
A “new paradigm,” as a theme, is entirely absent during the Cold War era, as not only was this a 
period in which the status quo is competition between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., but the United States did 
not yet have the history to draw comparison between the past and the present. It first appears as an 
important theme during the Reagan administration, at the tail end of the Cold War, when the National 
Commission on Space explained that power in space was rapidly proliferating as more and more nations 
made significant advances in space exploration with their own space capabilities [20]. However, Theme 5 
materializes as early as the Nixon administration, as the U.S. was descending from the height of the 
Apollo missions, and wondering where to go next. Theme 5 reaches its peak under the George H. W.  
Bush administration, directly after the fall of the Soviet Union, when the world was in the post-Cold War 
shock. As the United States grappled with its direction for the future in order to achieve its space 
exploration goals, it acknowledged that this was no longer as simple as surpassing one identified rival. 
Theme 5 stands out in the rhetoric of the Obama administration. The increasing importance of private 
industry in space exploration adds to the complexity of space exploration as a field. Globalization not 
only complicates the arena with the inclusion of more players, but also competing interests in the 
industrial side. Under the Obama administration, the president acknowledged the multipolar nature of 
modern space exploration, as well as the significant role of private industry in this field. There is a direct 
comparison to the past in our current era, where our challenges are now different [21], and 50 years after 
the establishment of NASA, the space exploration narrative has evolved significantly [22].

4. Discussion 
 
When examining the patterns that emerge from the five themes of the content analysis, it is 
important to consider how these themes interact with each other. Understanding this relationship allows 
us to develop a larger picture of the evolution of space exploration as a whole, with these different 
moving parts representing shifts in the interests and goals of the U.S. over time. By looking at what the 
United States desired to achieve recently in space exploration in contrast to its stated goals in the past, we 
can understand and make suggestions for how the country should move forward in the future. 
Competition becomes less present in U.S. space exploration rhetoric as other themes, such as 
international collaboration, American leadership, and a new paradigm become more prevalent. It is 
plausible that the fall of the Soviet Union and American interest in partnering with the new Russia 
contributed to this shift in U.S. goals for space exploration, and later on, this interaction between 
competition and other themes could be the result of the field of space exploration becoming more 
complex and diverse.  
Another theme that recedes over time is the theme of prestige, which is an important tool used by 
earlier leaders to gain the support of the American public by promoting American values through space 
exploration. Although the United States wishes to remain a leader in space exploration as time goes on, 
prestige as a theme falls to the wayside in favor of international collaboration. The rhetoric shifts from 
simply flaunting the national image to enthusiasm for Americans as helping others grow their own space 
capabilities. This transition is also related to the theme of a new paradigm. As many more interested 
parties enter into the space exploration arena, the United States made the decision to de-emphasize 
nationalism in favor of improving international relations and promoting leadership qualities. 
When competition and prestige disappear as space exploration themes, and international 
collaboration and a new paradigm rise, one might expect that references to American leadership decreases 
as well. If leadership is seen as taking a commanding role it logically would be in conflict thematically 
with collaboration. The relationship between leadership and collaboration themes is discussed later in this 
section. Curiously, under the Obama administration the theme of leadership rose once again. This may 
reflect an administration attempting to navigate an increasingly complex arena of space exploration or 
may be indicative of Obama’s values and goals for his legacy. Whatever the cause, the documents 
analyzed regarding Obama’s 2010 National Space Policy mention leadership as a goal six times, 
communicating the intention to maintain U.S. dominance in the field of space exploration in the future.  
The analysis and interactions among themes point to three observations regarding U.S. space 
policy through the Obama Administration. These observations are: 1) there is a disconnect between stated 
policy goals in American space exploration efforts and the implementation of those goals, 2) the United 
States communicates mixed messages regarding its intent to be both the dominant leader in the field of 
space exploration and committed as a participant in international collaboration, and 3) the United States 
cannot remain a true pioneer of space exploration if it does not embrace the realities of globalization and 
the changing dynamics within the field of space exploration.   
 
4.1 Observation 1: Disconnect Between Policy and Implementation 
 
After the successes of the Apollo era, the United States has had difficulty in clearly defining its 
goals in space exploration. As space policy has become less of a priority relative to other national 
interests, commitment and follow-through with stated policy goals is often not as consistent. Whereas in 
the past space was more of a national priority, that is not the case today. Additionally, issues with funding 
are not uncommon, and there is less momentum behind American space exploration initiatives as 
compared with the 1960s [23]. Because of this, the United States needs to make some choices concerning 
how it maintains its interests in the field of space exploration, in order to reconcile ambitious policy 
statements and the reality of the capabilities of NASA. 
The U.S. has recently expressed in its policy rhetoric ambivalent signals about the amount of 
influence it wishes to have on global space exploration. Throughout recent policy statements, the U.S. has 
11 
 
 
reiterated its desire to maintain a leadership status in space, yet realities like NASA’s current budget, as 
well as the general vagueness about the direction the U.S. space program is headed, contradict this goal. 
Rhetorical posturing is not a substitute for real vision and commitment. Space does not necessarily have 
to be a top priority in national policy, but if U.S. administrations continue to make statements about U.S. 
leadership in space that are reminiscent of the Apollo days, the American public and the rest of the world 
either expect the U.S. to live up to its proclamations or they will turn away, because they recognize empty 
promises. 
Additionally, the mentality of “bigger and better for less” that has dominated the space program 
since the end of the Apollo era is harmful in the long run. Attempting to run ambitious missions that are 
on the same grandiose scale as before, as cheaply as possible could be detrimental not only to the quality 
of the American space program, but also to its reputation. If the United States is not willing to invest what 
is necessary into projects like a human mission to Mars, then the country needs to reevaluate its goals. 
Currently, it is expected that projects will run over the budgets that were originally proposed to Congress, 
because the ambitious goals that the United States sets out to complete are not realistic for NASA’s 
current budget. One option is for the U.S. to take on less expensive, less ambitious projects as compared 
with the Apollo program. The U.S. could also partner with other nations and private companies in 
exchange for lower overall costs. However, if the United States desires to be the leader in space, and a 
pioneer in big, projects, then the country’s space budget needs to be aligned with that. Either way, the 
program needs to be reevaluated for realistic and achievable goals. 
 The U.S. government and NASA should critically examine space exploration priorities and 
commit to implementing a program that will further realistic and robust stated policy and goals.  
 
4.2 Observation 2: Struggle Between Leadership and Collaboration 
 
Both the themes of international collaboration in space and American leadership in space have 
meant different things to different people over the course of the development of space exploration in the 
United States. They are consistently prevalent themes, but this is perhaps due to their multifaceted nature 
and ambiguity. International collaboration and leadership come into direct conflict in the modern era of 
space exploration. The end of the Cold War may have opened up the global space arena for international 
cooperation, but the post-Cold War era did not completely shift U.S. goals away from nationalism [24]. 
As the field developed and more nations became interested in participation, the United States struggled 
and continues to struggle to balance a desire to participate in the evolving field, but also to retain a certain 
amount of preeminence and control. 
Although leadership surpassed competition as the new overarching goal for U.S. space 
exploration and leading through collaboration with other nations became a consistent goal of the U.S. 
space program, it is difficult to settle for being a participant rather than a leader. Blamont explains 
NASA’s struggle between leadership and collaboration by stating that NASA generally interprets 
international cooperation as a situation in which the program is controlled entirely by NASA, with a few 
international partners on board [25]. He adds that often the international community interprets statements 
made by the U.S. that world problems can be solved with American leadership as a euphemism for 
desiring total command [25]. 
In the past, international collaboration in space has meant that the United States is interested in 
simple data sharing with other friendly, allied countries. The national goals of the United States 
dominated these “collaborative” efforts, and the U.S. maintained unilateral control, but yet this can still be 
considered as some measure of international cooperation. Earlier administrations viewed collaboration as 
an avenue in which the U.S. could solidify other goals like prestige and leadership, or further political 
interests as the atmosphere warmed between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. Collaboration was not seen as a 
benefit to scientific development and the opportunity to share scientific achievement between many 
nations for the sake of the entire world – a more modern interpretation that resonates today. 
Leadership as well has taken on many meanings over time. In the past, the United States argued 
for leadership in space for the sake of furthering political goals and American prestige. Now, as those 
12 
 
 
specific goals are no longer relevant, NASA argues that it will “lead through cooperation.” However, this 
sentiment is somewhat of an oxymoron. Whether or not the U.S. can successfully participate in 
international collaboration in space and still act as a leader in the field is entirely contingent on its 
definition of leadership. If leadership means that the United States must dominate the arena and maintain 
the upper hand in international agreements, the country will not find the true benefits to collaboration and 
as a result, relationships with other space-faring nations will suffer. But if the U.S. can instead find 
leadership to mean something more along the lines of a country that acts as a “leading participant,” rather 
than the loudest and most important voice in the room, it may find that other nations are more willing to 
partner with it.  
Indeed, the U.S. cannot ignore the realities of the space exploration field today, which is 
international and only becoming more so. To push away potential partnerships in favor of egotism would 
be a huge detriment to not only NASA itself, but also to world progress in space. It is important to find 
that balance between leader and participant. It is also important to remain open to other perspectives and 
allow for other nations to take the critical path on missions. True leadership, after all, is not complete 
domination over other parties, but rather provides the opportunity for others to participate and ensures that 
all voices are heard. 
The U.S. should reexamine its intention to play a dominant leadership role in space exploration 
and consider emphasizing a commitment toward active participation in international collaboration in 
space. 
 
4.3 Observation 3: Embracing the New Paradigm 
 
The new paradigm of space exploration is one in which there are many international players, and 
in which private industry has an increasingly strong foothold. The relative role of U.S. leadership, the 
participation and role of other counties with interests in entering the space arena, along with privatization 
of space will all affect the kind of space science the U.S. conducts and in what particular aspects the U.S. 
will make trade-offs. Too much government control will limit competition, yet too much influence from 
private corporations will limit space science research and exploration to only what is commercially 
viable. However, it is clear that in order to be at the forefront of space exploration, the United States 
needs to cooperate with other prominent space-faring nations and also reduce barriers to participation in 
the space industry. 
One area where Cold War rhetoric still dominates is in America’s relationship with China in 
space. In this new era, China is often presented as the successor to the U.S.S.R.’s role as America’s 
“rival” in a space race [26]. China and Russia share similarities in many ways, especially in terms of 
looking at how international cooperation functions in ISS-related situations [26]. Examining the historical 
context of Russia’s inclusion on the ISS and initial U.S. reservations can aid in demonstrating how the 
United States could possibly extend an invitation to China [26]. It could also help evaluate whether or not 
the U.S. lives up to its stated goals of international collaboration. While comparing the situation with 
China to the past situation of the Soviet Union can be useful in understanding how national interests have 
shifted over time, it becomes clear that concessions will need to be made on part of the United States if it 
is to truly move forward in this era of globalization. Competition and rivalry in space pose a barrier to 
international collaboration and progress in space. With the state of current economic interdependence and 
a globalized world, China cannot be thought of in a simplistic, Cold War mentality [27]. In his 
recommendation for the U.S. and China to overcome their differences for the benefit of both parties, 
Hilborne states in the current global environment that is cooperative in nature, competition is not practical 
or logical [27]. 
 Another area in which the U.S. needs to embrace the new paradigm is in reconsidering and 
possibly restructuring regulations like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). If 
international collaboration is to be the model moving forward for the United States, the presence of ITAR 
and similar regulations greatly hinders future successes in space exploration. Blamont explains that ITAR 
negatively affects collaboration by straining collaboration due to the suspicious atmosphere that the 
13 
 
 
regulations cause [25]. Blamont also hints at America’s suspicious nature when it comes to collaboration 
in space exploration, a remnant of Cold War era mentality [25]. That mentality is not keeping up with 
post-Cold War realities, which impedes American progress in developing positive relationships with other 
countries in space endeavors. This mindset also leads to potential collaborators believing it is not a good 
idea to place trust in the United States on long-term projects, as the U.S. presents itself as a country that 
puts its image and prestige before scientific successes or advancement. This is not the message we want to 
be conveying to the rest of the world.  
While ITAR regulations are in place to protect U.S. national security and interests, some amount 
of deregulation does not mean dropping ITAR completely, which would render the U.S. vulnerable. 
Modern security concerns necessitate the need for regulations over data sharing in order ensure the safety 
of American intelligence and information. However, if the United States were to critically examine what 
particular regulations need to be in force and focus overall on improving outreach possibilities to other 
space-faring nations, this would demonstrate the U.S. government’s actual intentions to cooperate 
internationally in space exploration. The reasonable way forward is to accelerate opportunities for 
collaboration between the United States and other interested parties, be it nations or private corporations, 
in order to truly capitalize on the future successes in space. Taking an active role in the private space 
industry and seeking out collaborative roles is essential if the U.S. space program wishes to flourish in the 
new paradigm. 
The third arena in which it is imperative for the U.S. to fully embrace the new paradigm for space 
exploration is within the context of missions to Mars. If NASA is truly set on taking American astronauts 
to Mars, the United States should be asking realistic question about how to achieve such an ambitious 
collective goal. The path to Mars is undoubtedly one on which many nations must join together, simply 
due to the size and scope a human mission to Mars would entail. Whether the U.S. approaches missions to 
Mars with an international collaborative model in mind, or more like the old missions to the Moon that 
gave the United States a great sense of national pride, will be a true litmus test of the role the U.S. will 
take in these new endeavors. By looking at the framework for stated future U.S. missions to Mars, as well 
as what experts are recommending as courses of actions to Mars, we can see exactly how the “new 
paradigm” of space exploration plays out. 
The United States should fully embrace the new paradigm of space exploration by - lowering 
barriers like ITAR that hinder the competitiveness of the American space industry, committing to 
collaborative endeavors with rising space-faring nations such as China and abandoning Cold War era 
thinking, and paving the way to Mars by encouraging the participation of many nations and space 
agencies on future manned missions. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The examination of the changing narrative of space exploration in the United States is also an 
examination of the changing self-perception of the country in relation to the rest of the world. Space, by 
the nature of the word, means thinking outside of the boundaries of our own border, be it country or 
global borders. Because national interests have dictated U.S. direction in space exploration, this has meant 
that as the country finds itself at the crux of where it stands on the global stage politically, it also does so 
in space endeavors. 
We conclude that: competition as a driver launched the space program, but is no longer relevant 
with regard to Russia – and probably is not useful with regard to other countries going forward; American 
prestige has been a consistent but never dominant theme in space exploration rhetoric; international 
collaboration has been an important theme in all administrations, but it has not always had the same 
meaning or connotation throughout each administration; American leadership, while present in all 
administrations, gains momentum post-Cold War, as competition as a theme fades and the field of space 
exploration develops; a new paradigm of space exploration has emerged post-Cold War as an 
acknowledgement of changing times and more complex national and international interests.

Further study of the trends would yield additional insight. One aspect that could be investigated 
further is how the meaning of the five analyzed themes has changed over time. Themes like competition, 
prestige, collaboration, leadership, and a changing world order rarely mean exactly the same thing over 
the course of history. It is also often found that individual, leadership-based interpretations of the themes 
dictate how they are used and the value attributed to them in any given administration. As time passes, 
other themes may take precedence, and the approach used here could be repeated with new or additional 
themes in the future. It would be interesting to utilize this same method of historical narrative and content 
analysis to evaluate international science collaboration in other arenas, such as climate research or 
sustainability in the Arctic. Other areas may also yield similar situations in which the United States has 
transitioned from a sense of competition toward more interest in international collaboration, and scientific 
collaboration could be used as a tool for diplomacy. 
 Derived from its research, this article makes three observations to current U.S. efforts in space 
exploration. These observations are: 1) there is a disconnect between stated policy goals in American 
space exploration efforts and the implementation of those goals; 2) the United States communicates 
mixed messages regarding its intent to be both the dominant leader in the field of space exploration and 
committed as a participant in international collaboration; and 3) the United States cannot remain a true 
pioneer of space exploration if it does not embrace the realities of globalization and the changing 
dynamics within the field of space exploration.  
The unknown is complicated, and space is the unknown. The United States, a country that has 
been at the forefront of space exploration, currently has the opportunity to look back upon the past and 
critically analyze history, while also analyzing the present situation, in order to determine how it should 
move forward into the future. This article offers three summary thoughts: 1) U.S. government and NASA 
should critically examine space exploration priorities and commit to implementing a program that will 
further realistic and robust stated policy and goals, 2) the U.S. should reexamine its intention to play a 
dominant leadership role in space exploration, and consider emphasizing a commitment toward active 
participation in international collaboration in space, and 3) the United States should fully embrace the 
new paradigm of space exploration by - lowering barriers like ITAR that hinder the competitiveness of 
the American space industry, committing to collaborative endeavors with rising space-faring nations such 
as China and abandoning Cold War era thinking, and paving the way to Mars by encouraging the 
participation of many nations and space agencies on future human missions.

U.S. have changed over the past 50 years. We first examine the history of the
U.S. space exploration program and also assess three current conditions of
space exploration including: (1) the increasing role of the private sector, (2)
the influence of global politics, and (3) the focus on a human mission to Mars.
We identify five rhetorical themes: competition, prestige, collaboration,
leadership, and a new paradigm. These themes are then used to analyze the

ABSTRACT
Intrinsically motivated goal exploration algorithms enable machines to discover
repertoires of policies that produce a diversity of effects in complex environ-
ments. These exploration algorithms have been shown to allow real world robots
to acquire skills such as tool use in high-dimensional continuous state and action
spaces. However, they have so far assumed that self-generated goals are sampled
in a specifically engineered feature space, limiting their autonomy. In this work,
we propose to use deep representation learning algorithms to learn an adequate
goal space. This is a developmental 2-stage approach: first, in a perceptual learn-
ing stage, deep learning algorithms use passive raw sensor observations of world
changes to learn a corresponding latent space; then goal exploration happens in
a second stage by sampling goals in this latent space. We present experiments
where a simulated robot arm interacts with an object, and we show that explo-
ration algorithms using such learned representations can match the performance
obtained using engineered representations.

1 INTRODUCTION
Spontaneous exploration plays a key role in the development of knowledge and skills in human
children. For example, young children spend a large amount of time exploring what they can do
with their body and external objects, independently of external objectives such as finding food or
following instructions from adults. Such intrinsically motivated exploration (Berlyne, 1966; Gopnik
et al., 1999; Oudeyer & Smith, 2016) leads them to make ratcheting discoveries, such as learning to
locomote or climb in various styles and on various surfaces, or learning to stack and use objects as
tools. Equipping machines with similar intrinsically motivated exploration capabilities should also
be an essential dimension for lifelong open-ended learning and artificial intelligence.
In the last two decades, several families of computational models have both contributed to a better
understanding of such exploration processes in infants, and how to apply them efficiently for au-
tonomous lifelong machine learning (Oudeyer et al., 2016). One general approach taken by several
research groups (Baldassarre et al., 2013; Oudeyer et al., 2007; Barto, 2013; Friston et al., 2017)
has been to model the child as intrinsically motivated to make sense of the world, exploring like a
scientist that imagines, selects and runs experiments to gain knowledge and control over the world.
These models have focused in particular on three kinds of mechanisms argued to be essential and
complementary to enable machines and animals to efficiently explore and discover skill repertoires
in the real world (Oudeyer et al., 2013; Cangelosi et al., 2015): embodiment 1, intrinsic motivation2

and social guidance3. This article focuses on challenges related to learning goal representations for
intrinsically motivated exploration, but also leverages models of embodiment, through the use of
parameterized Dynamic Movement Primitives controllers (Ijspeert et al., 2013) and social guidance,
through the use of observations of another agent.
Given an embodiment, intrinsically motivated exploration4 consists in automatically and sponta-
neously conducting experiments with the body to discover both the world dynamics and how it can
be controlled through actions. Computational models have framed intrinsic motivation as a family
of mechanisms that self-organize agents exploration curriculum, in particular through generating
and selecting experiments that maximize measures such as novelty (Andreae & Andreae, 1978;
Sutton, 1990), predictive information gain (Little & Sommer, 2013), learning progress (Schmid-
huber, 1991; Kaplan & Oudeyer, 2003), compression progress (Schmidhuber, 2013), competence
progress (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013), predictive information (Martius et al., 2013) or empowerment
(Salge et al., 2014). When used in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework (e.g. (Sutton, 1990;
Schmidhuber, 1991; Kaplan & Oudeyer, 2003; Barto, 2013)), these measures have been called in-
trinsic rewards, and they are often applied to reward the ""interestingness"" of actions or states that are
explored. They have been consistently shown to enable artificial agents or robots to make discover-
ies and solve problems that would have been difficult to learn using a classical optimization or RL
approach based only on the target reward (which is often rare or deceptive) (Chentanez et al., 2005;
Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013; Stanley & Lehman, 2015). Recently, they have been similarly used to
guide exploration in difficult deep RL problems with sparse rewards, e.g. (Bellemare et al., 2016;
Houthooft et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2017; Pathak et al., 2017).
However, many of these computational approaches have considered intrinsically motivated explo-
ration at the level of micro-actions and states (e.g. considering low-level actions and pixel level
perception). Yet, children’s intrinsically motivated exploration leverages abstractions of the en-
vironments, such as objects and qualitative properties of the way they may move or sound, and
explore by setting self-generated goals (Von Hofsten, 2004), ranging from objects to be reached, toy
towers to be built, or paper planes to be flown. A computational framework proposed to address
this higher-level form of exploration has been Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes
(IMGEPs) (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2009; Forestier et al., 2017), which is closely related to the idea
of goal babbling (Rolf et al., 2010). Within this approach, agents are equipped with a mechanism
enabling them to sample a goal in a space of parameterized goals5, before they try to reach it by ex-
ecuting an experiment. Each time they sample a goal, they dedicate a certain budget of experiments
time to improve the solution to reach this goal, using lower-level optimization or RL methods for
example. Most importantly, in the same time, they take advantage of information gathered during
this exploration to discover other outcomes and improve solutions to other goals6.
This property of cross-goal learning often enables efficient exploration even if goals are sampled
randomly (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013) in goal spaces containing many unachievable goals. Indeed,
generating random goals (including unachievable ones) will very often produce goals that are out-
side the convex hull of already discovered outcomes, which in turn leads to exploration of variants
of known corresponding policies, pushing the convex hull further. Thus, this fosters exploration
of policies that have a high probability to produce novel outcomes without the need to explicitly
measure novelty. This explains why forms of random goal exploration are a form of intrinsically
motivated exploration. However, more powerful goal sampling strategies exist. A particular one
consists in using meta-learning algorithms to monitor the evolution of competences over the space
of goals and to select the next goal to try, according to the expected competence progress result-
ing from practicing it (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013). This enables to automate curriculum sequences
of goals of progressively increasing complexity, which has been shown to allow high-dimensional
real world robots to acquire efficiently repertoires of locomotion skills or soft object manipulation
(Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013), or advanced forms of nested tool use (Forestier et al., 2017). Similar
ideas have been recently applied in the context of multi-goal deep RL, where architectures closely
related to intrinsically motivated goal exploration are used by procedurally generating goals and
3Leverages what others already know
4Also called curiosity-driven exploration
5Here a goal is not necessarily an end state to be reached, but can characterize certain parameterized prop-
erties of changes of the world, such as following a parameterized trajectory.

sampling them randomly (Cabi et al., 2017; Najnin & Banerjee, 2017) or adaptively (Florensa et al.,
2017).
Yet, a current limit of existing algorithms within the family of Intrinsically Motivated Goal Explo-
ration Processes is that they have assumed that the designer7 provides a representation allowing the
autonomous agent to generate goals, together with formal tools used to measure the achievement of
these goals (e.g. cost functions). For example, the designer could provide a representation that en-
ables the agent to imagine goals as potential continuous target trajectories of objects (Forestier et al.,
2017), or reach an end-state starting from various initial states defined in Euclidean space (Florensa
et al., 2017), or realize one of several discrete relative configurations of objects (Cabi et al., 2017),
which are high-level abstractions from the pixels. While this has allowed to show the power of
intrinsically motivated goal exploration architectures, designing IMGEPs that sample goals from a
learned goal representation remains an open question. There are several difficulties. One concerns
the question of how an agent can learn in an unsupervised manner a representation for hypothetical
goals that are relevant to their world before knowing whether and how it is possible to achieve them
with the agent’s own action system. Another challenge is how to sample ""interesting"" goals using a
learned goal representation, in order to remain in regions of the learned goal parameters that are not
too exotic from the underlying physical possibilities of the world. Finally, a third challenge consists
in understanding which properties of unsupervised representation learning methods enable an effi-
cient use within an IMGEP architecture so as to lead to efficient discovery of controllable effects in
the environment.
In this paper, we present one possible approach named IMGEP-UGL where aspects of these difficul-
ties are addressed within a 2-stage developmental approach, combining deep representation learning
and goal exploration processes:
Unsupervised Goal space Learning stage (UGL): In the first phase, we assume the learner can
passively observe a distribution of world changes (e.g. different ways in which objects
can move), perceived through raw sensors (e.g. camera pixels or other forms of low-level
sensors in other modalities). Then, an unsupervised representation learning algorithm is
used to learn a lower-dimensional latent space representation (also called embedding) of
these world configurations. After training, a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is used to
estimate the distribution of these observations in the latent space.
Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Process stage (IMGEP): In the second phase, the em-
bedding representation and the corresponding density estimation learned during the first
stage are reused in a standard IMGEP. Here, goals are iteratively sampled in the embedding
as target outcomes. Each time a goal is sampled, the current knowledge (forward model
and meta-policy, see below) enables to guess the parameters of a corresponding policy,
used to initialize a time-bounded optimization process to improve the cost of this policy for
this goal. Crucially, each time a policy is executed, the observed outcome is not only used
to improve knowledge for the currently selected goal, but for all goals in the embedding.
This process enables the learner to incrementally discover new policy parameters and their
associated outcomes, and aims at learning a repertoire of policies that produce a maximally
diverse set of outcomes.
A potential limit of this approach, as it is implemented and studied in this article, is that repre-
sentations learned in the first stage are frozen and do not evolve in the second stage. However, we
consider here this decomposition for two reasons. First, it corresponds to a well-known developmen-
tal progression in infant development: in their first few weeks, motor exploration in infants is very
limited (due to multiple factors), while they spend a considerable amount of time observing what
is happening in the outside world with their eyes (e.g. observing images of social peers producing
varieties of effects on objects). During this phase, a lot of perceptual learning happens, and this
is reused later on for motor learning (infant perceptual development often happens ahead of motor
development in several important ways). Here, passive perceptual learning from a database of visual
effects observed in the world in the first phase can be seen as a model of this stage where infants
learn by passively observing what is happening around them8. A second reason for this decomposi-
7Here we consider the human designer that crafts the autonomous agent system.
8Here, we do not assume that the learner actually knows that these observed world changes are caused by
another agent, and we do not assume it can perceive or infer the action program of the other agent. Other works

tion is methodological: given the complexity of the underlying algorithmic components, analyzing
the dynamics of the architecture is facilitated when one decomposes learning in these two phases
(representation learning, then exploration).
Main contribution of this article. Prior to this work, and to our knowledge, all existing goal
exploration process architectures used a goal space representation that was hand designed by the
engineer, limiting the autonomy of the system. Here, the main contribution is to show that represen-
tation learning algorithms can discover goal spaces that lead to exploration dynamics close to the
one obtained using an engineered goal representation space. The proposed algorithmic architecture
is tested in two environments where a simulated robot learns to discover how to move and rotate an
object with its arm to various places (the object scene being perceived as a raw pixel map). The ob-
jective measure we consider, called KL-coverage, characterizes the diversity of discovered outcomes
during exploration by comparing their distribution with the uniform distribution over the space of
outcomes that are physically possible (which is unknown to the learner). We even show that the use
of particular representation learning algorithms such as VAEs in the IMGEP-UGL architecture can
produce exploration dynamics that match the one using engineered representations.
Secondary contributions of this article:
• We show that the IMGEP-UGL architecture can be successfully implemented (in terms
of exploration efficiency) using various unsupervised learning algorithms for the goal
space learning component: AutoEncoders (AEs) (Bourlard & Kamp, 1988), Variational AE
(VAE) (Rezende et al., 2014; Kingma & Ba, 2015), VAE with Normalizing Flow (Rezende
& Mohamed, 2015), Isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), PCA (Pearson, 1901), and we quan-
titatively compare their performances in terms of exploration dynamics of the associated
IMGEP-UGL architecture.
• We show that specifying more embedding dimensions than needed to capture the phe-
nomenon manifold does not deteriorate the performance of these unsupervised learning
algorithms.
• We show examples of unsupervised learning algorithms (Radial Flow VAEs) which pro-
duce less efficient exploration dynamics than other algorithms in our experiments, and
suggest hypotheses to explain this difference.
2 GOALS REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR EXPLORATION ALGORITHMS
In this section, we first present an outline of intrinsically motivated goal exploration algorithmic
architectures (IMGEPs) as originally developed and used in the field of developmental robotics,
and where goal spaces are typically hand crafted. Then, we present a new version of this archi-
tecture (IMGEP-UGL) that includes a first phase of passive perceptual learning where goal spaces
are learned using a combination of representation learning and density estimation. Finally, we out-
line a list of representation learning algorithms that can be used in this first phase, as done in the
experimental section.
2.1 INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED GOAL EXPLORATION ALGORITHMS
Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs), are powerful algorithmic architec-
tures which were initially introduced in Baranes & Oudeyer (2009) and formalized in Forestier et al.
(2017). They can be used as heuristics to drive the exploration of high-dimensional continuous
action spaces so as to learn forward and inverse control models in difficult robotic problems. To
clearly understand the essence of IMGEPs, we must envision the robotic agent as an experimenter
seeking information about an unknown physical phenomenon through sequential experiments. In
this perspective, the main elements of an exploration process are:
• A context c, element of a Context Space C. This context represents the initial experimental
factors that are not under the robotic agent control. In most cases, the context is considered
fully observable (e.g. state of the world as measured by sensors).
have considered how stronger forms of social guidance, such as imitation learning (Schaal et al., 2003), could
accelerate intrinsically motivated goal exploration (Nguyen & Oudeyer, 2014), but they did not consider the
challenge of learning goal representations.

• A parameterization θ, element of a Parameterization Space Θ. This parameterization rep-
resents the experimental factors that can be controlled by the robotic agent (e.g. parameters
of a policy).
• An outcome o, element of an Outcome Space O. The outcome contains information quali-
fying properties of the phenomenon during the execution of the experiment (e.g. measures
characterizing the trajectory of raw sensor observations during the experiment).
• A phenomenon dynamics D : C,Θ 7→ O, which in most interesting cases is unknown.
If we take the example of the Arm-Ball problem9 in which a multi-joint robotic arm can interact
with a ball, the context could be the initial state of the robot and the ball, the parameterization could
be the parameters of a policy that generate a sequence of motor torque commands for N time steps,
and the outcome could be the position of the ball at the last time step. Developmental roboticists are
interested in developing autonomous agents that learn two models, the forward model D̃ : C ×Θ 7→
O which approximates the phenomenon dynamics, and the inverse model Ĩ : C × O 7→ Θ which
allows to produce desired outcomes under given context by properly setting the parameterization.
Using the aforementioned elements, one could imagine a simple strategy that would allow the agent
to gather tuples {c, θ, o} to train those models, by uniformly sampling a random parameterization
θ ∼ U(θ) and executing the experiment. We refer to this strategy as Random Parameterization
Exploration. The problem for most interesting applications in robotics, is that only a small subspace
of Θ is likely to produce interesting outcomes. Indeed, considering again the Arm-Ball problem
with time-bounded action sequences as parameterizations, very few of those will lead the arm to
touch the object and move it. In this case, a random sampling in Θ would be a terrible strategy to
yield interesting samples allowing to learn useful forward and inverse models for moving the ball.
To overcome this difficulty, one must come up with a better approach to sample parameterizations
that lead to informative samples. Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Strategies propose a way
to address this issue by giving the agent a set of tools to handle this situation:
• A Goal Space T whose elements τ represent parameterized goals that can be targeted by the
autonomous agent. In the context of this article, and of the IMGEP-UGL architecture, we
consider the simple but important case where the Goal Space is equated with the Outcome
space. Thus, goals are simply vectors in the outcome space that describe target properties
of the phenomenon that the learner tries to achieve through actions.
• A Goal Policy γ(τ), which is a probability distribution over the Goal Space used for sam-
pling goals (see Algorithmic Architecture 2). It can be stationary, but in most cases, it will
be updated over time following an intrinsic motivation strategy. Note that in some cases,
this Goal Policy can be conditioned on the context γ(τ |c).
• A set of Goal-parameterized Cost Functions Cτ : O 7→ R defined over all O, which
maps every outcome with a real number representing the goodness-of-fit of the outcome o
regarding the goal τ . As these cost functions are defined overO, this enables to compute the
cost of a policy for a given goal even if the goal is imagined after the policy roll-out. Thus,
as IMGEPs typically memorize the population of all executed policies and their outcomes,
this enables reuse of experimentations across multiple goals.
• A Meta-Policy Π : T , C 7→ Θ which is a mechanism to approximately solve the mini-
mization problem Π(τ, c) = arg minθ Cτ (D̃(θ, c)), where D̃ is a running forward model
(approximating D), trained on-line during exploration.
In some applications, a de-facto ensemble of such tools can be used. For example, in the case where
O is an Euclidean space, we can allow the agent to set goals in the Outcome Space T = O, in which
case for every goal τ we can consider a Goal-parameterized cost function Cτ (o) = ‖τ − o‖ where
‖.‖ is a similarity metric. In the case of the Arm-Ball problem, the final position of the ball can be
used as Outcome Space, hence the Euclidean distance between the goal position and the final ball
position at the end of the episode can be used as Goal-parameterized cost function (but one could
equally choose the full trajectories of the ball as outcomes and goals, and an associated similarity
metric).

Algorithmic architecture 2 describes the main steps of Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration
Processes using these tools10:
Bootstrapping phase: Sampling a few policy parameters (called Random Parametrization Explo-
ration, RPE), observing the starting context and the resulting outcome, to initialize a mem-
ory of experiments (H = {(ci, θi, oi)}) and a regressor D̃running approximating the phe-
nomenon dynamics.
Goal exploration phase: Stochastically mixing random policy exploration with goal exploration.
In goal exploration, one first observes the context c and then samples a goal τ using goal
policy γ (this goal policy can be a random stationary distribution, as in experiments below,
or a contextual multi-armed bandit maximizing information gain or competence progress,
see (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013)). Then, a meta-policy algorithm Π is used to search the
parameterization θ minimizing the Goal-parameterized cost function Cτ , i.e. it computes
θ = arg minθ Cτ (D̃running(θ, c)). This process is typically initialized by searching the
parameter θinit in H such that the corresponding cinit is in the neighborhood of c and
Cτ (oinit) is minimized. Then, this initial guess is improved using an optimization algo-
rithm (e.g. L-BFGS) over the regressor D̃running. The resulting policy θ is executed, and
the outcome o is observed. The observation (c, θ, o) is then used to updateH and D̃running.
This procedure has been experimentally shown to enable sample efficient exploration in high-
dimensional continuous action robotic setups, enabling in turn to learn repertoires of skills in com-
plex physical setups with object manipulations using tools (Forestier & Oudeyer, 2016; Forestier
et al., 2017) or soft deformable objects (Nguyen & Oudeyer, 2014).
Nevertheless, two issues arise when it comes to using these algorithms in real-life setups, and within
a fully autonomous learning approach. First, there are many real world cases where providing an
Outcome Space (in which to make observations and sample goals, so this is also the Goal Space)
to the agent is difficult, since the designer may not himself understand well the space that the robot
is learning about. The approach taken until now (Forestier et al., 2017), was to create an external
program which extracted information out of images, such as tracking all objects positions. This
information was presented to the agent as a point in [0, 1]n, which was hence considered as an Out-
come Space. In such complex environments, the designer may not know what is actually feasible
or not for the robot, and the Outcome space may contain many unfeasible goals. This is the rea-
son why advanced mechanisms for sampling goals and discovering which ones are actually feasible
have been designed (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013; Forestier et al., 2017). Second, a system where the
engineer designs the representation of an Outcome Space space is limited in its autonomy. A ques-
tion arising from this is: can we design a mechanism that allows the agent to construct an Outcome
Space that leads to efficient exploration by the mean of examples? Representation Learning meth-
ods, in particular Deep Learning algorithms, constitute a natural approach to this problem as it has
shown outstanding performances in learning representations for images. In the next two sections,
we present an update of the IMGEP architecture that includes a goal space representation learning
stage, as well as various Deep Representation Learning algorithms tested: Autoencoders along with
their more recent Variational counter-parts.
2.2 UNSUPERVISED GOAL REPRESENTATION LEARNING FOR IMGEP
In order to enable goal space representation learning within the IMGEP framework, we propose
to add a first stage of unsupervised perceptual learning (called UGL) before the goal exploration
stage, leading to the new IMGEP-UGL architecture described in Algorithmic Architecture 1. In
the passive perceptual learning stage (UGL, lines 2-8), the learner passively observes the unknown
phenomenon by collecting samples xi of raw sensor values as the world changes. The architecture
is neutral with regards to how these world changes are produced, but as argued in the introduction,
one can see them as coming from actions of other agents in the environment. Then, this database
of xi observations is used to train an unsupervised learning algorithm (e.g. VAE, Isomap) to learn
an embedding function R̃ which maps the high-dimensional raw sensor observations onto a lower-

be implemented in multiple ways, for e.g. depending on which regression or meta-policy algorithms are imple-
mented

dimensional representation o. Also, a kernel density estimator KDE estimates the distribution
pkde(o) of observed world changes projected in the embedding. Then, in the goal exploration stage
(lines 9-26), this lower-dimensional representation o is used as the outcome and goal space, and
the distribution pkde(o) is used as a stochastic goal policy, within a standard IMGEP process (see
above).

2.3 REPRESENTATION LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND DENSITY ESTIMATION FOR THE UGL
STAGE
As IMGEP-UGL is an algorithmic architecture, it can be implemented with several algorithmic
variants depending on which unsupervised learning algorithm is used in the UGL phase. We experi-
mented over different deep and classical Representation Learning algorithms for the UGL phase. We
rapidly outline these algorithms here. For a more in-depth introduction to those models, the reader
can refer to Appendix B which contains details on the derivations of the different Cost Functions
and Architectures of the Deep Neural Networks based models.

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2018
Auto-Encoders (AEs) are a particular type of Feed-Forward Neural Networks that were intro-
duced in the early hours of neural networks (Bourlard & Kamp, 1988). They are trained to output
a reconstruction x̃ of the input vector x of dimension D, through a representation layer of size
d < D. They can be trained in an unsupervised manner using a large dataset of unlabeled samples
D = {x(i)}i∈{0...N}. Their main interest lies in their ability to model the statistical regularities
existing in the data. Indeed, during training, the network learns the regularities allowing to encode
most of the information existing in the input in a more compact representation. Put differently, AEs
can be seen as learning a non-linear compression for data coming from an unknown distribution.
Those models can be trained using different algorithms, the most simple being Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD), to minimize a loss function J (D) that penalizes differences between x̃ and x for
all samples in D.
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are a recent alternative to classic AEs (Rezende et al., 2014;
Kingma & Ba, 2015), that can be seen as an extension to a stochastic encoding. The argument
underlying this model is slightly more involved than the simple approach taken for AEs, and relies on
a statistical standpoint presented in Appendix B. In practice, this model simplifies to an architecture
very similar to an AE, differing only in the fact that the encoder fθ outputs the parameters µ and
σ of a multivariate Gaussian distribution N (µ, diag(σ2)) with diagonal covariance matrix, from
which the representation z is sampled. Moreover, an extra term is added to the Cost Function, to
condition the distribution of z in the representation space. Under the restriction that a factorial
Gaussian is used, the neural network can be made fully differentiable thanks to a reparameterization
trick, making it possible to use SGD for training.
In practice VAEs tend to yield smooth representations of the data, and are faster to converge than
AEs from our experiments. Despite these interesting properties, the derivation of the actual cost
function relies mostly on the assumption that the factors can be described by a factorial Gaussian
distribution. This hypothesis can be largely erroneous, for example if one of the factors is periodic,
multi-modal, or discrete. In practice our experiments showed that even if training could converge
for non-Gaussian factors, it tends to be slower and to yield poorly conditioned representations.
Normalizing Flow proposes a way to overcome this restriction on distribution, by allowing more
expressive ones (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015). It uses the classic rule of change of variables for
random variables, which states that considering a random variable z0 ∼ q(z0), and an invertible
transformation t : Rd 7→ Rd, if z = t(z0) then q(z) = q(z0)|det ∂t/∂z0|−1. Using this, we can
chain multiple transformations t1, t2, . . . , tK to produce a new random variable zK = tK ◦ · · · ◦
t2 ◦ t1(z0). One particularly interesting transformation is the Radial Flow, which allows to radially
contract and expand a distribution as can be seen in Figure 5 in Appendix. This transformation
seems to give the required flexibility to encode periodic factors.
Isomap is a classical approach of Multi-Dimensional Scaling (Kruskal, 1964) a procedure allow-
ing to embed a set of N -dimensional points in a n dimensional space, with N > n, minimizing the
Kruskal Stress, which measures the distortion induced by the embedding in the pairwise Euclidean
distances. This algorithm results in an embedding whose pairwise distances are roughly the same as
in the initial space. Isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000) goes further by assuming that the data lies in
the vicinity of a lower dimensional manifold. Hence, it replaces the pairwise Euclidean distances in
the input space by an approximate pairwise geodesic distance, computed by the Dijkstra’s Shortest
Path algorithm on a κ nearest-neighbors graph.
Principal Component Analysis is an ubiquitous procedure (Pearson, 1901) which, for a set of
data points, allows to find the orthogonal transformation that yields linearly uncorrelated data. This
transformation is found by taking the principal axis of the covariance matrix of the data, leading to a
representation whose variance is in decreasing order along dimensions. This procedure can be used
to reduce dimensionality, by taking only the first n dimensions of the transformed data.
Estimation of sampling distribution: Since the Outcome Space O was learned by the agent, it
had no prior knowledge of p(o) for o ∈ O. We used a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
(Parzen, 1962; Rosenblatt, 1956) to estimate this distribution from the projection of the images
observed by the agent, into the learned goal space representation. Kernel Density Estimation allows
8

to estimate the continuous density function (cdf) f(o) out of a discrete set of samples {oi}i∈{1,...,n}
drown from distribution p(o). The estimated cdf is computed using the following equation:

with K(·) a kernel function and H a bandwidth d × d matrix (d the dimension of O). In our case,

3 EXPERIMENTS
We conducted experiments to address the following questions in the context of two simulated envi-
ronments:
• Is it possible for an IMGEP-UGL implementation to produce a Goal Space representa-
tion yielding an exploration dynamics as efficient as the dynamics produced by an IMGEP
implementation using engineered goal space representations? Here, the dynamics of ex-
ploration is measured through the KL Coverage defined thereafter.
• What is the impact of the target embedding dimensionality provided to these algorithms?
• Are there differences in exploration dynamics when one uses different unsupervised learn-
ing algorithms (Isomap-KDE, PCA-KDE, AE-KDE, VAE-KDE, VAE-GP, RFVAE-GP,
RFVAE-KDE) as various UGL component of IMGEP-UGL?
We now present in depth the experimental campaign we performed11.
Environments: We experimented on two different Simulated Environments derived from the
Arm-Ball benchmark represented in Figure 1, namely the Arm-Ball and the Arm-Arrow environ-
ments, in which a 7-joint arm, controlled by a 21 continuous dimension Dynamic Movement Primi-
tives (DMP) (Ijspeert et al., 2013) controller, evolves in an environment containing an object it can
handle and move around in the scene. In the case of IMGEP-UGL learners, the scene is perceived
as a 70x70 pixel image. For the UGL phase, we used the following mechanism to generate the dis-
tribution of samples xi: the object was moved randomly uniformly over [−1, 1]2 for ArmBall, and
over [−1, 1]2 × [0, 2π] for ArmArrow, and the corresponding images were generated and provided
as an observable sample to IMGEP-UGL learners. Note that the physically reachable space (i.e. the
largest space the arm can move the object to) is the disk centered on 0 and of radius 1: this means
that the distribution of object movements observed by the learner is slightly larger than the actual
space of moves that learners can produce themselves (and learners have no knowledge of which
subspace corresponds to physically feasible outcomes). The environments are presented in depth in
Appendix C.
Algorithmic Instantiation of the IMGEP-UGL Architecture: We experimented over the fol-
lowing Representation Learning Algorithms for the UGL component: Auto-Encoders with KDE
(RGE-AE), Variational Auto-Encoders with KDE (RGE-VAE), Variational Auto-Encoders using
the associated Gaussian prior for sampling goal instead ofKDE (RGE-VAE-GP), Radial Flow Vari-
ational Auto-Encoders with KDE (RGE-RFVAE), Radial Flow Variational Auto-Encoders using
the associated Gaussian prior for sampling goal (RGE-RFVAE-GP), Isomap (RGE-Isomap) (Tenen-
baum et al., 2000) and Principal Component Analysis (RGE-Isomap).
Regarding the classical IMGEP components, we considered the following elements:
• Context Space C = ∅: In the implemented environments, the initial positions of the arm
and the object were reset at each episode12. Consequently, the context was not observed
nor accounted for by the agent.

rendered 70x70 images used as raw signals representing the end position of the objects for Arm-Ball
(on the center) and Arm-Arrow (on the right) environments. The arm is not visible to learners.
• Parameterization Space Θ = [0, 1]21: During the experiments, we used DMP controllers
as parameterized policies to generate time-bounded motor actions sequences. Since the
DMP controller was parameterized by 3 basis functions for each joint of the arm (7), the
parameterization of the controller was represented by a point in [0, 1]3×7.
• Outcome Space O ⊂ Rl: The Outcome Space is the subspace of Rl spanned by the em-
bedding representations of the ensemble of images observed in the first phase of learning.
For the RGE-EFR algorithm, l = 2 in ArmBall and l = 3 in ArmArrow. For IMGEP-
UGL algorithms, as the representation learning algorithms used in the UGL stage require
a parameter specifying the maximum dimensionality of the target embedding, we consid-
ered two cases in experiments: 1) l = 10, which is 5 times larger than the true manifold
dimension for ArmBall, and 3.3 times larger for ArmArrow (the algorithm is not supposed
to know this, so testing the performance with larger embedding dimension is key); 2) l = 2
for ArmBall, and l = 3 for ArmArrow, which is the same dimensionality as the true di-
mensions of these manifolds.
• Goal Space T = O : The Goal Space was taken to equate the Outcome Space.
• Goal-Parameterized Cost function Cτ (·) = ‖τ − · ‖2 : Sampling goals in the Outcome
Space allows us to use the Euclidean distance as Goal-parameterized cost function.
Considering those elements, we used the instantiation of the IMGEP architecture represented in
Appendix D in Algorithm 3. We implemented a goal sampling strategy known as Random Goal
Exploration (RGE), which consists, given a stationary distribution over the Outcome Space p(o),
in sampling a random goal o ∼ p(o) each time (note that this stationary distribution p(o) is learnt
in the UGL stage for IMGEP-UGL implementations). We used a simple k-neighbors regressor to
implement the running forward model D̃, and the Meta-Policy mechanism consisted in returning
the nearest achieved outcome in the outcome space, and taking the same parameterization perturbed
by an exploration noise (which has proved to be a very strong baseline in IMGEP architectures in
previous works (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013; Forestier & Oudeyer, 2016)).
Exploration Performance Measure: In this article, the central property we are interested in is
the dynamics and quality of exploration of the outcome space, characterizing the evolution of the
distribution of discovered outcomes, i.e. the diversity of effects that the learner discovers how to
produce. In order to characterize this exploration dynamics quantitatively, we monitored a measure
which we refer to as Kullback-Leibler Coverage (KLC). At a given point in time during exploration,
this measure computes the KL-divergence between the distribution of the outcomes produced so
far, with a uniform distribution of outcomes in the space of physically possible outcomes (which
is known by the experimenter, but unknown by the learner). To compute it, we use a normalized
histogram of the explored outcomes, with 30 bins per dimension, which we refer to as E, and we
compute its Kullback Leibler Divergence with the normalized histogram of attainable points which

we refer to as A:
KLC = DKL[E‖A] =
30∑
i=1
E(i) log
E(i)
A(i)
.
We emphasize that, when computed against a uniform distribution, the KLC measure is a proxy for
the (opposite) Entropy of the E distribution. Nevertheless, we prefer to keep it under the divergence
form, as theA distribution allows to define what the experimenter considers to be a good exploration
distribution. In the case of this study, we consider a uniform distribution of explored locations over
the attainable domain, to be the best exploration distribution achievable.
Baseline algorithms: We are using two natural baseline algorithms for evaluating the exploration
dynamics of our IMGEP-UGL algorithmic implementations :
• Random Goal Exploration with Engineered Features Representations (RGE-EFR):
This is an IMGEP implementation using a goal/outcome space with handcrafted features
that directly encode the underlying structure of environments: for Arm-Ball, this is the
2D position of the ball in [0, 1]2, and for Arm-Arrow this is the 2D position and the 1D
orientation of the arrow in [0, 1]3. This algorithm is also given the prior knowledge of
p(o) = U(O). All other aspects of the IMGEP (regressor, meta-policy, other parameters)
are identical to IMGEP-UGL implementations. This algorithm is known to provide highly
efficient exploration dynamics in these environments (Forestier & Oudeyer, 2016).
• Random Parameterization Exploration (RPE): The Random Parameterization Explo-
ration approach does not use an Outcome Space, nor a Goal Policy, and only samples a
random parameterization θ ∼ U(Θ) at each episode. We expected this algorithm to lower
bound the performances of our novel architecture.
4 RESULTS
We first study the exploration dynamics of all IMGEP-UGL algorithms, comparing them to the
baselines and among themselves. Then, we study specifically the impact of the target embedding
dimension (latent space) for the UGL implementations, by observing what exploration dynamics is
produced in two cases:
• Using a target dimension larger than the true dimension (l = 10)
• Providing the true embedding dimension to the UGL implementations (l = 2, 3)
Finally, we specifically study RGE-VAE, using the intrinsic Gaussian prior of these algorithms to
replace the KDE estimator of p(O) in the UGL part.
Exploration Performances: In Figure 2, we can see the evolution of the KLC through exploration
epochs (one exploration epoch is defined as one experimentation/roll-out of a parameter θ). We can
see that for both environments, and all values of latent spaces, all IMGEP-UGL algorithms, except
RGE-RFVAE, achieve similar or better performance (both in terms of asymptotic KLC and speed
to reach it) than the RGE-EFR algorithm using engineered Goal Space features, and much better
performance than the RPE algorithm.
Figure 3 (see also Figure 8 and 9 in Appendix) show details of the evolution of discovered outcomes
in ArmBall (final ball positions after the end of a policy roll-out) and corresponding KLC measures
for individual runs with various algorithms. It also shows the evolution of the number of times
learners managed to move the ball, which is considered in the KLC measure but not easily visible in
the displayed set of outcomes in Figure 3. For instance, we observe that both RPE (Figure 3(a)) and
RGE-RFVAE (Figure 3(c)) algorithms perform poorly: they discover very few policies moving the
ball at all (pink curves), and these discovered ball moves cover only a small part of the physically
possible outcome space. On the contrary, both RGE-EFR (handcrafted features) and RGE-VAE
(learned goal space representation with VAE) perform very well, and the KLC of RGE-VAE is even
better than the KLC of RGE-EFR, due to the fact that RGE-VAE has discovered more policies
(around 2400) that move the ball than RGE-EFR (around 1600, pink curve).

Figure 2: KL Coverage through epochs for different algorithms on ArmBall and ArmArrow envi-
ronments. The exploration performance was assessed for both an over-complete representation (10
latent dimensions), and a complete representation (2 and 3 latent dimensions). The shaded area
represent a 90% confidence interval estimated from 5 run of the different algorithms.
Impact of target latent space size in IMGEP-UGL algorithms On the ArmBall problem, we
observe that if one provides the true target embedding dimension (l = 2) to IMGEP-UGL imple-
mentations, RGE-Isomap is slightly improving (getting quasi-identical to RGE-EFR), RGE-AE does
not change (remains quasi-identical to RGE-EFR), but the performance of RGE-PCA and RGE-VAE
is degraded. For ArmArrow, the effect is similar: IMGEP-UGL algorithms with a larger target em-
bedding dimension (l = 10) than the true dimensionality all perform better than RGE-EFR (except
RGE-RFVAE which is worse in all cases), while when l = 2 only RGE-VAE is significantly better
than RGE-EFR. In Appendix F, more examples of exploration curves with attached exploration scat-
ters are shown. For most example runs, increasing the target embedding dimension enables learners
to discover more policies moving the ball and, in these cases, the discovered outcomes are more
concentrated towards the external boundary of the discus of physically possible outcomes. This
behavior, where increasing the target embedding dimension improves the KLC while biasing the
discovered outcome towards the boundary the feasible goals, can be understood as a consequence
of the following well-known general property of IMGEPs: if goals are sampled outside the convex
hull of outcomes already discovered, this has the side-effect of biasing exploration towards poli-
cies that will produce outcomes beyond this convex hull (until the boundary of feasible outcomes is
reached). Here, as observations in the UGL phase were generated by uniformly moving the objects
on the square [−1, 1]2, while the feasible outcome space was the smaller discus of radius 1, goal
sampling happened in a distribution of outcomes larger than the feasible outcome space. As one
increases the embedding space dimensionality, the ratio between the volume of the corresponding
hyper-cube and hyper-discus increases, in turn increasing the probability to sample goals outside the
feasible space, which has the side effect of fostering the discovery of novel outcomes and biasing
exploration towards the boundaries.

The curves show the mean and standard deviation over 5 independent runs of each condition.
Impact of Sampling Kernel Density Estimation Another factor impacting the exploration as-
sessed during our experiments was the importance of the distribution used as stationary Goal Policy.
If, in most cases, the representation algorithm gives no particular prior knowledge of p(o), in the
case of Variational Auto-Encoders, it is assumed in the derivation that p(o) = N (0, I). Hence,
the isotropic Gaussian distribution is a better candidate stationary Goal Policy than Kernel Density
Estimation. Figure 4 shows a comparison between exploration performances achieved with RGE-
VAE using a KDE distribution or an isotropic Gaussian as Goal Policy. The performance is not
significantly different from the isotropic Gaussian case. Our experiments showed that convergence
on the KL term of the loss can be more or less quick depending on the initialization. Since we used
a number of iterations as stopping criterion for training (based on early experiments), we found that
sometimes, at stop, the divergence was still pretty high despite achieving a low reconstruction error.
In those cases the representation was not be perfectly matching an isotropic Gaussian, which could
lead to a goal sampling bias when using the isotropic Gaussian Goal Policy.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a new Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration architecture with Unsu-
pervised Learning of Goal spaces (IMGEP-UGL). Here, the Outcome Space (also used as Goal
Space) representation is learned using passive observations of world changes through low-level
raw sensors (e.g. movements of objects caused by another agent and perceived at the pixel level).
Within the perspective of research on Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration started a decade ago
(Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007; Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013), and considering the fundamental problem of
how AI agents can autonomously explore environments and skills by setting their own goals, this
new architecture constitutes a milestone as it is to our knowledge the first goal exploration architec-
ture where the goal space representation is learned, as opposed to hand-crafted.
14

Furthermore, we have shown in two simulated environments (involving a high-dimensional contin-
uous action arm) that this new architecture can be successfully implemented using multiple kinds of
unsupervised learning algorithms, including recent advanced deep neural network algorithms like
Variational Auto-Encoders. This flexibility opens the possibility to benefit from future advances
in unsupervised representation learning research. Yet, our experiments have shown that all algo-
rithms we tried (except RGE-RFVAE) can compete with an IMGEP implementation using engi-
neered feature representations. We also showed, in the context of our test environments, that provid-
ing to IMGEP-UGL algorithms a target embedding dimension larger than the true dimensionality of
the phenomenon can be beneficial through leveraging exploration dynamics properties of IMGEPs.
Though we must investigate more systematically the extent of this effect, this is encouraging from
an autonomous learning perspective, as one should not assume that the learner initially knows the
target dimensionality.
Limits and future work. The experiments presented here were limited to a fairly restricted set of
environments. Experimenting over a larger set of environments would improve our understanding of
IMGEP-UGL algorithms in general. In particular, a potential challenge is to consider environments
where multiple objects/entities can be independently controlled, or where some objects/entities are
not controllable (e.g. animate entities). In these cases, previous work on IMGEPs has shown that
random Goal Policies should be either replaced by modular Goal Policies (considering a modular
goal space representation, see Forestier et al. (2017)), or by active Goal Policies which adaptively
focus the sampling of goals in subregions of the Goal Space where the competence progress is max-
imal (Baranes & Oudeyer, 2013). For learning modular representations of Goal Spaces, an inter-
esting avenue of investigations could be the use of the Independently Controllable Factors approach
proposed in (Thomas et al., 2017).
Finally, in this paper, we only studied a learning scenario where representation learning happens
first in a passive perceptual learning stage, and is then fixed during a second stage of autonomous
goal exploration. While this was here motivated both by analogies to infant development and to
facilitate evaluation, the ability to incrementally and jointly learn an outcome space representation
and explore the world is a stimulating topic for future work.

The cost functions used to train the different Deep Representation Learning algorithms used in this
paper can be motivated by a few theoretical arguments summarized below.
Auto-Encoders (AEs) The choice of the cost function can be motivated by considering the net-
work as composed of:
• An encoder network parameterized by weights θ that maps an input x to its deterministic
representation z = fθ(x).
• A decoder network parameterized by weights φ that maps a representation z to a vector ξ
parameterizing a distribution pξ(x|z) with ξ = gφ(z).
Under this stochastic decoding assumption, the Maximum Likelihood principle is used to train the
model, i.e. AEs can maximize the likelihood of data under the model. In the case of Auto-Encoders,
this principle is compatible with gradient descent, and we can use the negative log-likelihood as a
cost function to be minimized. If input x is binary valued, p(x|z) is assumed to follow a multivariate

with ξ(i) = gφ(fθ(x(i))). For a binary valued input vector x(i), the unitary Cost Function to mini-
mize is:
J (θ, φ,x(i)) = −
D∑
d=1
[
x

d log(gφ(fθ(x
(i)))d) + (1− x(i)d ) log(1− gφ(fθ(x
(i)))d)
]
, (4)
provided that fθ is the encoder part of the architecture and gφ is the decoding part of the architecture.
This Cost Function can be minimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (Bottou, 1998), or more
advanced optimizers such as Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) or Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015).
Depending on the depth of the network14, those architectures can prove difficult to train using vanilla
Stochastic Gradient Descent. A particularly successful procedure to overcome this difficulty is to
greedily train each pairs of encoding-decoding layers and stacking those to sequentially form the
complete network. This procedure, known as stacked AEs, accelerates convergence. But it has
shown bad results with our problem, and thus was discarded for the sake of clarity.
Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) If we assume that the observed data are realizations of a
random variable x ∼ p(x|ψ), we can hypothesize that they are conditioned by a random vector
of independent factors z ∼ p(z|ψ). In this setting, learning the model would amount to searching
the parameters ψ of both distributions. We might use the same principle of maximum likelihood as
before to find the best parameters by computing the likelihood logL(D) =
∑N
i=1 log p(x
(i)|ψ) by
using the fact that p(x|ψ) =
∫
p(x, z|ψ)dz =
∫
p(x|z, ψ)p(z|ψ)dz. Unfortunately, in most cases,
this integral is intractable and cannot be approximated by Monte-Carlo sampling in reasonable time.
To overcome this problem, we can introduce an arbitrary distribution q(z|x, χ) and remark that the
following holds:
log p(x|ψ) = L(q, ψ) + DKL[q(z|x, χ)‖p(z|x, ψ), (5)
with the Evidence Lower Bound being:
L(q, ψ) = Ez∼q(z|x,ψ)[log p(x|z, ψ)]︸ ︷︷ ︸
a
−DKL[q(z|x, χ)‖p(z, ψ)]︸ ︷︷ ︸
b
. (6)
Looking at Equation (5), we can see that since the KL divergence is non-negative, L(q, ψ) ≤
log p(x|ψ) − DKL([q(z|x, χ)‖p(z|x, ψ)] whatever the q distribution, hence the name of Evidence
Lower Bound (ELBO). Consequently, maximizing the ELBO have the effect to maximize the log
likelihood, while minimizing the KL-Divergence between the approximate q(z|x) distribution, and
the true unknown posterior p(z|x, ψ). The approach taken by VAEs is to learn the parameters of
both conditional distributions p(x|z, ψ) and q(z|x, χ) as non-linear functions. Under some restricted
conditions, Equation (6) can be turned into a valid cost function to train a neural network. First,
we hypothesize that q(z|x, χ) and p(z|ψ) follow Multivariate Gaussian distributions with diagonal
covariances, which allows us to compute the b term in closed form. Second, using the Gaussian
assumption on q, we can reparameterize the inner sampling operation by z = µ + σ2  ε with
ε ∼ N (0, I). Using this trick, the Path-wise Derivative estimator can be used for the a member
of the ELBO. Under those conditions, and assuming that p(x|ψ) follows a Multivariate Bernouilli
distribution, we can write the cost function used to train the neural network as:
J (ψ, χ,x(i)) =− 1

13This requires that the output layer uses a sigmoid function which restricts the values of output to [0, 1].

where fχ represents the encoding and sampling part of the architecture and gψ represents the decod-
ing part of the architecture. In essence, this derivation simplifies to the initial cost function used in
AEs augmented by a term penalizing the divergence between q(z|x, χ) and the assumed prior that
p(x|ψ) = N (0, I).
Normalizing Flow overcomes the problem stated earlier, by permitting more expressive prior
distributions (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015). It is based on the classic rule of change of variables
for random variables. Considering a random variable z0 ∼ q(z0), and an invertible transformation
t : Rd 7→ Rd, if z = t(z0), then:
q(z) = q(z0)
∣∣∣∣ det ∂t−1∂z0
∣∣∣∣ = q(z0)∣∣∣∣det ∂t∂z0
∣∣∣∣−1. (8)
We can then directly chain different invertible transformations t1, t2, . . . , tK to produce a new ran-
dom variable zK = tK ◦ · · · ◦ t2 ◦ t1(z0). In this case, we have:
log q(zk) = log
(

∣∣∣∣det ∂tk∂zk−1
∣∣∣∣−1) = log q(z0)− K∑
k=1
log
∣∣∣∣ det ∂tk∂zk−1
∣∣∣∣. (9)
This formulation is interesting because the Law Of The Unconscious Statistician allows us to com-
pute expectations over q(zk) without having a precise knowledge of it:
Ezk∼q(zk)[h(zk)] = Ez0∼q(z0)[h(tk ◦ . . . t2 ◦ t1(z0))], (10)
provided that h does not depends on q(zk). Using this principle on the ELBO allows us to derive
the following:
L(q, θ, φ) =Ez0∼q(z0|x)[log p(x|tK ◦ . . . t2 ◦ t1(z0))]
−DKL[q(z0|x)‖p(z0)]
+2Ez0∼q(z0|x)
[ K∑
k=1
log
∣∣∣∣det ∂tk∂zk−1
∣∣∣∣]
(11)
This is nothing more than the regular ELBO with an additional term concerning the log-determinant
of the transformations. In practice, as before, we use p(z0) = N (z0;0, I), and q(z0|x) =
N (z0;µ(x), diag(σ(x)2)). We only have to find out parameterized transformations t, whose pa-
rameters can be learned and have a defined log-determinant. Using radial flow, which is expressed
as:
t(z) = z + βh(α, r)(z− c), (12)
where r = |z − c|, h(α, r) = 1α+r and α, β, c are learnable parameters of the transformation, our
cost function can be written as:
J (ψ, χ,x(i)) =− 1

provided that fχ represents the encoding, sampling ad transforming part of the architecture, gψ
represents the decoding part of the architecture, and βk, αk, ck are the parameters of the different
transformations. Other types of transformations have been proposed lately. The Householder flow
(Tomczak & Welling, 2016) is a volume preserving transformation, meaning that its log determinant
equals 1, with the consequence that it can be used with no modifications of the loss function. A
more convoluted type of transformations based on a masked autoregressive auto-encoder, the Inverse
Autoregressive Flow, was proposed in Kingma & Welling (2013). We did not explore those two last
approaches.

C EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENTS
The following environments were considered:
• Arm-Ball: A 7 joints arm, controlled in angular position, can move around in an envi-
ronment containing a ball. The environment state is perceived visually as a 50x50 pixels
image. The arm has a sticky arm tip: if the tip of the arm touches the ball, the ball sticks to
the arm until the end of the movement. The underlying state of the environment is hence
parameterized by two bounded continuous factors which represent the coordinates of the
ball. A situation can be sampled by the experimenter by taking a random point in [0, 1]2.
• Arm-Arrow: The same arm can manipulate an arrow in a plane, an arrow being consid-
ered as an object with a single symmetry that can be oriented in space. Consequently, the
underlying state of the environment is parameterized by two bounded continuous factors
representing the coordinates of the arrow , and one periodic continuous factor representing
its orientation. A particular situation can hence be sampled by taking a random point in
[0, 1]3.
The physical situations were represented by small 70x70 images very similar to the dSprites dataset
proposed by Higgins et al. (2016)15. The arm was not depicted in the field of view of the (virtual)
camera used to gather images for representation learning. We used a robotic arm composed of 7
joints, whose motions were parameterized by DMPs using 3 basis functions (hence action policies
have 21 continuous parameters), during 50 time-steps. An example of such a DMP executed in
the environment is represented in Figure 6. The first phase, where the learner observes changes of
the environment (= ball moves) caused by another agent, is modeled by a process which samples
iteratively a random state in the underlying state space, e.g. in the case of Arm-Ball s ∼ U([0, 1]2),
and then generating the corresponding image x = f(s) that is observed by the learner.

E DETAILS OF NEURAL ARCHITECTURES
Fig. 7 shows the neural networks architectures used for Deep Representation Learning algorithms.
Those architectures are based on the one proposed in Higgins et al. (2016).
Auto-Encoder The architecture was trained directly without particular stacking. The AdaGrad
optimizer was used, with initial learning rate of 1e− 3, with batches of size 100, until convergence
at 2e5 epochs.
Variational Auto-Encoder The architecture was trained with a deterministic warm-up of 1e4
epochs, as proposed in Sonderby et al. (2016), which shows improved convergence rate. The Adam
optimizer was used, with initial learning rate of 1e− 3, with batches of size 100, until convergence
at 1e5 epochs.
Radial Flow Variational Auto-Encoder The architecture was trained with a deterministic warm-
up of 1e4 epochs. The complete flow was made out of 10 planar flows as proposed in Rezende &
Mohamed (2015), whose parameters were learned by the encoder. The Adam optimizer was used,
with initial learning rate of 1e− 3, with batches of size 100, until convergence at 5e4 epochs.

Running title: Exploration of Extraterrestrial Mission Data
Abstract
This paper discusses data pertaining to space
missions to astronomical bodies beyond earth. The
analyses provide summarizing facts and graphs obtained
by mining data about (1) missions launched by all
countries that go to the moon and planets, and (2) Earth
satellites obtained from a Union of Concerned Scientists
(UCS) dataset and lists of publically available satellite
data.
Introduction
The ultimate goal of this research project is to
search for quantitative trends that describe humankind’s
advancement in the physical exploration of
extraterrestrial bodies. The objective of the research
described here is to perform preliminary, yet critical,
steps toward that ultimate goal. Specifically, we seek to
identify sources of data about space exploration
missions, extract pertinent facts about the great majority
of missions rather than a sampling of missions, and
perform exploratory analyses on the extracted facts to
better understand the data and domain. We seek data on
all missions rather than just a representative subset
because the total number of missions is manageable – in
the hundreds for missions to extraterrestrial bodies and
in the thousands for missions into orbit around Earth.
There are a number of aspects to space exploration.
One is the science – how the universe works and what is
happening in distant stars and galaxies, and even the far
reaches of the observable universe. One traditional
approach to measuring scientific progress is paper and
citation counts. While such counts clearly measure
activity, they don’t necessarily accurately reflect the
amount of advancement in human knowledge, and
indeed, it is not clear how to accurately do this in a
quantitative way. Advances in knowledge are often
unique and differ in important ways, and thus are hard
to compare in terms of quantitative amount of progress.
Which is a bigger advance, for example, special
relativity or Newtonian mechanics, and by how great a
percentage? From the standpoint of actual travel to
extraterrestrial bodies, the science – perhaps in some
ways unfortunately – becomes secondary to the fact of
getting there. A mission that lands on the moon for the
primary purpose of competition with other countries (as
was the case between the US and the Soviet Union
during the “space race” period) lands on the moon as
much as one that successfully executes a mission
intended to squeeze every ounce of science possible out
of a moon landing.
To summarize, the four main objectives of this
research, including both overarching and specific to this
paper, are as follows:
1. identify quantitative trend lines that permit
extrapolations predictive of future human space
exploration activity;
2. identify sources of data to support item 1 above;
3. develop a data set that covers much of or most
relevant activities rather than relying on a
sampling strategy; and
4. do exploratory mining of the dataset.
Background
The performance of space exploration technology
must be understood, first, by collecting data from which
the performance can be extracted. Data collection and
analysis is an intrinsic part of the space exploration
endeavor in multiple ways. Big data has become a high
profile term as well as field of both research and practice
in recent years. Space science and technology is no
exception. NASA, for example, has numerous projects
that relate to handling and analyzing big data (Savaram
2017). One of the high profile missions, the Pluto
contact of 2016, provided a special challenge in getting
all the data that was acquired downloaded to Earth over
the several light hours of distance required (Stockton

2016). Space, after all, does not support high bandwidth
commercial data trunks. Stefano et al. (2017) address
the data storage and management part of the problem
with an IT platform, Eodataservice.org, designed for
space mission data needs.
Focusing on technical performance over time, one
approach is to focus on “bang for the buck,” that is,
amount of the technology per dollar. This is the
“Carlson curve” approach commonly used in measuring
technical performance over time of biotechnology
(NHGRI 2017). Wright’s (1936) law used this approach.
For space exploration, costs tend to be high and cost-
per-performance is generally an important engineering
issue. For example Cordova and Gonzalez (2017)
analyze NASA’s “Faster, Better, Cheaper” program,
which focused on this aspect but was deemed not
successful. Thus, for a country to have a space program,
it must be willing to spend the necessary funds. Luxton
(2016) presents lists of countries that spend significant
money on space exploration. Unfortunately the figures
are just for one year. Expenditures are not necessarily
easily available for all years, thus enhancing the interest
of non-monetary measures for which the data might be
easier to obtain. Multi-year data on space related
financials is provided by Bryce (2017). However the
data is limited to startup investment, which while it
captures an important part of the space funding picture
that is often proposed as auguring a transition to
commercial development of space related industry, does
not capture the overall picture of space funding in
general or, more specifically, space exploration per
dollar.
Due in part to the difficulties associated with
obtaining the data to measure technical performance per
dollar for space exploration, pursuing measures that rely
on performance without reference to costs is a natural
strategy. With respect to space exploration data,
Eshbach and Hathaway (2014) provide an online service
showing how many people are in space at the current
time. As of the moment of this writing, the web page
lists six names, their mission roles, and how many days
each has been in space. Duffy (2015) assesses 2015 as a
banner year for space exploration.
To get at trends over time it is necessary to obtain
data and provide assessments spanning time. Hicks
(2015), focusing on crewed missions, concludes that
“It’s sad that human space exploration has stalled.”
Oukaci (2017) argues that space exploration is slowing.
Bardi (2015) is even more pessimistic, suggesting that
“… human spaceflight is coming to an end” and
providing a graph of human space flights 1960–2014 to
illustrate his fears. Technologies often develop in an
exponential fashion. Although it is early enough that the
data regarding space exploration does not yet lead to
definitive conclusions, Adams (2015) provides a graph
and blames the lack of commercial use of space as a
specific reason for why space exploration has not yet
demonstrated a clear case of exponential development.
Arguing that a pessimistic assessment of
advancement in space exploration is not warranted,
Roberts (2011) describes how progress is proceeding in
multiple ways that, while genuine, do not jump out from
much commonly tabulated data. Flo422 [sic] (2017)
charts the number of people launched into space per
year, 1961–2016. Elliott (2014) plots the population of
space over time; the “collapsed view” mode clearly
suggests a trend of increasing human population of
space over time. In previous work in our lab we
identified a model for measuring space exploration
activity. This model was tested only on NASA data, and
with that limitation in mind the model nevertheless
suggests generally increasing technical performance
(Hall et al. 2017).
To understand human space exploration, it is
necessary to analyze the data available on space
missions. Data from NASA (2018) is an integral part of
a larger whole that incorporates data about the space
missions of all countries. McDowell (2017) accounts for
satellite launches worldwide. The Union of Concerned
Scientists (UCS 2017) maintains a catalog of currently
active satellites. Space exploration seems to appeal to
enough Wikipedians (mostly volunteer editors) that
Wikipedia’s information is kept up to date and has
reasonable coverage of satellite activity (Category
2018), general space mission lists broken out by year
(Timeline 2018), and many related listings. The dream
of human exploration of extraterrestrial bodies remains
before our eyes, tantalizing the imagination with its
potential (Berleant 2017).

Missions to extraterrestrial bodies
For the next several figures, missions in which
spacecraft were sent to extraterrestrial bodies were
recorded. Missions were scored according to the type of
contact made with the destination body. The scoring
assigned 2 points to a launch failure, 3 to a distant flyby,
6 to a close flyby, 9 to orbiting the destination, 12 to a
hard (destructive) landing, 12 to a return to Earth, 15 to
a soft landing, 17 to a crewed mission, and 18 to a
mission with a robotic rover. This represents an
adjustment to the values used in Hall et al. (2017). Many
missions qualified for multiple categories, and were

assigned to the score of the highest-scoring category for
which it qualified. The scores of the missions launched
in a particular year were summed, and the % of the sum
that was attributable to various countries was calculated
and graphed from year to year.
Figure 1 shows the % of the summed scores of
missions for each year attributable to US launched
missions.
Figure 1. Percentage of missions launched by USA.
Figure 1 was plotted by using moving averages to
smooth out yearly fluctuations in the data. The value for
a given year was calculated by averaging the raw values
of that year and the four previous years. The graph
reached its maximum in the year 2003.
Figure 2 shows the data for the Soviet Union and its
successor state Russia. From the graph we can observe
that there is a major contribution from the USSR/Russia
in the initial years. Later the contribution falls rapidly
and remains low thereafter.
Figure 2. Percentage of missions launched by USSR/Russia.
Figure 3 shows the situation for Japan. Compared to
the US and the USSR/Russia, Japan has zero
contribution initially, then ramps up a space program
that makes significant contributions to the world’s
exploration of extraterrestrial bodies.
Figure 4 shows the relative activity of China. We
can observe that China started exploring astronomical
bodies relatively late but has been increasing its share of
missions on a generally increasing trajectory.

Figure 5 shows the situation for European-launched
missions. Europe did not contribute to launching
missions to astronomical bodies at first. More recently
Europe has been a significant contributor to such
missions.

The next graph, Figure 6, shows the smoothed
percentages for India.
It is possible that with efforts such as SpaceX, the
costs of lifting mass into space will be reduced and this
might lead to more launches in the coming years.

Satellites
Extraterrestrial bodies are only one category of
space mission. Another category is satellites, of which
the vast majority are around the Earth. These satellites
are one variety of humankind’s expansion into outer
space. Satellites gather data that is otherwise
unobtainable, provide services such as GPS and radio
transmission that are not otherwise possible or
economic, and form an important portion of our space
exploration activity. This subsection provides some
analyses of satellite data.
Purpose is a key column in the Earth satellite dataset
used by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS 2017)
that we downloaded for analysis. Figure 7 shows a facet
chart that we developed to show the satellite launches
by year, differentiated by the purpose of the satellite, for
satellites that were operational as of 9/1/2017. The chart
shows growth in communication satellites over time,
and growth in Earth observation satellites starting a bit
later. Following that, there was a gradual increase in
technology development satellites. Space science shows
steady growth in recent years. Technology development
satellites launches very late in the timeline compared to
Communication satellites or Earth observation
satellites. The differences in the timing of the increases
in these categories is of interest as it permits comparing
the categories over time. Overall, communication
satellites have constituted the largest category of Earth
satellite launches. What are the implications of these
observations? One may hypothesize that these trends
reflect trends in underlying need by society for satellites
with those purposes.
Another data element in Earth satellite dataset we
analyzed (UCS 2017) is the launch site. A histogram
chart was developed for active Earth satellite counts by
launch site. Figure 8 shows that the highest number of
currently active Earth satellites were launched from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome.

Figure 8. Active satellites by launch site.
Obviously, the Baikonur Cosmodrome is one of the
world’s largest and most active space facilities. The
chart shows that Baikonur Cosmodrome leads with 254
launches of active (as of 9/1/2017) satellites, followed
by other launch sites, notably Guiana Space Center,
Cape Canaveral, and Vandenberg Air Force Base. The
Guiana Space Center is in French Guiana and began
operating in 1968. Reasons for the location include
being near the equator, so that the spinning Earth gives
launches a faster boost thus minimizing the energy
needed to launch into space. Also, sea east of the
spaceport provides a measure of safety in that launch
debris has a place to fall without endangering people on
land. French Guiana is in South America and is a part of
France.
Apogee and perigee distances are two of the data
elements regarding satellites in the McDowell (2018)
dataset. A scatter plot of average apogee vs. average
perigee for Earth satellites was developed using that
data. Note that apogee and perigee (peri- is from Greek
and means near) may be defined as follows.
 Apogee: that point in an orbit at which the orbiting
body is furthest from the center of the orbit.
 Perigee: that point in an orbit at which the orbiting
body is closest to the center of the orbit.
Figure 9 shows that the average apogee and perigee
of satellites in orbit has increased over time. Most of the
satellites have an apogee significantly greater than the
perigee. Furthermore, the larger apogees and perigees
tend to be associated with newer satellites.
Patterns in data on perigee and apogee were further
studied using the k-means clustering algorithm on the
UCS (2017) dataset. Figure 10 uses 2 clusters to identify
similarities in the data. Color depicts the purpose of the
satellite. The graph shows that all the earth observation
satellites are grouped at a relatively close distance and
communication satellites are grouped at further
distances. The graph shows a pattern of most of the
Earth/Space Science, Navigation/Global Position and
Earth science satellites located centrally on the chart.
Cluster 2 does not contain any the Earth/Space Science,
Navigation/Global Position or Earth science satellites.
Figure 9. Apogee vs. perigee for Earth satellites. (Color coding is
viewable on a computer display.)
Figure 10. Clustering of satellites on the basis of their orbital
distances.
McDowell (2018) provides a lengthy compendium
of basic data on satellite launches worldwide. Satellite
launch data were extracted from the web site, cleaned,
and analyzed. Figure 11 shows some of these results.
These data indicate that the fraction of satellites that are
successfully launched into orbit, out of all satellite
launches, has tended to improve over time. This is a
positive trend.
Figure 11 shows a spike around 1998. The Union of
Concerned Scientists (UCS 2017) dataset was analyzed
to better understand it. Figure 12 resulted, showing a

corresponding spike. A closer investigation of the data
revealed that the spike was due to communication
satellites launched between 1997 and 1999. While the
data do not explain why, these visualizations do
highlight the fact that it occurred, thus suggesting an
exploration of the “why?” question.
Figure 11. Total satellite launches and successful satellite launches.
Another analysis is shown in Figure 13. Different
countries have different numbers of satellites in orbit. A
comparison of operating (as of 9/1/2017) Earth satellites
owned by different countries was done using the Union
of Concerned Scientists (UCS 2017) dataset. A
histogram chart was developed showing country vs.
number of operating satellites. Figure 13 shows that the
highest number of Earth satellites in orbit are owned by
the US with a count of 786, followed by China at 203.
Russia has a count of 138. The chart shows total 81
countries involved in the satellite launches. Overall, it
seems like many countries have satellites but still have
a long way to go to catch up with the US.
Discussion
There are several possible goals for mining space
mission data. These fit into two broad categories:
understanding what has been accomplished (the past),
and understanding what is possible (the future).
Goals related to the past focus on historical
understanding. These include the following.
 The reasons, results, and social effects of the space
race between the US and USSR decades ago. For
example, there was a burst of early space
exploration activity early on known as the “Space
Race.” The degree of activity was higher than
expected given the longer term trajectory of more
gradual progress in space exploration. That level of
activity was not sustained, because once people
landed on the Moon the race seemed to have been
“won,” as though space exploration was akin to a
sports contest, and having been “won” it lost some
of its attraction and thus US government funding
decreased.
 The satellite infrastructure, its effects on
communication, and the effects of the
communication thus enabled on the evolution of the
current world order. Unlike most space related
activities, satellites have a lot of commercial and
other practical applications. This has driven much
of the satellite construction and launching activity,
a force that does not apply to other space
exploration mission types such as those to distant
planets.

 The effects of long-standing popular cultural
interests on large national science and engineering
efforts. This is evidenced by the differences in
efforts made to travel to extraterrestrial bodies with
historically strong ties to popular consciousness and
imagination like Mars (Crossley 2011), compared
with efforts to travel to bodies with weaker such
ties.
 The experimental testing of laws that govern and
describe trends in technological performance.
Exponential and similar trends are examples. Less
quantitative examples include effects of population,
societal wealth, and previous technologies on
technological advancement. Historical data can be
used to test if such a proposed law has held in the
past.
In contrast to understanding the past, goals related
to understanding the future use data about the past for
predictive purposes. These purposes include the
following.
 Technology forecasting of future space exploration.
If a trend can be quantified based on historical data,
it could be extrapolated to make predictions about
future levels of space exploration activity.
 Technology foresight of likely scenarios of future
space exploration. The future will always be fraught
with uncertainty. The concept of foresight is
distinguished from forecasting in that it is about
determining future possibilities rather than
predicting which one will occur. Because of the
inherent uncertainty about the future, foresight is a
reasonable approach to understanding the future of
space exploration.
 Insight into effective national or corporate policy
options for future space exploration efforts. Interest
in the future of space exploration (or other
technologies) is not just about what will eventually
happen. There is instead the possibility of affecting
that future. There are always reasons to pursue
certain futures over others. Understanding and
evaluating different scenarios leads naturally to
efforts to make the most desirable ones happen.
Conclusions and Future Work
We have collected data and performed exploratory
analyses. The ultimate goal, however, is to see if we can
extract an overarching trend that will permit
understanding of likely future levels of space
exploration. Such a trend would be analogous to
Moore’s law for computer chips and other exponential
curves describing technical performance over time for
various technologies.
A trend curve, by definition, can be extrapolated to
make predictions about the future because it shows a
trend. Such predictions are testable by checking if the
predictions hold when the data finally becomes
available. On the other hand, a curve from which no
extrapolatable trend can be determined provides little

basis for projection and thus does not support
technology forecasting. Thus for forecasting purposes a
curve that shows a trend is better.
How can a trend curve be found? First, there must
be an underlying trend in order for a valid trend curve to
exist and be found. This is a modeling problem. Satellite
launches and visits to extraterrestrial bodies, which we
analyzed herein, are obvious candidates for model
components. It is not clear however if those components
are sufficient. Other components that might need to be
accounted for are the following.
 The International Space Station. The space station
is not an astronautical body and, while a satellite, is
a much bigger part of the whole space exploration
picture than an ordinary satellite. Most astronauts
currently go there, for example. If it were not for the
existence of the International Space Station (ISS),
perhaps other exploration activity would be done
instead. Activities related to the ISS have
constituted a significant portion of space
exploration during the period of existence of the
ISS.
 The US Space Shuttle program. Like the ISS, the US
Space Shuttle program made up a significant
fraction of the overall space exploration effort, but
is not represented adequately when focusing on
satellites or interplanetary missions. Data (e.g.
Catlett 2004) exists that may support including the
Space Shuttle program in a model of space
exploration.
To properly model space exploration activity,
various parameters must be defined. For example, does
a trip to the moon count less than a trip to Mars? By how
much? Also different types of contact with the
destination need to be distinguished. For example, a soft
landing with a rover and a return trip should presumably
count more than a flyby. We have done this in an ad hoc
manner as described earlier. A principled approach to
inferring these numbers would be better, but it is not
clear what is the best way to do it.
One approach to the parameter tuning problem
posed by the foregoing paragraph is to seek parameter
values that result in a space exploration trend curve that
is relatively smooth and extrapolatable. But is
determining parameter values that way fair? Here, in a
nutshell, are the “no” and “yes” arguments.
 No, it is not fair. The counterargument to choosing
parameters that result in an extrapolatable curve is
simply that it looks too much like an attempt to force
fit the data to a curve. It appears to be the dual of the
overfitting problem in machine learning: instead of
finding an overly complicated curve that fits data
that might in fact be more noise than signal, this
approach involves finding a complicated
transformation of the data values to fit a simple
curve.
 Yes, it is fair. A set of parameter values that results
in an extrapolatable curve is not, in itself, a claim
that the curve is a valid model for space exploration
activity over time. As just discussed it might be no
more than a force fit of the data with no predictive
value for future years. On the other hand, it might
turn out to have the desired predictive ability, and
thus be part of a useful model. Only time can tell
which possibility applies, but one thing that can be
known immediately is that the parameter values
form a hypothesis. This hypothesis will be tested by
future events. If future events follow the resulting
curve’s extrapolation, that is corroborating evidence
for the hypothesis (i.e., the model and its parameter
values). If future events do not comply with the
extrapolation, that is evidence against the
hypothesis.
Different sets of parameter weights would provide
different hypotheses, and these each can be tested
against future events. If a set of parameter weights can
be justified by domain facts and historical context, the
hypothesis embodied by that set of weights gains
explanatory heft as well. Ultimately a model of
advancement in space exploration over time may be
derived that, like the exponential and other laws shown
to be useful with various other technologies, will be
shown to predict future levels of space exploration
activity.
