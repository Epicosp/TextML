1. INTRODUCTION 
N-Queen problem is a problem in computer science that is not solvable using traditional algorithms. 
In N-Queen problem, N number of queens have to be placed on a chess board of N rows and N columns.  
The Queens must be placed such that no two queens should clash each other. So in every row and every 
column the challenge is to place only one queen. In N-queen problem some constraints have to be satisfied, 
so N-queen problem is also known as constraint satisfaction problem. It consists of some variables, some 
values to these variables and some constraints that are to be satisfied. Figure 1 shows a sample solution of 8 
Queen problem. Q1,Q2,Q3 are queens placed on the chess board.  
The N Queen problem has many applications in science and engineering. It can be used to solve 
problems in real time computer systems, error correction and detection, designing of communication systems, 
designing of VLSI circuits, resource management in computer systems, testing of VLSI circuits, scheduling 
of tasks in   operating system, solving routing problems in computer networks, balancing of load on different 
microprocessors in computers, parallel processing in optics, controlling traffic, data and image compression, 
storage of memory parallel, prevention of deadlocks in operating system, assignment of tasks and many 
more.  In recent years many researchers try to solve N-queen problem. 
N-queen problem can be solved using backtracking algorithm. In recent years many authors are 
working on solution of N-queen problem and its various applications in science and engineering [1]-[4]. In 
literature efforts have been made to solve N-queen problem using metaheuristic techniques such as Genetic 
Algorithm GA, Ant Colony Optimization ACO, Particle Swarm Optimization PSO, Simulated Annealing SA 
etc. [5]-[7]. [8], [9] Vinod Jain and Jay Shankar Prasad apply genetic algorithm to solve Travelling Salesman 
problem and found better results for it. These efforts try to solving N-queen problem for smaller values of N. 
In [10] author improves the performance of solving N-queen problem by using multi core processors. Author

N-queen problem using a modified genetic algorithm. Author found that the improved Genetic Algorithm

2. RESEARCH METHOD  
In this work new genetic algorithm is proposed to solve N-Queen problem. The proposed AGA 
algorithm is differing than the other Genetic Algorithm while applying its advanced mutation operation. 
The mutation operation does some accidental changes in the population. This step is performed after cross 
over operation. In this work those part of the chromosomes is mutated which are producing clashes with 
other queens. This the mutation operation reduces the clashes in a chromosome and improves the fitness of 
that chromosome. A set of newly mutated chromosomes are generated and added in the population just like 
the cross over operation.  
Let chr-1 is a chromosome of 10-Queen problem. In the list positions of Queens in different 
columns (from 0-9) are given in chr-1(Chromosome-1).  
Chromosome before removing column clash is (Chr-1) 
3     6     1     8     0     5     4     2     5     9: 
Clash Count=10  
The number of queens which are having clashes with other queens are 10.   
A queen position which is producing clashes if found and queen at that location is swapped with other queen.  
Queen at position 5 is replaced with 7. So the chromosome after mutation is: 
 3     6     1     8     0     7     4     2     5     9  
Clash Count=4 
The mutated chromosome has only 4 clashes. Thus this advance mutation operation is removing 
clashes very quickly and thus finding the solution in less time. The proposed genetic algorithm with 
Advanced Mutation Operation is as follows:  
Proposed Algorithm  
1. Create initial population of chromosomes 
2. Find fitness of current population 
3. If stopping criteria reached, then stop otherwise continue 
4. Perfrom natural selection  
5. Perform cross over and generate new children 
6. Add newly generated children in current population  
7. Find fitness of current population

8. Sort the chromosomes by decreasing order of the fitness 
9. Generate next population 
10. Apply proposed mutation 
11. Go to Step-3. 
 
 
3. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS  
The proposed genetic algorithm is implemented in JAVA. Results are calculated in terms of 
execution time of the proposed genetic algorithm to solve different instances of N-queen problem. The 
algorithm is applied on two instances of N-queen problem having 8 and 50 queens. The obtained results are 
shown in Table 1. The results are compared with other algorithm to solve N-queen problem. The table shows 
that the results obtained by this proposed algorithm are better for almost all the instances of N-queen 
problem.

algorithm obtained results in less time as compared to other existing algorithm. It can be concluded from the

4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE 
N-queen problem can be solved using genetic algorithm. The proposed genetic algorithm uses a fast 
mutation operator that solves many instances of N-queen problem in quick time. So the proposed genetic 
algorithm is better than the other existing algorithms. In future the proposed algorithm can be applied to  
N-queen problem has large number of Queens (i.e.  No of queens>500). The proposed algorithm can be 
further optimized to produce results more quickly. In future other genetic operators such as selection and 
cross over can be modified to solve the problem faster.

Biodiesel has huge potentials as a green and technologically feasible alternative to fossil diesel. However, biodiesel production 
from edible oil crops has been widely criticized while nonedible oil plants are associated with some serious disadvantages, such 
as high cost, low oil yield, and unsuitable oil composition. The next generation sequencing (NGS), omics technologies, and 
genetic engineering have opened new paths toward achieving high performance-oil plants varieties for commercial biodiesel 
production. The intent of the present review paper is to review and critically discuss the recent genetic and metabolic engineering 
strategies developed to overcome the shortcoming faced in nonedible plants, including Jatropha curcas and Camelina sativa, as 
emerging platforms for biodiesel production. These strategies have been looked into three different categories. Through the first 
strategy aimed at enhancing oil content, the key genes involved in triacylglycerols (TAGs) biosynthesis pathway (e.g.,
diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), and glycerol‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1)), 
genes affecting seed size and plant growth (e.g., transcription factors (WRI1), auxin response factor 19 (ARF19),  leafy 
cotyledon1 (LEC1), purple acid phosphatase 2 (PAP2), G-protein c subunit 3 (AGG3), and flowering locus T (FT)), as well as
genes involved in TAGs degradation (e.g., sugar-dependent protein 1 triacylglycerol lipase (SDP1)) have been deliberated. 
While through the second strategy targeting enhanced oil composition, suppression of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of 
linoleic acids (e.g., fatty acid desaturase (FAD2), fatty acid elongase (FAE1), acyl-ACP thioesterase (FATB), and ketoacyl-ACP 
synthase II (KASII)), suppression of the genes encoding toxic metabolites (curcin precursor and casbene synthase (JcCASA)), 
and finally, engineering the genes responsible for the production of unusual TAGs (e.g., Acetyl-TAGs and hydroxylated fatty 
acids (HFA)) have been debated. In addition to those, enhancing tolerance to biotic (pest and disease) and abiotic (drought, 
salinity, freezing, and heavy metals) stresses as another important genetic engineering strategy to facilitate the cultivation of 
nonedible oil plants under conditions unsuitable for food crops has been addressed. Finally, the challenges faced prior to 
successful commercialization of the resultant GM oil plants such have been presented.

1. Introduction 
 
Based on recent predictions, the world population will significantly increase 
up to 9 billion people by the year 2050. This will cause further rapid increases 
in energy demands, significant decreases in the global fossil fuel reserves, and 
the intensification of the global environmental challenges such as global 
warming and climate change due to increased emission of greenhouse gasses 
(GHG). Given the diminishing sources of fossil fuels as well as the non-
renewable and unsustainable nature of these fuels, it is necessary to find 
alternative sources of energy. In fact, seeking renewable energies with less 
GHG emissions and air pollution capacity is of importance at global level 
(OECD, 2012). Among different renewable platforms, biomass-based energy 
production has attracted a great deal of attention because of the huge quantity 
of biomass (e.g., plants and residues) produced globally and the potentials it 
holds to mitigate the harmful environmental impacts associated with fossil fuels 
(Tabatabaei et al., 2011; Salehi Jouzani and Taherzadeh, 2015; Selim, 2015; 
Zahed et al., 2016).  
Among various biomass-oriented fuels, biodiesel has been considered to 
have great potentials as a green and technologically-feasible alternative to fossil 
diesel fuels. Biodiesel is derived from plant seed oils and animal fats and is a 
mixture of the alkyl esters if long chain fatty acids, mainly produced by 
transesterification methodology. The physico-chemical properties of biodiesel 
are very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and therefore, could be used as an 
alternative to diesel in conventional diesel engines without the need for any 
modifications. Other advantages of biodiesel include higher cetane number, 
flash point and lubricity, absence of sulfur, and lower aromatics content 
compared to the petroleum diesel (Demirbas, 2009; Tabatabaei et al., 2011; 
Axelsson et al., 2012; Lee and Lavoie, 2012) 
Biodiesel is mostly produced from the edible oils, i.e., soybean, canola, 
rapeseed, palm, etc. (Hegde et al., 2015; Taher and Al-Zuhair, 2017). However, 
the application of such oil crops as feedstock for biodiesel production is 
associated with negative impacts on global food security, especially in the 
developing world suffering from vulnerable economy and agriculture. On the 
other hand, given such unfavorable effects on the price of food commodities 
and consequently food security, biodiesel production from food-grade 
feedstock may not be quite economically feasible either. Therefore, nonedible 
oils, animal waste fats, and used vegetable oils have been used for biodiesel 
production. The most important nonedible oil plants with high potentials for 
biodiesel production include physic nut (Jatropha curcas), Camelina 
(Camelina sativa), castor beans (Ricinus communis L.), neem (Azadirachta 
indica A.), karanja (Pongamia pinnata L.), mahua (Madhuca spp.), simarouba 
(Simarouba glauca DC.) and cheura (Diploknema butyracea). However, 
current oil yields from these plants are in general insufficient to meet the 
bioenergy demands, while the resultant oils are characterized with trace salts, 
water, and high free fatty acid contents. Thus, genetic improvements to enhance 
their oil yield and properties has attracted a considerable deal of attention 
(Alaba et al., 2016; del Pilar Rodriguez et al., 2016).  
During the last decades, different plant breeding strategies have been used 
to improve oil yield and quality and to also improve tolerance to biotic and 
abiotic stresses in edible and nonedible oil plants. New biotechnological tools 
such as marker-aided selection, next generation sequencing, “omics” 
technologies, and genetic engineering have accelerated the breeding process for 
such traits in these kinds of plants. Identification and isolation of major genes 
involved in the lipid biosynthesis pathways using omics technologies and their 
transfer to edible and no-edible oil plants are expected to result in economical 
oil production in such plants as feedstock for biodiesel production (Grover et 
al., 2013). Different genetic engineering strategies aimed at changing the 
structure of the enzymes as well as overexpression or silencing of the genes 
involved in the oil production pathway have been used to enhance oil yield and 
quality in nonedible oil plants. In this article, recent advances in the field of 
plant genetic engineering for improving oil production in biofuel crops and in 
particular in tow of the most promising non-edible plants, i.e., Jatropha and 
Camelina are reviewed and discussed. Moreover, the challenges faced and the 
future prospects of these strategies in improving biodiesel production are 
presented. 
     
2. Plant breeding strategies to enhance oil production in biofuel crops 
 
To achieve commercial biodiesel production from nonedible oil plants, 
development of new varieties/hybrids of oil plants with high oil contents, 
tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and no toxic proteins is a critical 
step. During the last decades, different breeding strategies have been used 
to improve these traits in edible and nonedible oil plants. The main 
activities pursued in plant breeding include developing variation, selection, 
evaluation for target traits, multiplication, and finally, release and 
distribution of new varieties (Fig. 1). Commonly, creation of genetic 
variation is performed through domestication, germplasm collection, 
introduction, intra- and inter-species hybridization, mutation, polyploidy, 
somaclonal variation, germaclonal variation, and genetic engineering 
(Singh and Nimbkar, 2006; Singh et al., 2015; Moniruzzaman et al., 2016). 
During the last decades, using conventional breeding strategies, different 
edible and nonedible oil plants have been improved to enhance oil quality, 
oil yield, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses (Golkar, 2014; 
Merkouropoulos et al., 2016; Montes and Melchinger, 2016; Valliyodan et 
al., 2017). In spite of such successful experiences, these methods face some 
disadvantages, such as being laborious and time-consuming, low accuracy 
in achieving desired traits, impossibility of inter-species hybridizations and 
wild crosses.  
Recent developments in next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) 
have encouraged rapid development of bioenergy crops. Different new 
“omics” technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and 
metagenomics), marker-aided selection (MAS) and genetic engineering 
approaches have been considered and are widely used as the most 
promising solutions to improve agronomic traits in bioenergy oil plants. 
“Omics” technologies could be used to identify genes involved in oil 
production, to discover oil production pathways, and also to improve oil 
content and composition. To facilitate such efforts, whole genomes of some 
oil plants including soybean (Schmutz et al., 2010), rapeseed  (Wang et al., 
2011), sunflower (Staton et al., 2012),  Arabidopsis (Cao et al., 2012), 
castor bean (Chan et al., 2010),  Jatropha  (Sato et al., 2011; Wu et al., 
2015), Pará rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) (Rahman et al., 2013), oil palm 
(Elaeis guineensis) (Singh et al., 2013; Pootakham et al., 2015), Asian 
spicebush (Lindera glauca) (Lin et al., 2017),  Camelina  (Mudalkar et al., 
2014), and P. pinnata (Jiang et al., 2017) have been already sequenced. 
Such huge deal of data has opened a new high throughput way to discover 
genes and pathways involved in oil production as well as the genes affecting 
oil quality in these plants. Moreover, by using omics technologies, such as 
quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) and expressed sequence tag (EST)-based molecular markers, cDNA 
libraries, and RNA-seq analysis, researchers could identify and characterize 
genes involved in lipid synthesis pathways, tolerance to biotic and abiotic 
stresses, and the other important traits (Tang et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2011 
and 2017; Tian et al., 2016). 
 
3. TAG biosynthesis pathway and candidate genes for metabolic 
engineering in bioenergy plants 
 
Identification and characterization of the key genes involved in the 
performance of such important agronomical traits are the first critical steps 
for breeding programs in oil crops. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the major 
seed storage lipids and are used as energy and carbon sources during the 
seed germination process. TAG biosynthesis pathway in the higher plants 
seeds is very complex (Fig. 2). Recently, some comprehensive reviews 
have been published presenting more detailed description on this complex 
pathway (Bates and Browse, 2012; Bates et al., 2013; Bansal and Durrett, 
2016).  
The first step of lipid production in plants is fatty acid (FA) synthesis. 
Acetoacetyl- acyl carrier protein (Acetoacetyl-ACP) as a key substrate is 
necessary to initiate the process of FAs biosynthesis. Two enzymes have 
key roles in the conversion of Acetyl-coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA) to 
acetoacetyl-ACP. The first enzyme is acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), 
which catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. 
Subsequently, the second enzyme, i.e., β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III 
(KASIII) catalyzes the conversion of malonyl-ACP to acetoacetyl-ACP. 
Then, two carbon units are added elongating the FA chain through repeated 
condensation, reduction, and dehydration reactions (Sainger et al., 2017). 
Diacylglycerol (DAG) is the immediate precursor molecule for TAG 
biosynthesis. Two main pathways have been identified for DAG 
biosynthesis, which include de novo DAG synthesis (Kennedy pathway) 
and/or   conversion   of   phosphatidylcholine (PC). The   FA  modification

(desaturation, hydroxylation, etc.) occurs only for those FAs which are 
esterified to PC, thus, the FA composition of PC-derived DAG can be 
substantially different from that of de novo DAG. As DAG provides two of the 
three FAs in the TAG structure, the relative flux of TAG synthesis from PC-
derived or de novo DAG can significantly affect the final oil composition 
(Bates et al., 2013; Bansal and Durrett, 2016; Sainger et al., 2017). The TAG 
biosynthesis pathways and the candidate genes which can be used for 
bioengineering to enhance oil yield and quality are summarized in the Figure 
2. 
During the last decades, genetic and metabolic engineering approaches have 
shown huge potentials to accelerate achieving breeding targets for different 
crops (Salehi Jouzani et al., 2008; Safarnejad et al., 2011; Salehi Jouzani, 2012; 
Tohidfar et al., 2013). In this regards, different GM strategies have been used 
to enhance oil yield and oil composition to make oil crops suitable for biodiesel 
production. These include, 1) increasing oil contents as well as seed and fruit 
size, 2) improving oil composition, 3) improving biotic and abiotic tolerance, 
and 4) reduction of toxic metabolites in oil crops. The first strategy is the most 
important methodology in which the genes encoding proteins involved in the 
oil biosynthesis pathways as well as those involved in seed/fruit size and plant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
growth are used as candidate genes. This methodology includes improving 
TAG synthesis by overexpression of the genes involved in the oil 
biosynthesis (such as DGAT, GPD, FatA, and LPAT), inhibition of TAG 
degradation (suppression of the sugar-dependent protein 1 triacylglycerol 
lipase (SDP1)), using different types of transcription factors 
(overexpression of WRI1 transcription factors), and improving 
morphological and developmental traits by expression of  different genes 
encoding auxin response factor 19 (ARF19),  Zea maize leafy cotyledon1 
(LEC1), purple acid phosphatase 2 (AtPAP2), G-protein c subunit 3 
(AGG3), early flowering (flowering locus T (JcFT)), and photo respiratory 
bypass bacterial genes (GDH, GLC, and TRS) (Table 1).  
Improvement of seed oil content through engineering of lipid 
biosynthetic pathways is known as the simplest and the most efficientgeneti 
engineeringstrategy to enhance economically-feasible oil production in 
nonedible plants (Hegde et al., 2015). For instance, DAG acyltransferase 
gene (DGAT) encodes a salient enzyme, which is involved in TAG 
biosynthesis, and has an important role during oil production in plants. The 
conversion of DAG and free fatty acids to TAG is catalyzed by DGAT 
during  the  storage   oil   synthesis (Andrianov et al., 2010; Chhikara et al.,

2017). This gene has been transferred to other plants, including Camelina, 
maize, tobacco, potato, and rapeseed, and could significantly increase oil 
contents of these plants (Table 1) (Weselake et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008; 
Andrianov et al., 2010; Vanhercke et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2016; Chhikara et 
al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017). Moreover, expression of the genes encoding fatty 
acyl acyl carrier thioesterase A (FatA), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GPD), and lysophosphatidyl-acyltransferases (LPAT) have improved the 
pathway of oil production, and thus, could be considered as key genes to 
improve oil contents in bioenergy plants (Singh et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017). 
Each TAG commonly contain three fatty acid chains which are esterified to a 
glycerol backbone, and hence, the overexpression of the genes, such as that of 
glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, involved in glycerol-3-phosphate 
biosynthesis, could result in enhanced TAG biosynthesis (Akashi and 
Nanasato, 2018). Vigeolas et al. (2007) could significantly increase (up to 40%) 
the oil content of canola seeds by overexpression of a yeast glycerol‐3‐
phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GPD1). Inhibition of TAG degradation in oil 
crops seeds is known as another strategy to enhance TAG abundance in lipid 
storage tissues. Sugar-dependent protein 1 triacylglycerol lipase (SDP1), which 
regulates the first step of TAG catabolism, could be a good target for metabolic 
engineering in oil crops (Akashi and Nanasato, 2018). Another method is the 
inhibition of TAG lysis and degradation. It has been previously confirmed that  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the gene SDP1 encodes a patatin-like acyl hydrolase domain (a specific 
lipase), which is involved in the first step of TAG degradation during seed 
germination, and is capable of associating with the surface of the oil bodies 
and other reported PTLs (Eastmond et al., 2006 and 2007). The RNA 
interference (RNAi) technology has also been used to express a homologue 
of the SDP1 in oilseed rape (Brassica napus), which resulted in a significant 
reduction of SDP1 protein expression and subsequently, an increase in oil 
content (Kelly et al., 2013). 
 
In addition to the genes involved
 
in TAG biosynthesis (oil content), 
engineering other genes playing key roles
 
in some agronomical traits, such 
as seed, fruit and leaf size, plant growth and biomass, as well as root 
architecture and vegetative/reproductive transition, have important effects 
on potentials of bioenergy plants as source of biodiesel production (Table 
1) (Jakob et al., 2014; Akashi and Nanasato, 2018). The seed size has an 
important role in oil yield of Jatropha, and therefore, it has been
 
taken into
 
account as the main goal of breeding to enhance oil yields. Recently, a 
candidate gene (CYP78A98) with potentials for increasing
 
seed size, has 
been identified in Jatropha. The expression of this gene in tobacco
 
resulted 
in increased seed size and weight as well as
 
protein and fatty acid contents 
(Tian et al., 2016).

A suitable oil for biodiesel production should have a high oxidative stability, 
less polyunsaturated fatty acids, and low viscosity under low temperatures. 
Thus, high contents of monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic and palmitoleic 
acids) and low contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid) are 
suitable for biodiesel production. For instance, 16- to 18-carbon fatty acids ratio 
has a direct impact on the quality of biodiesel and on its combustion 
performance. Since the optimal FA composition of the raw oil used in the 
biodiesel production process is critical to achieve good acceptance by both 
customers and vehicle manufactures, thus, improvement of desirable 
physicochemical properties of oil by engineering of oil composition is  also  an 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 important research target. Different GM methodologies have been used  to 
enhance oil composition and quality in oil plants (Ciubota-Rosie et al., 
2013; Sainger et al., 2017). This involves, 1) increase of oleic acid content 
by down regulation of either fatty acid desaturase  2 (FAD2), Acyl-ACP 
thioesterase (FATB), or fatty acid elongase 1 (FAE1) genes, 2) expression 
of the genes encoding medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) by expression of 
FatB or suppression of KASII (ketoacyl-ACP synthase II), 3) production of 
omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acids by expression of plastidial desaturase 
with extraplastidial 16:0∆9 desaturases, and/or suppression of KASII 
elongase, 4)  production  of    hydroxylated   fatty   acids   (HFAs),  and  5)

reduction of toxins and inhibitors such as curcin and phorbol ester in seeds and 
oil by suppression of such genes (Table 2).  
Since oleic acid (C18:1) which is a monounsaturated acyl chain with high 
cetane value, low melting point, and high resistance to oxidation, thus, it is a 
preferred component in TAGs (Akashi and Nanasato, 2018).  Suppression of 
FATB and FAD2 genes in different oil crops using RNAi or CRISPR-Cas9 has 
reportedly resulted in a significant increase of oleic acid in seed oils (Buhr et 
al., 2002; Qu et al., 2012). Commonly, the length of fatty acid chains is 
determined by the plastidial fatty acid synthase enzymes (three β-ketoacyl-acyl 
carrier protein synthases (KASI, II, and III)). Recently, some putative KAS 
genes have been identified and cloned from Jatropha. Expression of such genes 
in Arabidopsis resulted in a significant increase of palmitic acid content as well 
as the 16- to 18-carbon fatty acids ratio (Yu et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2017). It 
was shown that JcKASI-1 and JcKASI-2 exhibit partial functional redundancy 
and play a universal role in regulating fatty acid biosynthesis, growth, and 
development in plants. Other researches have confirmed that species-specific 
fatty acid desaturases (FAD2, FADX, FAH12, etc.), oleocins, and 
phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyl transferase (PDAT) proteins are involved in 
or regulating fatty acid compositions in seeds of Vernicia and Jatropha (Yang 
et al., 2016).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Enhancing tolerance to biotic (pest and diseases) and abiotic (drought, 
salinity, freezing, and heavy metals) stresses to improve yield productivity 
in oil plants is another strategy widely used (Table 3). Abiotic stresses such 
as water deficit, high salinity, high temperature, freezing, and heavy metals 
pollutions are recognized as the most important factors negatively affecting 
plant growth and crop productivity. Therefore, engineering oil plants to 
enhance tolerance to these abiotic stresses could have a tremendous 
potential to expand their cultivation zones to drought-, heat-, and/or 
salinity-affected marginal lands (Akashi and Nanasato, 2018). Different 
genes, such as fatty acid hydroxylase12 (FAH12) (van Erp et al. 2011), 
transcription factors (MYB96) (Lee et al., 2014), phosphopantetheine 
adenylyltransferase (PPAT), the subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor 
(NF-YB), and GSMT/DMT (Tsuchimoto et al., 2012) have been used to 
enhance drought tolerance in oil crops (Table 3).  
 The genes, such as those encoding transcription factors, involved in 
biotic and abiotic stress tolerance are known as other important genes 
affecting oil production in bioenergy plants (Eswaran et al., 2010). These 
genes include the flowering-time-related Dof transcription factor gene 
(Yang et al., 2010), accA, accB1, accC and accD genes encoding the 
subunits   of  heteromeric   ACCase (Gu et al., 2011), stearoyl-acyl   carrier

protein desaturase (SAD) (Tong et al., 2006), which have been previously 
isolated and characterized in J. curcas. Recently, a newly developed microarray 
system has been used to identify genes involved
 
in Jatropha drought tolerance. 
As a result, about 1300 genes contributing to dehydration and/or recovery were 
characterized (Cartagena et al., 2015). 
 
To enhance salinity tolerance, different genes encoding ACC deaminase 
(acdS), vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter (NHX1
 
and GmsSOS1),
 
and AP2/EREBP
 
domain have been expressed in some oil plants including Camelina, Jatropha, 
and Arabidopsis
 
(Table 3) (Tang et al., 2011; Jha et al., 2013; Heydarian et al., 
2016).  Moreover, functionality of transcription factor JcCBF2
 
(a cold
 
response 
transcription factor) and
 
JcDREB
 
(a putative AP2/EREBP domain of DREB 
subfamily) derived from Jatropha, in improving freezing tolerance has been 
confirmed by expression in Arabidopsis
 
(Tang et al.,
 
2011; Wang et al.,
 
2015). 
To enhance heavy metal tolerance, the CsHMA3
 
gene encoding a heavy metal 
P1B-ATPase has been expressed in Camelina
 
(Park et al., 2014
 
and
 
2015). 
 
The Gram-positive aerobic bacterium
 
Bacillus thuringiensis

and PR3),
 
and defensin (PDF1.2) (Nayanakantha et al., 2014), defense regulatory

and hairpin dsRNA (Ye et al., 2014) have been transferred to 
Camelina, soybean,
 
and Jatropha. These successful histories confirm that 
genetic engineering

accelerate the improvement of oil crops for 
biodiesel production (Table 3). To show these
 
potentials, recent advances

4. Genetic engineering of Jatropha
 
to improve
 
oil production capacity
 
 
Jatropha
 
or physic nut, a wild plant belong to Euphorbiaceae,
 
is a 
nonedible biofuel plant with high oil reserves. Jatropha
 
has inherent 
drought tolerance, and therefore,
 
has high potentials
 
to be grown even in 
marginal lands. This provides
 
a major advantage for Jatropha
 
to avoid 
competition with food crops over
 
agricultural lands (King et al., 2009;

Sinha et al., 2016). This plant contains high amounts of qualified oil for 
biodiesel production. Moreover, Jatropha and its biomass/oil can be used as in 
soil improving, hedges, wind protection, soil erosion control, firewood, lamp 
fuel production, soap/paints/lubricants making, and also as a medicinal plant 
due to the production of different pharmacologically-important metabolites and 
substances (Kumar et al., 2015; Castro Gonzáles, 2016; Gudeta, 2016; 
Moniruzzaman et al., 2016; Cartagena, 2017). However, in spite of many 
advantages, such as rapid growth, easy propagation and harvesting, drought 
tolerance, reclaiming different types of land, pest resistance, short gestation 
periods, Jatropha has not been completely domesticated, and there has been 
slow progress in its breeding and use as biodiesel feedstock over the last several 
years due to some limitations and disadvantages associated with Jatropha. 
These include lack of high oil and biomass productive genotypes or commercial 
varieties, lack of genetic diversity, low seed yield due to low female to male 
flower ratio, high viscosity of the Jatropha oil, significant reduction of yield 
under insufficient irrigation and nutrients conditions, long waiting period (3–5 
years) to achieve commercial productivity of the tree, presence of toxins such 
as curcin and toxic phorbol esters, and finally susceptibility to some pest and 
diseases as well as to frost and water logging. Therefore, the breeding 
objectives of Jatropha include improvements of seed yield, oil content, oil 
composition, reduction of toxicity, and enhanced tolerance to biotic and abiotic 
stresses (Brittaine et al., 2010; Divakara et al., 2010; Ceasar and Ignacimuthu, 
2011; Edrisi et al., 2015; Moniruzzaman et al., 2016; Cartagena, 2017).   
To overcome agronomical limitations of Jatropha, recently, many studies 
have been performed aimed at characterizing the genes involved in metabolic 
pathways in Jatropha, while some conventional breeding methods, based on 
phenotypic selection strategies, have also been used to increase the productivity 
of J. curcas, which resulted in new cultivars with improved oil yields. These 
studies have been well reviewed by Cartagena (2017), Moniruzzaman et al. 
(2016), and Montes et al. (2016). Although conventional breeding has shown 
significant positive effects in improving different traits, and resulted in the 
release of new varieties with higher yields and productivity, early maturation, 
resistance to pests and diseases, and tolerance to drought and cold, this 
procedure is laborious and time-consuming, especially for perennial plants such 
as Jatropha (Yue et al., 2013; Montes et al., 2016; Laviola et al., 2017).  
In addition to the conventional breeding strategies, recently, omics-based 
breeding techniques have been widely used to improve agronomical traits of 
Jatropha to enhance economic and sustainable production of biodiesel. These 
include MAS-based and genomic (GS)-based selection using a diverse range 
of molecular tools, such as DNA markers, linkage, and QTL mapping, 
genomics (NGS), proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics (Costa et al., 
2010; King et al., 2011; Eswaran et al., 2012; Yue et al., 2013; Agarwal et al., 
2014; Cartagena et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). The whole genome sequence 
and linkage map of Jatropha have been reported several times during the last 
years. Such information is a very important component in molecular breeding 
and genetic improvement of this plant (Sato et al., 2011; Hirakawa et al., 2012; 
Wu et al., 2015) and could be used as a platform for performing genetic 
engineering procedures on Jatropha to enhance economic biodiesel production 
using this bioenergy plant.     
 
4.1. Tissue culture and transformation optimization 
 
It is clear that efficient application of genetic engineering for Jatropha 
improvement requires elite genotypes with optimized tissue and organ culture 
procedures as well as transformation protocols. Therefore, currently, the 
majority of research works in this field is focused on optimization of tissue 
culture and genetic engineering protocols and also on the identification of genes 
associated with important traits of Jatropha (Jaganath et al., 2014; Yang et al., 
2016; Montes et al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2017). Since 1990, Agrobacterium-
mediated transformation is the most widely used method for transferring the 
genes into plant cells. Li et al. (2008) firstly used Agrobacterium-mediated 
transformation method for transformation of Jatropha. To improve 
transformation efficiency in Jatropha, different strategies such as different 
types of plant tissues (Kumar et al., 2010), modifying the infection process 
(Khemkladngoen et al., 2011; Jaganath et al., 2014), as well as the age of plant 
tissues and the tissue culture methods have been tested as critical factors.  
Agrobacterium-mediated and microprojectile bombardment transformation 
have been developed for Jatropha. For instance, Agrobacteriuim-mediated 
cotyledon disc transformation (Li et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2010), 
Agrobacteriuim-mediated leaf explants transformation (Kumar et al., 2010), 
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using leaf and hypocotyl 
segments (Misra et al., 2012), Agrobacterium-mediated transformation 
using vacuum infiltration and vegetative in vivo cleft grafting method 
without the aid of tissue culture (Jaganath et al., 2014; Nanasato et al., 
2015), and  microprojectile bombardment using embryo axes (Purkayastha  
et al., 2010; Joshi et al., 2011) have been optimized for this purpose. In spite 
of such advances in the related protocols, tissue culture is still regarded as 
one of the major limitations in creating transgenic Jatropha plants 
(Cartagena, 2017). In vivo transformation has been efficiently performed in 
germinating Jatropha seeds (Patade et al., 2014) and plantlets (Jaganath et 
al., 2014). These methods included creating some wounds on the tissues 
prior to Agrobacterium infection. Moreover, a grafting method has also 
been developed to propagate transgenic Jatropha, which resulted in 100% 
genetic stability between mother and grafted plants (Jaganath et al., 2014). 
Furthermore, to reduce environmental and health risks of genetically 
modified (GM) Jatropha plants, some techniques, such as the creation of 
marker-free transgenic plants using the chemical inducible Crelox-
mediated site-specific recombination system, have been developed (Qu et 
al., 2012; Gu et al., 2014). This would reduce the biosafety issues associated 
with GM plants while it also would facilitate the acceptance of transgenic 
Jatropha plants by the public. 
 
4.2. Genetic engineering to enhance oil contents in Jatropha  
 
Engineering the genes attributed to yield parameters (fruit and seed size, 
oil contents, leaf size and numbers, early flowering, fast growing, etc.) is 
taken into account as the most important strategies to improve oil 
production in Jatropha. The genes encoding proteins involved in oil 
biosynthesis or metabolism as well as those involved in transcriptional 
control of these processes are important tools to unfold biotechnological 
enhancement of oil content and quality in Jatropha by direct genetic 
engineering (Ye et al., 2013; Moniruzzaman et al., 2016). Three key 
enzymes, i.e., DGAT, LPAT, and GPD, play important role in lipid 
biosynthesis pathway. However, other enzymes such as carboxyl 
transferase of the ACCase b subunit, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein of 
ACCase, acyl ACP thioesterase A, acyl-CoA binding protein, malonyl-
CoA:ACP transacylase, betaketo acyl ACP synthase II,  3-keto acyl ACP 
reductase, beta-keto acyl ACP synthase I, acyl carrier protein ω-3-fatty acid 
desaturase,  ω-6-fatty acid desaturase, and long chain acyl-CoA synthetase 
are also involved in lipid biosynthesis pathways in Jatropha, and could  be 
promising candidates for oil yield and oil composition engineering 
(Natarajan et al., 2010; Moniruzzaman et al., 2016).  
In an investigation, the gene encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase 
(JcDGAT1), a key enzyme contributing to fatty acids biosynthesis pathway, 
was isolated from Jatropha seeds and was transferred to Arabidopsis. The 
transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed a gradual increase in total oil content 
from early seed development to their maturation (up by 30–41%) without 
any phenotypic changes (Misra et al., 2013). The DGAT1 gene has also 
been transferred to many plants, including Camelina, maize, tobacco, 
potato, and rapeseed, reportedly leading to significant increases in the oil 
contents of these plants (Weselake et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008; 
Andrianov et al., 2010; Vanhercke et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2016; Chhikara 
et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017). Hence, the overexpression of such gene could 
increase oil content in Jatropha as well. Early flowering is a preferred trait 
for Jatropha as a biodiesel feedstock. The flowering locus T (FT) gene is 
one of the central factors playing a crucial role in the transition from 
vegetative phase to flowering. Overexpression of a homolog gene JcFT in 
GM Jatropha resulted in a significant early flowering phenotype (Li et al., 
2014). Moreover, it has been shown that the suppression of SDP1 gene 
resulted in a significant increased oil content in rapeseeds (Kelly et al., 
2013). In a study, Kim et al. (2014) generated JcSDP1 deficiency in 
transgenic Jatropha using the RNAi technology, which resulted in 13 to 
30% higher total seed storage lipid and 7% compensatory decrease in 
protein content (Kim et al., 2014). 
Seed size is a key trait for enhancing oil yield in Jatropha, thus, 
increasing seed size is an opportunity to increase the amount of oil storage 
capacity. Sun et al. (2017) showed that auxin response factor 19 (JcARF19) 
is an effective factor in increasing seed size in J. curcas. They claimed that 
the overexpression of 19 (JcARF19) in two plants, i.e., A. thaliana and J. 
curcas, led to improved seed size. In addition to increasing oil content in

seeds, increasing the number of female flowers and consequently, the number 
of fruits in Jatropha, has been regarded as a solution to increase oil yield in this 
bioenergy plant. For instance, Pan et al. (2016) by treating inflorescence 
meristems of Jatropha could increase fruit number using thidiazuron. 
 
4.3. Genetic engineering for improving oil composition in Jatropha 
 
FAD2 is a key enzyme contributing to linoleic acid biosynthesis in plants. 
Qu et al. (2012) could identify three putative fatty acid desaturase genes in 
Jatropha (JcFAD2s) by using genome wide analysis. Down regulation of 
JcFAD2-1 gene through the expression of its homologue in Jatropha using the 
RNAi technology resulted in significant increases in oleic acid contents (> 
78%) and reduction of the polyunsaturated fatty acids contents (<3%) 
compared with the wild type plants. Another gene involved in the determination 
of oil composition in Jatropha is acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase 
named JcFATB1. This gene increases saturated fatty acids content and in 
particular, palmitate in plant oils (Wu et al., 2009). Therefore, suppression of 
this gene would enhance the production of unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic 
acid.  
 
4.4. Genetic engineering for reduction of toxic metabolites in Jatropha 
 
One of the most important drawbacks of Jatropha for biofuel production is 
the presence of some toxic metabolites such as phorbol esters and curcins (a 
type 1 ribosome inactivating protein) in the seeds. These metabolites are known 
as skin-irritating and cancer-promoting toxins and reduce the nutritional and 
commercial value of seeds and oil obtained from this plant (Gu et al., 2015). 
Thus, reduction of such toxins would significantly enhance oil quality of 
Jatropha. Some research works have successfully used the RNAi technology 
to reduce curcins in Jatropha. Suppression of this gene could reduce the curcin 
up to 98% (Patade et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2015). The cDNA of the gene encoding 
curcin, i.e., curcin2 was obtained from J. curcas leaves (Tong et al., 2007). 
Recently, three curcin genes have been isolated and characterized from J. 
curcas MD44 (Wu et al., 2017). In addition, a specific RNAi technology was 
used to down-regulate a phorbol ester gene (JcCASA: casbene synthase gene). 
This suppression strategy could effectively reduce the gene expression and 
resulted in a final 85% reduction of phorbol esters level in seeds (Li et al., 
2016).  
 
4.5. Genetic engineering to enhance biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in 
Jatropha  
 
Identification, cloning, and transformation of the genes attributed to 
Jatropha tolerance to biotic (diseases and pests) as well as to abiotic stresses 
(e.g., drought, salinity, and cold) is of importance in breeding programs of 
Jatropha. In light of that, other transgenic Jatropha have been developed for 
other agronomic traits, such as salinity tolerance (Jha et al., 2013), drought 
tolerance (Tsuchimoto et al., 2012), pest resistance using B. thuringiensis cry 
genes (Gu et al., 2014), fungal disease resistance (Franco et al., 2016), and 
geminivirus resistance (Ye et al., 2014).   
 
4.5.1. Enhancing biotic stresses tolerance 
 
Jatropha due to the production of some insecticidal and toxic metabolites in 
all its tissues, is not susceptible to the majority of pests and pathogens, however, 
it has been shown that various fungi, viruses, insects, etc. causing serious 
damages of economic significance could attack this plant. These pests include 
35 fungal species, 4 viral and 4 bacterial pathogens, 6 nematodes, and about 60 
insect species (Anitha and Varaprasad, 2012). Thus, performing Jatropha 
breeding programs for pest and diseases resistance is of importance as well. 
The Archips micaceanus (Walker), a moth of the family Tortricidae, is known 
as one of the most important pests of Jatropha. In 2014, a hybrid of cry1Ab and 
cry1Ac genes encoding δ-endotoxin proteins derived from the bacterium B. 
thuringiensis which confers resistance to lepidopteran insects, was expressed 
in Jatropha using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and a chemically 
regulated, Cre/loxP-mediated DNA recombination system (Gu et al., 2014). It 
was reported that the insecticidal bioassays of the GM line of Jatropha resulted 
in 80-100% mortality of larvae of A. micaceanus four days after infestation. 
Recently, to enhance disease resistance in Jatropha, Franco et al. (2016) 
expressed a chitinase gene from the fungus Trichoderma viride into the genome 
of a Jatropha superior genotype by inoculating leaf explants with 
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The results reported could be a 
start point for breeding programs concerning fungal disease resistance in 
Jatropha. 
 
4.5.2. Enhancing abiotic stresses tolerance 
 
Although Jatropha is known as a drought tolerant plant growing in semi- 
arid lands unsuitable for food crops, however, its oil productivity is not 
economic under such stress conditions at the present time. Thus, enhancing 
drought tolerance is of significance toward commercialization of this plant 
as bioenergy plant, and it could contribute to improved oil productivity of 
Jatropha even in semi-arid lands. In an investigation, three kinds of drought 
tolerance transgenic Jatropha plants were generated by Tsuchimoto et al. 
(2012). The GM plants overexpressed the PPAT gene encoding the 
phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (catalyzing the CoA biosynthetic 
pathway); or the NF-YB gene encoding a subunit of the NF-Y transcription 
factor or two GSMT and DMT genes encoding osmolyte betaine 
synthesizing enzymes, including glycine sarcosine dimethylglycine 
methyltransferase and dimethylglycine Nmethyltransferase, respectively 
(Tsuchimoto et al., 2012).  
Salinity is another stress adversely affecting the growth and yield of 
Jatropha. Salt tolerance in plants mainly depends on different 
physiological, biochemical, and molecular adaptations. It is well known 
that antiporters Na+/H+ are important factors involved in plant salt 
tolerance. They help plants to maintain Na+ homeostasis in the cytosol. Ion 
homeostasis is commonly performed either by sequestration of excess 
sodium into the vacuoles via vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporters (NHX1) or by 
active exclusion through Na+/H+ antiporters (SOS1) located on the plasma 
membrane (Apse et al., 1999; Shi et al., 2000). The sbNhx1 gene was 
previously isolated from an extreme halophyte, Salicornia brachiate. The 
gene was expressed in Jatropha to enhance salinity tolerance and the 
resultant GM Jatropha lines showed tolerance to 200 mM NaCl in the 
growth media (Jha et al., 2013).   
 
5. Genetic engineering of Camelina to improve oil production 
  
C. sativa (L.) (gold of pleasure or false flax) is known as a new emerging 
oilseed crop with some advantages such as less water, pesticide, and 
fertilizer requirements compared with the other traditional oilseed crops. 
Camelina is drought and cold tolerant, and therefore, can be used as a 
rotational crop with winter wheat (Ciubota-Rosie et al., 2013). Camelina 
biodiesel has less life cycle energy and less emissions compared with diesel 
fuel, and also in the view of land use change emissions, Camelina biodiesel 
has higher performance compared with that of traditional biodiesel crops 
(Krohn and Fripp, 2012). However, Camelina oil is faced with some 
disadvantages, such as presence of high amounts (> 90%) of long-chain 
(C18 – C22) and unsaturated FAs, which is undesirable for biodiesel and 
jet fuel production, as it could negatively affect biodiesel properties such as 
cetane number, iodine value, and oxidation stability (Hu et al., 2017). Other 
disadvantages are the atmospheric equivalent temperature (AET, 90% 
recovered) and the polyunsaturated (P4 double bonds) methyl ester content. 
Therefore, one of the most important strategies in genetic engineering of 
Camelina is aimed at significantly decreasing its high degree of 
unsaturation and the molecular weight of the oil (Ciubota-Rosie et al., 
2013). In addition to FA composition, other breeding targets for Camelina 
include increasing grain yield and oil content to make the plant more 
competitive to the other well-established oilseeds (Vollmann and Eynck, 
2015). However, as Camelina has a remarkably undifferentiated hexaploid 
genome, all proteins and enzymes could be encoded by up to three similar 
gene homologues making modifying endogenous metabolic fluxes more 
difficult. For instance, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (CsDGAT1), 
microsomal oleate desaturases (CsFAD2), and elongase (CsFAE1) genes 
have three similar copies, which are expressed in developing seeds. 
Fortunately, it has been confirmed that the RNAi yechnology as well as the 
newly developed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technologies have 
tremendous potentials for silencing of target genes, such as all three 
homeologues of FAD2 in Camelina genome (Krohn and Fripp, 2012; 
Bansal and Durrett, 2016; Morineau et al., 2017). Moreover, GM Camelina 
has a low environmental biosafety risks due to its low outcrossing rate, no

intercrossing with other species, and weak weed potential. These collectively 
mark this plant as a suitable platform for genetic engineering programs to 
enhance its feasibility for biodiesel production (Nayanakantha et al., 2014; 
Vollmann and Eynck, 2015). 
 
5.1. Tissue culture optimization for Camelina 
 
Different in vitro culture protocols have been tested and evaluated for 
organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis of Camelina. These protocols have 
been mainly focused on shoot organogenesis and regeneration using cotyledon 
with petiole, hypocotyl segment and leaf explants (Yemets et al., 2013), 
microspore culture (Ferrie and Bethune, 2011), and somatic hybridization 
(Narasimhulu et al., 1994). It has been confirmed that Camelina can be 
efficiently transformed by Agrobacterium-mediated floral-dip methods, and a 
variety of selectable markers (e.g., seed fluorescence and resistance to specific 
herbicides or antibiotics) can be easily used to identify Camelina transgenic 
seeds (Liu et al., 2012; Bansal and Durrett, 2016).  
 
5.2. Improving seed size and oil content in Camelina 
 
Different genetic engineering studies have been performed on Camelina to 
enhance oil yield, oil composition, and abiotic stress tolerance. One drawback 
associated with the application of Camelina as feedstock for biodiesel 
production is low oil contents of the seeds, so one of the most important GM 
strategies is to increase seed oil yields. The enzyme encoded by the gene 
DGAT1 has been identified as one of the most key factors involved in the plant 
oil biosynthesis pathways. Kim et al. (2016) identified and cloned three DGAT1 
genes (i.e., CsDGAT1A, CsDGAT1B, and CsDGAT1C) from developing 
Camelina seeds. Overexpression of CsDGAT1B in Camelina resulted in a 24% 
increase in total seed oils as well as larger embryonic cells and a greater number 
of cells compared with the wild type (Kim et al., 2016). Recently, DGAT1 and 
a yeast cytosolic GPD1 genes have been co-expressed in Camelina under the 
control of seed‐specific promoters. This co-expression resulted in up to 13% 
higher seed oil content and up to 52% increase in seed mass compared with the 
wild‐type plants. The oil harvest index for the GM lines was almost two folds 
higher than the wild type (Chhikara et al., 2017). In another study, the castor 
fatty acid hydroxylase gene was transferred to Camelina through 
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with a vacuum infiltration procedure 
to enhance hydroxyl fatty acid synthesis in the plant. The transgenic seeds 
showed the expression of new castor fatty acid hydroxylase (Krohn and Fripp, 
2012).  
Camelina has small seeds, thus increasing seed size is of importance to 
improve oil content. Enhancing photosynthesis efficiency and increasing the 
carbon flux from photosynthesis into TAG biosynthesis may increase plant 
growth, seed characteristics, and oil content (Enjalbert et al., 2013; Sainger et 
al., 2017). For instance, it has been shown that overexpression of the 
Arabidopsis purple acid phosphatase 2 (AtPAP2) in Camelina resulted in early 
flowering, rapid growth, and enhanced seed yield and size (Zhang et al., 2012). 
Heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G-protein) is very important for plant 
growth and development. Therefore, enhancing the expression of such protein 
may improve seed size and plant growth. Overexpression of Arabidopsis G-
protein c subunit 3 (AGG3) in Camelina reportedly resulted in significant 
increases of photosynthesis efficiency, seed and oil production, stress tolerance, 
fruit number, 1000-seed weight, and seed yield (Choudhury et al., 2014). The 
leafy cotyledon1 (LEC1) is another key protein which regulates embryo 
development and enhances the expression of genes involved in FA 
biosynthesis. Recently, the ZmLEC1 gene, isolated from maize, was 
overexpressed in A. thaliana and C. sativa, and could significantly increase (> 
20%) the oil content in mature seeds of both plants (Zhu et al., 2018). 
Phosphatidycholine (PC) turnover has a crucial function in the process of 
TAGs biosynthesis. Enhancing the expression of phospholipases involved in 
the conversion of PC to free FAs may enhance TAG production. For instance, 
the overexpression of pPLAIIIδ (a patatin-related phospholipase, hydrolyzing 
PC to free FAs and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC)) in Camelina has increased 
seed oil content (Zhang et al., 2012).  Moreover, other strategies, such as 
expression of different photo-respiratory bypass bacterial genes glycolate 
dehydrogenase (GDH) or glyoxylate carboligase (GLC), as well as tartonic 
semialdehyde reductase (TRS) genes in Camelina chloroplast has reportedly 
resulted in reduction of the photo-respiratory carbon loss and the crop cycle (by 
1–2 weeks), and increased the photosynthesis efficiency, plant growth, seed 
yield (50–72%), and nitrogen use efficiency (15%) (Dalal et al., 2015; 
Sainger et al., 2017). In addition, the expression of cyanobacterial 
CO2/HCO-transporters in Camelina could increase CO2 assimilation in leaf 
tissues and seed yields by 20-40 % (Price et al., 2008). Over-expression of 
Arabidopsis WRINKLED 1 (AtWRI1), a transcription factor of 
APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding (AP2/EREBP) in 
Camelina was another strategy, which was used to improve seed size and 
oil content. The resultant GM lines showed a 14% increase in seed mass 
and total seed oil content (An and Suh, 2015).   
 
5.3. Improving oil composition in Camelina seeds 
 
It is well documented that the degree of saturation and length of FAs 
chain in oils could significantly affect fuel properties, such as viscosity, 
combustion quality, ignition delay, and oxidative stability. Therefore, 
improvement of oil composition in Camelina for finer biodiesel is of 
importance. High contents of oleic acid increases biodiesel quality through 
its greater oxidative stability, low cetane number, and better cold-flow 
properties, hence, high oleic content lines of Camelina are of huge interest 
for the biofuel industry (Durrett et al., 2008). New gene silencing 
techniques such as RNAi and CRISPR‐Cas9 genome editing have been 
applied and optimized for Camelina. RNAi suppression of FAD2 and FAE1 
genes have resulted in reduced concentrations of linoleic, linolenic, and 
eicosaenoic acids, whereas oleic acid was accumulated at levels as high as 
66% (Krohn and Fripp, 2012). Recently, targeted mutagenesis for three 
different delta‐12‐desaturase (FAD2) genes was achieved by CRISPR‐Cas9 
gene editing in Camelina. These mutations resulted in reduced levels of 
polyunsaturated fatty acids and increased accumulation of oleic acid in the 
oil. Genetic analysis of the mutants during four generations showed the 
heritability of single, double, and triple mutations in the three 
isologous CsFAD2 genes. Moreover, combinatorial association of different 
alleles for the three FAD2 loci enhanced oleic acid accumulation in the oil 
of the mutant Camelina lines from 10 to 62% (Morineau et al., 2017). In 
another study, the CRISPR/Cas9 was used to target the FAD2 gene in A. 
thaliana and C. sativa to enhance seed oil composition. As a result, 
transgenic Camelina seeds showed a significant increase of oleic acid 
content (16-50% of the fatty acid composition) and significant decreases in 
less desirable polyunsaturated fatty acids content, i.e., linoleic acid (a 
decrease from ~16% to <4%) and linolenic acid (a decrease from ~35% to 
<10%). These traits were stable up to T3 and T4 generation Camelina seeds 
(Jiang et al., 2017).  
The second strategy to optimize oil composition would be the expression 
of genes involved in the biosynthesis of medium-chain FAs (MCFAs, 8:0–
14:0). These kinds of FAs are commonly used as Jet A fuel (Kallio et al., 
2014). In a study, three FatB genes (i.e., CpuFatB3, CvFatB1, and 
CpuFatB4) involved in high accumulation of MCFAs in Cuphea seeds were 
identified. The expression of the FatB genes and coconut LPAT in 
Camelina in single or co-expression form led to accumulation of capric acid 
(10:0), 16:0, myristic acid (14:0), lauric acid (12:0), or 14:0 in Camelina 
seeds. Moreover, RNAi approach has been used for seed specific 
suppression of Camelina KASII which resulted in the reduction of 12:0 but 
enhanced palmitic acid (16:0) and MCFA contents in seeds to mimic Jet A 
fuel composition (Kim et al., 2015). In another study, simultaneous 
expression of a 12:0-acyl-carrier thioesterase gene (UcFATB1) from 
California bay (Umbellularia californica Nutt.) and suppression of the 
Camelina KASII genes by RNAi constructs led to enhanced accumulation 
of three medium-chain saturated FAs, including laurate (C12:0), myristate 
(C14:0), and palmitate (C16:0) in Camelina seed oils (Hu et al., 2017).  
It has been confirmed that ω-7 unsaturated FAs, such as palmitoleic acid 
(16:1Δ9) and vaccenic acid (18:1Δ11), are suitable for biodiesel production 
due to their better cold-flow properties, high oxidative stability, as well as 
reduced NOx emissions and ignition quality. Expression of a plastidial 
enzyme ∆9-16:0-ACP desaturase in Camelina seeds increased ω-7 
unsaturated FAs contents by 2-14%. Co-expression of this plastidial 
desaturase with extraplastidial 16:0∆9 desaturases and suppression of 
KASII elongase resulted in 71% further increase of such FAs (Nguyen et 
al., 2010). In a different investigation, Nguyen et al. (2015) developed a 
named “six transgene strategy” through which they performed the co-
expression of a mutant Δ9-acyl-ACP, an acyl-CoA desaturase, a second Δ 
9-16:0-ACP desaturase transgene, as well as RNAi suppression of KASII 
839

and FatB in Camelina. This GM strategy could significantly increase the 
amount of ω-7 unsaturated FAs to ~60–65% of the total FAs, and significantly 
decreased the amount of total saturated FAs contents by 2-3 folds (Nguyen et 
al., 2015).  
HFAs are rare FAs, commonly seen in castor and lesquerella oil, and are 
used for production of polyesters, biodiesel, and lubricants. The seed specific 
expression of castor oleate Δ12 hydroxylase gene (RcFAH12), involved in the 
biosynthesis of 18:1–OH, increased the accumulation of HFAs in the Camelina 
seed oil by 15% (Lu and Kang, 2008). In a different study, RcFAH and LfKCS3 
from Physaria fendleri (encoding a FA condensing enzyme) were co-expressed 
in Camelina, which resulted in elongated HFAs such as lesquerolic acid 
accumulation (8%) with normal oil content and seed viability (Snapp et al., 
2014).  
 
5.4. Improving biotic and abiotic tolerance in Camelina
 
 
Camelina commonly shows
 
high resistance to pests and pathogens, 
however, some fungi, such as Plasmodiophora brassicae,
 
Albugo candida, 
Erwinia carotovora,
 
Fusarium sporotrichioides, Alternaria brassicae
 
and 
Candidatus phytoplasma asteris,
 
as well as
 
some insect pests (aphids) could 
reportedly cause damages
 
to this plant (Sainger et al., 2017). In light of that, 
GM Camelina varieties expressing some antimicrobial proteins, including 
cecropin P1
 
(Zakharchenko
 
et al., 2013), defensin, and pathogenesis-related 
genes (PR1
 
and PR3) (Nayanakantha et al., 2014), have been successfully 
created to enhance resistance to E. carotovora,
 
F. sporotrichioides, and A. 
brassicae.  
 
Camelina is also known as a drought adaptive plant
 
and this attribute could
 
cause reductions in
 
its yield productivity during abiotic stresses. Lee et al. 
(2014) transferred a transcription factor gene MYB96
 
to Camelina. The results 
confirmed that the expression of this gene improved the expression of several 
Camelina cuticular wax biosynthetic genes by two to seven
 
folds, and 
consequently increased accumulation of cuticular wax (Lee et al., 2014). The 
gene encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (acdS:
 
ACC 
deaminase) which enhances abiotic tolerance in plants by reducing stress 
ethylene, was transferred to Camelina. The GM Camelina
 
lines expressing 
acdS, showed higher root length and weight, seed production, as well as seed 
quality and seed oil content under salt stress compared with
 
the wild type 
(Heydarian et al., 2016). 
 
Isoprene has the ability to extinguish reactive oxygen species produced in 
plants during different abiotic stresses, thus enhancing the concentration of 
isoprene in plants especially during abiotic stresses could be promising in 
inducing tolerance. It has been well documented
 
that plants with high isoprene 
emissions
 
are naturally tolerant to some abiotic stresses, such as high 
temperatures, high light intensities,
 
and high O3
 
concentrations. To enhance 
such abilities in
 
the plants lacking isoprene emission, such as Camelina, it is 
possible to transfer isoprene synthase gene (PcISPS) to the plant genome (Rossi 
and Xie, 2014). Moreover, the citrus limonene synthase gene (ls), geranyl 
diphosphate synthase (GDP), monoterpene synthase (LS), farnesyl diphosphate 
synthase (FDS),
 
and sesquiterpene synthase (CDNS) have been transferred to 
the Camelina genome in the single or in co-expression
 
forms, and resulted in 
more adaptation to abiotic stresses in Camelina (Augustin et al., 2015; Borghi 
and Xie, 2016).
 
It has
 
been also
 
shown that the overexpression
 
of
 
γ-glutamyl 
cyclotransferase gene (GGCT2) in Camelina could
 
improve oxidative stress 
tolerance in this plant. This protein is a part of γ-glutamyl cycle involved in the 
synthesis and degradation of glutathione and recycling of amino acids 
(Ablordeppey, 2014). 
 
It has been reported
 
that Camelina genome contains a heavy metal P1B-
ATPase gene (hma3), making
 
this plant more tolerant to heavy metals (such as 
Cd, Pb,
 
and Co), and more capable of accumulating
 
heavy metals in shoots
 
compared with
 
rapeseed
 
for instance (Park et al., 2014 and 2015; Sainger et al., 
2017).
 
Thus, this plant could be considered as promising candidate for 
phytoremediation purposes
 
as well. Overall, the overexpression of CsHMA3
 
in 
transgenic Camelina
 
plants improved many traits, including heavy metals 
tolerance, plant growth, seed yield,
 
and total FAs content compared with
 
the 
wild type plants under heavy metal stresses. It was shown that such
 
improvements were ascribed
 
to significant decreases of
 
reactive oxygen species
 
(ROS)
 
and transporting heavy metals to vacuoles
 
(Park et al., 2014
 
and
 
2015; 
Sainger et al., 2017).
 
 
 
6. Challenges in genetic engineering of oil plants for biodiesel 
production 
 
Currently, the majority of the commercial production of biodiesel is 
dependent on oils derived from palm, soybean, and rapeseed by 
conventional methods. Changing the direction of biodiesel production from 
food crops to nonedible plants requires significant improvements in oil 
yield and quality of these plants as well as in their tolerance to biotic and 
abiotic stresses. As discussed throughout the present article, 
biotechnological interventions and genetic engineering approaches have 
shown great potentials to achieve these goals. However, the application of 
such technologies in oil plants is at their starting points, and there is no 
commercial oil plant with enhanced oil content or composition yet; there 
are laboratory and pilot scale samples though. Moreover, it is also necessary 
to thoroughly evaluate the potentials of genetic engineering technology in 
improving several other attributes of oil plants, i.e., environment 
adaptation, production cost, and economic feasibility in field scale. Lack of 
the presence of superior genotypes as a base for genetic engineering 
especially for nonedible plants such as Jatropha is known as one of the 
most important drawbacks in pursuing this path.  
Developing high throughput tissue culture and transformation protocols 
for oil plants is also very important to produce a large number of primary 
GM lines. This is very critical for especially woody perennial trees. Most 
of the GM oil crops have been evaluated at laboratory or greenhouse levels, 
and it is not clear that their response under field conditions are yet to be 
looked into. It should also be noted that genetic engineering methods might 
sometimes seem technically successful but would lead to commercial 
failures at large-scale production. Identification and characterization of 
major genes involved in TAG biosynthesis pathway as well as in adaptation 
to biotic and abiotic stresses are also of grave importance. In addition, it is 
necessary to carry out gene pyramiding programs to collect different 
agronomical traits in single superior genotypes of oil plants. This would 
help breeders to accelerate achieving superior genotypes suitable for 
commercial biodiesel production. Another challenge would be the biosafety 
issues related to GM oil plants, necessitating performing environmental and 
health risk assessments for such plants before commercial release. This 
would include evaluation of GM plants risks related to gene flow and 
potential negative effects on non-target organisms as well as the risks of 
potential negative effects on human and animal health.      
 
7. Concluding remarks 
 
During the last decades, significant developments have been reported
 
on
 
the technological aspects of genetic engineering of emerging oil plants with 
high potentials
 
for
 
biodiesel production. Recent revolutionary 
developments in NGS and other molecular biology technologies have 
provided excellent opportunities to accelerate identification and 
characterization of major genes involved
 
in TAG biosynthesis and 
environmental adaptation of oil plants
 
as source of bioenergy. These 
advances have provided very useful background for breeding programs to 
enhance oil contents, oil composition and quality, to reduce toxic 
metabolites,
 
as well as
 
to improve tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in 
different oil plants. The most of genetic engineering programs has been 
dedicated to expression, overexpression,
 
or suppression of the major genes 
affecting oil yield, oil quality,
 
and tolerance
 
to
 
biotic and abiotic stresses in 
bioenergy crops. Among these genes, DGAT
 
and FAD
 
genes have been 
widely used as major genes to enhance oil content and oil composition for 
biodiesel production in different oil plants, such as Jatropha, Camelina, 
soybean, rapeseed, Arabidopsis, etc.
 
Some successful GM verities with 
enhanced oil contents, oil composition,
 
and tolerant to biotic and abiotic 
stresses have been achieved. However, most of such GM plants have been 
evaluated at lab or greenhouse levels. Performing field trials to evaluate
 
the
 
efficiency and productivity of such GM biodiesel crops while also
 
looking 
into their biosafety aspects are
 
of importance in pursuing the
 
commercialization of such plants for biodiesel production. Moreover, in the 
next phases, exploring
 
other
 
major genes with potentials for further
 
improvements in oil content/quality and tolerance
 
to biotic and abiotic 
stresses followed by
 
pyramiding of such multiple transgenes conferring 
combined agronomical traits related to oil content and composition in a 
single plant would be
 
expected.

Abstract  
Synthetic biology offers a powerful method to design and construct biological devices for 
human purposes. Two prominent design methodologies are currently used. Rational design 
adapts the design methodology of traditional engineering sciences, such as mechanical 
engineering. Directed evolution, in contrast, models its design principles after natural 
evolution, as it attempts to design and improve systems by guiding them to evolve in a 
certain direction. Previous work has argued that the primary difference between these two 
is the way they treat variation: rational design attempts to suppress it, whilst direct 
evolution utilizes variation. I argue that this contrast is too simplistic, as it fails to 
distinguish different types of variation and different phases of design in synthetic biology. I 
outline three types of variation and show how they influence the construction of synthetic 
biological systems during the design process. Viewing the two design approaches with 
these more fine-grained distinctions provides a better understanding of the methodological 
differences and respective benefits of rational design and directed evolution, and clarifies 
the constraints and choices that the different design approaches must deal with. 
 
Keywords: Synthetic biology; Engineering; Design; Variation; Rational Design; Directed 
Evolution 
 
1. Introduction 
The emerging field of synthetic biology has been framed as a way of bringing an 
engineering perspective and principles to biotechnology. One of these principles is the 
higher emphasis on design and, consequently, identifying design as an autonomous phase 
distinct from fabrication (Cambray et al. 2011; Heinemann and Panke 2006). Successful 
 
 
2 
separation of design and fabrication should allow higher division of labor between these 
phases, or even automation of many of the fabrication tasks. Besides emphasis on 
autonomous design, the influence of engineering principles for synthetic biology is seen in 
the formulation of systematic design methodologies. The systematization of design 
methodology is an important feature of most engineering sciences (see Houkes and 
Vermaas 2010; Kroes 2012), and synthetic biologists have proposed different design 
approaches to better control the variability and stochastic interaction of biological systems. 
I will analyze the role of design approaches in controlling biological complexity from the 
perspective of biological variation. I focus on two prominent design methodologies: 
rational design and directed evolution. In Section 2, I provide an analysis of the respective 
methodological differences between these approaches. Rational design is a component-
focused approach that resembles the design methodology of traditional engineering 
sciences, such as mechanical engineering. It is, subsequently, the most prominent design 
methodology for those synthetic biologists that argue that synthetic biology should model 
its core methodology after engineering (e.g., Endy 2005; Heinemann and Panke 2006). 
Directed evolution, in contrast, models its design principles after natural evolution, as it 
attempts to design and improve systems by guiding them to evolve in a certain direction. 
Despite the prominence of engineering-inspired methods such as rational design, directed 
evolution or similar evolutionary design approaches are also common in the practice of 
synthetic biology (e.g., Haseltine and Arnold 2007; Packer and Liu 2015; Romero and 
Arnold 2009). 
 
 
3 
These approaches are often juxtaposed both in the biological (e.g., Silver et al. 2014) and 
philosophical literature (e.g., Krohs and Bedau 2013; Lewens 2013; Morange 2013). These 
accounts have not, however, dealt with the question of variation or how it relates to the 
specifics of different design approaches. I will analyze the differences between these 
design approaches by framing them through their relationship to variation. I follow the 
categorization offered by Giese et al. (2013) in their bibliometric analysis of synthetic 
biology. They argue that the primary methodological controversy of synthetic biologists is 
based on contrary views concerning biological variation and the inherent randomness of 
biological systems. They distinguish between “rational” and “evolutionary” groups of 
synthetic biologists.1 The rational group treats biological variation as problematic and aims 
to suppress it in its design, whereas the evolutionary group sees variation as a fundamental 
part of biological systems and aims to utilize it in their design process.  
In general, I agree with Giese et al.’s (2013) differentiation between rational and 
evolutionary groups of synthetic biologists, and their stances toward this variation. 
Biological variation and noise can be understood either as a destructive or as a constructive 
factor in design. However, Giese et al. (2013) are analyzing more general trends in the 
practice of synthetic biology based on bibliometric analysis. Therefore, whereas their 
dichotomy is well-suited to analyze differences in the synthetic biology community, it is 
too coarse to discern actual methodological questions on how variation affects design. 
 
1 Though Giese et al. (2013) approach the question from the perspective of different groups of synthetic 
biologists, their categorization of rational and evolutionary groups is equivalent to the distinction between 
rational design and directed evolution design approaches. 
 
 
4 
Therefore, in Section 3, I propose a new classification for distinct types of variation in 
synthetic biology and show how they influence the design process both in rational design 
and directed evolution. I argue that from the perspective of design practice, the 
categorization offered by Giese et al. (2013) between variation-suppressing rational design 
and variation-utilizing evolutionary design is too simplistic, and the specific type of 
variation must also be considered. I argue that biological variation causes distinctly 
different problems on the genotypic and phenotypic level for the design of synthetic 
systems, and analyze how these problems relate to each design approach. I distinguish 
three types of variation that are relevant to design tasks in synthetic biology: genetic 
variation (Section 3.1.), functional phenotypic variation (Section 3.2.), and environmental 
phenotypic variation (Section 3.3.). I demonstrate how each of these variations affects 
different design choices, how the suppression of variation is more fruitful in some cases 
than in others and how different types of variation may be correlated. 
2. Design in Synthetic Biology 
Most instances of synthetic biology are application-oriented as they aim to construct 
biological systems and devices for human purposes. These desired functions and systems 
are often not found in nature, and Dougherty and Arnold (2009, p. 486) argue that 
successful application of synthetic biology will require “parts that are not biologically 
relevant, parts that solve human problems and not necessarily problems for the organisms 
that make them.” This is both the rationale and the main challenge of design in synthetic 
biology, as synthetic biologists need to plan and construct novel structures that would 
exhibit the required beneficial functionalities.  
 
 
5 
One should, however, exercise some caution in drawing analogies between engineering 
and synthetic biology. For one, engineering as a discipline and a practice it is not uniform 
in its design methodology. When synthetic biology is framed as a way of bringing 
engineering perspective to synthetic biology, these proponents of synthetic biology usually 
rely on an overly narrow conception of engineering. For example, Heinemann and Panke 
(2009, p. 394-395) use the manufacturing of a new car as an example of the typical 
characteristics of real engineering, suggesting that “we just have to replace the car with 
biological cell and have to employ the outlined features of engineering disciplines.” 
Calcott et al. (2015) criticize this image of engineering, which focuses on the design of 
mechanical and electric machines, as narrow and misleading. They argue that actual 
engineering is much more heterogeneous in its design methodology and practices; 
subfields such as software engineering rely on design principles that differ radically from 
those in mechanical engineering (see also Calcott 2014). Therefore, when proponents of 
synthetic biology argue that one should “start thinking of designing biological parts in a 
forward engineering manner” (Heinemann and Panke 2009, p. 392) they should be 
understood in the context of “classical” engineering, such as mechanical and electrical 
engineering.  
One feature of classical engineering, which synthetic biologists aim to adapt, is the idea 
that you can distinguish between the design of the artifact and the execution of the design 
blueprint, that is, fabrication of the artifact. In previous biotechnology and molecular 
biology, design work was tied to wet lab work with no clear division between design and 
fabrication. However, the attempts to make biotechnology more similar to engineering 
 
 
6 
have lead synthetic biologists to distinguish design as an autonomous phase. This entails 
both a higher division of labor between design and wet lab experimental work and the 
development of methods and tools for design. Subsequently, design tools such as the use of 
computer-assisted design and standardization have become more prevalent. Following 
classical engineering, design is recognized as a distinct and creative form of problem-
solving that does not aim to find one correct solution, but to assess between multiple 
possible solutions based on pragmatic criteria, such as efficiency, reliability, cost, or even 
the aesthetics of design (Kroes 2012). 
The autonomous design phase produces its own conceptual questions concerning how to 
model and design new systems. Similar to engineering, synthetic biologists have proceeded 
to systematize their design methodology and develop distinct approaches to achieve 
reliable bioengineering of organisms with desirable traits. A systematic design approach 
should define the methods, heuristics and performance criteria that the engineer uses to 
solve design problems and to assess the success of the design. The most prominent design 
approach in synthetic biology is rational design, which closely resembles the traditional 
design paradigm of engineering (see Kroes 2012). Subsequently, rational design is often 
promoted and discussed in the more engineering-dominated conceptions of synthetic 
biology that emphasize analogies between engineered and living systems (Knuuttila and 
Loettgers 2013). However, rational design is frequently complemented and sometimes 
even replaced by more biologically-inspired evolutionary methods, the most visible of 
which is directed evolution. Directed evolution relies on a very different conceptualization 
of its design tasks, and, as we will see in Section 3, treats biological variation very 
 
 
7 
differently in comparison to rational design. I will next give a short account of both of 
these design approaches and their central heuristic differences. 
Rational design aims to solve its design problems by approaching them from the 
perspective of ‘proper characterization of parts’. Like the design methods of traditional 
engineering sciences, it is a forward-engineering method and its main principles are (i) 
decoupling of design tasks, (ii) the use of standardized modular components and (iii) 
hierarchical organization (Endy 2005; Heinemann and Panke 2006). Decoupling means the 
separation of design goals into sub-tasks that can be tackled separately. In a decomposable 
system, each of these design sub-tasks could be solved semi-independently in relation to 
other tasks. This is done by constructing devices and modules with corresponding sub-
functions by using standardized modular components. With rational design, 
characterization of a set of standardized components that can be predictably assembled to 
form more complex systems is one of the main goals of synthetic biology (Endy 2005). 
Possible standardized DNA components can be reporter genes, ribosome binding sites, 
promoter DNA sequences, and so on. Use of a standardized toolbox of parts takes its 
inspiration from electric engineering, and many of its standardized parts are characterized 
through similar language, as synthetic biologists talk, for example, about genetic switches 
and circuits (Purnick and Weiss 2009). Finally, designed systems should exhibit 
hierarchical organization, where standardized components form the foundational level of 
bottom-up system construction. Standardized components are put together to form more 
complex modules, such as bistable genetic switches or regulatory circuits 
(Andrianantoandro et al. 2006). In turn, these “second-level systems” should be able to be 
 
 
8 
combined to form more autonomous systems, such as whole networks (Purnick and Weiss 
2009). In other words, parts make devices and devices make systems. 
In these circumstances, the main task in rational design is to carefully specify, choose, and 
combine the individual components of the system resulting in a predictable composite 
behavior (Cambray et al. 2011; Haseltine and Arnold 2007). Rational design is often 
complemented or replaced with other design approaches, which are inspired by natural 
evolution. From the more biologically-inspired design methods, the most widely-used 
evolutionary design approach is directed evolution, which aims to use random mutations 
and deliberate selection to guide the designed system to evolve in a desired direction 
(Blake and Isaacs 2004). Design through directed evolution proceeds by iterating between 
two stages: the library generation and the selection/screening stage (Marguet et al. 2007). 
In the first stage, random mutations are induced into target sequence (e.g., through error-
prone replication, PCR errors or DNA shuffling) to create a library of mutants that exhibit 
relevant variation. In the second stage, the generated library is screened and one or more 
mutants, with desired phenotypic differences, are selected for further iterations. Library-
generation and a screening/selection cycle is repeated until a desired endpoint is achieved. 
Therefore, the work of a synthetic biologist using directed evolution resembles selective 
breeding in agriculture and animal husbandry (Lewens 2013).2 
 
2 Directed evolution is framed as a more biologically inspired design method than rational design. However, 
one should not consider directed evolution as exclusively biological design approach that is incompatible 
with engineering principles. Many engineering projects also rely on similar trial and error design methods 
(see Calcott et al. 2015), or evolutionary based design, such as use of genetic algorithms.  
 
 
9 
Directed evolution relies on different heuristics and the conceptualization of its design 
tasks than rational design. As with natural evolution, it modifies and tinkers with pre-
existing structures rather than designs and constructs systems by manipulating their parts. 
Subsequently, directed evolution is not limited to any certain level of hierarchy, and can be 
applied to modify both individual parts as well as more complex modules or whole systems 
and organisms (Marguet et al. 2007). Therefore, it can be used to optimize or tune non-
functional systems that do not exhibit the desired functionality (Yokobayashi et al. 2002).  
One such target for tuning by directed evolution are those rationally designed systems that 
do not achieve the intended functionality, or that change their functionality due to context-
sensitivity. I will discuss the latter case and the effects of environment on the variation of 
functionality in Section 3.3. 
This redesign of rationally-designed systems by directed evolution should exemplify the 
complementary role of different design approaches and their respective design principles 
(Dougherty and Arnold 2009). Both design approaches have their benefits and limitations. 
Whereas rational design relies on the decomposability of the system and the availability of 
well-characterized standardized parts, directed evolution is primarily limited by the ability 
of the researcher to induce mutational variation in the target sequence, and to detect and 
select desired phenotypes from the generated library of mutants. However, rational design 
is often framed as the primary design methodology of synthetic biology, and evolutionary 
design approaches such as directed evolution are considered to be only intermediate steps 
to overcome the current limitations of rational design (Bujara and Panke 2010). This 
follows the traditional engineering of idea conceptualizing design practice as a form of 
 
 
10 
rational problem-solving (see Simon 1996). Directed evolution, where the designer both 
induces random mutations into the system and cannot predict the exact direction in which 
the system will evolve, is, in turn, seen as a less rational form of design. Consequently, 
directed evolution is described both as an “irrational” (Lewens 2013, p. 642) and “semi-
rational” (Guimaraes et al. 2013, p. 72) design approach, or is even characterized as 
“engineering without design” (Marguet et al. 2007, p. 610). 
This difference between rational design and directed evolution can be made more explicit 
by considering it from the perspective of biological variation. The inherent stochasticity 
and messiness of biological systems imposes a major challenge for the attempts to engineer 
them, and the two design approaches provide different solutions to deal with variation. 
Based on this difference, Giese et al. (2013) categorizes synthetic biologists into two 
camps in relation to their stance to biological variation, namely rational and evolutionary 
groups. Rational group considers randomness to be a problematic phenomenon and 
biological variation as something to be suppressed. In turn, evolutionary group sees 
variation and randomness as “an elementary part of biological function and development,” 
and as something to be accommodated in the design solutions (Giese et al. 2013, p. 325).  
To some extent, this juxtaposition between rational and evolutionary design mirrors the 
engineering and biology disciplinary roots of synthetic biology (see Cameron et al. 2014). 
Subsequently, the unpredictability and noisiness of evolving biological systems highlights 
one of the major disanalogies in relation to engineered systems (Knuuttila and Loettgers 
2014). Several classical engineering fields have established standards and protocols that 
allow them to design and construct objects like bridges and mobile phones with high 
 
 
11 
predictability. Whereas biological systems are affected by evolutionary change and both 
internal and external noise, classical engineering fields have technical infrastructure and 
foundations that allow them to achieve predictable control of their systems. As Arkin and 
Fletcher (2006, p. 114.3) put it, “Thermal fluctuations that drive stochastic behavior can 
typically be ignored or managed in traditional engineering, but often not in cells.”  
Conscious of this disanalogy, Agapakis and Silver (2009) note that in the engineering of 
biological circuits, designed synthetic systems are defined explicitly in opposition to 
evolved systems. Therefore, the question concerning the role of biological variation and 
randomness is not important simply to coax out the respective methodological differences 
between different design approaches of synthetic biology, but it relates to a larger question 
in the center of synthetic biology about the engineerability of biological systems. Indeed, 
to better understand these differences between “rational” and “evolutionary” groups of 
synthetic biologists, a more nuanced understanding of biological variation is required. I 
will next turn to my core question, which is the role and effects of biological variation, and 
how they relate to the requirements of design in synthetic biology. 
3. Variation 
I distinguish between three different types of variation. Genetic variation (Section 3.1.) 
refers to the variation in the nucleotide sequence, usually due to the accumulation of 
mutations. It is the most important type of variation for both design approaches, as genetic 
content is the primary target for manipulations, and most phenotypic change is caused by 
genetic change. In turn, I distinguish between two types of phenotypic variation. 
Functional phenotypic variation (Section 3.2.) is defined as the variation of the intended 
 
 
12 
target phenotype under the same environmental conditions, whereas environmental 
phenotypic variation (Section 3.3.) refers to the variation of the target phenotype under 
different environmental conditions. This distinction allows me, for example, to discuss the 
context-sensitivity of biological systems separately from other challenges of phenotypic 
variation to design approaches, such as, does each iteration of design cycle of directed 
evolution produce selectable differences in phenotypes.  
This threefold typology follows the one used by Tawfik (2010), who discusses the different 
aspects of biological “messiness.” He considers biological variation from the evolutionary 
perspective: he is interested in the origin of messiness, whether evolution promotes things 
like heterogeneity and stochasticity, and how it affects evolutionary innovation and 
robustness. Although Tawfik (2010) does not discuss variation from the perspective of 
design or synthetic biology, I show that these distinctions are, in fact, relevant to synthetic 
biology. As Michel Morange (2013, p. 318) suggests, one should avoid “the false 
distinction drawn between the work of synthetic biologists and the action of evolution.” By 
applying the evolutionary discussion concerning variation to design of synthetic systems, 
we can better understand one of the core methodological controversies of synthetic 
biology.  
Different types of variation provide distinct benefits and challenges at various stages of 
engineering, and these problems differ depending on the design approach that is used. For 
example, rational design tries to suppress the effects of environmental phenotypic variation 
by characterizing the functional ranges of its parts. Directed evolution, in turn, mitigates 
these effects by tuning its systems to the selective pressures of the implementation 
 
 
13 
environment. I will make two further distinctions to clarify these effects. First, I separate 
the engineering process into two distinct phases: the design phase and the implementation 
phase. In the design phase, synthetic biologists try to plan and model the system that 
exhibits the intended functions. It includes, e.g., in silico and in vitro research, as well as 
computer-aided modeling. Design in synthetic biology is usually done in a highly-
controlled environment, and it is also the phase where the previously discussed design 
approaches are applied. In turn, implementation is the post-design phase when the 
synthetic biological system is used and maintained in its intended target environments. 
After implementation, systems are still susceptible to the effects of biological variation, as 
they undergo evolution, accumulate mutations and face environmental change. It should be 
noted that in most cases the design and the implementation phases are not fully separate. 
Synthetic biology projects often iterate between the design, implementation and redesign 
of their systems, and activities like prototype construction transcend the 
design/implementation divide. However, as I will show in the following sections, 
biological variation has distinctly different effects in the design and implementation phase. 
Furthermore, I will analyze how the ability of the designed system to control and maintain 
its functionality under this variation depends partly on the choice of the design approach. 
Second, I distinguish between synchronic and diachronic variation. Synchronic variation 
refers to the existing variation in a population or sets of populations at any one given time. 
In turn, diachronic variation denotes variation and change in time, usually during multiple 
 
 
14 
generations.3 This distinction allows me to tease out some additional differences between 
the design approaches. 
3.1. Genetic Variation 
Genetic variation is both the most important and the best-understood form of biological 
variation, due to the importance of DNA and genes in evolutionary and molecular biology. 
It is defined as variation in the nuclear sequence, due to mutations, insertions, deletions, 
and gene copy number variations (Tawfik 2010). Genetic variation is sometimes referred 
to as mutational variation (e.g., Lehner 2008; Rollié et al. 2012), as the accumulation of 
mutations is the main source of both desired and undesired genetic variation. Subsequently, 
these mutations affect the design process in different ways, depending on the design 
approach that is applied. The roles and effects of genetic variation are summarized in Table 
1. Furthermore, to understand the utilization of genetic variation in directed evolution, it is 
important to make a distinction between genetic variation at one point of time and the 
accumulation of mutations in time, that is, between synchronic and diachronic genetic 
variation, respectively. 
 
 
3 A synchronic/diachronic distinction can also be discussed in relation to design goals. In his analysis of 
software engineering, Calcott (2014, p. 298) defines a synchronic goal as the attempt to “make the software 
do something useful now,” and a diachronic goal means to “make the software easy to modify” in the future. 
As Calcott notes, analysis of engineering tends to focus on synchronic goals, whereas diachronic aspects are 
overlooked. 
 
 
15 
[Insert Table 1 about here] 
Genetic variation, especially in bacteria, is often highly correlated with phenotypic 
variation. As most synthetic biology projects have practical goals that aim to achieve 
improved or novel functionality, synthetic biologists are primarily interested on the 
phenotypic effects of their design. It is, therefore, difficult to analyze the consequences and 
utilization of genetic variation without invoking its possible phenotypic effects. However, 
there are reasons to discuss genetic variation separately from phenotypic variation. In 
natural systems it provides the basis for evolution, whereas in biotechnology genetic 
content is the primary target for manipulations. Both rational design and directed evolution 
target their interventions on the genetic content, either through the use of DNA-based parts 
or induction of genetic variation. Secondly, though genotype and phenotype are correlated, 
the phenotypic effects of genetic variation are not uniform, and organisms generate 
phenotypic variation from genetic change in various ways (see Gerhart & Kirschner 2007; 
Tawfik 2010). Finally, decoupling genetic and phenotypic variation might provide a way to 
increase the mutational robustness of the system, allowing the designed system to maintain 
functionality after mutations (Kitano 2004). In Section 3.2. I will further discuss how the 
correlation of genetic and phenotypic variation affects different design approaches, but 
first, I will analyze the role of genetic variation in synthetic biology. 
For rational design, most problems of genetic variation arise after the design work, in the 
implementation phase. Successful characterization and standardization of parts should 
allow rational design to plan and design its systems with predictable outcomes at the 
design phase, where many environmental factors and promiscuous interactions can be 
 
 
16 
controlled. Most unpredictable genetic variation in this phase is due to methodological 
limitations, e.g., technical and practical problems in the synthesis and assembly of a 
nucleotide sequence. This type of variation can be overcome with the development of less 
error-prone syntheses and proof-reading methods. However, the effects of synthesis errors 
should not be underestimated as this type of variation imposes challenges especially for 
more complex synthetic biology projects such as whole-genome engineering. The 
probability of error-free synthesis diminishes as the size of the synthetized genome 
increases. For example, in the case of Mycoplasma laboratorium genome engineering, a 
single synthesis error in one DNA fragment caused the synthetic systems to be non-
functional, and led to significant delays in the project (Gibson et al. 2010). 
In turn, induction and utilization of genetic variation is at the heart of directed evolution. 
Synchronic variation is not just left unsuppressed, it is a necessary factor whose emergence 
is encouraged in the library-generation stage of design, for example, by using error-prone 
replication or DNA shuffling (Marguet et al. 2007). This should create synchronic genetic 
variation, that is, a set of varying DNA molecules that can then be subjected to selection or 
high-throughput screening. If successful, iterating the library-generation and 
selection/screening cycle will lead to controlled diachronic genetic variation, where 
different generations of mutant lineages vary in their target sequence. However, the 
induction of variation is not a completely random process and successful application of 
directed evolution requires both types of variation to be controlled. In optimal cases, 
directed evolution requires synchronic genetic variation only in sequences that are relevant 
for target functionality. Unfortunately, other parts of the genetic sequence are susceptible 
 
 
17 
to mutations as well, and, subsequently, can cause the accumulation of undetected 
mutations. This unintended genetic variation hinders the independent screening of intended 
properties (Haseltine and Arnold 2007). 
After the intended design is achieved, both rational design and directed evolution still face 
similar problems with genetic variation in the implementation phase. Control of the 
environment and its selective pressures is more difficult outside the laboratory setting of 
the design phase. In time, the DNA sequence of the designed system accumulates 
mutations, which leads to deterioration of the original designed system. Synthetic systems 
have, therefore, a tendency to accumulate diachronic genetic variation after they are 
implemented. This diachronic variation can lead to synchronic variation if multiple co-
existing mutant lineages evolve from the designed sequence, or to a case where one mutant 
lineage replaces the original system. The probability of this depends on the selective 
pressures of the implementation environment and on the phenotypic effects of the genetic 
variation. It also shows why the correlation of genetic variation and phenotypic variation 
must be considered. If genetic and phenotypic variation are highly correlated, the system is 
sensitive either to selective pressures, or to changes in its functionality due to genetic 
deterioration (Wagner 2005). I will next turn to the question of phenotypic variation and its 
effects on designed systems. 
3.2. Functional Phenotypic Variation 
I distinguish two types of phenotypic variation: functional and environmental. Following a 
similar distinction given by Tawfik (2010), functional phenotypic variation is defined as 
 
 
18 
the variation of the intended target phenotype under the same environmental conditions. 
This variation might be quantitative (e.g., differences in the metabolic efficiency of a 
certain mutant) or qualitative (e.g., novel functionality or a loss of function). 
Phenotypic variation is usually, at least partially, caused by differences in genotype, and 
therefore correlated with genetic variation. This means that changes in genetic variation 
often induce changes in phenotypic variation. However, this influence can also work the 
other way round. Phenotypic variation may guide genetic variation by influencing the 
possible evolutionary routes and fixing mutations through selection (Tawfik 2010). 
Phenotypes of bacteria are especially sensitive to genetic changes. Even silent mutations, 
where a genetic change in the DNA codon does not change the amino acid that it codes, 
can have relevant phenotypic effects for synthetic biologists. Organisms have been 
observed to exhibit codon preference; synonymous codon replacement can affect 
translation efficiency and protein functionality (Angov et al. 2008). For example, Hu et al. 
(2013) tested 342 variants of antibody coding gene with synonymous codon usage. The 
produced proteins retained identical original amino acid sequence, but exhibited significant 
functional differences in solubility and antigen-binding affinity. This was explained by 
differences in the availability of corresponding transfer-RNAs for synonymous codons. 
Rare codons were translated at different rates which, subsequently, influenced the protein 
folding. This result shows how genetic variation can guide protein synthesis and affect 
protein phenotype without amino acid substitutions. On the other hand, the same genotypes 
can also exhibit different phenotypes in the same environment. This type of variation is 
due to developmental changes or stochastic events such as phenotypic noise (Tawfik 
 
 
19 
2010). Together, these discoveries demonstrate why the influence between genetic and 
phenotypic variation is not a straightforward question even in bacteria. 
The stances of rational design and directed evolution towards functional variation are 
similar to their stances toward genetic variation discussed in the previous section. The 
effects of functional phenotypic variation are presented in Table 2. Due to the correlation 
of genetic and phenotypic variation, there is an important symmetry in the respective 
effects of genetic and functional variation to design. Synthetic biologists are concerned 
about the actual relevant functional effects that genetic variation might have. However, this 
correlation of genetic and phenotypic variation has different consequences for rational 
design and directed evolution. 
[Insert Table 2 about here] 
As discussed in the previous section, synthetic biologists are usually able to control most 
unintended variation in the design phase. For rational design, there should be no 
unintended synchronic functional variation in the design phase as the approach aims to 
make phenotypic variation predictable by testing, modeling and reassembling the systems. 
Predictable design is facilitated by the modularity of used components and the suppression 
of phenotypic noise. The main task of the design phase is to construct systems whose 
phenotypes exhibit most closely the intended functionality. Subsequently, possible 
functional variation usually arises from methodological problems, either when DNA 
synthesis and assembly errors have phenotypically detectable consequences, or when 
phenotypic noise cannot be suppressed. 
 
 
20 
In turn, directed evolution aims to achieve its design goals by utilizing both synchronic and 
diachronic functional variation. Successful application of directed evolution requires that 
in each iteration of the library generation stage, induced random mutations have 
phenotypic effects that allow the synthetic biologist to screen and select the desired 
phenotypes for further iterations. Relevant synchronic functional variation in each iteration 
of the design cycle is, therefore, necessary for successful application of directed evolution. 
Furthermore, to reach a desired phenotypic outcome, and to achieve the intended design 
goals, directed evolution requires a certain type of diachronic functional variation. There 
must be an incremental pathway of beneficial mutations from a starting point to a desired 
phenotype (Dougherty and Arnold 2009). 
This shows an important tension concerning how the correlation of genetic and phenotypic 
variation affects the application of directed evolution. For directed evolution, each 
genotypic change should ideally bring about detectable changes in the phenotype. This 
allows each iteration of the library generation stage to produce enough phenotypic 
variation that can be screened or selected for improved functionality. Therefore, in its 
design phase, directed evolution benefits from a closer correlation of genotypic and 
phenotypic variation. However, as Zakeri and Carr (2015, p. 57) note: “once a successful 
design is achieved, we typically prefer that the designed system remain static, not deviating 
from the original specifications.” After that point, further variation can only disrupt the 
intended design. 
Subsequently, both rational design and directed evolution benefit from mutational 
robustness in the implementation phase, that is, if the designed system can retain its 
 
 
21 
functionality even though being subject to genetic degradation and selection. There is an 
interest in robustness-promoting structures that provide a “genetic buffer” by decoupling 
genetic variation from the phenotype (Kitano 2004). For example, heat-shock chaperone 
proteins (HSPs) stabilize the structure of several proteins by aiding protein folding despite 
genetic changes and environmental stress. HSPs increase the robustness of the system and 
mask the effects of genetic variation by helping proteins to fold correctly when they have 
accumulated detrimental mutations (Rutherford 2003). However, if the correlation between 
genetic and phenotypic variation is higher, genetic change might lead to changes in 
functionality. In time, genetic change can cause diachronic phenotypic variation which – as 
harmful mutations are more probable than beneficial ones – can lead to a loss of functions 
(Haseltine and Arnold 2007). Even in cases where mutations lead to a novel functionality, 
these promiscuous functions are usually in opposition to the intended design goals, and can 
potentially be harmful to the environment or human health. 
Possible synchronic functional variation also has important effects on implementation. As 
mentioned in Section 3.1., accumulation of mutations can lead to genetic divergence and 
the emergence of multiple mutant lineages. If this genetic variation has phenotypic effects 
with different fitness consequences in the implementation environment, synchronic 
functional variation can lead to competition and natural selection, and even to cases where 
the mutant lineage replaces the original designed strain. The latter poses a particular 
problem for designed systems, where the designed properties do not necessarily provide 
fitness benefits for the organism. Synthetic biologists have tried to estimate the genetic 
reliability of standardized parts by attaching a GFP-reporter gene to the device (Sleight et 
 
 
22 
al. 2010). By measuring the expression level of the reporter gene, synthetic biologists have 
been able to estimate parts’ evolutionary half-life: the number of generations it takes for 
less than 50% of the population to have the designed functionality. Studies indicate that, 
for example, in the common Escherichia coli host, typical genetic parts lose their 
reliability after ~100 generations (Renda et al. 2014). This is explained by the fact that 
synthetic biology devices often cause a fitness cost to their host organisms. Systems with 
designed genetic devices impose a metabolic burden, as they usually require cells to 
synthesize additional RNAs and proteins that are unnecessary for the host survival, or that 
interfere with native cellular processes (Sleight et al. 2010). Subsequently, deleterious 
mutations that inactive the designed genetic parts may be favored by selection. This might 
result in the dominance of non-productive mutants, as the estimates of evolutionary half-
life of genetic parts suggest. 
Rational design, in contrast, generally benefits from a lower correlation of genetic and 
phenotypic variation. This increases the chance that post-implementation genetic change 
does not cause relevant phenotypic changes. In other words, it increases the likelihood of 
mutations being neutral, which enables the system to maintain its stability and 
functionality. In turn, directed evolution benefits from a higher correlation of genetic and 
phenotypic variation in the design phase, but it faces similar problems of system 
“detuning” and lowered functionality after implementation. Directed evolution seems to 
face a trade-off between design efficiency and post-implementation system robustness. 
However, Wagner (2008) addresses this seemingly antagonistic relationship between 
robustness and evolvability by turning the analysis of robustness from genotype to 
 
 
23 
phenotype. Even though robust genotypes exhibit low evolvability, robust phenotypes 
actually promote evolvability. Wagner explains this by the fact that several alternative 
genotypes can produce the same phenotype; populations with robust phenotypes are more 
diverse and can access greater amounts of variation. Therefore, the effects of mutational 
robustness to the design process of directed evolution are not unequivocal, and depend, for 
example, on the fitness landscape of the manipulated system. Subsequently, directed 
evolution has been considered especially suitable for protein engineering, as proteins 
exhibit phenotypic robustness due to previously discussed folding stabilizing factors 
(Romero and Arnold 2009).  
Finally, both design approaches aim to suppress functional variation in implementation. 
Rationally designed systems aim at structural solutions that increase genetic robustness, 
such as gene duplication (“back-up systems”), modular design or alternative metabolic 
routes (see Wagner 2005). In turn, directed evolution can decrease the chance of detuning 
by lowering the effects of the implementation environment’s selective pressures. This can 
be done by choosing a design environment that resembles the implementation 
environment, and therefore designing a system to function stably in the intended 
environment. As many systems of synthetic biology are sensitive to their implementation 
environment, this “environmental tuning” is an important rationale for the use of directed 
evolution. I will discuss this design goal in the next section when I analyze the effects of 
environmental phenotypic variation. 
 
 
24 
3.3. Environmental Phenotypic Variation 
The second type of phenotypic variation, environmental variation, is defined as variation 
in the target phenotype under different environmental conditions. It describes how likely 
the system is to respond to changes in the environment and can thus be called its “context-
sensitivity” (Güttinger 2013, p. 200) or “context-dependence” (Haseltine and Arnold 2007, 
p. 4). Context-sensitivity offers a major obstacle for proper implementation in synthetic 
biology. The goal of standardization is still far away, and in many cases achieving 
functionality even in one environment can require some post-hoc tinkering from synthetic 
biologists (O’Malley 2011; Purnick and Weiss 2009). Constructs of synthetic biology 
usually exhibit more environmental variation than natural systems, as they are less 
complex than their natural counterparts and include fewer redundant parts (“back-up” 
components) or robust structures. The ability for synthetic devices to work in more than 
one environment is often an important feature, and it has practical incentives, as context-
sensitivity limits the application of systems, making them less cost-effective. Furthermore, 
the ideal of standardization requires a certain level of generality in parts, as standardized 
components are required to exhibit predictable behavior under a range of different 
environments (Endy 2005). 
[Insert Table 3 about here] 
As the variability of an environment is controlled in the design phase, environmental 
variation causes most of its challenges in the implementation phase. These challenges and 
their role in rational design and directed evolution are summarized in Table 3. Both design 
 
 
25 
approaches aim to predict and control the environmental variation in the implementation of 
their systems, though by different methods. Rational design aims to overcome 
environmental variation by characterizing the environmental responses and functionality 
ranges of its components. For each component, there should be some range of domains and 
functional roles where the component could be predictably used. This ideal has been 
successful for a limited number of simple designs in rational design, but not for more 
complex structures. In many cases, rational design constructs exhibit unpredictable 
environmental variation that still cannot be mitigated by standardization, and which limits 
the generality of its constructs (Purnick and Weiss 2009). 
For directed evolution, environmental variation is also a challenge. However, directed 
evolution has better ways of mitigating the effects of environmental variation. Directed 
evolution allows synthetic biologists to circumvent the effects of environmental variation 
by finding particular solutions for each environment. Multiple iterations of the library 
generation and screening/selection cycle allow synthetic biologists to carefully choose 
mutants that exhibit higher functionality in the given environment (Haseltine and Arnold 
2007). This ability to tune the non-functional system to achieve functionality in a novel 
environment is one of the main rationales for the use of directed evolution. 
However, there is a trade-off as the gained functionality is usually achieved with higher 
context-specificity and decreased generality, as new mutants are tuned to work only in 
their specified environment. Therefore, directed evolution leads to an increased coupling 
between the system and its environment. In this way, use of evolutionary design methods 
resembles the use of genetic algorithms that, similarly, off-load some of the problem 
 
 
26 
solving to the environment (see Kuorikoski and Pöyhönen 2013). Due to the increased 
coupling between the system and the environment, environmentally tuned systems are 
harder to implement into a new domain. Environmental variation causes problems to both 
design approaches in synthetic biology, but directed evolution can better mitigate those 
problems with the loss of generality. Therefore, directed evolution is often used to 
supplement rational methods to overcome environmental variation and find particular 
solutions, “kludges”, for each environment (see O’Malley 2011). 
Sometimes this higher context-sensitivity can be beneficial, for example, in the case of 
trophic containment (Marliere 2009; Torres et al. 2016). In these experiments, bacteria are 
grown in a culture that include molecules (for example, synthetic coenzymes) that do not 
occur in their natural food chain, and directed evolution is used to tune bacteria to that 
environment. These “alien nutrients” form a selective medium and bacteria are forced to 
evolve so that their metabolism adapts to utilize the added compounds. The goal of the 
process is to develop a mutant lineage that requires the exogenous supply of synthetic 
nutrients (Marliere 2009). This should prevent bacteria from growing in a natural 
environment which lacks the necessary nutrients, thus decreasing the risk of accidental 
release of GM bacteria outside the laboratory. Subsequently, the increased context-
sensitivity that is achieved by directed evolution is an actual design goal. 
Finally, there is another important trade-off that affects both design approaches in a similar 
way. Phenotypic noise, caused, e.g., by unstable expression patterns of gene networks of 
stochastic developmental factors, can hinder successful and predictable design (Tawfik 
2010). Engineered systems usually aim to suppress and minimize the effects of noise, as it 
 
 
27 
causes unpredictability and inefficiencies (Knuuttila and Loettgers 2013). In most cases, 
the proper functioning of synthetic systems requires high fidelity and specificity of their 
interactions, such as the enzyme-substrate reactions of the metabolism. The fidelity of 
interactions is costly, as systems require structures that can reduce noise or discern a signal 
(Tawfik 2010). Therefore, dealing with noise causes design trade-offs between efficiency 
and metabolic cost, or between specificity of interactions and robustness of the system to 
perturbations, e.g., in structural confirmations of enzymes. Additional noise-suppressing 
structures, such as proof-reading mechanisms and developmental constraints accrue 
additional metabolic costs. Furthermore, such mechanisms can lower the ability to induce 
random mutations in systems, which is a required design step in directed evolution. 
However, even though phenotypic noise can cause unpredictability and impose fidelity 
costs, it has also been shown to play an important functional role in some cellular 
phenomena, such as regulation and differentiation (Eldar and Elowitz 2010). Suppression 
of noise can affect the functional ranges of the designed systems, and decrease their 
robustness or adaptability. Subsequently, even rational design can in certain circumstances 
benefit from variation, and allowing certain amount of noise can actually make systems 
more robust. It provides another example of the challenge that synthetic biologists face 
when trying to apply engineering principles and methodology to the design of biological 
systems.

4. Conclusions 
This paper offers an analysis on the role of biological variation in synthetic biology and 
explains how different types of biological variation affect the design at given points in the 
engineering process. I have argued that a more fine-grained analysis of different types of 
variation allows us to better understand this juxtaposition and how variation actually is 
suppressed and utilized in the design of synthetic biological systems. In general, variation 
is more problematic for the rational design approach and, in turn, essential for the 
evolutionary approach. However, not even directed evolution embraces all instances of 
variation, for it must suppress certain types of variation or mitigate their effects. Rational 
design is prone to changes in time (genetic deterioration and detuning), and context-
specificity. In turn, directed evolution requires closer correlation between genotype and 
phenotype, and loses generality in dealing with environmental variation. Some types of 
variation, such as phenotypic variation after implementation, propose challenges to both 
design approaches. Finally, all design approaches must consider of the effects of biological 
noise, as it accrues fidelity costs and causes subsequent design trade-offs.  
Variation poses important challenge for design in synthetic biology, and its role cannot be 
reduced to the role that variation plays in evolutionary change. Neither should biological 
variation be approached only from the engineering perspective, and seen merely as a 
source of unpredictability and something to be suppressed. Rather, different types of 
variation and their effects offer an opportunity to understand the methodological 
foundations of synthetic biology, and its attempts to reconcile its biological and 
engineering roots.

Abstract 
Author: Katherine Banner 
Thesis: The Problem of the Neurodegenerative Germline: An Ethical Reconsideration in Light of 
Genetic Engineering Developments 
Supervising Professors: Dr. Joy Penticuff, Dr. Nancy Moran 
 
In this thesis I strive to answer the question, “Is it ethically justifiable to edit out the 
mutant Alzheimer’s gene, and therefore the germline of, a human embryo with the CRISPR-
Cas9 system?” 
 There are many risks of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, including the off-target effects of 
mosaicism, unintended base changes, and double-stranded breaks. Along with this, using the 
CRISPR-Cas9 system on the germline of a human embryo violates the two major theories of 
bioethics as well as the principles of medical ethics. There is also a large public and religious 
fear about the clinical use of this technology. 
 Through the analysis of the science behind CRISPR-Cas9, the scientific benefits and 
risks of CRISPR-Cas9, and the medical ethics of its clinical use, I determined that it is not 
ethically justifiable to use CRISPR-Cas9 in its current state to edit the germline of a human 
embryo in order to remove Alzheimer’s disease. I also determined that it is not ethically 
justifiable to use CRISPR-Cas9 in a future, more accurate state unless multiple limitations and 
regulations on the technology are set.

I. Introduction 
 
Modern advancement in the scientific community has been astounding, and sometimes 
very unexpected. We have discovered smaller particles than ever before known, bioengineered 
body parts for humans, developed cures and vaccinations for diseases that we never thought 
would be possible, and so much more. Science is leading us, as humans, down a future path that 
nobody expected, and a path that some may not want. Some of these new scientific discoveries, 
especially the new technologies involving genetic engineering, could change the human race for 
the good and possibly for the bad. The possibility (and success) of editing the genomes of 
different organisms around the world, including humans, has recently come into light, and has 
proven to be one of the most significant and promising technologies in the scientific and medical 
communities today.  
However, the ethical dilemma that the new genetic engineering technologies has 
presented cannot be ignored. Whether these technologies should actually be used on the human 
population, and if so what they can and cannot be used for, is a question that can change the 
future of humans in innumerable ways. 
 There are many proposed uses of the new genetic engineering technologies, including 
cancer therapy and other therapies for genetic diseases. However, the ability to alter the human 
genome in any form raises many ethical concerns, as altering our genetic makeup can go much 
further than disease therapy. Altering the human genome would not only allow us to edit out 
mutant genes that cause disease in humans, but also to alter multiple other traits. We have 
already developed the technology to genetically test the genomes of human embryos (a human 
which is in the early stages of development and has not been born, and is derived from the 
zygote, which is the single cell resulting from the fertilization of an egg by a sperm) for their 
 7 
genetic makeup (what genes they are positive for), and those who participate in in-vitro 
fertilization have the ability to take advantage of this technology. For example, parents are able 
to choose the sex of their child if they desire to. Any action similar to this introduces the ethical 
debate associated with genetic engineering: what should it be used for? There is a major fear of 
using the new genetic engineering technologies to perform similar actions and create “designer 
babies” or “genetically modified humans.”1 
The genetic engineering techniques we have developed involve the precise modification 
of DNA and allows genes to be turned on or off, meaning that certain genes will not be 
physically expressed if they are turned off, and they will be expressed if they are turned on. This 
allows scientists to identify traits they want to remove or to insert other traits found somewhere 
else in an organisms’ genome through the process of editing alleles out and replacing them with 
non-mutant alleles. Should we alter a human embryo if we are able to genetically test and 
confirm that it will be born with a lethal, degenerative disease, or should we allow the human 
race to populate naturally? Even in the case of using genetic engineering technology on already 
born humans, the question of what we are able to do versus what we should do still introduces an 
ethical debate, as altering the germline of an adult human changes the genetic makeup of not 
only the adult but also any offspring of that person.  
 For example, some genetic mutations that lead to the development of Alzheimer’s disease 
are known. If we are able to test for chromosomal content of human embryos, then we are able to 
detect if a human embryo will be born with a genetic disease. The first use of genetic engineering 
technology, specifically the CRISPR-Cas9 system, on human embryos was conducted in the

summer of 2017 in order to fix a genetic disorder in a human embryo.2 Jennifer Doudna, a 
biologist from The University of California at Berkeley who co-discovered how to use CRISPR 
to edit genes, stated that “any scientist with molecular biology skills and knowledge of how to 
work with [embryos] is going to be able to [edit human embryos].”3 We are able to genetically 
engineer the germline in human embryos, which can be used to treat disease in future developing 
humans. The concern, however, is that of Edward Lanphier, the CEO of the California 
biotechnology company (Sangamo Biosciences) that is using the genetic engineering technology 
of zinc-finger nucleases to treat HIV in adults. Lanphier believes that there is no disease rationale 
for germline engineering, as it is “a slippery slope toward much more unacceptable uses.”4 
The consequences of genetically modifying an embryo are unknown. Currently, it is 
impossible for us to know if any unintended, genetic consequences will occur by genetically 
modifying the genome of a human embryo, and therefore it is impossible for us to know if the 
benefit outweighs the cost of this technology or treatment. “Any human embryo altered by 
CRISPR today would carry the risk that its genome had been changed in unexpected ways.”5 Not 
only this, but modifying the genetic makeup of an adult human, and specifically the germline of 
an adult human, can also introduce unintended, unknown detrimental consequences to not only 
the adult but also any of his/her children, and the human race.

There are multiple other ethical considerations that must be taken into account when 
considering the human application of genetic manipulation technology besides the unintended 
consequences and changing a germline. When using this technology as a human treatment, there 
are many religious aspects to take into account, as well as geographic, social, and financial 
aspects.  
In this thesis, I will attempt to determine whether or not it is ethically justifiable to use 
the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering technology to edit the genetic makeup of a human 
embryo, and more specifically to modify the genetic makeup of the embryo’s germline. The 
reason for this focus is because at this time, the large majority of research has been directed 
towards germline modification rather than somatic cell modification in human embryos. This 
means that my analysis of the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering technology deals 
with germline modification, which affects all future generations from the embryo upon which 
CRISPR-Cas9 has been applied. In order to come to a conclusion to this argument, I will analyze 
the scientific background of the genetic engineering technology along with any other science that 
relates to its clinical use, the scientific benefits and risks of the technology, and the bioethical 
arguments for and against the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system on human embryos. 
 
 
 
 
 
II. Scientific Background 
 10 
 
Introduction 
 A genome is an organism’s complete set of DNA, which includes all genes and 
hereditary material. Therefore, our genome (to an extent) determines who we are— it includes all 
any and all information necessary to build an organism. It determines what we look like (our 
phenotype), portions of our intelligence, and certain aspects of our personalities. Each gene in an 
organism is a specific sequence of DNA (our genotype), deoxyribonucleic acid, that codes for a 
certain sequence of RNA, ribonucleic acid, or a certain protein. DNA is structured as a double-
helix consisting of two complementary strands made up nucleotides, which contain a phosphate 
group, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base. There are four different nitrogenous bases in DNA: 
adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T), and RNA has the same four except that 
uracil (U) is substituted for thymine. In the complementary strands, adenine pairs with thymine 
and cytosine pairs with guanine. Each DNA sequence that codes for a gene is converted into a 
protein through two different processes that make up the central dogma of genetics. DNA is 
unwound and replicated, and then converted into RNA (which is single-stranded rather than 
double-stranded) through a process called transcription, and then the RNA is translated into the 
corresponding protein through a process called translation. These processes are continuously 
occurring in our bodies to maintain every one of our bodily functions.  
Genetic engineering has the ability to change our genome by manipulating our genes 
through biotechnology, which is technology that utilizes living organisms to develop a desired 
product. “Genome engineering technology offers unparalleled potential for modifying human 
and nonhuman genomes. In humans, it holds the promise of curing genetic disease.”6 These

genetic engineering techniques involve the precise modification of DNA through introducing 
mutations and allows for genes to be turned on or off. However, through altering our genetic 
makeup we have the ability to alter our germline, which is what we pass on to our future 
offspring, what our offspring pass on to their offspring, and so on. Our germline consists of germ 
cells that eventually produce sperm and eggs, and therefore contains all of the genetic 
information to be passed on.  
 
The CRISPR-Cas9 Genetic Engineering System 
One specific technology recently introduced to the scientific community is Clustered 
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats- associated protein-9 nuclease (CRISPR-
Cas9), which is used to introduce targeted mutations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) into 
specific gene sequences.7, 8 A palindromic sequence of DNA or RNA is a sequence in which the 
sequence (reading from left to right, or 5’ to 3’) on the template strand matches the sequence 
(reading right to left, also 5’ to 3’) on the complementary strand. Repeats of sequences like these 
are involved in the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Insertions are genetic mutations in which a single base 
or group of bases are inserted into a genetic sequence, deletions are mutations in which a single 
base or group of bases are deleted from a genetic sequence, and a substitution is a mutation in 
which one base is substituted for another. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has many current

applications. Since the CRISPR-Cas9 system has the ability to target and induce mutations in 
one or two alleles, it can mimic heterozygous or homozygous knockout of a specific gene.9 
Therefore, this technology is essentially able to make certain genes inoperative, and in the case 
of gene therapy, it makes mutant, disease-causing alleles inoperative through gene editing. The 
CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering technology can correct genetic defects through introduction 
of new DNA sequences, change DNA sequences in pluripotent embryonic stem cells to culture 
certain specific differentiated tissues, and change germline DNA by altering the DNA in the 
nuclei of reproductive cells. Through modifying the genome of fertilized animal eggs and 
embryos, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has the ability to alter the genetic makeup of every 
differentiated cell in an organism, therefore confirming that the changes will be passed on to the 
offspring of the organism.10  
The CRISPR-Cas9 is a very new technology. CRISPRs were first investigated in the 
2000s and were later discovered in many bacteria and archaea. A few years later, in 2005, 
CRISPR was discovered to be derived from plasmid and viral origins, and it was found that 
CRISPR loci were transcribed. Combined with the observation that the Cas gene encodes 
proteins with nuclease and helicase domains, it was proposed that CRISPR-Cas could be a 
defense mechanism that had RNA memory signatures of past invasions. In 2007, the CRISPR-
Cas-mediated adaptive immunity was proved in Streptococcus thermophilus, and just a year later 
mature CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) were illustrated to be guides in complexes with Cas proteins

and the DNA-targeting activity of CRISPR was determined.11 
 The CRISPR-Cas9 system 
(see Figure 1)12 is derived from the 
bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes 
SF370, and uses specific RNA 
molecules within an RNA duplex 
(tracrRNA:crRNA) from this 
bacteria that have the ability to 
recognize human DNA sequences.13 
It is derived from type II CRISPR-
Cas systems in bacteria that provide 
bacteria with adaptive immunity to 
certain viruses and plasmids. The 
bacterial RNA is used as a guide that leads the endonuclease, the CRISPR-associated protein 
Cas9, to the targeted, matching location in the human genome in order to form base pairs. 14, 15 A 
nuclease is a type of enzyme (biological catalyst that can accelerate chemical reactions) that is

able to cleave nucleic acids, the group of biological molecules that includes DNA and RNA. The 
CRISPR-Cas9 technology is simpler than others as it does not rely on the successful engineering 
of certain proteins that can bind to certain, specific engineering sequences, but rather just the 
correct pairing of RNA and DNA.16 Before CRISPR, it was not possible to precisely change the 
DNA of primates, and now we are able to do this easily and efficiently.17 
More specifically, the formation of base pairs with target DNA sequences that contain tri-
nucleotide protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) allows the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to 
cleave the target DNA, introducing a site-specific double-strand break in the DNA. A double-
strand break in DNA is when both strands of a DNA duplex are cleaved, and if undesired are 
very detrimental and can be potentially lethal. The double-strand breaks in the target DNA 
(which is usually a sequence about twenty-three nucleotides long) are repaired by non-
homologous end-joining or homologous recombination directed repair. 18,19  
The specific, dual tracrRNA:crRNA was engineered in this technology as a single guide 
RNA (sgRNA), and it has two very necessary features for successful use of the technology: a 
specific sequence at the 5’ end of the RNA that determines the DNA target site in the organism

these two features, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology can target any desired DNA sequence.20 Once 
the Cas9 protein is expressed, it forms a riboprotein complex with the sgRNA through 
interactions between what is called the scaffold domain of the sgRNA and positively-charged 
grooves of amino acids on the Cas9 protein that are exposed to the surface. The causes a 
conformational change of Cas9 into the active form that allows it to bind to DNA with the PAM, 
and the spacer sequence of the sgRNA is left free so it can also interact with the DNA.21 After 
association with the double-stranded DNA, Cas9 undergoes further conformational change, 
creating a channel between the two structural lobes of the Cas9 protein that can bind to the RNA-
DNA hybrid and to the stacked dual-RNA structure of the sgRNA. The hinge and bridge 
between these two structural lobes of Cas9, an arginine-rich α-helix, plays a central role in 
binding the sgRNA-target DNA hybrid.22 
 
 
 
 
Other Technologies Similar to the CRISPR-Cas9 System 
Along with the already observed success of modifying human embryos, the CRISPR-
Cas9 system has the benefit of being developed after older, less-successful technologies. The 
CRISPR system was developed to be a more precise and successful technology with potential

use on humans. Before CRISPR, there were (and still are) three other classes of engineering 
nucleases used for the purpose of gene editing: zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like 
nucleases (TALENs), and engineered meganucleases.23 The CRISPR-Cas9 system is the only 
one that utilizes a RNA-guided system, and it is, by far, the most specific of these gene-editing 
technologies. Compared to the other, similar genetic engineering technologies, CRISPR-Cas9 is 
much more advanced in the fact that is it the only one that has the ability to make extremely 
specific edits to the genome that could consist of just one base pair, and then repair the break 
after. 
 
Alzheimer’s Disease 
The CRISPR-Cas9 system has already been proposed for treatment for genetic disease 
and altering human embryos. In the case of certain genetic diseases in humans, more than 50,000 
genetic mutations that are linked to disease are caused by one base change, and most commonly 
that DNA change is from a G-C pair to T-A.24 
Alzheimer’s disease is one neurodegenerative disease in which the genetic components 
are known, and gene therapy is a viable option for Alzheimer’s alleviation. It is a brain disorder 
with symptoms of progressive dementia, loss of memory and thinking ability, and loss of ability 
to do some normal day-day actions (and it worsens over time).25 In Alzheimer’s disease, nerve

cells deteriorate and therefore brain matter decreases (the cortex of the brain and the 
hippocampus are significantly reduced). About 5.5 million Americans currently have 
Alzheimer’s disease, and it is estimated that up to 16 million Americans will have this disease in 
the year 2050.26 There is no single cause of Alzheimer’s disease but rather it is a combination of 
several different gene mutations and related resultant problems. It is primarily caused by two 
factors: β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. β-amyloid plaques are largely caused by 
deposits of 39-43 amino acid-long β-amyloid peptide (which is from a larger β-amyloid 
precursor protein). Neurofibrillary tangles are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.27  
The human tau gene is located on chromosome 17, and the tau protein (a phosphoprotein) 
stimulates tubulin assembly into microtubules in the brain— it is the major microtubule 
associated protein (MAP) of mature neurons.28 Tau is modified post-translationally, and the 
phosphorylation of tau negatively regulates its activity in the production of microtubule 
assembly. The hyperphosphorylation on tau protein its C-terminus end causes the aggregation of 
the protein, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. One possible target for 
neurofibrillary tangle alleviation is to genetically target GSK-3β (glycogen-synthase kinase-3β), 
a kinase that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (a kinase is an enzyme that 
that chemically modifies other proteins by adding phosphate groups). The inhibition of GSK-3β

through genetic means has shown to reverse hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein in mice, and 
it is known that the human body tolerates inhibition of GSK-3β well.29 Targeting the mutated 
genes of tau kinases and tau proteins could lead to alleviation of neurofibrillary tangles in 
Alzheimer’s patients and therefore could alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer’s patients. The MAPT 
(microtubule associated protein tau) gene is the gene that encodes for tau proteins. Mutation of 
the MAPT gene results in the accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, and 
therefore genetically targeting the mutated form of this gene would reduce the instance of 
hyperphosphorylated tau.30 
The other major player of Alzheimer’s disease is accumulation of β-amyloid plaques. β-
amyloid plaques are a result of fragments of an amyloid precursor protein (APP) that harden in 
the brain and become insoluble (and therefore are unable to be eliminated).31 One of the main 
genetic factors in Alzheimer’s disease is apolipoprotein ε-4 (APOE-4), which is a precursor to 
the formation of β-amyloid plaques.32,33 Apolipoprotein E is involved with injury repair in the 
brain. It regulates lipid balance through the mediation of lipid transport into and out of the brain,

which in turn helps with repair. There are three different isoforms of APOE, all of which bind to 
lipids, certain receptors, and β-amyloid proteins, but in different manners.34 It is specifically the 
ε-4 allele that increases likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease, and not the other two isoforms of 
APOE. “Currently, the best arguments [for human implementation of genetic engineering 
technology] might be for eliminating the ε4 variant at the APOE gene (which increases risk for 
Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease).”35 
 
Conclusions 
The science behind both the CRISPR-Cas9 system and Alzheimer’s disease, when 
considered in conjunction, introduces a discussion of them being used together for medical 
benefit. Knowing certain genetic players in Alzheimer’s disease allows us to consider using the 
CRISPR-Cas9 system as possibly gene therapy to target the mutations that eventually lead to 
onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The genetic component of Alzheimer’s disease is 
one that can be examined and easily tested for in human embryos, although it would be very 
difficult to genetically repair brain cells in developed, adult individuals. By genetically 
modifying embryos that have been tested to have the mutations leading to Alzheimer’s may, if 
successful, prove to be a viable therapy for those who would not have other viable options in life. 
There has been more than one human trial showing that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used in 
humans, and other trials are leading towards and testing human embryos. However, although 
possibly successful with further development, there are multiple other aspects of this treatment

III. Scientific and Medical Benefits and Risks 
 
Introduction 
 Along with the many ethical concerns regarding the general field of genetic engineering 
and of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology itself that will be discussed later on in the thesis, there are 
also many benefits and risks from the scientific standpoint that must be considered. Whether or 
 21 
not the scientific technology itself is safe enough to use on humans is especially important to 
consider before analyzing the ethical concerns human use— the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic 
engineering system must have minimal side effects and a very high accuracy rate in order to be 
considered acceptable to use on humans in a clinical setting. There have been other technologies 
similar to CRISPR which make CRISPR an impressive comparison. It is the only technology in 
this field that has introduced the option of clinically alleviating and curing human genetic 
diseases, especially those caused by a single base pair or just a couple base changes. The use of 
the CRISPR-Cas9 technology on humans would also allow further clinical research on inherited 
diseases in humans. However, there are also many off-target, unexpected risks of using CRISPR 
like unpredicted base changes, the creation of mosaic mutations, and double-stranded break 
errors. There have been multiple trials using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit non-human DNA, but most 
recently many that have edited human embryos, some viable and some non-viable. The results of 
each trial, as discussed below, are very similar yet also very different from one another in terms 
of the consequences and just how they were carried out experimentally. However, each trial also 
shows potential scientific benefits and risks of using the CRISPR-Cas9 system on human 
embryos.  
 
Genetic Engineering Trials: Benefits 
 The first attempt at genetically modifying a human embryo in the US occurred in summer 
of 2017 by a research team in Portland, Oregon at Oregon Health and Science University. This 
research team, led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, used the CRISPR system to edit multiple one-cell 
human embryos. According to Mitalipov, the inherited defective genes were edited efficiently, 
and most importantly, edited safely. This means that there were no observed detrimental (and 
 22 
unexpected) off-target effects in the embryos in the trial. After performing the trial, his team 
concluded that with CRISPR, it is possible to avoid off-target, unexpected effects. However, 
none of the embryos developed further than a few days, so the later possible side effects could 
not be examined.36 
 Not only was editing human embryos attempted in the United States, but it was also 
researched and attempted by researchers in China. The Chinese researchers at Sun Yat-sen 
University used CRISPR-Cas9 to alter mutant HBB gene that causes the β-thalassemia human 
disease. In each of their trials, non-viable human embryos were used. Although they were able to 
successfully edit out the mutant HBB gene in one of their trials, they reported multiple off-target 
effects and mosaicism, both which mean that some un-targeted DNA was edited.37 In both of the 
above cases, the germline of the human embryo was altered, whether the target gene was 
completely or only partially edited. 
 One reason Mitalipov’s group overcame the off-target effects and mosaicism was timing. 
Although possibly inapplicable to viable human embryos going through the in-vitro fertilization 
process, his group injected the CRISPR-Cas9 system into eggs at the same time they were 
fertilized with sperm (so at the moment of fertilization and zygote formation). He observed that 
compared to other technologies, it is possible to overcome the side effects for a truly beneficial 
outcome, even though the embryos in question were only observed for a few days. One of the 
largest risks of using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to alter the human genome is the possible 
mosaic outcome, so the ability to overcome this issue is a large discovery in the field. However,

 23 
as stated, the embryos were observed for only a few days so the possible mosaic phenotype may 
have not been observed (although seemingly not visible in the genotype). Mitalipov was also the 
scientist to introduce the world’s first cloned monkey, marking him as a leader in the field of 
genetics.38 
 Without the accidental, unpredicted consequences, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology would 
be beneficial in a clinical setting. The elimination of off-target affects would be one step closer 
to allowing the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology in a clinical setting, and therefore one step 
closer to the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for disease prevention, elimination, and alleviation. If 
clinically used on viable human embryos to go through in-vitro fertilization, it is possible that we 
could alleviate or even eliminate degenerative diseases that greatly affect the human population. 
With these recent discoveries in the CRISPR-Cas9 technology and the more general field of 
genetic engineering as a whole, it is necessary to further research the inherited diseases that 
CRISPR could be used for. This further research on inherited diseases could not only improve 
the outcome of genetically editing mutant genes, but also would improve the alleviation and 
curing of the diseases that are already present in adult humans. 
 As the specific base changes that cause many genetic diseases are known (see chapter 
two), scientist David Liu from Harvard developed the enzyme adenosine deaminase and attached 
it to the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which led to a very efficient process with very few off-target 
effects. In 28 percent of the cells tested by his research group, a mutation was successfully 
reversed with no unintended modifications. In the scientific rather than ethical sense, this

experiment leads CRISPR in a direction for efficient use in permanent modification of mutations 
for therapeutic reasons.39 
 
Genetic Engineering Trials: Risks 
 Although there are clear scientific benefits of using CRISPR and other genetic 
engineering technologies, there are many more scientific risks than benefits that may outweigh 
the benefits in the end. The unknown and known complications of the CRISPR-Cas9 system 
have led high-profile officials, like the US Intelligence agency, to label this gene editing 
technology a “weapon of mass destruction.”40 Officials are worried that it could be used to make 
viruses and plagues that can wipe out crops or severely alter human health. Although this could 
be a large threat to the human population, the US Intelligence Agency was also extremely 
worried about unregulated use of the technology, and how that would transfer over to heritable 
genes. For example, unregulated use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology on humans could allow for 
the editing of physical traits in embryos. The more a certain physical trait was edited out and a 
different one edited in, there is a possibility of eliminating certain physical, hereditable traits. 
 Although CRISPR has been used to modify human embryos in successful trials, the 
unknown side complications like unpredicted base changes, mosaicism, and double-stranded 
breaks could mark CRISPR to be unsuccessful in its current state. The large possibility of off-
target effects means that there is a large possibility of unknown and unexpected detrimental and

maybe fatal complications, as the system could introduce other mutations that cause terrible 
illnesses and malfunctions. The trials that proved CRISPR successful in the modification of 
human embryos only observed the embryos for a few days prior to the experiment, which is not 
enough time to confirm that unexpected off-target effects would not take effect in the future of 
the embryo. There has not been a trial where a human embryo is viable to develop as a normal 
functioning human being (as it has not been approved yet), so the listed consequences are still 
unpredictable. 
 
Possible Unintentional Risks of the CRISPR-Cas9 System Explained 
 Unintended Base Changes 
 The CRISPR-Cas9 technology, as stated previously, can edit out unwanted target genes 
and replace them with the desired gene. However, when changing the bases of the genome, more 
than just the target gene may be edited. Just a single base insertion, where one base is entered 
into the base sequence, or a single base deletion, where one base is deleted from the base 
sequence, can cause translation errors that affect a large portion of the genome and possibly 
change the target gene to an unwanted product. This unpredicted translation error (the processes 
of transitioning RNA to proteins in the body) in the hereditable portion of the genome would 
cause permanent, possibly detrimental or even fatal consequences later in life. All edits made by 
the CRISPR-Cas9 system are permanent. It can also only be used where cells are actively 
dividing, as the Cas9 machinery is linked to cell division.41 The unintended, off-target gene edits 
caused by CRISPR is one of the largest and most scientifically and ethically concerning aspect of

 26 
the technology. For example, one CRISPR-Cas9 trial on viable embryos in China was attempting 
to correct the beta 41-42 mutation, which causes beta-thalassemia, but instead of fixing it another 
mutation was introduced instead.42 However, there has been one recent modification to CRISPR, 
where the Cas13 protein is used instead of Cas9, so that edits can be made to transient genetic 
material and the changes are reversible. An alteration of the CRISPR-Cas9 system similar to this 
would allow changes to be reversible, and any detrimental effects could be reversed if necessary. 
Therefore, it could fix certain genetic mutations without affecting the genome.43

 27 
 Besides unintended base 
changes, another risk of the CRISPR 
gene editing technology is mosaicism. 
One Chinese research team at the Third 
Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou 
Medical University carried out a 
CRISPR trial on viable human 
embryos with a heritable disease that 
were donated by patients of in-vitro fertilization, and actually had more success than their trials 
on non-viable human embryos. This research team was the same team that carried out the beta 
41-42 mutation trial in China. However, the largest consequence they encountered with the 
CRISPR technology was the creation of a mosaic embryo. In the cases of these embryos, the 
G6PD gene (which was the target gene), was completely turned off instead of edited. 
“[Mosaicism] would need to be solved before the methods could be used clinically to correct a 
disease” said Robin Lovell-Badge of the Francis Crick institute in London.44 Mosaic embryos 
are embryos that have a mixture of edited and non-edited cells (see Figure 2).45 With only partial 
editing of the embryo, it is still possible that the child would still grow up with the disease in 
question.46 This consequence occurs when the Cas9 mRNA is translated at a later developmental

stage than the sg RNA, so various different alleles result.47 One possible remedy for this problem 
would be to edit the eggs and sperm separately before fertilization, but that has not been 
attempted yet. Another hypothesis in the reduction of mosaic mutations is the promotion of 
degradation of the Cas9 protein. The prolonged expression of Cas9 in embryos could contribute 
to the creation of mosaic DNA mutations, so tagging Cas9 with ubiquitin in order to degrade it 
faster could reduce the mosaic mutations. It has been proven that tagging Cas9 with ubiquitin 
reduces its half-life and reduces the number of mosaic mutations. However, this has only been 
tested on monkeys and not human embryos.48 With mosaic mutations, “only about half the 
embryos will lead to live births, and of those that do, many could contain a mixture of cells with 
edited DNA and without,” according to Guoping Feng of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain 
Research.49  
 Double-Stranded Breaks 
 One last large complication of the CRISPR system is the induction of unwanted, extra 
double-stranded breaks. CRISPR induces a double-stranded break in order to edit the DNA. 
Normally the break is rejoined by non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair 
mechanisms, but when an extra break is induced that was unintended it may not be repaired by 
the specific mechanisms. There also may be an issue that the intended double-stranded break is

never made at all. For example, studies have shown that a single mis-match in the sgRNA and 
target strands of DNA can prevent the Cas9-mediated cleavage. There are currently methods to 
predict off-target breaks when Cas9 is used in vivo, but not in vitro and the off-target effects 
could be very different between the two.50 The addition or removal of a double-stranded break in 
the DNA involved with the CRISPR-Cas9 system is not the only issue related to double-stranded 
breaks. Inaccurate repair of CRISPR-Cas9-induced DNA breaks could introduce other 
unintended mutations, although with the current technology this is very unlikely.51  
 Possible Risks of the CRISPR-Cas9 System: Conclusions 
 The possible complications of unintended base changes, mosaicism, and double-stranded 
breaks have the potential to create medical problems far greater than those that are needing to be 
fixed in the first place. For example, they could contribute to cell suicide (apoptosis) and the 
creation of cancer cells.52 
 The scientific benefits and risks of the current CRISPR-Cas9 technology are very 
contradictory as different trials have provided evidence for both the success and overcoming 
obstacles or the inability to. Each trial has its own caveat that makes the trials difficult to 
compare to each other. Whether or not viable or non-viable embryos were used, or how long 
each trial embryo was observed after and what they were testing, are all different variables that 
need to be taken into account when comparing the scientific benefits and risks of the CRISPR-

Cas9 system for use in humans. The most important aspects are the effects on human embryos, 
especially those that are viable, and whether or not any unpredicted consequences are observed. 
Scientific Risks and Benefits: Alzheimer’s Disease  
 In reference to Alzheimer’s disease, there are risk genes and deterministic genes. The risk 
genes are those that increase the likelihood of inheriting the disease, and the deterministic genes 
directly cause the disease. There are variations in three certain genes that are inherited and will 
directly cause Alzheimer’s disease: the amyloid precursor protein, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2. 
Variations in presenilin-1 are the most common cause of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. 
Although solely-inherited Alzheimer’s disease accounts for only 1% of Alzheimer’s cases, the 
inherited risk genes play a large role in all other cases as well. The risk gene with the largest 
known impact is apolipoprotein ε-4 (APOE-4).53 With the large genetic component of 
Alzheimer’s, the scientific advances to the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering technology could 
eventually lead to alleviation of Alzheimer’s disease symptoms or complete eradication of the 
genetic mutations that cause the disease (and therefore elimination of the mutant disease genes 
from the germline). However, from a scientific standpoint, do the benefits outweigh the risks? 
 Using the data from the trials carried out with human embryos, the CRISPR-Cas9 
technology is not scientifically advanced enough to use on viable human embryos before in-vitro 
fertilization. Although some trials have discussed and tested methods to reduce or eliminate the 
complications of off-target effects and mosaic mutations, they have not been 100% effective, and 
for use on unborn humans, there needs to be a much larger success rate than was shown (as little 
as one to three embryos per trial were successful without visible off-target effects). Even though 
genetic engineering on the human germline has progressed further than anyone thought or

imagined it would, it still is not in the stage to be used on humans. Especially with the possible 
off-target base changes and creation of mosaic mutations, any introduction of a mutation that 
would cause the embryo in question to grow up and not live a normal, healthy life (even with the 
original target disease edited out) may not be worth the risk (especially if we do not know what 
that off-target mutation may do).  
Conclusions 
With more research on the technology, the reduction of these unpredicted, unwanted off-
target effects, whether it be base changes, mosaic mutations, or double-stranded break errors, 
would be reduced. However, there does still need to be an improvement scientifically in the 
technology before it can really be used to alleviate or eradicate any human, genetic disease in 
human embryos that will later grow up and live a normal life.  
Biologist Guoping Feng of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research said in 2015 
that he “thinks actual gene-edited humans are ‘10 to 20 years away.’”54 Feng also explained that 
at the time, making specific edits with CRISPR, like editing or swapping DNA bases, works only 
about 20% of the time.55 Although a couple of years have passed since this statement and the 
technology has improved, the percentage is still not where it needs to be for the scientific 
benefits of using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology on humans to outweigh the risks. One thought of 
scientists in the field is to combine the CRISPR-Cas9 technology with the current research in 
stem cells in order to generate a higher success rate. With the stem cells, scientists can edit genes

in stem cells before turning them into an egg or sperm for fertilization.56 Although this has not 
been done yet, it would help bring the gene editing technology a step closer for human use. With 
further research and improvement, however, the scientific and medical benefits could outweigh 
the risks of using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology on human embryos. 
IV. Analyzing the Ethical Considerations of Genetic Engineering 
 
Chapter Introduction 
In this section of the thesis, I am going to analyze the ethical arguments for and against 
the use of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology on human embryos in order to eliminate or alleviate 
Alzheimer’s disease. In order to accomplish this, I will present two case studies that relate to the 
use of the CRISPR-Cas9 engineering technology on human embryos and apply the two major 
theories of bioethics, deontological theory and consequentialist theory, the four major principles 
of medical ethics, respect for patient autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice, and 
the current religious and public views to each case. 
 
Medical Ethics Background 
The field of medical ethics applies to all clinical medicine practices and clinically-related 
scientific research. There are four principles to be considered in discussing the field of medical 
ethics: respect for patient autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. When 
considering medical ethics in terms of genetic engineering, and especially in terms of altering a 
human embryo, many of these theories and principles may be violated.

 33 
 
Two Theories of Bioethics Background 
It is imperative to understand the major theories of bioethics along with the four 
principles of medical ethics in order to analyze the ethical question at hand. There are two 
theories of bioethics: deontology and consequentialism. The theory of deontology was 
formulated by Immanuel Kant and follows rules based ethics. This theory states that we must not 
violate rules which depend on rational thought, and we must not intentionally harm someone 
else. In order to decide whether something is ethically justifiable or not, one must be capable of 
rational thought. In this theory, there are certain obligations and commitments that we cannot 
violate, regardless of the outcome (i.e. even if the outcome is ideal), and we cannot use other 
humans for the purpose of achieving our goals. One of the largest aspects of deontology is that 
we cannot lie. Kant also states, as a part of deontological theory, that no person can be simply 
used to fulfill one’s own goals, and we cannot intentionally harm. 
 The consequentialist theory, formulated by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, is 
quite similar to an economic theory. This theory focuses on the outcomes of behavior, and is 
therefore commonly contrasted to deontological theory. It judges whether something is ethically 
justifiable or not based on what a behavior produces and not the path it took to get to that 
outcome. According to consequentialism, we are trying to achieve the greatest good for the 
greatest number of people, which is similar to a cost-benefit analysis. Contrary to deontology, 
consequentialists will sacrifice individuals to save the many and achieve personal goals. 
 
Case Study 1: Introduction 
 34 
In this section, I am answering the following question: Is it ethically justifiable to use the 
CRISPR-Cas9 technology, in its current condition, to eliminate risk or determinate genes of 
Alzheimer’s disease? In order to answer this question, I propose the following scenario: 
 A middle-aged couple had been attempting to conceive a child and they just found out 
that the woman is pregnant. They have both been screened for their genetic makeup, and the 
father is positive for the mutated apolipoprotein ε-4 (APOE-4) gene that is the major precursor 
for the formation of β-amyloid plaques, and therefore a large precursor for Alzheimer’s disease. 
Worried about the possible inheritance of this gene, the couple decides to screen their embryo for 
the APOE-4 gene. They have the belief that they should do anything and everything to make sure 
that their child has the best and longest life possible. After screening, it is determined that the 
embryo also carries the mutated APOE-4 gene that is a precursor for Alzheimer’s. They decide 
that they want to use current genetic engineering technology, the CRISPR-Cas9 system, in order 
to edit out the mutated gene and replace it with a normal one. However, the couple’s physician is 
skeptical about using the technology in its current state to perform this procedure. Is it ethically 
justifiable for the couple and the physician to do go ahead with the editing of the embryo? My 
conclusion, as shown in the arguments below, is that at the current state of the CRISPR-Cas9 
technology, it is not ethically justifiable for the couple to edit out the mutated APOE-4 gene from 
their growing embryo. 
 
Case Study 1: Analyzing Deontological Theory 
 Editing the mutated gene out of the couple’s embryo would violate major aspects of 
deontological theory. First of all, it can be argued that the couple is not currently relying on 
rational thought. Although it could be argued that wanting to do everything for your child is 
 35 
rational, in this case the parents are not scientists that know the small details of the unintended 
consequences, even if they have been informed of these consequences by their physician. They 
are trying to do everything possible to help their child, and even though editing out the mutated 
gene is possible, it is not rationally okay to do in its current state. As stated in the previous 
section, the scientific issues of unintended base changes and mosaicism could lead to 
consequences we have not yet discovered or predicted. Even though the couple wants to use it to 
possibly eliminate the risk of Alzheimer’s or alleviate later symptoms of Alzheimer’s in their 
future child, they are not considering the possible side effects. Although Alzheimer’s could be 
gone, many other complications, which possibly could be fatal, could arise from the use of the 
CRISPR-Cas9 system. 
 From the physician and scientist standpoint, the physician would be violating 
deontological theory as he would be using someone else in order to reach his own goal of 
eliminating and/or alleviating Alzheimer’s disease, especially knowing that there could be 
possible consequences. Deontological theory states that we cannot use others to achieve personal 
goals. He has the obligation to give the best possible care to each patient he encounters, and to 
make sure that he helps the patient become as healthy as possible. Knowing that there are 
possible detrimental consequences of using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology in its current state 
would be violating the commitment he made when he became a physician. 
Kant places a lot of emphasis on the importance of the rational person, and how humans 
must be considered rational in order to make the decision of what is right and wrong. Around the 
age of 12-15, Kant allows children moral status because they are then capable of rational 
thought. According to this theory, embryos are not capable of rational thought and do not have 
moral standing. However, the embryos will eventually develop into infants and later adults with 
 36 
a moral standing. Kant would originally discount the moral standing of embryos, but they do 
have potential to eventually develop rational thought, which must be considered in the 
deontological analysis of each of the following case studies. In the real world, deontological 
theory would not apply to these embryos that we are able to genetically manipulate until they are 
capable of rational thought. 
Kant also states, as a part of deontological theory, that no person can be simply used to 
fulfill one’s own goals. This applies in the sense that embryos cannot give consent at the time 
they would be edited, and when they reach the point of rational thought we have already violated 
the prohibition against using them for our own personal goals without their permission and 
consent. 
 
Case Study 1: Analyzing Consequentialist Theory 
 Not only through the theory of deontology, but also through the consequentialist theory, 
the gene editing of this embryo would not be ethically justifiable. In this theory, we are trying to 
act in a way where the outcome produces the greatest good for the greatest number. In the 
scenario described above, the physician would be editing a gene that is in the embryo’s germline, 
which means that the edited would be passed on to future generations. Since the CRISPR-Cas9 
technology is not at the current state of a 100% success rate, or even a very high success rate, he 
could be causing more harm to the masses than good, which would violate this aspect of 
consequentialism. Through a cost-benefit analysis (as this theory is similar to economic 
theories), the risk of harm resulting from performing this procedure in this scenario greatly 
outweighs the benefits, as the unpredicted consequences could end up to be more fatal than 
Alzheimer’s.  
 37 
 Unlike the theory of deontology, however, the consequentialist theory allows for sacrifice 
of the individual to save the many (i.e. one is able to use others to accomplish personal goals). 
Following this principle, it would be okay to try to edit the germline of this embryo in order to 
observe the outcome. Even if the outcome were detrimental rather than successful, it would still 
provide new research and new observations on what may happen when altering a human embryo, 
and therefore could help the masses in the future. However, this still would violate the other 
concepts of consequentialist theory. 
 Going along with the same concept of providing the greatest good for the greatest 
number, it could also be argued the opposite way, that it would not be providing good for the 
greatest number. Using CRISPR-Cas9, with its known complications, could easily cause more 
harm than good, as stated above, especially in the discussion of editing the germline and not just 
somatic cells. In this sense, using the technology and harming the human embryo would not 
provide the greatest good to the greatest number as it would not only harm the human embryo 
but also emotionally harm the parents and others involved in the procedure, as well as harm all of 
the future offspring of the embryo. 
 
Case Study 1: Analyzing Non-Maleficence 
 The physician, in this case, is also clearly violating the medical ethics principle of non-
maleficence. This principle requires that we do not intentionally harm any patient, whether it be 
from performing an act or not performing one at all.57 We currently do not have confirmed 
knowledge that using the CRISPR-Cas9 system will not introduce harmful consequences, but we 
do know that it will introduce consequences as mosaicism and unintended base changes. With 
                                                     
57 McCormick, T. R. (2013). Principles of Bioethics. Retrieved from  
 https://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/tools/princpl.html. 
 38 
this knowledge, although we also do not know exactly what the unintended consequences may 
lead to in the future, the physician could not perform this gene editing procedure while also 
following the principle of nonmaleficence. 
 
Case Study 1: Analyzing Beneficence 
Similar to violating the concept of producing the greatest good for the greatest number, 
editing out the mutant Alzheimer’s gene in this embryo would violate the medical ethics 
principle of beneficence. Beneficence states that physicians have the duty to take steps towards 
removing harm from any patient and to always be of benefit to the patient.58 Since CRISPR, in 
its current state, does not have a high success rate (i.e., a low rate of unintended consequences), 
the physician would not be fulfilling his duty of intentionally providing benefit and taking 
positive steps to help the patient, and in this case, the human embryo. On the contrary, in 
knowing all of the possible consequences, the physician would really be harming the patient. The 
principle of beneficence includes preventing harm and doing good along with removing harm. In 
this scenario, the physician would not be preventing harm as he, again, does not know what the 
possible consequences are. Although not removing the mutant gene would allow the human 
embryo to grow into someone who develops Alzheimer’s disease, the unexpected consequences 
of the CRISPR-Cas9 system may cause other, more harmful consequences, and therefore 
performing the procedure would not be preventing harm but rather causing harm. Lastly, 
although it may seem as if the physician is doing good in this scenario by preventing or 
alleviating Alzheimer’s disease in the viable human embryo, once again the unintended 
consequences like unexpected base changes and mosaicism may end up being worse or more 
                                                     
58 McCormick, T. R. (2013). Principles of Bioethics. Retrieved from  
 https://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/tools/princpl.html. 
 39 
quickly fatal, in which case the physician would not be doing good to the patient or the patient’s 
family. 
 
Case Study 1: Analyzing Religious Views 
 From a religious perspective, the physician could also be construed as “playing God” in 
this scenario. By choosing whether or not to carry out the gene editing process, he is essentially 
choosing when and how the child may live and die. He is deciding whether or not the child could 
develop Alzheimer’s disease or not, and he knows that there are possible, unpredicted 
detrimental outcomes if he chooses to go ahead with the procedure. In this case he is violating 
some essential rules of being a human bring from a religious perspective because he as a person 
may not be in the position to decide whether to do right or wrong because he is not God. 
 
Case Study 1: Conclusions 
 In applying deontological and consequentialist theories and the principles of 
nonmaleficience and beneficence, and in considering some oppositional religious views, it can be 
concluded that with the CRISPR-Cas9 in its current technological state, it would be unethical to 
edit the mutant gene out of the viable human embryo in question. Even “the American Medical 
Association, holds that germ-line engineering shouldn’t be done ‘at this time’ because it ‘affects 
the welfare of future generations’ and could cause ‘unpredictable and irreversible results.’”59 It 
violates major aspects of both the deontological theory and the consequentialist theory of 
bioethics and therefore it cannot be concluded that it is ethically justifiable to use the CRISPR-

Cas9 system to edit out the APOE-4 gene that is a precursor for Alzheimer’s disease in the 
human embryo. 
 The main basis of concluding that is it not ethically justifiable to edit the mutant gene out 
of the visible human embryo in question is the fact that the CRISPR-Cas9 system is not in a 
scientifically current acceptable state for use on humans, and still has many problems to 
overcome.  
 
 
Case Study 2: Introduction 
What if the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering technology was acceptable for use in 
humans (in that the unintended consequences were completely avoided), and rarely ever made 
mistakes? Would it be ethically justifiable to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system, when it is at the 
point of an extremely low off-target effect rate, to eliminate risk or determinate genes of 
Alzheimer’s disease? In order to answer this question, I propose the following scenario: 
 We project ourselves into a future in which multiple studies and trials with the CRISPR-
Cas9 system have been performed, and the off-target effects like mosaicism, unpredicted base 
changes, etc. (the problems explained in the previous chapter) have been reduced to a 1% 
occurrence rate. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has recently been implemented in a small number of 
premier hospitals and research centers around the world, with only few in America (in large 
metropolitan cities as Houston, New York City, and Boston), in order to edit mutant and possibly 
fatal genes in genetically screened human embryos. At this point in time, the CRISPR-Cas9 
system is only being used in a clinical setting to edit mutant genes that are the sources of genetic 
diseases that are eventually fatal or cause an extremely painful and poor quality of life. The price 
 41 
to screen your fertilized embryo for the diseases that are being edited by CRISPR-Cas9, attend a 
diagnostic appointment with a physician and scientist who will perform the procedure, and have 
the procedure done with follow up appointments is extremely expensive (although the price to 
perform the procedure with CRISPR-Cas9 is actually very low), and only very little if any of 
these costs are covered by private insurance (none of the process covered by Medicare of 
Medicaid, or any government subsidized public insurance). “An in-vitro fertilization procedure 
costs about $20,000 in the United States. Add genetic testing and egg donation or a surrogate 
mother, and the price soars to $100,000,” and that is without the use of CRISPR-Cas9 to actually 
edit out the gene.60  
 A young wealthy, upper-class couple from a small town in the mid-west has one middle-
school aged daughter who learned the basics of genes and DNA in her science class and asked 
her parents if she could be genetically screened, as one of her classmates had been and shared 
about it in her class. Her parents agreed and decided to also get screened. Once their results came 
back, both the mother and the daughter realized that they were positive for the mutated APOE-4 
gene that is the major precursor for the formation of β-amyloid plaques, and therefore a large 
precursor for Alzheimer’s disease. Although the daughter did not know what that meant, the 
mother, who had to undergo in-vitro fertilization to have her daughter, was very worried about 
her daughter and her next child (as she and her husband were planning to have at least one other 
child). 
 Once the couple, who had a very good private insurance plan, was ready to have their 
next child, again via in-vitro fertilization, they decided to screen the fertilized embryo for the 
mutated APOE-4 gene. The results showed that the embryo they were planning to implant was 
                                                     
60 Regalado, A. (2015). Engineering the Perfect Baby. MIT Technology Review. Retrieved from
 https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/. 
 42 
positive for the mutated APOE-4 gene. The couple decided to schedule an initial appointment 
with the physician and scientist who could perform the CRISPR-Cas9 procedure at the nearest 
hospital to them, which was a two-hour flight away. The physician and scientist jointly decided 
that the couple was a good candidate to undergo CRISPR-Cas9 editing to edit the mutated 
APOE-4 gene out of their embryo. Although insurance did not cover the procedure, the couple 
had enough money to go forward with the process. 
 Even though, at this hypothetical point in time, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology is 
scientifically sound and makes very minimal, if any, errors, is it ethically justifiable for the 
couple, physician, and scientist to go through with the procedure? My conclusion, as shown in 
the arguments below, is that even with an almost-perfected CRISPR-Cas9 technology (almost-
perfected as there are always risks of any clinical procedure), in considering the principle of 
justice in the distribution of scarce resources, it is still not ethically justifiable for the couple to 
edit out the mutated APOE-4 gene from their growing embryo until the technology is much more 
accessible around the world. 
 
 
Case Study 2: Analyzing Justice 
 Performing the clinical procedure of editing out the mutant genes with the CRISPR-Cas9 
system violates the principle of justice. This principle requires the fair distribution of goods in 
the healthcare system, and that equal people should be able to receive equal treatment.61 
According to the principle of distributive justice, the criteria for the just allocation of scarce 
medical resources includes the following: “to each, an equal share; to each, according to need; to 
                                                     
61 McCormick, T. R. (2013). Principles of Bioethics. Retrieved from  
 https://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/tools/princpl.html. 
 
 43 
each, according to effort; to each, according to contribution; to each, according to merit; and to 
each, according to the ability to pay.”62 
 In this scenario, which is a very likely case once the technology is at the point where it 
can successfully and accurately perform this procedure, the couple is very wealthy and has the 
ability to travel across the country in order to meet with the doctors that can perform the 
procedure, and they have the ability to pay for the whole process out of pocket (rather than it 
being covered by insurance). For any kind of medical procedure of the like, only the very few 
who can afford the travel and the cost of the medical portion itself are able to go through with 
this process. The accessibility is also very limited, as it is, in this scenario, only performed at 
very few hospitals around the world. Is this fair to those with the same problem, but not the same 
financial stability? “What if these improvements were only available to the richest societies, or 
the richest people?”63 There must be some fairness in the distribution of technology and scarce 
resources like the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system.  
 From a financial aspect, the fairness of medical treatment is a large issue in our current 
society and in this specific scenario. It can be argued that it would not be ethically justifiable to 
perform this procedure on this specific family because this family is only one of the extreme few 
who could follow through with it, and then the only embryos that would have the disease edited 
out would be those of wealthy upper-class families. Since this clinical procedure is not covered 
by insurance, it would be extremely expensive. Therefore, a new gap between rich and poor 
would be created. In this case, Alzheimer’s disease would eventually shift to only be present in 
those families who were not as financially stable, as the general cost of the treatment is

extremely expensive. In order to remedy this issue with distributive justice, a much more 
expansive financial plan needs to be implemented. Whether the treatment is covered only partly 
or fully, it would need to be covered by both private and public insurance policies. If not covered 
by insurance, the price would need to be reduced or an association be created that would finance 
the procedure for those who do not have the funds to pay for it at the more expensive price. 
Without fixing the financial instability and cost, there would be no distributive justice in a 
financial aspect, and the gap created would render the technology ethically un-justifiable. 
Another reason the procedure is only accessible in few hospitals and few countries is due 
to the views of genetic engineering. For example, in a study conducted in the United Kingdom, 
“the public’s ethical concerns [regarding genetic engineering] are associated with applications 
involving the use of animals or of human genetic material,” and a large portion of those concerns 
are based on the “’unnaturalness’” of altering animal and human genetic material.64 In “western 
Europe, 15 of 22 nations prohibit the modification of the germ line. Although the United States 
has not officially prohibited germline modification, the US National Institutes of Health’s 
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee explicitly states that it ‘will not at present entertain 
proposals for germ line alterations.’”65 Although using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology in some of 
these areas may not be banned or illegal, in countries that have an extreme negative attitude 
towards using the technology on human genetic material, the procedure may not be accessible. 
Also, “in China, an invention that contravenes social moral principle cannot be granted patent

right.”66 If it is not available in certain countries or areas like this, people may have to travel 
further and therefore spend much more money solely on travel and lodging expenses, which 
would polarize the distribution of the CRISPR-Cas9 resources even more (to where it is available 
to a much smaller, wealthier group of people only). This would further violate the medical ethics 
principle of justice. 
 From a healthcare perspective, the distribution of this resource would also be extremely 
unfair and unequal. This procedure would have to be in effect with little risk for a long period of 
time before it would be largely or fully covered by private healthcare companies, and even much 
longer for public or government subsidized healthcare policies. Therefore, even if it were 
partially covered by healthcare, only those with very good, private healthcare plans would be 
able to afford the procedure. Therefore, only the wealthy who are able to pay for the more 
expensive and higher-coverage healthcare plans would be truly able to pay, so the only people 
able that would have the procedure covered by their healthcare plan would be those who could 
probably afford to pay for it out-of-pocket in the first place. It would only further the two-class 
system of healthcare. The coverage of this procedure by all healthcare plans is very, very far into 
the future (if it would even happen at all), especially with how new the technology is, even after 
more years of research to when the technology makes very little to no off-target, unpredicted 
changes. There would be no distributive justice under these circumstances. 
 
Case Study 2: Analyzing Deontological Theory 
 From a deontological perspective, editing the mutated APOE-4 gene out of the couple’s 
new, in-vitro, viable embryo would still not be ethically justifiable. One main statement of 
                                                     
66 Peng, Y. (2016). The morality and ethics governing CRISPR–Cas9 patents in China. 
NatureBiotechnology, 34(6), 616–618. https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3590. 
 46 
deontological theory is that we must not violate rules, and there are certain obligations and 
commitments we cannot violate, regardless of outcome. Two of the rules is that we may not use 
others to achieve personal goals, and that one must be of moral standing and have rational 
thought to make decisions (especially those of right or wrong). In this case, the argument is the 
same as in the first case study. The embryo is not able to make its own decisions, as it does not 
yet have moral standing and cannot make rational thoughts. Although it will develop into a 
human who can, at the moment it cannot, so the parents would be making their decision based on 
what they think is best. This would be fulfilling their goals through using the child. 
The CRISPR-Cas9 system “is likely to power a new generation of gene treatments for 
serious diseases,” but is that it?67 One of the main concerns of the public (whether CRISPR-Cas9 
is scientifically accurate or not) is that the CRISPR-Cas9 technology will be used for editing that 
goes much further than editing out mutant genes that cause terrible diseases, for example, using 
it to create “a dystopia of super-people and designer babies for those who can afford it,” and 
down a further slippery slope in which “’most of the public does not appreciate.’”68 The main 
fear is that “if germ-line engineering becomes part of medical practice, it could lead to 
transformative changes in human well-being, with consequences to people’s life-span, identity, 
and economic output.”69 The negative views of CRISPR-Cas9 seem to be becoming even more 
negative as the thoughts of “designer babies” and “editing the human race” have been coming

into light. 
 Although the CRISPR-Cas9 system is being analyzed in order to eliminate or alleviate 
disease, specifically Alzheimer’s disease, would even just that lead to an era of human 
augmentation and enhancement? For example, people with a specific variant of the Amyloid 
precursor protein are protected against Alzheimer’s and dementia, so they remain very sharp in 
old age compared to those who do not have the variant. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce that 
variant into someone could be construed as enhancing that human rather than just protecting him 
or her from a harmful disease.70 The use of this technology to make people just a bit sharper, 
smarter, more athletic, more disease-resistant, etc. would be bordering, if not crossing the line of 
what is considered an acceptable use of this technology. However, humans with rational thought 
did create this technology, so its use, in any scenario, could be argued to be rational, even though 
that argument does not outweigh the argument against using CRISPR-Cas9 for anything but 
disease prevention. 
 
Case Study 2: Analyzing Consequentialist Theory 
Consequentialist theory can be used to argue both for and against the ethical justifiability 
of use of CRISPER-Cas9. From one standpoint of a consequentialist theorist, using the CRISPR-
Cas9 technology to edit out the mutant APOE-4 gene in this scenario (where the technology is 
scientifically sound and extremely accurate), is not ethically justifiable. The consequentialist 
theory requires that we act in a way where the outcome produces the greatest good for the 
                                                     
70 Regalado, A. (2015). Engineering the Perfect Baby. MIT Technology Review. Retrieved from
 https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/. 
 48 
greatest number of people. Using this technology would create the greatest good for the greatest 
number by editing out the mutant APOE-4 gene, but if the technology went any further than this 
it could have the ability to eliminate a certain population of certain gene pool which would do 
the opposite of what consequentialist theory calls to do. Eliminating a certain gene pool or 
certain physical aspects would lead to less diversity and variety around the world, which would 
not be providing the greatest good for the greatest number. 
From another standpoint of a consequentialist theorist, using the CRISPR-Cas9 
technology to edit out the mutant APOE-4 gene in this scenario is ethically justifiable. As stated 
above, the consequentialist theory calls to act in a way where the outcome produces the greatest 
good for the greatest number of people, regardless of the steps it took to get to the outcome. In 
any case where the germ-line, and therefore what will be passed on to later generations, is edited, 
any gene editing technology must be questioned.  
However, in this scenario, eliminating or even just alleviating Alzheimer’s disease in this 
one embryo would produce greater good than harm for the greatest number of people, as the 
parents are happy and the viable embryo will have a less extreme case of Alzheimer’s disease or 
not develop Alzheimer’s disease at all (and will also affect later generations). Also, through the 
argument of possibly making enhanced humans, whether it be with greater intelligence or a 
different trait (even though it is still not completely clear how genetics affect individual 
intelligence), this technology could cause further developments and innovations that could 
change the world for the better by increasing problem-solving and entrepreneurial skills.71 
Although not the same as in the last chapter, this could still bring about very different unintended

 https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/. 
 49 
consequences for the human race, as certain children would be more intelligent or superior in 
some other way due to the ability of the parents to afford the procedure. But this begs the 
question, are we in a post-ethics technological world? Through analyzing the current views and 
arguments on the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, I personally do not yet think we are because the 
topic of editing humans, and many other topics similar, are still highly debated and thought of 
negatively. However, we could be on the path towards one. 
 
Case Study 2: Analyzing Religion 
From a religious standpoint, performing this procedure may be construed as human 
beings “playing God,” and therefore violating the rules of human life. Certain areas of the world 
have different religious-based opinions on this technology. For example, “life science research in 
China does not encounter the same religious objections compared with the West and research 
based on CRISPR–Cas9 technology, such as using such gene-editing technology in human 3PN 
zygotes, does not provoke the same level of controversy.”72 The Christian Research Institute, in 
contrast, states that  
“Christians must focus on questions of disease versus enhancement, the 
purpose(s) of medicine, and the dangers involved in possibly releasing new (and 
unintended) harmful genes into the human gene pool. The primary purpose of 
                                                     
72 Peng, Y. (2016). The morality and ethics governing CRISPR–Cas9 patents in China. Nature    
Biotechnology, 34(6), 616–618. https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3590. 
 
 50 
medicine ought to be, in Nigel Cameron’s words, ‘a tradition of healing.’”73  
The Christian Research Institute also explains that through the analysis of Christian 
Doctrine, “We lack both the wisdom and purity necessary to decide matters of human 
‘perfection.’ It is, therefore, immoral to use such genetic technologies as human eugenics.”74 
These statements and arguments are discussed due to the ability to pick and choose genes to be 
edited before a human is even born, which is also one of the many reasons why gene editing was 
added to the threat list as a possible “weapon of mass destruction and proliferation” by the US 
intelligence community in 2016.75 
 
Case Study 2: Conclusions 
 Using the CRISPR-Cas9 engineering technology to solely edit out detrimental, mutant 
disease genes, like the mutant genes that cause Alzheimer’s disease, is ethically justifiable when 
the technology is in a state of almost perfect accuracy. However, there are still major problems 
relating to justice, as well as violations of deontological and consequentialist theory in the 
analysis of this case study. Not only this, but there are also large fears of other use of the 
technologically (creating a slippery slope) that would not render it ethically justifiable even if it

is in a state of perfect accuracy, as it could also affect the human race and evolution through 
other, more physically apparent edits.  
 
 
 
Chapter 4 Conclusions 
From the two case studies discussed above, it can be concluded that it is not ethically 
justifiable to use CRISPR to edit the germline of a human embryo. The violations of the most of 
the principles of medical ethics (the first case study relates to beneficence and nonmaleficence, 
and the second relates to justice), as well as of deontological and consequentialist theories, 
greatly outweigh the ethical benefits of using the technology on human embryos, whether it be in 
the technology’s current state or in a state where detrimental side effects have been eliminated 
and it is at an almost-perfect accuracy. 
Although I concluded that the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology is not ethically 
justifiable for use in either scenario, a hard set of limits of where application of this technology is 
ethically justifiable could be introduced that would make the public have a more positive view of 
not only the CRISPR-Cas9 technology but also any other genetic engineering technology for use 
on humans.

V. Proposed Limitations of the CRISPR-Cas9 System 
 
“Scientists are developing ways to edit the DNA of tomorrow’s children. Should they stop 
before it’s too late?”76 
 
The limits that need to be set on the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, when used to modify the 
germline of human subjects, range across all aspects of the ethical arguments outlined above. 
Although we currently are not in an age where this technology is openly and widely used on 
humans, the limitations for future use need to be addressed as the technology is coming closer 
and closer to human use every day. The main limitation, and the most concerning to the general 
public, would address how far we should be allowed to take this technology and what exactly we 
should use the technology for. 
 The use of genetic engineering, and especially the CRISPR-Cas9 system, on humans 
could be used for much more than editing out and replacing one specific gene. If we were to 
develop the technology to an almost perfect accuracy, using it to edit out and replace genes that 
would cause detrimental and possibly fatal diseases would be the best possible outcome. 
However, once the technology gets that far it could and may also be used to many other

 https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/. 
 
 53 
procedures. For example, if we were able to edit out a gene causing Alzheimer’s disease and 
replace it with a non-mutated gene, we could also edit out a gene for a certain physical trait and 
replace it with a different physical trait. “’There are moral and ethical issues, but one of the 
profound questions is just the appreciation that if germ-line editing is conducted in humans, that 
is changing human evolution.’”77 Although most physical traits like hair color, skin color, eye 
color, etc. are determined by the combination of multiple genes, even changing one of those 
genes could very likely lead to the embryo being born with the desired trait or a trait much more 
similar to the desired trait than the original. The genetic determination of other human traits, like 
athleticism and intelligence, is not fully known for humans, although it is known that genetics 
play some role for both of them and other traits of the like. There is constant research on these 
traits and their genetic components, so with more research in the time it would take to perfect the 
CRISPR-Cas9 technology, editing genes in human embryos to make the child smarter or more 
intelligent could be a realistic possibility. These thoughts culminate into the main fear of the 
public: using this technology to have superior children, or “designer babies.”78 
 Playing into this fear would also be the financial aspect of using genetic engineering to 
alter the genetic makeup of unborn children. Using the technology on humans would be very 
expensive, and as described above not fully covered by insurance, so only the wealthiest would 
be able to use it. Therefore, the wealthiest people would be able to create superior children, 
which would not only further the gap between rich and poor, but also cause a more controversial 
class divide. It could also eliminate certain physical traits and certain aspects of the human race 
around the world to create children with the “desired” traits. There would be no distributive

 54 
justice in this case. This is why it is imperative to set limits on this technology, the first being 
what it is used for. Genetic engineering technology like CRISPR-Cas9 and the like should be 
limited to use for disease control and elimination. It should not be allowed to use this technology 
for human enhancement (physical looks, intelligence, athleticism, etc.). This limitation 
essentially removes the main public fear of the use of any genetic engineering technology on 
human embryos. However, as humans created this technology and are furthering its development 
and use, is may be unrealistic to assume that these limitations would be set. 
 Along with this limitation comes the financial limitations. Although many aspects of the 
healthcare system are not equally fair among everyone who needs them, using the CRISPR-Cas9 
technology to prevent disease should be at least partially covered by private and public 
healthcare plans so that any member of the general public has the chance to save their future 
child from a fatal disease. This would allow justice within the healthcare system (in relation to 
genetic engineering), the greatest good for the greatest number of people, and a higher rate of 
disease elimination, which is the ultimate goal. Although these limitations and regulations of the 
technology could ethically justify its use on human embryos, and “that in the United States, there 
are [currently] piles of regulations to keep lab science from morphing into a genetically modified 
baby anytime soon,” the future cannot be accurately predicted and it is unknown whether 
limitations would be set once the technology reaches the necessary point for human use.79

VI. Conclusion 
 
In this thesis I attempted to explore the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering system to 
modify the germline of human embryos in order to eliminate or alleviate Alzheimer’s disease. 
Through this exploration, I analyzed the specifics of the technology in its current state, the 
causes of Alzheimer’s disease, the scientific benefits and risks, and the ethical arguments for and 
against its use on humans. Through the explanations and arguments discussed in the previous 
section, I conclude that overall, it is not ethically justifiable to use the CRISPR-Cas9 technology 
to edit the germline, and therefore the hereditary material to be passed on to all future offspring, 
of a human embryo. 
As previously explained, the chapter on scientific benefits and risks, although the 
CRISPR-Cas9 system is the most developed engineering technology (and that which is closest to 
use on humans), it is not nearly perfected to the necessary point of accuracy in which it would 
not cause more harm than good. The possible side effects of complications like unintended base 
changes or mosaicism are unknown, and could possibly cause harm that far outweighs the 
benefit, for example, how it can cause cancer.80 The science behind the CRISPR-Cas9 
technology is still in a developmental stage when considering its use for human embryos. This 
conclusion is based on the analysis of multiple trials and case studies that have been performed 
by scientists and experts on genetic engineering across the world, none of which have been able 
to successfully edit out a gene from an inviable human embryo without any side effects in the

 56 
future (as none have observed the long-term effects or tried to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system on 
viable human embryos). 
Not only through the scientific risks, but the ethical arguments against the technology for 
use on humans also far outweighs the ethical arguments for the use of genetic engineering 
technology on human embryos. The technology violates the bioethical theories of deontology 
and consequentialism, as well as some of the four principles of medical ethics: justice, 
beneficence, and non-maleficence. The financial and low availability aspects of the clinical use 
of the technology do not allow for distributive justice, and create unfair gaps between those who 
can afford all expenses and those who cannot. As stated previously, the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic 
engineering system is considered to be “a slippery slope toward much more unacceptable 
uses.”81 There is a large fear of the creation of “designer babies,” which are superior children 
who have physical and possibly mental traits that were chosen before birth.82 This also creates 
the fear of a superior race, an elimination of certain traits of humans, and a larger gap between 
rich and poor. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering system on humans also violates 
different religious doctrines, as explained through the example of the Christian doctrine in 
chapter four. 
Even if the technology were developed to an almost perfect accuracy to where the 
scientific benefits outweigh the risks, the ethical arguments still would form the conclusion that 
overall, it is not ethically justifiable to use the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genetic 
makeup of a human embryo affecting its germline. The necessary limitations outlined in chapter 
four would need to be put in place in order to ethically justify CRISPR-Cas9 use on humans, and

 57 
as the future cannot be predicted, at this time it is still not ethically justifiable to use the 
CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the genetic makeup of a human embryo. However, once the 
CRISPR-Cas9 genetic engineering system reaches the scientific point for use on humans, we 
may see necessary limitations implemented and therefore the main fears of using genetic 
engineering on humans would be alleviated. It is not unlikely that it will be clinically used in the 
future for the benefit of the human race through the alleviation and possible elimination of 
Alzheimer’s disease, along with other genetically caused diseases and medical complications.

ABSTRACT 
Accurate prediction of the friction factor and consequently the pressure drop 
in small two-phase flow channels are still lacking with large disagreements.  In 
addition, the environmental concerns associated with industrial refrigerants currently 
used have further posed a challenge to find thermally and hydrodynamically 
compatible and environmentally friendly alternatives.  The goal of this study is to 
determine the optimal friction factor and frictional pressure drop using single-
objective and multi-objective genetic algorithms.  A total of 53 friction factor 
models/correlations have been reviewed from which eight were utilized to address 
discrepancies.  Then, minimization of the frictional pressure drop by implementing 
single-objective genetic algorithm (SOGA) was carried out.  In the multi-objective 
genetic algorithm (MOGA), the conflicting objectives of friction factor and pressure 
drop have been minimized simultaneously.  Finally, the analysis was carried out on a 
small horizontal tube of 7.6 mm inner diameter utilizing experimental data for the 
refrigerant R-22 and the natural refrigerant R-290.  It has been shown that the 
disagreements occur due to (i) the use of fluid data from different sources, (ii) 
utilization of different correlations on viscosity, and consequently on predicting the 
friction factor, and (iii) the applications of different friction factor correlations on 
predicting the frictional pressure drop.  It has been proven that the Blasius friction 
factor correlation for turbulent flow in smooth pipe can be used by experimental 
researchers to determine their frictional pressure drop or/and matching of data and 
predicted values due to the coincidentally good agreement obtained.  The optimal 
outcomes using MOGA are found to be closest to the experimental data.  The 
percentage difference between the predicted and experimental frictional pressure 
drop is up to 1.93% and 0.25% when the Blasius friction factor equation is used with 
the McAdams and Dukler viscosity equations for R-22 and R-290 respectively.

ABSTRAK 
Ramalan tepat tentang faktor geseran dan akibatnya penurunan tekanan dalam 
saluran kecil aliran dua fasa masih kurang dengan pencanggahan yang tinggi. 
Kebimbangan terhadap alam sekitar terus menjadi cabaran kepada industri 
penyejukan untuk mencari pengganti kepada bahan penyejuk yang mempunyai ciri-
ciri haba dan hidrodinamik yang bersesuaian. Objektif kajian ini adalah untuk 
menentukan faktor geseran dan kejatuhan tekanan geseran optimum menggunakan 
algoritma genetik objektif tunggal dan berbilang objektif. Sejumlah 53 
model/korelasi faktor geseran telah dikaji semula, lapan daripadanya digunakan 
untuk menganalisa percanggahan. Seterusnya, pengurangan faktor geseran dan 
penurunan tekanan geseran menggunakan algoritma genetik objektif tunggal 
(SOGA) dilakukan. Dalam algoritma genetik berbilang objektif (MOGA), ojektif 
yang bercanggah iaitu faktor geseran dan penurunan tekanan telah diminimumkan 
serentak. Analisis  ini diakhiri dengan data eksperimen tiub mendatar kecil bergaris 
pusat 7.6 mm dengan penyejuk R-22 dan penyejuk semula jadi R-290. Analisis 
menunjukkan terdapat percanggahan adalah disebabkan (i) penggunaan data bendalir 
daripada sumber yang berlainan, (ii) penggunaan korelasi kelikatan yang berbeza dan 
penggunaannya terhadap anggaran faktor geseran, dan (iii) penggunaan faktor 
geseran yang berbeza untuk mendapatkan penurunan tekanan geseran. Kajian 
membuktikan korelasi faktor geseran Blasius untuk aliran gelora dalam paip licin 
boleh digunakan untuk penyelidik eksperimen dalam menentukan penurunan tekanan 
geseran atau/dan padanan data dengan nilai ramalan berdasarkan keputusan baik 
yang diperolehi. Hasil pengoptimuman menggunakan algoritma genetik didapati 
hampir dengan data eksperimen. Peratusan perbezaan antara penurunan tekanan 
geseran yang diramalkan dan eksperimen adalah 1.93% dan 0.25% apabila 
persamaan faktor geseran Blasius digunakan dengan persamaan kelikatan McAdams 
dan Dukler untuk R-22 dan R-290 masing-masing.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Introduction 
Two-phase flow phenomenon has gotten increased interest in recent years, 
attracting researchers to conduct more studies due to their higher heat transfer 
coefficient in comparison with single-phase flow (Jacopo, 2010).  In general, the rate 
of the heat transfer rate during phase change can be higher than four to twenty-five 
times compared to the single-phase equivalent convection (Incropera et al., 2007).  
Contrasted with the flow inside traditional channels, the flow of the refrigerants 
during boiling in smaller channels has distinct characteristics as a result of the 
chemical and physical properties of the refrigerants and the measurements of the 
channels.  Therefore, the accuracy of the pressure drop prediction is of a great 
importance and occupies the forefront place in design and improvement of the 
systems for its close association with the power required to drive fluid inside 
channels.  
 
The 1950s were marked by the fact that air conditioners were available to 
almost every family, especially in developed countries.  The makers of these gadgets 
supplanted poisonous refrigerant gasses with manufactured refrigerants called 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  The 1970s were marked by the terrible discovery that 
CFCs, used in refrigeration units as well as various devices, were one of the factors 
leading to the depletion of the ozone layer responsible for reducing the harmful 
effects of solar radiation.  The Montreal Protocol signed by most countries in 1987, a 
global agreement, attempts to replace the Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) products with 
other products such as Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) like R-410A and R-134a 
2 
 
(Mironov, 1968), that are environmentally friendly, natural, and have low or zero 
ozone depleting potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP).  Currently, 
there are still inadequate studies on environmentally friendly natural refrigerants in 
small channels available in the literature.  Preliminary results from these studies 
provided viable options but there is insufficient data on the properties of these 
refrigerants, especially with regard to heat transfer and pressure drop. 
 
Appearance and disappearance of the phases during the two-phase flow 
makes the analysis of the flow systems very complex because of the characteristics 
of the intermittent fluids at the phase boundary, as well as the relative movement of 
the phases, mass and energy and the transfer of momentum between phases.  
Besides, void distribution in a two-phase channel has special importance.  The flow 
patterns get more complex in small channels due to the increased frictional losses 
between the fluid layers as well as between the fluid and channel walls.   
 
The advantages that can be found using small channels is the high heat 
transfer coefficient due to the high ratio between heat transfer surface and fluid flow 
volume.  Also, their small size makes the need for less material and reduces the 
weight, fluid stock, installation costs and power reserve.  However, despite these 
advantages, they are also characterized by an increase in wall friction which leads to 
increased pressure drop.  Therefore, there is a need to understand the basic aspects of 
flow in two phases with regard to pressure reduction and heat transfer for accurate 
prediction leading to better design of compact heat exchangers and greater efficiency 
in industrial processes. 
 
 
1.2 Flow Patterns and Flow Pattern Maps  
 
The flow pattern in two-phase flow can be influenced by various parameters 
such as density and viscosity of the gas and liquid phases, surface tension, mass flow 
rate of each phase, and geometrical measurements of the flow channel.  In addition, 
competition between forces such as inertia force, viscosity force, gravitational force, 
and surface tension force controls the order of specific flow patterns in the channel.  
It is, therefore, a necessary to predict these flow regimes as the basis for performing 
3 
 
arithmetic operations on two-phase flow.  The usual procedure is to draw data in the 
form of a flow pattern map. 
 
Thus, flow pattern maps can be defined as an operation of separating space 
into areas on a two-dimensional graph corresponding to the different flow patterns.  
They are a construct of two coordinates, where the liquid superficial velocity is 
plotted against the gas superficial velocity.  The boundaries between the flow 
patterns are plotted by lines.  Using these maps for predicting the local flow regime 
in both horizontal and vertical pipes are very useful.  Additionally, most of the flow 
pattern maps have been developed for adiabatic two-phase flows, which may not 
yield reliable results when used in the case of diabatic. 
1.3 Pressure Drop in Two-Phase Flow  
   
The pressure drop is defined as the difference in pressure between two 
interesting points in the flow system.  Total pressure drop usually occurs owing to 
friction because of the viscosity of the liquid and gas in motion. Where in the case of 
the laminar flow pressure loss occurs as a result of the momentum transfer between 
the particles, while in the turbulent flow occurs when the individual particles move at 
different velocities between the adjacent fluid layers.  In addition, pressure losses 
also can be caused by the local pressure loss due to sudden changes in flow area, 
shape, and flow direction; and pressure losses due to acceleration, caused by changes 
in elevation (gravity effect), flow area or by changes in the fluid density. 
 
In view of the design and operational issues caused due to the simultaneous 
flow of liquid and vapor and forming various two-phase flow patterns, makes the 
calculation of the pressure drop in these conditions a crucial in order to assist the 
piping designer to succeed in achieving the optimal line size and better design of the 
piping system.  Most of the studies on pressure drop proved that the frictional 
component was dominant and the contribution of the accelerational and gravitational 
component is small (Saitoh et al., 2005).  Frictional pressure drop commonly comes 
from the friction between the flowing fluid and pipe wall.  In two-phase flows, there 
4 
 
is an additional frictional pressure loss comes from the interphase friction between 
phases.   
 
In general, calculation of the frictional pressure drop requires knowing either 
the two-phase friction factor or the two-phase frictional multiplier.  Where, 
calculating friction factors can be done using implicit Colebrook equation which 
requires iterative procedure, an inconvenience and needs time for computation.  
Therefore, many explicit equations were developed to rid of the iterations.  The main 
disadvantage of these explicit approximations is the relatively high percentage of 
error compared to the solution to the implicit Colebrook equation (Brkić, 2012). 
 
In the past, five methods have been utilized in solving the Colebrook equation 
(Colebrook, 1939): (i) graphical method by finding the solution from the Rouse or 
Moody diagrams (Rouse, 1943; Moody and Princeton, 1944), (ii) implementing 
iterative process by using spreadsheet solvers, which gives accurate solutions to the 
Colebrook equation but requires long time (Excel is most suitable tool), (iii) using 
developed explicit equations of the Colebrook equation which requires less 
calculation but have higher error percentage (Genić et al., 2011), (iv) make use of the 
Lambert W function to avoid the iterative calculations with less percentage error 
(Boyd, 1998; Barry et al., 2000), and (v) applying trial – and – error method which is 
no longer used.   
 
Today, Colebrook equations can be solved easily and accurately using the 
Newton-Raphson iterative procedure and common software tools such as Microsoft 
Excel and MATLAB.      
1.4 Background and Rational of the Research 
At present, the need for small channels in a variety of compact applications is 
widespread.  Unfortunately, published reports indicate the significant increment in 
pressure drop to the detriment of heat transfer coefficient increment.  Consequently, 
5 
 
there is a requirement for a dependable model with a high degree of accuracy for 
predicting two-phase flow frictional pressure drop in small channels. 
 
To date, researchers have modified available correlations on pressure drop 
developed based on conventional systems.  Meanwhile, other researchers have 
invested much time and funds in developing new correlations in search of better 
agreements across refrigerants, channel diameter, and flow regimes.  The issue 
remains with the many different predicted friction factor correlations used in the 
determination of the frictional pressure drop.  Besides, the different approaches in 
modelling the flow (homogeneous or separated) introduced further variations in the 
outcomes.  Global concerns for natural and more environmentally friendly 
refrigerants in practical applications have added a new challenge to the study and 
investigation of the two-phase flow in small channels. 
 
Experimental studies that have been conducted on boiling heat transfer and 
pressure drop of refrigerants during two-phase flow in small channels are few in 
comparison with those in conventional channels.  Even less is the focus on optimized 
conditions for minimal pressure drop.  The difficulty of effectively dealing with 
turbulent flow issues in pipes originates from the truth that friction factor is an 
intricate function of roughness and Reynolds number.  With various 
correlations/models applicable and performance on alternative refrigerants, there is a 
need for a study and analyze available correlations/models proposed or modified 
(many) to identify and address causes of discrepancies.  Optimized conditions such 
as inlet temperature, mass flux, heat flux, and vapor quality in small channels 
whereby the frictional pressure drop is minimized have to be investigated, with 
comparisons of the performance between current and environmentally friendly 
refrigerants as potential alternatives. 
1.5 Problem Statement 
 
Two-phase flow pressure drop is a major parameter in designing two-phase 
flow systems and takes precedence over any other consideration.  Past empirical 
6 
 
correlations come with various degrees of disagreements with experimental data, up 
to and above 100% (Xu and Fang, 2012; Xu et al., 2012; Xu and Fang, 2013).  The 
use of data from different sources and various equations in calculating the viscosity 
value had a clear effect on the viscosity value estimation.  This effect is clearly 
shown in the calculation of the value of the number of Reynolds, which is a critical 
element in estimating the friction factor.  In addition, the use of various equations for 
calculation of the friction factor has had a considerable effect on the accuracy of the 
predicted value of the friction factor and consequently on predicting frictional 
pressure drop.   
 
In addition, the enormous ecological harm that has happened because of the 
utilization of halogens pushed the researchers to look for and examine natural 
refrigerants as replacements to the current used.  Thus, in this study the propane (R-
290) has been examined simultaneously with HCFC (R-22) as an alternative natural 
environmentally friendly refrigerant.   
 
Current research investigated the effect of using data from various sources 
and various viscosity and friction factor equations on estimating viscosity and 
friction factor values.  As well as, this research inspects the effect of the predicted 
viscosity and friction factor values on predicting frictional pressure drop.  
Examination has been performed utilizing the genetic algorithm (GA) as a 
convenient optimization method.  The optimal outcomes were compared with 
experimental data collected from the experiments conducted at the Universitas 
Indonesia.  
 
 
 
1.6 Research Objectives 
 
The objectives of this study are: 
 
i. Perform a critical review of the available implicit and explicit equations for a 
wide range of Reynolds numbers and relative pipe roughness to establish the 
accuracy. 
7 
 
ii. Examine the natural environmentally friendly refrigerant R-290 
parametrically and under optimized conditions as an alternative refrigerant to 
the refrigerant R-22 using Genetic Algorithm Optimization. 
 
iii. Show the effects of using data from various sources on estimating the 
viscosity value and thus on evaluating the friction factor value. 
 
iv. Illustrate the effects of using the different equations on the viscosity value 
estimate and the effect of this on the value estimation of the friction factor. 
 
v. Demonstrate the effect of using various correlations on estimating the friction 
factor value and its impact on the accuracy of the prediction of the frictional 
pressure drop in two-phase flow. 
 
vi. Evaluate the magnitude of all the above-mentioned effects by comparing the 
results obtained with experimental data to increase the accuracy of the 
analysis. 
1.7 Scopes of the Research 
 
Theoretical and experimental approaches were involved in this research.  The 
research focuses on study and evaluation of the effect of using data from different 
sources and different equations in calculating the value of viscosity on which the 
Reynolds is dependent on.  The Reynolds number is a key element in the calculation 
of the friction factor which is a critical factor in the evaluation of the frictional 
pressure drop.  In addition, examination of the effect of using various viscosity 
equations as well as various equations on estimating the friction factor is completed.  
Consequently, the impact of all these effects on predicting the frictional pressure 
drop is analyzed.  Some of the most commonly used equations were selected to 
assess the magnitude of all these effects. 
 
An examination of a natural and environmentally friendly refrigerant as a 
replacement to the currently used refrigerants was accomplished.  Genetic algorithm 
8 
 
has been utilized as an effective and convenient optimization method with the aim to 
identify the source of inconsistency between the predicted frictional pressure drop 
and experimental results previously reported from a large number of researchers.  
Comparison of the numerical and optimal outcomes of the measured pressure drop 
and calculated experimental friction factor from the experiment conducted for this 
purpose, has made it possible to assess the selected viscosity and friction factor 
correlations and their effect on the accuracy of the predicted frictional pressure drop.  
Thus, utilizing these correlations and applying the homogeneous flow model, 
pressure drop can be more effectively predicted in the design of compact two-phase 
flow systems.

factors. 
 
iii. Demonstrate the effect of using data from various sources and various 
viscosity correlations on calculating viscosity and friction factor and

from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
chemistry webbook (Eric et al., 2013) were used.

1.10 Research Significance 
 
The importance of the research lies in the critical review of the huge number 
of the void fraction, viscosity, and friction factor correlations available in the 
literature used for laminar and turbulent flow regimes.  In addition to that, the effect 
of using data from different sources on the viscosity value, the effect of using 
different viscosity equations in calculating the viscosity value and the subsequent 
effect on the predicted friction factor has been demonstrated.  Furthermore, genetic 
algorithm optimization tool to optimize the friction factor and frictional pressure 
drop in a small channel that has not been used previously has been utilized.  Thus, 
the research significance can be summarized in the following points: 
 
i. This research is an effort to comprehend the effect of the frictional pressure 
drop on two-phase flow boiling in small channels including experiments and 
applying of different friction factor and viscosity equations. 
 
ii. Demonstrate the effect of using data from various sources in evaluating 
friction pressure drop and correspondingly on predicting pressure drop.   
 
iii. The critical review discovered some correlations that have not been 
mentioned before, in addition to the presence of some of the misconceptions 
about the original developers of these correlations. 
 
iv. Applying genetic algorithms optimization gave a methodical optimization 
program with less limiting conditions, and can be used by the designers 
without difficulty or effort. 
 
v. Examination of a natural environmentally friendly refrigerant as a 
replacement to the currently HCFC used in order to protect the environment, 
preserve the ozone layer and avoid global warming.

ABSTRACT
We offer a new framework for understanding biological adaptability based on interpreting the findings of 342 journal 
articles and 67 online reports related to adaptation, bioengineering, and design in view of the assumption that biological 
functions are most accurately explained by engineering principles. We hypothesize that organisms actively and 
continuously track environmental variables and respond by self-adjusting to changing environments—utilizing the 
engineering principles constraining how human-designed objects self-adjust to changes—which results in adaptation. 
We termed this hypothesis Continuous Environmental Tracking (CET). CET is an engineering-based, organism-
focused characterization of adaptation. CET expects to find that organisms adapt via systems with elements analogous 
to those within human-engineered tracking systems, namely: input sensors, internal logic mechanisms to select suitable 
responses, and actuators to execute responses. We derived the hypothesis by reinterpreting findings and formalizing 
biological adaptability within a framework of engineering design, considering: (1) objectives, (2) constraints, (3) 
variables, and (4) the biological systems related to the previous three. The literature does identify internal mechanisms 
with elements analogous to engineered systems using sensors coupled to complex logic mechanisms producing 
highly “targeted” self-adjustments suitable to changes. Adaptive mechanisms were characterized as regulated, rapid, 
repeatable, and sometimes, reversible. Adaptation happened largely through regulated gene expression and not gene 
inheritance, per se. These observations, consistent with CET, contrast starkly with the evolutionary framework’s 
randomness of tiny, accidental “hit-and-miss” phenotypes fractioned out to lucky survivors of deadly challenges. 
Evolutionists now divide over their framework’s need of modification, and a trend among some seeks to infuse more 
engineering into biology. This disarray affords a rare, transient opportunity for engineering advocates to frame the 
issue. CET may fundamentally change how we perceive organisms; from passive modeling clay shaped over time by 
the vicissitudes of nature, to active, problem-solving creatures that continuously track environmental changes to better 
fit existing niches or fill new ones.

INTRODUCTION
The search for the mechanism underlying the adaptive diversification 
of organisms could be futile. This is for good reason. Research 
continues to discover wide-ranging adaptive mechanisms—from 
genetic to epigenetic, behavioral, and ecological—and, therefore, 
they resist being pigeon-holed into a single category (Laland et al. 
2015; Muller 2017). Several theorists have cautioned that unless 
the structure of the current theory of adaptation itself adapts to 
accommodate these diverse mechanisms into its research programs 
and explanations—and refrains from shoe-horning them into old 
theory—then advances in the whole field of biological adaptation 
may be hindered (Lewontin 1983).
Subsequently, a meeting of the British Academy and the Royal 
Society was held on November 7-9, 2016 focused on reconciling 
theory with certain observations and mechanisms of adaptation, 
some of which are discussed herein. Commenting on why no one 
should be alarmed over sharp differences about interpretations of the 
same data, several key organizers said, “But let us also remember 
that no scientific, mathematical or philosophical advance occurs 
simply by quoting authority. In the end, evidence is what counts. 
Remember also the philosophical insight that evidence is evidence 
precisely because it can be so interpreted. We all work, explicitly 
or implicitly, from or within metaphysical assumptions. That is so 
whether or not we recognize it. Moreover, different assumptions 
dominate alternative academic fields, which can lead to differences 
in interpretation, and to different emphases between individuals 
and field on what is causally relevant” (Bateson et al. 2017, p. 1 
emphasis in original) 
We agree that the theory needs revision, but we find the new 
mechanisms incompatible with current theory. In the spirit of 
Bateson’s counsel about interpretations, we offer a new framework 
for understanding adaptability that interprets observations and 
results in the literature in view of the assumption that biological 
systems and functions are most accurately explained by engineering 
principles. At a broad level, fresh interpretations form a new 
description of what organisms achieve when they adapt. Then data 
is re-interpreted to identify where adaptive capacity resides at the 
organism-environment interface. The mechanisms themselves are 
re-interpreted to identify how adaptation happens via a myriad 
of diverse mechanisms. Thus, this paper offers a new way to 
characterize the body of literature about adaptation. This approach 
is a contribution toward the development of a new, comprehensive 
engineering-based framework for understanding biological 
phenomena (Snoke 2014). How different is this characterization 
of adaptation from the status-quo? Why select an engineering 
framework? Why now?
1. The Current Framework of Diversification and Adaptation
Tenets of the current, widely-held conceptual framework used to 
characterize diversification and adaptation are defined by Muller 
(2017):
In a condensed form, these tenets are as follows: (i) all 
evolutionary explanation requires the study of populations 
of organisms; (ii) populations contain genetic variation 
that arises randomly from mutation and recombination; 
(iii) populations evolve by changes in gene frequency 
brought about by natural selection, gene flow and drift; 
(iv) genetic variants generate slight phenotypic effects 
and the resulting phenotypic variation is gradual and 
continuous; (v) genetic inheritance alone accounts for 
the transmission of selectable variation; (vi) new species 
arise by a prevention of gene flow between populations 
that evolve differently; (vii) the phenotypic differences 
that distinguish higher taxa result from the incremental 
accumulation of genetic variation; (viii) natural selection 
represents the only directional factor in evolution (p. 3).
Muller’s equivalence of diversification and adaptation with 
evolution is questioned by those in creationist and Intelligent Design 
circles. Still, key elements accepted within selectionism include the 
familiar elements of natural selection, population-level thinking, 
Mendelian inheritance (gene-centricity), mode (accumulation of 
favored genetic variants), and rate (gradual and linear) (Denton 
2013; Jeanson, 2017; Jeanson and Lisle 2016; Laland et al. 2015). 
Further, the entire framework, particularly research programs, is 
grounded in the assumptions that the diversification and adaptation 
process is random, unregulated, unguided toward any need-based 
outcome, and that organisms are driven by the vicissitudes of 
nature (Reigner 2015).
2. Discontent with the Current Understanding of Adaptation
However, a growing list of observed phenomena and mechanisms 
seem to be anomalous to the current understanding of adaptation 
(Koonin 2009) unless numerous ad hoc modifications are devised 
to eliminate apparent conflicts (Futuyma 2017). The principle 
incongruities which prompted the 2016 Royal Society meeting 
are recently identified mechanisms regularly characterized with 
non-random descriptors such as: biased and directional, rapid, 
predictable, and repeatable (Table 1 lists multiple examples). 
These findings are contrary to the classic framework of gradual 
diversification and adaptation resulting from random variation 
fractioned out through diverse death-driven scenarios where 
survival and reproduction are highly dependent on “luck” (Snyder 
and Ellner 2018). Accordingly, there is a growing insistence on 
modification of this framework (Laland et al. 2014). 
Some believe the current framework is so out-of-date that it 
still fails to incorporate knowledge of developmental regulatory 
mechanisms into both theoretical population genetics and genetic 
accommodation theory (Laland et al. 2015; Muller 2017). While 
true, criticizing the current framework as merely “out-of-date” may 
be misidentifying the problem. This paper explores the possibility 
that the primary cause of the clash between recent discoveries and 
the current framework is that the basic tenets of the framework—
and their underlying naturalistic, design-exclusive assumptions—
are fundamentally incompatible with recent discoveries. Adaptive 
mechanisms characterized as regulated, rapid, repeatable, and 
predictable are anomalous precisely because those words seem to 
describe the purposeful outcomes of engineered systems. In areas 
of applied biological research, a growing trend is to incorporate 
engineering principles to frame biological phenomena. We believe 
that there are good reasons to incorporate this approach into a 
replacement framework for diversification and adaptation as well.
3. A Growing Tendency to Explain Biological Functions with 
Engineering Principles
Life itself seems to have attributes which are currently beyond 
the reach of scientific methods to discover, but making sense 
of biomolecular, physiological, or anatomical functions is not 
mysterious. Could it prove useful to apply engineering principles 
to explain how a biological function like adaptation works? There 
is good justification to begin doing so. Despite their vastly different 
substrates, living organisms are subject to the same fundamental 
constraints that govern all regulatory mechanisms, and they 
function within the same laws of nature as man-made designs 
(Khammash 2008). This makes it possible to study birds to gain 
insight into aircraft design, for example. Research demonstrates 
a remarkable correspondence in design, purpose, and function of

• Adaptations often appear to be “targeted” not “hit-and-
miss” solutions to environmental challenges.
• Organisms can modify their developmental course to 
produce novel and suitable phenotypic variants.
• Organisms do track dynamic conditions and self-adjust their 
traits correspondingly.
• Diverse organisms repeatedly express similar morphological 
traits when located in similar environments.
• Adaptive mechanisms seem to be highly regulated under the 
control of precise cellular circuits.
• Many adaptive “mutations” increasingly looks to be 
controlled internally.
• The genome is increasing viewed as a read–write library 
of genetic functions under continuous revision and not as 
mostly read-only with a few rare mutations.
• The rate of adaptation can be variable and is often rapid.
• Some adaptations are known to be repeatable and reversible 
across taxa and time.
• Adaptive means include: genetic, epigenetic, developmental, 
behavioral, founder effect, and ecological.
• Transgenerational inheritance also includes epigenetic, 
physiological, behavioral, ecological, and cultural.
Table 1. Biological observations identified as appearing to be anomalous 
to the dominant conceptual framework for adaptation and differentiation 
(Bateson 2014; Danchin et al 2011; Endara et al 2017; Esquerre and Keogh 
2016; Deem 2013; Hull et al 2017; Laland et al 2014; Laland et al 2015; 
Muller 2017; Reigner 2015; Shapiro 2013)
many organs and systems of organisms to similar devices produced 
by human engineers. Yet, knowing that organisms have functions 
operating by the same engineering principles as man-made things 
does not equate to saying that living things are only machines.
Just like human-engineered devices, organism have organs and 
systems which utilize the properties of natural laws like such 
as gravity, inertia, and momentum. Biomechanical engineers 
advocate the mimicry of systems found in living things and use 
them for inspiration in design (Socha 2012). Biological researchers 
already “reverse engineer” biological systems by methodically 
disassembling their components piece by piece to discover their 
operation. Further, the ever-increasing awareness that biological 
functions bear striking resemblance to man-made systems using 
sophisticated engineering has not been ignored. In 2016, an 
international conference dedicated to engineering biology was 
held at the University of Pittsburgh (http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/
Events/All/ Conferences/others /other_conf_2015-16/04-15-16_
reengineering/reengineering.html). Its goal was to develop a new 
engineering paradigm in biology that emphasizes how engineering-
based perspectives on biology contrast with established biological 
thinking. Conference organizers maintained that engineering-
inspired fields such as integrative systems biology, biomedical 
engineering, and synthetic biology appear to have more in common 
with engineering approaches than with traditional biological ones. 
Thus, even evolutionary biologists, though rooted in design-
exclusive assumptions, will face the inevitable rising tide of 
scientific literature from other disciplines that are using engineering 
principles to better explain biological functions.
4. Biblical Rationale for Explaining Biological Functions Using 
Engineering Principles
It would seem natural for researchers who claim to embrace the 
explanation that living things look designed because they are 
designed, to get out in front of this trend for using engineering 
principles to explain biological functions. For those who believe 
that the Bible provides insight into biological function, there 
is justification for approaching research from an engineering 
perspective. Psalms 19:1-6 and Romans 1:18-25 are key passages 
stating that some attributes of God are revealed in nature. Both 
texts emphasize that living things manifest “workmanship.” Nature 
displays features unique to designing agency that humans would 
ascribe to the workmanship of artists or engineers. For instance, 
living things are full of systems with multiple parts working 
together for a purpose, which are otherwise only found in human-
engineered devices. It is this clearly-seen tight correlation between 
the function of living things and human-engineered contrivances 
that strongly indicates that living things were, in fact, designed 
by an intellect—with engineering prowess far surpassing the 
best human engineers. Analysis of Romans 1:18-25 prompts a 
profound question related to biological research: is there a biblical 
(or scientific) reason to believe that any biological function will 
be discovered that will operate by different engineering principles 
than those by which human-engineered apparatuses are already 
operating or could be operating? Therefore, researchers open to 
intelligent causation for living creatures should expect to find an 
ever-increasing resemblance of biological function to sophisticated 
engineering.
Since creatures were commanded to “fill the earth” (Genesis 1:22, 
28; 8:17; 9:1, 7) which was a highly dynamic place after Creation 
and the Flood, design-guided biological researchers should begin to 
identify the basic engineering principles governing the operation of 
systems which appear to self-adjust to dynamic external conditions 
(i.e., the how of biological adaptation). It is time to rethink the 
concepts of diversification and adaptation, and to develop a 
framework that explains biological function with engineering 
principles; one that naturally incorporates the numerous highly 
regulated mechanisms that appear to be incompatible with current 
evolutionary theory.
5. Formalizing a New Engineering-based Framework
To begin formalizing, rather than just conceptualizing, biological 
adaptability within a valid framework of engineering design, we 
should consider: (1) objectives, (2) constraints, (3) variables, and (4) 
the biological systems (corresponding to mathematical equations 
in engineering) related to the previous three. Incorporating several 
broad observations and re-interpreting them in this light will form 
a new description of what organisms achieve when they adapt (i.e., 
the design objective for what they are doing).
Organisms are observed to modify their own developmental 
course by continuously monitoring, responding to, and adjusting, 
their internal and external states, and these adjustments appear 
to play a significant role in producing novel, potentially 
beneficial, phenotypic variants (Bateson 2017). Further, there is a 
growing body of evidence that appears to indicate that recently-
discovered regulated mechanisms enable organisms to actively 
and continuously track environmental changes. For instance, 
organisms appear to quickly respond to significant environmental 
changes—often making surprisingly rapid adaptations—and then 
more gradually adapt to conditions during periods with relatively 
little environmental change (Reigner 2015). What are organisms 
doing? We posit that organisms are continuously tracking 
environmental changes and responding with suitably self-adjusted 
traits to maintain homeostasis—within their lifetime and cross 
generationally—resulting in adaptation. How might they achieve 
this objective within realistic constraints?
A. Hypothesis
We observe sophisticated human engineering demonstrated in 
automated, autonomous robotic drones equipped with exquisite 
detectors, logic-centered algorithms, and locomotive performance 
to reliably track a target. If the application of engineering design 
objectives, constraints, and variables for human-created tracking 
systems can be applied to biological systems, then this readily 
offers a testable hypothesis:
Organisms actively and continuously track environmental variables 
and respond by self-adjusting to changing environments—utilizing 
the engineering principles that constrain how human-designed 
things adapt to changing conditions—resulting in adaptation.
This assumes that fluctuating environmental conditions are 
comparable to the variability of moving targets followed by tracking 
systems. If this assumption and the above hypothesis are true, then 
we expect:1) organisms should possess innate mechanisms with 
features that correspond to elements of human-engineered tracking 
systems, 2) these mechanisms should be demonstrably utilized to 
Guliuzza and Gaskill  ◀ How organisms continuously track environmental changes ▶ 2018 ICC
160
actively and continuously track environmental changes, and 3) 
changes in an organism’s traits should occur in parallel with the 
rate and magnitude of environmental changes.
We have termed this hypothesis Continuous Environmental Tracking 
(CET). It is the foundational assumption of a new framework for 
understanding diversification and adaptation. Scientific activities 
including interpretations of findings take place within a structure 
of ideas and assumptions defining a field of study. The framework 
we offer promotes comparing data and observations (findings) 
of reported biological functions to those of human-engineered 
entities to search for: corresponding systems and their elements, 
mechanisms, engineering principles fundamental to operation, and 
assembly processes to assist in research. Our framework widens 
the bi-directional conduit between engineering and biology by 
aiding bioengineers in their job of biomimicry and aids biologists 
to predict where to search for elusive system elements or steps, 
guided by the assumption of functional purpose(s). Reinterpreting 
the findings of biological studies by an “engineering approach” 
or “design analysis” means that they are evaluated with this 
comparison of biological functions to those of human-engineered 
entities in mind.
B. Expected features of CET biological mechanisms
What are the elements of biological systems that should correspond 
to man-made tracking systems? Tracking systems are generally 
part of larger, robust, adaptive control systems. These follow 
the movement of a select “target” within a specified “field of 
view” and elicit response per a predetermined algorithm. These 
“surveillance systems” use one or more sensors, coupled to a 
computer system, that gather and interpret incoming data about 
uncertain environments. (Blackman and Popoli 1999).
There are three irreducible elements common to all tracking 
systems: 1) sensors to detect pre-specified conditions; 2) condition-
consequence logic mechanisms that process information by 
specifying if (+) condition then (+) consequential output response, 
and 3) output responses which adjust activities to effectively pursue 
a target (Blackman and Popoli 1999; Ioannou and Sun. 2012). (If 
navigation or interception at a precise location is desired, then a 
chronometer or circadian device to measures time is also an essential 
element.) If the CET hypothesis is correct, we would expect to find 
biological mechanisms with corresponding irreducible elements 
that are recognizable by the following characteristics:
(1) Sensors. The element linking the system to its environment is 
the sensor. Fraden, a system design specialist, highlights the role 
of sensors in initiating data acquisition, “a sensor does not function 
by itself; it is always a part of a larger system that may incorporate 
many other detectors, signal conditioners, signal processors, 
memory devices, data recorders, and actuators…A sensor is always 
a part of some kind of a data acquisition system…Depending on 
the complexity of the system, the total number of sensors may vary 
from as little as one (a home thermostat) to many thousands (a 
space shuttle)” (Fraden 2010, p.5). 
Understanding three key characteristics of how sensors integrate 
into systems helps illuminate important details of the relationship 
between an entity and exposures. First, sensors are exquisitely 
designed to be selective by specifying the environmental conditions 
to which they will be sensitive and insensitive. Sensors should 
minimally disturb the condition being monitored so its “true value” 
remains. Second, a sensor must be ready to collect data by means 
of detecting a condition, often by “active surveillance.” Third, 
sensors are an integral part of the system. This relationship may be 
difficult to see since sensors are often remotely located. 
(2) Logic mechanisms. Sophisticated internal logic mechanisms 
are currently being designed as more than basic if-then types of on-
off switches (or gates.) Engineers are patterning logic mechanisms 
in tracking systems after the nervous system in living organisms 
so that they function as artificial neural networks. Ioannou (2012) 
believes his approach to adaptive control systems “…will be of 
great interest to the neural and fuzzy logic audience who will 
benefit from the strong similarity that exists between adaptive 
systems, whose stability properties are well established, and neural 
networks, fuzzy logic systems where stability and convergence 
issues are yet to be resolved” (p. xiv). The logical programming 
may be extraordinarily complex and mathematically rigorous to 
process the array of incoming variables, especially when multiple 
sensors are tracking multiple moving targets (Oh et al. 2013). 
Advanced logical programming integrates data from multiple 
sensors with pre-programmed ranges to further reduce target-
tracking uncertainties by filtering out useless data or “noise” and to 
make determinations on the validity of data prior to specifying an 
output response (Luo et al. 2002).
(3) Output responses. The final step in tracking is to respond to 
target movements. Though the response is usually a necessary 
consequence when specific conditions are encountered, responses 
can range from a simple discreet on-off action, to a continuous 
range produced by an algorithm utilizing input variables. This 
is illustrated in the multiple uses for tracking eye movements 
which range from medical diagnostics, refractive surgery, human-
computer interfaces, and commercial marketing (Gneo et al. 2012). 
Responses may be integral to a tracking system itself, such as a 
mechanism using stepping motors to keep a solar panel tracking 
the sun’s movement.
Implications of this hypothesis help clarify biological adaptability
A fundamental design constraint is that the capacities for a designed 
entity to both relate to—and adapt to—external conditions must be 
built entirely into an entity. In terms of external conditions, these are 
insufficient to cause changes to an internal system’s function. An 
engineer would identify conditions pertinent to performance and 
may specify some (amongst a myriad of conditions) as variables 
that are either present or not. The implication of the utilization 
of engineering principles and causation is reflected in the second 
half of our engineering-based, organism-focused characterization 
which keeps the operational spotlight on the organism rather than 
the environment.
An engineering approach focuses on whole systems and not 
individual elements. Since the entire system ceases to function 
with the loss of any vital element, then, no single element is 
declared to be causal. Only verifiable elements are included—and 
no vital element is omitted—in causal chains. With this primarily 
descriptive approach, causal chains in organism will: 1) generally 
link genetic or epigenetic information through, 2) specific systems

to, 3) modified traits and then, 4) to the specific environmental 
conditions to which they relate. 
METHOD
We reviewed 342 articles from the scientific literature and 67 
online reports (not duplicating the journal articles) from four topic 
areas pertaining to our hypothesis: 1) mechanisms conferring 
adaptability in varied taxa, 2) bioengineering, systems analysis, 
human-engineered tracking systems, robust control networks, 
robotics, and logical algorithms, 3) papers urging a greater 
integration of engineering analysis into biology, and 4) papers 
calling for modification of the current framework. The main body 
of data relating to the validity of our hypothesis deals with the 
varied mechanisms of adaptation. The body of this report describes 
23 examples that are a select subset most representative of different 
types and mechanisms for adaptation. Table 2 (found at the end 
of the paper) lists 22 different highly regulated, non-random 
mechanisms that would not be classified as environmentally 
fractionated heterozygosity, but instead confer phenotypic diversity 
through other means to enable (usually) rapid adaptation to new 
environments. The Reference section and Table 2 identify many of 
the major source materials, but not all those reviewed.
Findings were analyzed for correspondence of mechanisms 
utilized in living organisms to elements of human-engineered 
tracking systems. Results were also investigated to answer specific 
questions about adaptive mechanisms: Do published results identify 
a predominant mechanism for adaptation utilized by organisms? 
Is modification of genetic sequence the principle mechanism to 
express phenotypic changes? Could variations be categorized, 
irrespective of genetic or epigenetic causality, in discernable 
patterns that would give clues that organisms were tracking 
environmental changes? The final area investigated involved 
cataloging mechanisms of adaptation that could potentially lead to 
speciation or other diversification events.
RESULTS
A remarkable number of non-random mechanisms specifically 
directing variable, adaptive responses to changes in distinct 
environmental conditions were reported. Several of the following 
examples thoroughly describe the chain from exposure to a changed 
condition to a phenotypic response by identifying sensors, logic 
mechanisms, and an output. These were analogous to the elements 
of human-engineered tracking systems. The significance of these 
results as evidence for the CET framework is withheld until the 
Discussion section.
By way of overview, results can be grouped into systems-based 
adaptive mechanisms and phenotypic responses. Non-random 
phenotypic output responses could be traced to both genetic and 
epigenetic mechanisms. Responses encompass modifications 
to physiological systems involved in maintaining cellular and 
organismal homeostasis. External modifications ranging from 
color variation to the total non-development of organs, major 
morphotypic reformations, and alterations in behavior. Some 
responses happened in a single organism within minutes, while 
others were found to affect entire populations and persist for several 
generations. Other novel responses did not result directly from 
either genetic or epigenetic changes but were the consequence of 
internal processes initiated upon detection of changed conditions. 
Of particular note was the identification of certain mechanisms and 
phenotypic responses which are both predictable and reversible.
We further subcategorize variations as developmental responses 
(both embryonic and juvenile)—these are the primary drivers of 
morphology—and adult responses, which directly influence the 
distribution of traits in diverse niches.
1. Developmental Response to Environmental Parameters
A. Embryonic development
The development of blind cave fish, Astyanax mexicanas, from a 
population of sighted river fish is the subject of active research. 
A critical question was how a river fish finding itself suddenly 
trapped in a cave environment would respond. Rohner et al (2013) 
investigated the activity of a common stress-related chaperone 
protein HSP 90 [heat shock protein 90] which has wide-ranging 
activity in cells, including a molecular mechanism for buffering 
latent, adaptable genetic variation (if present in the genome) and 
expressing it in response to differing environmental conditions. 
The target environmental condition was cave water abiotic factors 
(but not the presence of light.) Caves have other distinguishing 
conditions besides darkness. The ability of water to conduct 
electricity may show up to a five-fold decrease in cave water 
compared to surface streams. The authors presupposed that A. 
mexicanas, would respond (by an undescribed mechanism) to 
fluctuations in water conductivity. They showed that fish embryos 
which develop in low conductivity up-regulate HSP 90 response 
genes, which enabled expression of innate variability in eye size 
ranging from slightly decreased to absent within the first generation. 
River fish placed in low conductivity during larval development 
displayed a 50% increase in eye and orbit size variation. Additional 
tests showed that de novo mutations did not cause these genetic 
variations for small eye size, and after being “unmasked” they 
seemed to remain expressed in offspring. 
For various reptiles including some lizards, snakes, turtles, and 
alligators, a single clutch of eggs may all converge on the same 
sex (Sifuentes-Romero 2017). Their sex is not determined by 
heteromorphic chromosomes, but by a developmental program 
using data they collect about their incubating temperature during 
a temperature-sensitive period. All females develop at one 
temperature, all males at another, and a ratio of both sexes at 
temperatures in between (ratios are further modulated by added 
data on sand moisture content.) This data is used to regulate 
different ratios of gene products for sex-affecting hormones. The 
process is triggered by temperature sensors in eggs discovered by 
Yatsu et al. (2015) in “…the first experimental demonstration of a 
link between a well-described thermo-sensory mechanism, TRPV4 
channel, and its potential role in regulation of TSD [temperature-
dependent sex determination] in vertebrates, shedding unique new 
light on the elusive TSD molecular mechanism” (p. 1).
B. Juvenile development
Phenotypic plasticity refers to the expression of different 
combinations of traits from a single genotype as an organism 
responds to different environmental conditions. Plasticity is a 
broader description for a graded response that usually correlates 
to the quantity of exposure to certain conditions. The nature of 
Guliuzza and Gaskill  ◀ How organisms continuously track environmental changes ▶ 2018 ICC
162
conditions is broad and includes temperature, sunlight, moisture, 
chemicals, nutrition, population density, etc. Polyphenism is a type 
of plasticity where discrete, all-or-nothing expressions of traits 
happens upon exposure—usually to a threshold level. The change 
in color of an artic fox’s fur from grey-brown to white in the fall is 
an example of seasonal polyphenism. 
The significance of phenotypic plasticity to diversification and 
adaptation is described by West and Packer (2002) who say that 
the “environmental effects on trait morphology can be substantial, 
outweighing both genetic effects and reproductive advantages” (p. 
1339). A few illustrations highlight the importance of external-
condition detectors to initiate developmental, physiological, 
phenotypic, or behavioral changes, and the extent to which these 
changes could lead to speciation and diversification.
Observable phenotypic differences that distinguish species, 
and certainly genera, are assumed to be the result of genetic 
polymorphisms. But this assumption may not be accurate. Susoy et 
al. (2016) report experiments which indicate that some genera-level 
morphotypes of a fig-associated nematode Pristionchus are the result 
of polyphenism and not genetic polymorphism. Upon colonizing 
the island-like microecosystem of individual figs, symbiotic 
nematodes of the genus Pristionchus expressed a polyphenism with 
up to five discrete adult morphotypes per species. The principle 
target condition in this study was found to be both fig type and fig 
maturation. Since juvenile development cannot be cultured outside 
of figs, any environmental cues detected during development 
associated with differing morphs cannot be identified. Yet, the five 
major morphotypes identified were associated with fig type, fig 
phase (early and late interfloral), and transit on, versus through, 
their specific wasp vector (Ceratosolen spp.). Genetic sequencing 
demonstrated that from a single genotype, developmental plasticity 
had led to discontinuous novelties whose variation exceeded level 
of genera in the same family. They concluded that this was a case 
of “macroevolutionary-scale” diversification, with some structures 
having no analogs in other nematodes, without genetic divergence. 
Tadpoles of the tree frog Hyla chrysoscelis demonstrate 
developmental phenotypic adjustment when exposed only to 
aquarium tank water that had harbored dragonfly larvae of the 
tadpole predators Aeshna or Anax. McCollum and Leimberger 
(1997) document that tadpoles have exquisite capability to, “detect 
waterborne chemical” substances “produced by predators” (p. 616). 
Post-exposure, tadpoles developed a thick, muscular, bright red tail 
which increased their probability to escape future predation better 
than tadpoles isolated from predator exposure during development. 
Relyea (2005) followed up on the tadpole-predator study to 
determine whether a plastic trait expressed in one generation could 
be passed on to offspring which themselves experienced variable 
levels of the exposure during their development. He concluded that 
“predator-induced traits can frequently be heritable, although the 
magnitude of heritability can be wide ranging across environments. 
Moreover, the plasticity of these defenses also can be heritable” 
(p.864).
Multiple studies identify an exquisite detection-response linkage 
in some organisms. They detect the presence of predators, respond 
with phenotypic adjustments either during development or as 
adult forms, and then pass a tendency for the adjusted form on 
to offspring. Stabell and Lwin (1997) conducted experiments to 
determine elements of an underlying mechanism that might explain 
why the body depth and muscle mass of crucian carp, Carassius 
carassius, increases in the presence of the predator northern pike, 
Esox lucius. They demonstrated that crucian carp did not respond 
with growth changes after exposure to either the pike itself, nor 
to pike-fed Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus. Morphological changes 
occurred only after carp were exposed to pike which had been 
feeding on other crucian carp, or when exposed to water containing 
skin tissue (prepared and homogenized) of conspecifics. They 
conclude that chemical substances from the skin of conspecific fish 
are a stimulus for induction of the phenotypical changes.
Another review paper indicates that the role of phenotypic plasticity 
for diversification and speciation may be going unnoticed. Pfennig 
et al. (2010) document cases of speciation resulting from phenotypic 
plasticity and conclude that “generally, phenotypic plasticity can 
play a largely underappreciated role in driving diversification and 
speciation” (p. 459). They point out that an organism’s abilities 
to rapidly respond to changes facilitate diversification since “…
alternative resource-use morphs might be particularly effective at 
facilitating speciation because the same conditions that promote 
resource polyphenism simultaneously foster speciation’s three 
components: genetic isolation, divergence and reproductive 
isolation” (p. 462).
2. Adult Response to Environmental Dynamics
A. Phenotypic response
Patterson (2007) discusses how the thickness, length, and color of a 
male lion’s mane, which may vary over the course of a single year, 
depends on its ability to detect at least two conditions: temperature 
and rainfall. West and Packer (2002) also note how the presence 
of these conditions, available nutrition, and a non-environmental 
exposure (age), play a more prominent role than genetics in 
determining the characteristics of mane.
The speed of adult phenotypic alteration is demonstrated in 
desert locusts which can change reversibly between solitarious 
and gregarious phases. These are so dissimilar in physiology, 
morphology and behavior, that they were recognized as different 
species until 1921. Rogers et al. (2014) shows that, when a 
previously discovered sensor on the hind femora is subjected to 
increased tactile stimulation due to forced crowding, solitarious 
locusts begin within one hour to exhibit the behaviors of the long-
term gregarious locusts. Then by the next molt (within 4-7 hours) 
they completely morph into the gregarious phenotype. Miller et al. 
(2008) establishes how “depending on their rearing density, female 
desert locusts Schistocerca gregaria epigenetically endow their 
offspring with differing phenotypes…[which] affords organisms 
robustness against environmental fluctuation…[and is] persistent 
for some duration in the absence of inducing stimuli” (p. 300).
Adult forms that maintain sexual plasticity demonstrate the 
potential of adult phenotypic modification. In a large resident 
female Blue-headed Wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, ovaries 
regress and testes grow within a single day if a territorial male is 
lost (Warner and Swearer 1991). Even though Godwin et al. (2008) 
assert that the environment is sending information to a female 
Guliuzza and Gaskill  ◀ How organisms continuously track environmental changes ▶ 2018 ICC
163
Wrasse, they document a thoroughly internal mechanism mediated 
by the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in a female detecting an 
absent male, and subsequent sexual transformation.
B. Epigenetic response
Some theorists speculate that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is essential 
to a natural origin of life, shapes evolutionary diversification, and 
contributes to mass extinctions (Olson and Straub 2015). H2S is 
largely an environmental toxin introduced via natural geochemical 
and biological processes, or industrialization. Kelley et al. (2016) 
looked at the target condition of H2S in three river drainage 
systems in Mexico. They found that when exposed to varying 
H2S concentrations, genetic transcription within gill tissue of 
small live-bearing fish of the Poecilia mexicana species complex 
demonstrated, on average, 1,626 up-regulated and 1,827 down-
regulated transcripts adaptively correlated to mediating H2S flux 
into the fish through diffusion, regulating H2S homeostasis, and 
mitigating side effects by detoxification.
To investigate one mechanism which might link ambient 
temperature changes to adaption, Weyrich et al. (2016) obtained 
five genetically heterogenous male wild guinea pigs (Cavia aperea) 
originating from Argentina and Uruguay. The environmental 
target condition was ambient heat. Researchers proceeded on the 
assumption that guinea pigs have a neurological mechanism to 
detect temperature changes (without identifying a specific sensor.) 
Males sired an F1 generation. Prior to the next mating, males were 
kept in cages placed on a heating plate which kept the floor at 30 °C 
for one cycle of spermatogenesis (60 days). F1 and F2 generations 
were obtained after mating with the same females. Comparison 
of epigenetic methylation of specific genomic regions in liver 
and testis between pre-and-post heat treatment found epigenetic 
changes in both paternal guinea pigs and F2 offspring on 13 of 19 
temperature-regulating genes, and 12 additional genes involved in 
temperature regulation had their promoters epigenetically altered.
If an adult mouse learned to fear the scent of fox urine, such 
information could be useful to offspring. Dias and Ressler 
(2014) conditioned male lab mice (Mus muluscus) to fear a 
target condition: acetophenone (cherry blossom) odor. With each 
exposure, males received painful foot shocks. The sensor was an 
olfactory bulb developmentally controlled by the M71 gene related 
to acetophenone. Offspring of males mated to naïve females had 
an increased number of odor-specific cells, increased size of odor-
specific glomerulus in their nose, and 200% increase in response 
to acetophenone compared to controls. Phenotypic changes were 
mediated by epigenetic methylation of an unaltered M71 sequence. 
Offspring conceived by artificial insemination from sperm of 
acetophenone-fearing fathers had similar changes.
The molecular basis of the adaptive changes in Darwin’s finches 
on the Galapagos islands is assumed to be genetic variation 
fractioned out through differential survival. However, McNew et 
al. (2017) note that “growing evidence suggests that epigenetic 
mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, may also be involved 
in rapid adaptation to new environments” (p.1). Comparing over 
1,000 birds in adjacent “rural” and “urban” populations of each of 
two species of ground finches (Geospiza fortis and G. fuliginosa) 
on Santa Cruz Island, they found significant morphological 
differences in beak depth, width, length, chord length, and tarsus 
length between urban and rural populations of G. fortis (but not 
for body mass), and no statistical changes for G. fuliginosa. Copy 
number variations between populations of either species were 
mostly unchanged. Phenotypic differences were associated with the 
dramatic DNA methylation variances discovered between urban 
and rural populations. They speculate that a change toward human-
associated foodstuffs is the target environmental condition. Urban 
finches face far greater exposure. They reported no identifiable 
link between the exposure and epigenetic changes, which were 
explained as “environmentally-induced epimutations.”
C. Distributive response
Drosophilids have innate and species-specific humidity 
preferences. Enjin et al. (2016) were the first to describe genes 
and neurons necessary for hygrosensation in the vinegar fly. The 
target environmental condition is relative humidity, which is used 
as a cue to navigate to different environments. D. melanogaster 
has sensors for dry, moist, and cold conditions through neuron tips 
in a specialized organ in the antenna. They identified the detector 
enabling D. melanogaster to track humidity changes and migrate 
accordingly. 
Gulls of the family Laridae are found in both freshwater and 
saltwater environments. Barrnett et al. (1983) describe the de-novo 
membrane biogenesis of an “avian salt gland.” The gland’s osmotic 
action extracts excess sodium from plasma and excretes it through 
a port in the nasal beak. The target environmental condition is 
brackish water. Gulls possess an osmotic sensor in the cardiac 
vasculature. After detecting increased sodium ion concentration, 
neurologic and endocrine actions control cell differentiation and 
hypertrophy to form the gland. The organ formation is reversible, 
enabling gulls to migrate between freshwater and brackish 
estuaries. 
3. Reversibility of Adaptation
If a population steadily expresses traits highly specialized for one 
niche, then it could head down a genetically unrecoverable one-
way street. Mundy et al. (2016) observed that this circumstance 
could “lead to a genetic constraint on adaptation if the environment 
subsequently changes” (p. 1) which forces them into occupying a 
certain niche or dying. Their concern, within the current framework, 
is that “in evolutionary biology, Dollo’s Law [of irreversibility] 
proposes that complex adaptations cannot be reacquired easily 
once lost” due to degeneration of developmental pathways as 
mutations accumulate.
Other theorists question the validity of the “irreversibility” 
concept. Reversals have been documented in the reappearance of 
teeth in certain frogs (Wiens 2011) and in the lineage of an extinct 
kangaroo (Couzens et al. 2016), and in beak morphology in a 
lineage of Hawaiian birds (Freed et al. 2016). These researchers 
also document, by way of historical background, the reacquisition 
of certain traits, including: reversals for wings in stick insects, 
coiling in snail shells, color vision, eggshells in boid snakes, and 
others. Two microbiologists (Ogbunuga and Hartl 2016) working 
to treat drug-resistant malaria through various paths of “reverse 
evolution” stated, “the lack of a coherent understanding of reverse 
evolution is partly due to conceptual ambiguity: the term ‘reverse 
Guliuzza and Gaskill  ◀ How organisms continuously track environmental changes ▶ 2018 ICC
164
evolution’ is misleading, as it implies directionality in a process 
[Darwinian evolution] that is near-sighted and agnostic with regard 
to goal. This has spawned similarly dubious concepts, such as 
Dollo’s Law, asserting that evolution is intrinsically irreversible…” 
(p. 2). Considering the dwindling evidence for the law-like nature 
of Dollo’s Law, Collin and Miglietta (2008) conclude that support 
for this view has become untenable.
The mechanisms for recovery of ancestral states are slowly being 
deciphered. Evidently, the developmental pathways and genetics 
for idled traits are often retained. Galis, et al. (2010) found 
that, after loss of a structure, in many cases “…the genetic and 
developmental architecture to develop such structures continues to 
be fully present…” (p.2466). Couzens et al (2016) also reviewed 
how reversibility may be variably widespread among organisms, 
and state “…it has been argued that trait reversibility may be 
promoted when there is reutilization of conserved developmental 
pathways…[and] the reutilization of regulatory pathways and 
constituent genes is widespread in development and ancestral 
states are recoverable across a diverse spectrum of metazoan 
structures.” (p. 568). Collin and Miglietta. (2008) also describe 
cases where genetic and developmental pathways of “lost” traits 
are reactivated. Two other aspects of these reversals make them 
quite remarkable. First, there are the multiple instances of repeated 
oscillation between loss-and-reversal which, second, happened 
over time spans purported to range from tens to hundreds of millions 
of years—which counterintuitively indicates that the genetic and 
developmental pathways remained undegraded for astonishingly 
long times (Couzens et al. 2016; Freed et al. 2016; Wiens 2011).
Reversion to a prior phenotype in a population would not necessarily 
involve a back-mutation. Hubert et al. (2016) acknowledge that 
“reversibility of evolution is a long studied and questioned aspect 
of evolutionary biology. Especially in small populations, slightly 
deleterious mutations may accumulate and become fixed by genetic 
drift” (p. 1). They report on European carp bred to be scale-free 
(homozygotous.) A population transported in 1912 from France 
to Madagascar (which had no native carp populations) colonized 
natural waters. By the 1950s, carp had re-grown scales. This 
development was inexplicable, since they could cite no studies 
confirming a survival value of scaled over non-scaled phenotypes. 
Their analysis found that these fish were still homozygous to be 
scale-free, but that scale growth was under polygenic control and 
the current fish were expressing scales by accessing another genetic 
route. They conclude that these “visible and striking” findings are 
“…evidence for a rescue of the wildtype-like scale cover…[by] 
polygenes from standing genetic variation…[through] other routes 
than reversion mutation, and suggests that natural populations 
can host enough capacity for adaptation on the short-term to face 
a sudden environmental change, even if a harmful mutation was 
formerly fixed” (p. 6).
DISCUSSION
1. Variation appears directed, not random
Variation perpetuates “in the classical view…[when] species 
experience spontaneous genetic mutations that produce various 
novel traits—some helpful, some detrimental. Nature then selects 
for those most beneficial, passing them along to subsequent 
generations. It’s an elegant model.” (Whitehead 2013, p. 1) Thus, 
in the classical view, genetic heterozygosity generated via random 
mutations, or conceivably originating as a standing assemblage, 
becomes fractioned into subpopulations by the struggle to survive 
in challenging environments. In dramatic contrast, the results from 
our survey of the literature (summarized in the regulated changes 
described above and further detailed in Table 2) provide evidence 
of multiple controlled mechanisms that bias or direct phenotypic 
variation in a population toward specific, adaptive outcomes. 
However, it has taken several decades to discover these alternative 
mechanisms; recognize and collate them into non-random, directed 
mechanistic categories; and then to realize their contributions 
toward variation, diversification, and adaptation. As Charlesworth 
et al. (2017) discuss, researchers are just beginning to determine the 
relative importance with regard to diversification and adaptation of 
these dissimilar and distinct mechanisms compared to, or perhaps 
contributing to, the status quo genetic fractionation explanation 
which they endorse. Our survey of the literature uncovered 
evidence that epigenetic changes are the product of systems that 
have sensors to detect changed conditions, that process data within 
logic mechanisms, and that are observed to have rapid and targeted 
responses. It appears that regulated, condition-sensing epigenetic 
mechanisms also “prime the pump” for specific adaptive variation 
in offspring.
For example, after Weyrich (2016) detected that paternal Wild 
guinea pigs and their offspring had improved long-term resilience 
to temperature increases, he concludes, “we demonstrated 
immediate and inherited paternal epigenetic response with a 
potential adaptation reaction that occurred in response to increased 
ambient temperature in a wild genetically heterogeneous mammal 
species, the Wild guinea pig” (p.8). That epigenetic control can 
be adaptive and transgenerational was corroborated by Ressler 
commenting on his journal-published research (see Dias and 
Ressler 2014): “such information transfer would be an efficient 
way for parents to ‘inform’ their offspring about the importance of 
specific environmental features that they are likely to encounter in 
their future environments” (Le Roux 2013).
In addition, Rohner et al. (2013) deduce from their results on blind 
cave fish, Astyanax mexicanas, from a population of sighted river 
fish that “because multiple variants can be unmasked at the same 
time, this system provides a mechanism to create complex traits 
in a single step… (p.1372) [that] would have helped potentiate a 
rapid response to the cave environment” (p.1375). Variants that can 
be “unmasked” precede the environmental challenge. Unmasking 
of variants is under tight, internal regulation so that responses 
occur only after organisms detect specified changes. Also, the 
expression of variants occurred repeatedly, within one generation, 
after fish were exposed during development to either an HSP90 
inhibitor or to water conductivity mimicking cave conditions. 
These internally, self-adjusted phenotypic outputs enable this 
fish’s adaptive response to migration into cave environments. 
Taken together, these results indicate that expression of variants 
is a necessary and predictable consequence of an internal logic-
based algorithm altering embryonic development. Those fish with 
unmasked variants that successfully fit the specific cave conditions 
tend to become dominant in a new population.
Further, we found that directed phenotypic change—enabling 
Guliuzza and Gaskill  ◀ How organisms continuously track environmental changes ▶ 2018 ICC
165
colonization of an “empty niche” (i.e., an environment 
not previously inhabited by a species)—and its potential 
contribution to diversification can be extensive. Susoy, et al.’s 
work (2016) on the fig-associated nematode Pristionchus 
found “macroevolutionary-scale diversification without genetic 
divergence…[so] that rapid filling of potential ecological niches 
is possible without diversifying selection on genotypes. This 
uncoupling of morphological diversification and speciation in fig-
associated nematodes has resulted from a remarkable expansion of 
discontinuous developmental plasticity” (p. 1). The morphotypic 
changes exceeded what would be observed at the species level. 
They summarize that “…given the ‘empty niche’ conditions 
predisposing an ecosystem to the trophic diversification of its 
colonists…and [given] that developmental plasticity can lead to the 
multiplication of discontinuous novelties from a single genotype” 
(p.6) substantial phenotypic change can precede speciation.
Finally, we found that many taxa exhibit mechanisms that enable 
reversal to ancestral states in future generations. This ability 
correlates to a useful “turn back” mechanism that engineers embed 
in tracking systems on drones. It seems reasonable that organisms 
could also reverse direction so that they could escape getting 
trapped in a genetic dead-end. It appears this can occur through the 
persistence of underlying “developmental architecture” (Galis, et 
al. 2010) that “reanimates” genetically mothballed features. This 
compares to engineered “turn off-turn on” control mechanisms. The 
fact that genetic and developmental pathways can be deactivated 
but remain functionally intact for generations (giving the 
appearance of a “lost” trait), and then reactivated during embryonic 
development in future generations, is mechanistic evidence of how 
some populations can continuously track environmental changes 
even over long periods. Evidence for reversibility at phenotypic 
and morphotypic levels appears contrary to evolutionary and 
heterozygous fractionation models.
Thus, it appears that multiple mechanisms exist which direct 
variation toward specific adaptive responses to specific 
environmental changes, contrary to the classical view with its 
reliance on random variation. These mechanisms can reasonably 
be described as “tracking” the environment in the sense that they 
appear to detect environmental changes, process this information, 
and then adjust traits in an adaptive manner. Thus, they appear to 
have features correlating to all three components of man-made 
tracking systems (sensors, logic mechanisms, output responses), 
just as expected from our Continuous Environmental Tracking 
hypothesis.
2. Continuous Environmental Tracking (CET) is the foundation 
for adaptation
CET is purely a descriptive title for what creatures seem to do as 
they adapt. CET assumes that the most accurate way to explain 
the function of adaptable biological systems is with the same 
engineering principles that govern human-engineered tracking 
systems. CET, therefore, could become the basis for a new 
framework (i.e., framing observations, interpreting facts, and 
guiding research) meant to replace the current framework for 
understanding adaptability. This engineering-based, organism-
focused characterization of organism’s systems is only changing 
the way existing data are organized and interpreted. This means 
that other approaches are not necessarily excluded.
With CET, we assert that adaptation primarily occurs during 
embryonic and juvenile development (genotype, morphotype, 
phenotype), and as the result of continuous surveillance and 
shadowing of the environment (i.e., response to environmental 
parameters made possible by sensors and mechanisms), and 
secondarily as an adult response to environmental dynamics 
(phenotype, epigenotype) (Figure 1). This assertion is made 
based on our findings (highlighted in Results and detailed in 
Table 2) regarding the observed internal mechanisms of adaptive 
change. The current framework of random variation, randomly 
efficacious hit-and-miss responses, and subsequent death-driven 
fractionation, is not excluded as an explanation, but either demoted 
in importance or, more properly, seen as a contrary process. 
Instead, this approach views organisms as active, problem-solving 
entities that respond to environmental challenges instead of passive 
entities which are shaped by environmental challenges. CET thus 
implies that adaptation is fundamentally produced by regulated 
gene expression and not gene inheritance, per se. Adaptation at 
the population level then results from a combination of directed 
variation in individuals (resulting from CET during all life stages) 
and differential inheritance of those variations (i.e., from unequal 
distribution and reproduction) by the next generation.

3. CET aptly describes the evidence
Theorists are still absorbing the full implications of these newly-
discovered internal mechanisms of adaptation and are trying to 
determine if they fit within current theory. So now, in this rare 
time of unsettled and open-ended discourse among evolutionary 
scientists over theories of adaptation, it is very appropriate to 
frame new findings using an engineering-based, organism-focused 
structure into which they seem to naturally fit. We now consider 
additional observations within the literature which seem to point 
to CET, clarify what CET implies, and favorably contrast an 
internalistic, engineering-based framework to current theory. 
A. “Regulated,” “rapid,” “repeatable,” and “reversible” describe 
adaptable tracking systems
A significant observation from the literature review is that 
internal mechanisms of adaptation yield responses habitually 
characterized as “regulated,” “rapid,” very often “repeatable,” 
and, surprisingly at times, even “reversible.” These words fittingly 
describe the purposeful outcomes of robust, adaptable engineered 
tracking systems. Prior to the discovery of regulated phenotypic 
outcomes, Stephen J. Gould (1994) contrasted the random, death-
driven parsing out of genetic variation he assumed was evidence 
supporting current theory, with the controlled, purposeful outcomes 
of internally-regulated systems. He said, “natural selection is a 
theory of ‘trial and error externalism’—organisms propose via 
their storehouse of variation, and environments dispose of nearly 
all—not an efficient and human ‘goal-directed internalism’ (which 
would be fast and lovely, but nature does not know the way)” 
(p. 6). New findings provide evidence that “nature” does indeed 
“know the way.”
B. Innate capacity controls responses to the environment 
Consistent with Gould’s recognition that the internalist and 
externalist approaches are contradictory, discoveries of internal 
systems producing what seem like targeted responses are forcing 
a move away from environment-driven, selectionist explanations. 
Researchers have started coining terms for adaptive mechanisms 
that descriptively sound very close to engineered, innate capacity 
such as: “stem plasticity” (Susoy et al. 2016, p. 6), “standing 
genetic variation” (Rohner et al. 2013, p. 1372), “natural genetic 
engineering” (Shapiro 2011, p. 161), “cryptic genetic variation” 
(Sangster et al, 2008, p. 2963), “facilitated phenotypic variation” 
(Gerhart and Kirschner 2007, p. 8582), “adaptively inducible 
canalizers” (Meiklejohn and Hartl 2002, p. 468), and “evolutionary 
capacitors” (Rutherford and Lindquist 1998, p. 336). All of these 
terms describe means to access innate self-adjusting capacity 
for what Waddington noted in 1942 as, “a suitable genetically 
controlled reactivity in the organism” which he referred to as “a set 
of alternative canalyzed [innate] paths” (Waddington 1942, p. 564, 
565). Taken together, these results establish a growing recognition 
that internal systems specify if organisms can, and how they will, 
relate to external conditions. 
C. Diverse inheritance mechanisms facilitate transgenerational 
environmental tracking
Most of the mechanisms reviewed here demonstrate that organisms 
utilize input elements (sensors) to sense environmental conditions, 
logic mechanisms to interpret those inputs and determine 
responses, and output mechanisms to implement responses. 
Additionally, these same elements are utilized in tandem to 
trans-generationally track environmental changes in two distinct 
steps. That is, first, the parent directly detects an environmental 
change, which is processed, and then an output response is sent 
into the milieu of the developing offspring which, second, detects 
it and responds with self-adjusted phenotypic outputs suitable to 
conditions detected by the parent. Recall the paternal mouse’s 
detection of acetophenone—which started the process leading to 
epigenetic modifications in offspring modifying expression of the 
M71 gene, as documented in the work of Dias and Ressler (2014). 
A Duke University study on the tiny worm C. elegans observed 
detailed maternal-to-offspring signals about a nutrition-deprived 
environment (Hibshman et al 2016). It described “a genetic network 
that mediates effects of a mother’s diet on the size and starvation 
resistance of her offspring” that worked by “signaling through [an] 
insulin-like receptor” which “function in the mother to transmit 
information about her diet to her offspring.” Remarkably similar 
findings, most likely due to epigenetic modifications, were noted 
for humans as well. Children born to parents exposed to starvation 
during conception and gestation had an increased risk of type 2 
diabetes and hyperglycemia, which indicated to researchers that 
in-utero epigenetic modifications predisposed them to be calorie 
hoarders in the face of being born into a starvation environment. 
The transgenerational odds of developing hyperglycemia were 
about 2:1 in both children and grandchildren, while there was 
about a 75% increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the children of 
starved parents (Li et al 2016).
We are not arguing that cross-generational variability of traits 
that could result from standing heterozygosity is not a source of 
adaptive phenotypes, but that this mode of inheritance should 
be viewed no differently than any other trait that is a product of 
internally regulated systems that produce a potential solution to an 
environmental challenge. Furthermore, the mechanisms described 
here signal that the penultimate role in the current framework 
accorded to genetics, primarily genes, to propel adaptation should 
be diminished. Evidence indicates that the genome may function as 
any other sub-system of the cell since, ultimately, it is the organism 
which senses and responds to external variables (Keller 2014). But 
it should also be noted that the traits derived during development 
principally under genetic/epigenetic control are an important, but 
not the sole, determinant of the fit of offspring to its niche. Heredity 
would broadly include all mechanisms facilitating offspring-parent 
resemblance that promote the maintenance of homeostasis or 
enhance the suitability of an organism to its niche, which includes: 
genetic, epigenetic of all types, physiological, microbial symbionts, 
behaviors, physical resources, parent-altered ecological niches, and 
population-modified cultures. These mechanisms are wide-ranging 
in mode of transmission, rate of effect, and manner of action.
D. Environmental tracking starts as a developmental necessity
Environmental tracking begins early in development and continues 
throughout the lifetime of an individual organism. An engineering-
based, organism-focused framework doesn’t view organisms 
as constructed by their parents or their environment. Organisms 
begin with innate capacity to self-construct, self-metabolize, 
self-maintain, self-repair, self-adjust, reproduce, and transfer an 
inheritance. Genetic and non-genetic factors transferred from parent 
Guliuzza and Gaskill  ◀ How organisms continuously track environmental changes ▶ 2018 ICC
167
are viewed from a design perspective as highly influential variables 
utilized in the offspring’s assorted developmental algorithms, but 
they do not control the entire development. External conditions 
do not bypass an organism’s boundary and directly control the 
expression of its genes, but expression is a system-derived outcome 
with no single system element elevated to causal status. Embryonic 
control systems, sensors, and developmental response mechanisms 
map the course of development by constantly monitoring and 
self-adjusting to internal and external states. Recall how tadpoles 
of the tree frog Hyla chrysoscelis will rapidly morph into a form 
with thick muscular bright red tails when they “detect waterborne 
chemical” substances “produced by predators” of the dragonfly 
larvae in the water (McCollum and Leimberger 1997, p. 616). The 
detection of dragonfly larvae chemical signatures is only data. That 
data is a reliable conditional input to their developmental program 
that directs them to develop tails to better escape predation. Sensors 
specifically tuned for dragonfly larvae are the actual “triggers” 
within organisms to initiate their self-adjustment processes.
E. Environmental tracking requires the whole organism
The tracking elements of sensors, logic mechanisms, and response 
systems may reside very distantly from each other on the organism 
but nonetheless work very tightly together. Possessing a sensor 
is not enough. Programming internal to the organism specifies 
what constitute actual environmental “signals” or “stimuli” for 
itself (which explains why a myriad of other exposures are never 
stimuli for the sensor). This implies that adaptations result from the 
functioning of the whole organism, and not merely from genomic 
changes. Likewise, the research of Shapiro (2016) demonstrates 
that in one of it several roles, the genome looks like a dynamic 
logic-housing sub-system of the cell (or organism) supporting its 
role of responding to detected conditions. Thus, environmental 
tracking ability appears to be irreducible below the organismal 
level.
F. Targeted, rapid solutions solve environmental challenges
As organisms track environmental targets, their responses are 
directed toward solutions specifically targeted to the challenge. 
Astyanax mexicanas, progeny’s reduced eye size in cave conditions 
is a single-step, focused response. Mus muluscus pups’ increased 
glomeruli and neuronal support was specifically targeted for 
acetophenone. Crucian carp, Carassius carassius, responded 
precisely to gape-limited predators by rapidly morphing into a 
larger size. Cavia aperea guinea pig pups had epigenetic changes 
on genes specific for temperature regulation, and so forth.
Targeted responses indicate mechanisms operating in a vastly 
different manner from those which would produce the random 
results expected in the dominant framework where “further 
improvements were accidentally thrown up (by genetic mutation, 
according to modern biology) then retained in turn” (Millikan 
2014, p. 63) or the hit-and-miss results that Peter Godfrey-Smith 
states are expected from a selectionist framework that must “…rely 
on a process that can be described loosely as ‘trial and error’. New 
variations are produced in a spontaneous and unintelligent way, 
and a few successful variants are kept while others are discarded” 
(Godfrey-Smith 2010, p.29). 
G. Epigenetic mechanisms facilitate rapid phenotypic “flexing”
Phenotypic flexing captures two concepts related to engineered 
robustness: the ability to rapidly “bend” phenotypically, but not 
break, to stressful conditions; and the ability to return to “baseline” 
if conditions revert. Accumulation of mutations within the germ 
line, or even variation from a standing population of heterozygous 
alleles, seems far too slow to solve some challenges. Internally-
regulated epigenetic mechanisms variably mark specific nucleotides 
of DNA with different molecules which exert control over how the 
information in DNA is expressed, but without changing the genetic 
sequence.
From a design-based view, genetic stability combined with 
plastic variable expression confers the ability for phenotypes 
to rapidly “flex” to a rapid environmental change. CET would 
imply epigenetic changes such as rapid (within one generation) 
adaptations that of necessity fill an intermediate time gap between 
very rapid physiologic changes and slow, multi-generational 
genetic changes. Weyrich et al. (2016) sum up this function: 
“The regulation of genes and their expression is fundamental 
for immediate adaptation processes in the same generation. In 
addition, the inheritance of responses to experienced changes 
(adapted traits) is fundamental for long-term adaptational memory. 
The mechanism regulating gene expression and conferring such 
immediate and inherited adaptation is ‘epigenetic response’” (p.1). 
H. Diversification as a continuum of adaptations succeeding 
continuous tracking
With CET, environmental tracking should happen continuously 
from development through the time offspring inherit niche-suitable 
resemblances. Therefore, adaptive phenotypes produced by 
epigenetic mechanisms or phenotypic plasticity could be viewed as 
a continuum of change which would range from rapid physiologic 
to multi-generational. Speciation may not be a “goal,” “target,” or 
“end-product” as researchers generally understand it, but it could 
be thought of as simply a transient manifestation of a discreet set 
of characters along a continuum of adaptation. 
I. CET of variable conditions correlates with observed episodic 
speciation rates
The CET hypothesis implies that organisms track environmental 
changes at whatever rate and manner that they occur. This contrasts 
with a fundamental tenet of the current framework: gradualism. 
Gradualism holds that the rate of diversification, (as seen by 
the magnitude of morphologic change within a taxon,) must be 
essentially linear in terms of the number of species over time. 
Stephen J. Gould explains why this belief may not consistently 
align with actual observations but is a core principle of selectionist 
theory nonetheless: “substantial change might occur as a very rare 
event, but most alteration must be insensible, even on geologic 
scales.” (Gould 2002, p. 147, emphasis in original). CET is free 
from a constraint on how rates will be interpreted. Therefore, 
it would be expected that at times the rate of change could be 
described as linear, episodic, or asymptotic, and the trajectory may 
be either positive or negative.
Jeanson (2015) completed a unique in-depth study of mtDNA, 
amassing data he used to graph the cumulative total number of 
species for representative kinds of organisms versus time, covering 
Guliuzza and Gaskill  ◀ How organisms continuously track environmental changes ▶ 2018 ICC
168
approximately the last 4000 years. His data could be interpreted 
as episodic speciation across diverse taxa as they track rapid and 
slower rates of environmental change. Though Jeanson interprets 
the data as a linear change, we see his plotted data as consistently 
resembling episodic graphs. These data seem to fit CET well 
since an abrupt and extensive change in conditions seems more 
likely to lead to the appearance of unique characteristics. Tight 
environmental tracking could show a tendency of traits to change 
rapidly at times and then, during periods of steadier environmental 
change, organisms would “ratchet” an ever-closer fit of their traits 
to the conditions—a phenomenon which was noted by Reigner 
(2015). Rohner et al. (2013) demonstrates that complex traits in 
organisms can appear in a single step as they track sudden changes 
in conditions. This observation fits the episodic changes we see in 
Jeanson’s data and may explain why some species could appear 
without morphological intermediates.
J. CET harmonizes rapid acquisitions of similar traits by diverse 
organisms
A remarkable biological phenomenon occurs when two unrelated 
organisms express very similar traits (usually in similar 
environments), or the when offspring rapidly express similar new 
traits when relocated to remote islands with similar conditions. 
A tracking mechanism could explain how two or more groups of 
organisms arrive at a specific phenotypic “location.” Thus, if two 
unrelated organisms are actively tracking similar environmental 
changes and their internal logic centers use similar algorithms to 
directly express suitable traits as responses, then the fact that they 
exhibit similar features is explained as a particular and necessary 
consequence of similar internal plans within independent organisms. 
For example, Esquerre and Keogh (2016) show that pythons and 
boas display strong and widespread morphological similarity when 
they occupy equivalent ecological niches ranging from arboreal to 
aquatic. They demonstrate strong coupling of similar phenotypic 
traits to ecological diversification. Losos (2017) documents a 
similar coupling of rapid, predictable phenotypic expressions in 
equivalent ecological niches in anolis lizards—and across many 
other taxa—which appears to be normal throughout the known 
history of some groups of organisms (Moen et al. 2015). These 
appear to be targeted solutions in independent groups of organisms 
following a specific plan which rapidly closes in on similarly 
suitable traits. This may be better described as “rendezvous” rather 
than “convergence.”
CONCLUSION
Bateson et al. (2017) welcomes sharp, legitimate differences of 
interpretation regarding data. Hence, we offer a new framework for 
understanding biological adaptability that reinterprets findings in 
the literature in view of the assumption that biological systems and 
functions are most accurately explained by engineering principles.
Using an engineering approach to reinterpret data led us to 
an engineering-based, organism-focused characterization 
of adaptation. We hypothesized that organisms actively and 
continuously track environmental variables and respond by self-
adjusting to changing environments—utilizing the engineering 
principles that constrain how human-designed things adapt to 
changing conditions—resulting in adaptation. We termed this 
hypothesis Continuous Environmental Tracking (CET). 
CET expects to find that organisms adapt by using mechanisms 
with elements analogous to those underlying the self-adjustable 
property of human-engineered tracking systems. These are: input 
sensors, internal logic mechanisms to select suitable responses, and 
output actuators to execute responses. We came to our hypothesis 
by reinterpreting findings and formalizing biological adaptability 
within a framework of engineering design, considering: (1) 
objectives, (2) constraints, (3) variables, and (4) the biological 
systems related to the previous three. Reinterpreting observations 
of behavior suggests a new description of what organisms achieve 
when they adapt: i.e., the design objective. Organisms appear to 
continuously track environmental changes and self-adjust with 
suitable and often heritable traits, resulting in adaptation.
A basic design constraint is that the capacities for a designed entity 
to both relate to—and adapt to—external conditions must be built 
entirely into an entity. Interpreting the data to identify the location 
of adaptive capacity at the organism-environment interface 
suggested that, without exception, adaptive mechanisms reside 
internal to organisms; mechanisms controlling how adaptation 
happens appear internally regulated and integrated.
Engineers identify external conditions pertinent to performance 
as variables. They are either present or not. Using engineering 
principles to interpret the role of external conditions suggests that 
conditions are detected and their presence is recognized as input 
data that innate systems process. Additionally, external conditions 
themselves were interpreted from an engineering approach as 
insufficient to cause the production of adaptive traits.
To evaluate whether biological function could be framed by 
an engineering approach, and in order to determine if the CET 
hypothesis is valid, we performed an extensive literature review for 
study results across various taxa. We identified multiple internal 
mechanisms utilizing diverse sensors coupled to complex logic 
mechanisms that produced condition-specific output responses. Not 
only did organisms use elements analogous to engineered tracking 
systems, they were used in ways that can readily be interpreted 
as continuously tracking environmental changes. Biological 
adaptations often occurred within one generation. We found an 
array of phenotypic self-adjustments functioning as purposely 
designed “targeted solutions” to the challenges of dynamic external 
conditions. Adaptations frequently occurred from well-organized 
modifications of genetic output, often executed at points during 
development that significantly affect the traits at an organism’s 
environmental interface. CET thus implies that adaptation is 
fundamentally produced by regulated gene expression and not 
gene inheritance, per se.
The underlying mechanisms enabling biological adaptations can 
be described as non-random. This observation is in stark contrast to 
the randomness characterizing the standard framework that posits 
tiny, accidental “hit-and-miss” phenotypic adjustments fractioned 
out to lucky survivors of deadly challenges. Adaptive mechanisms 
were characterized as regulated, rapid, repeatable, and predictable. 
This depiction is anomalous to selectionism’s iterative stacking of 
fortuitous results, precisely because regulated, rapid, repeatable, 
and predictable describe purposeful outcomes of engineered 
systems. But, it is consistent with an engineering-based premise 
Guliuzza and Gaskill  ◀ How organisms continuously track environmental changes ▶ 2018 ICC
169
that adaptation results from heritable programming intended to 
enable creatures to adapt and fill changing niches. 
Continuous Environmental Tracking is the foundation of a 
new framework for understanding adaptation, but several key 
gaps in our framework need to be filled by further research. For 
instance, we predict further investigation will demonstrate that 
many variations which are assumed to be—but never documented 
to be—random in nature were never random at all but directed. 
Also, more research on sensors in needed. It is notable that only 
a small fraction of the papers we reviewed identified a sensor for 
the exposure of interest. In addition, they did not indicate that 
identification of the sensor and the signaling pathway would be 
an important area of future research. Though it would be likely 
that most researchers would instruct students against drawing a 
causal link between the association of an exposure to an outcome 
without providing a plausible biological mechanism to explain the 
outcome, most researchers were content to report that the exposure 
caused the response. Yet, it seems that during experimental setup 
they did intuitively look for something in their research subject that 
would relate directly to the exposure. Also requiring more research 
is the characterization of the reversibility of adaptation and the 
determination of whether it is rare or common. Additionally, 
analysis of whether heterozygous fractionation models can 
plausibly explain reversibility is lacking, and more analysis of the 
role and impact of genetic loading and genetic drift on adaptation 
in a CET-based framework is needed. In this vein, more work 
needs to be done to detail how a CET-based framework differs 
in assumptions, concepts, interpretations, and predictions from 
current theory.
The CET framework demonstrates that an engineering-based, 
organism-focused framework can contribute to science because 
it does suggest testable hypothesis about biological function—
that are being overlooked under the current theory—and make 
predictions of findings In addition to illuminating regulated 
mechanisms producing targeted responses and system elements 
corresponding to human-designed tracking systems, CET provides 
an engineering-based explanation for epigenetic mechanisms as 
a way for organisms to rapidly “flex” phenotypically to sudden 
environmental changes and then possibly revert to “baseline.” 
CET allows for episodic changes by tracking mechanisms that can 
“step up” or “step down” as needed, perhaps without producing 
noticeable intermediate forms.
CET expects and explains “convergence” by diverse organisms on 
similar traits and thus accounts for why some evolutionists now 
claim that evolution is “predictable.” CET goes beyond simply 
asserting that common function is due to common design, since 
CET specifies the systems which are the common design and can 
anticipate where the common traits might appear.
CET incorporates the engineering principles that are likely 
essential to make correct cause-effect associations for biological 
functions. Engineering causality is different from philosophical, 
psychological, theological, or other causation. Engineering 
causation focuses on whole systems and not individual elements. 
Since the entire system ceases to function with the loss of any vital 
element, no single element is declared to be causal. Engineering 
causes are distinguished by clarity, objectivity, and thoroughness. 
Only verifiable elements are included—and no vital element is 
omitted—in causal chains. Research informed by engineering 
principles searches for all system elements within an organism that 
must exist between its detection of environmental exposures and its 
conditioned self-adjustments. 
We note increasing calls to reform or replace the current framework, 
yet “reformers” themselves have not integrated a replacement. One 
impression is that the field of evolutionary biology is somewhat 
in disarray and that practitioners are having difficulty framing the 
discussion regarding how to explain these new mechanisms. We 
see this as an opportunity to set the agenda. We suggest that many 
anomalous findings are explained within the CET framework.
CET is not simply a critique of the insufficiencies of adaptationism, 
random mutations, or selectionism. It is a new engineering-based, 
organism-focused model that flows from the latest findings 
from molecular biology—identifying sensing systems and logic 
mechanisms which direct suitable responses ranging from rapid 
physiologic changes to multi-generational modifications. Most 
importantly, it fundamentally changes the way we perceive 
organisms; from passive modeling clay shaped over time by the 
vicissitudes of nature, to active, problem-solving entities that 
continuously track changing environmental conditions to better fit 
existing environmental niches or fill new ones.

TR expansion and contraction 
contributes to incremental control

ing, protein translation, folding, 
stability, aggregation rates, and 
gross morphology. Variations in the 
number of repeats in the coding 
regions of the Alx-4 and Runx-2

significant differences in limb and 
skull morphology.  
“The high frequency and incre-
mental effects of repeat length 
mutations provide molecular 
explanations for swift, yet topolog-

evolution...revealing evidence sup-
porting an alternative hypothesis 
that length variations in tandemly 
repeated sequences are a major 
source of morphological variation...
that permit rapid generation of 
useful alleles...abundant in the 
coding sequences of vertebrate 
genes, especially those involved in 
development...repeat expansions 
or contractions vary in a locus-spe-
cific manner and occur at rates up 
to 100,000 times higher than point 
mutations...how broadly this mode 
of evolutionary change is exploited 
in nature remains to be seen, but 
if the prevalence of repetitive ele-
ments within genes is any indicator, 
then mammals, insects, plants, and 
other genomes throughout the nat-
ural world may use this mechanism 
to achieve evolutionary agility"" pgs.

Nature
Improved de novo 
assembly and 
annotation of the 
maize reference 
genome.
Characterization of the repetitive 
portion of the genome revealed 
more than 130,000 intact 
transposable elements, allowing us 
to identify transposable element 
lineage expansions that are unique 
to maize. LINEs can be a mechanism 
of exon mobilization in protein-
coding genes. LTRs only mobilize 
within the genome of a single cell.
Different transposon insertions 
confer drought tolerance, altered 
flowering time, ability to grow 
in toxic aluminum-rich soils, and 
have allowed maize to spread to 
temperate latitudes by breaking 
sensitivity to the long days of the 
tropics. And broadly, transposable 
element insertions have been 
shown to alter gene expression in 
stressful conditions.

lele of Bmp6. PNAS
Threespine stickle-
back Gasterosteus 
aculeatus
Derived benthic freshwater 
stickleback population have  about 
twofold gain in ventral pharyngeal 
tooth number and assays of Bmp6 
in developing teeth show that cis-
regulatory changes have ~1.4-fold 
up-regulation of Bmp6 relative 
expressio compared with their 
ancestral marine counterparts 
during late stages of stickleback 
development indicative of late-
acting cis-regulatory up-regulation 
of Bmp6 expression underlies an 
increase in tooth number.
""BMP family members have been 
implicated in several vertebrate 
evolved traits: size and shape of the 
beak in Darwin’s finches, size and 
shape of the jaw in cichlids, jaw and 
skull variation in brachycephalic 
dogs, and avian feather patterning...
this apparent reuse of the same 
signaling pathway across taxa 
may reflect a predisposition for 
Bmp genes to be used during 
morphological evolution, perhaps 
due to having complex, modular cis-
regulatory architecture to generate 
evolutionary variation"" p. 13916.

""Polyploidy is prevalent across 
eukaryotic life, particularly in 
the plant, animal, and fungal

that the rationale for this

that it provides novel genetic

can allow polyploid individuals

We hypothesize that organisms actively and continuously track environmental variables and respond by self-adjusting to changing environments—utilizing the engineering principles constraining how human-designed objects self-adjust to changes—which results in adaptation. We termed this hypothesis Continuous Environmental Tracking (CET). CET is an engineering-based, organism-focused characterization of adaptation. CET expects to find that organisms adapt via systems with elements analogous to those within human-engineered tracking systems, namely: input sensors, internal logic mechanisms to select suitable responses, and actuators to execute responses. We derived the hypothesis by reinterpreting findings and formalizing biological adaptability within a framework of engineering design, considering: (1) objectives, (2) constraints, (3) variables, and (4) the biological systems related to the previous three. The literature does identify internal mechanisms with elements analogous to engineered systems using sensors coupled to complex logic mechanisms producing highly “targeted” self-adjustments suitable to changes. Adaptive mechanisms were characterized as regulated, rapid, repeatable, and sometimes, reversible. Adaptation happened largely through regulated gene expression and not gene inheritance, per se. These observations, consistent with CET, contrast starkly with the evolutionary framework’s randomness of tiny, accidental “hit-and-miss” phenotypes fractioned out to lucky survivors of deadly challenges. Evolutionists now divide over their framework’s need of modification, and a trend among some seeks to infuse more engineering into biology. This disarray affords a rare, transient opportunity for engineering advocates to frame the issue. CET may fundamentally change how we perceive organisms; from passive modeling clay shaped over time by the vicissitudes of nature, to active, problem-solving creatures that continuously track environmental changes to better fit existing niches or fill new ones","['text', 'Rapid adaptation', 'specific adaptive mechanism', 'tracking systems', 'epigenetics', 'sensor', 'engineering principles', 'systems biology', 'intelligent design', 'evolutionary synthesis', '03 Natural sciences', '0303 Biology', 'Biology']",disabled

The E2 glycoprotein is the major antigen that induces neutralizing and protective antibodies in CSFV infected 
pigs, thus a marker vaccine based on this antigen appears to be the most promising alternative to induce a 
protective immune response against CSFV. However, the structural characteristics of this protein state the 
necessity to produce glycoprotein E2 in more complex expression systems such as mammalian cells. In this 
study, we use a lentivirus-based gene delivery system to establish a stable recombinant HEK 293 and CHO K1 
cell line for the expression of E2 fused to porcine CD154 as immunostimulatory molecule. In a first experiment, 
E2his and E2-CD154 were compared in an immunization trial. The average antibody titers in E2his immunized 
pigs was in the range of 30-40% of  blocking and the average antibody titers for E2-CD154 are above 40% at 
day 14, meaning that the chimeric antigen is able to raise antibodies at positive levels in a shorter time. 
Additionally, the blocking rate of E2his vaccinated group in ELISA ranged between 66-88% and in the E2-
CD154- vaccinated groups ranged between 86-92%, one week after booster immunization. The NPLA antibody 
titers also increased greatly. Later on, the protective capacity of purified E2-CD154 glycoprotein was 
demonstrated in a challenge experiment in pigs using a biphasic immunization schedule with 25 and 50 μg. The 
immunized animals developed neutralizing antibodies that were protective when the animals were faced to a 
challenge with 105 LD50 of ‘‘Margarita’’ CSFV highly pathogenic strain. No clinical signs of the disease were 
detected in the vaccinated pigs. Unvaccinated pigs in the control group exhibited symptoms of CSF at 3–4 days 
after challenge and were euthanized from 7–9 days when the pigs became moribund. These results indicate 
that E2-CD154 produced in recombinant HEK 293 and CHOK1cell line is a high quality candidate for the 
development of a safe and effective CSFV subunit vaccine. In the next steps, pilot and production scale, E2-
CD154 expression levels should be increased in 10 to 50 fold, arriving to a very attractive productive platform for 
an implementation of a commercial subunit vaccine against CSF.

Literacy Reveals Little Empirical Data

As genetic modification for food production has expanded, the United States 
(U.S.) public discourse about the acceptance and regulation of the use of these 
products has also expanded.  Dissent is currently presumed to be widespread on 
these issues.  However, assessments of public agricultural literacy around the 
technology alternatives are limited, especially in the context of food production 
versus medical genetic testing, about potential environmental risk and other 
reasons for dissent.  Assessments also tend to focus on consumer knowledge in 
outdated deficit-model frameworks.  In preparation for an assessment of U.S. 
adult public understanding of traditional breeding and genetic engineering 
technology, we reviewed existing agricultural literacy and science literacy 
literature to determine current understanding and locate existing instruments on 
which to build such an assessment.  Of 323 peer-reviewed articles, we found only 
four that empirically examined U.S. adult public audiences in the context of 
literacy related to genetic modification for food.  Results from agricultural 
economics and four gray literature pieces provided additional context and 
direction for our own survey development.  We suggest ways to build a more 
representative and meaningful survey relying on more than knowledge deficits to 
characterize agricultural literacy and plant genetic literacy.  This will lay the 
foundation for understanding why dissent over such agricultural topics exists.

Introduction 
 
As the United States (U.S.) and the world face pressures to feed hungry populations, a global 
food crisis has arrived.  By the year 2050, overall food production needs to increase by 70% to 
meet the demands of the world’s populations (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations, 2009).

Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
With this growing demand, agricultural scientists are turning to both technology-driven and 
traditional-breeding-based genetic engineering solutions.  Genetically modified organisms 
(GMOs), also referred to as genetically engineered (GE) foods use genetic engineering 
technology to create new and improved crops, which people may consume directly as, or as a 
component of, genetically modified (GM) foods1.  Genetically engineered foods promise higher 
production yields and net return with a decrease in pesticides used (Fernandez-Cornejo, 
Wechsler, Livingston, & Mitchell, 2014).  Yet, controversy surrounds their use in the United 
States (e.g., Azadi & Ho, 2010; Funk & Kennedy, 2016; Funk & Rainie, 2015a), albeit less so 
than in Europe (Funk & Kennedy, 2016; Kahan, 2015).  Recent ballot initiatives regarding 
labeling and attacks on scientists studying GMOs seem to be increasing (Council for Agricultural 
Science and Technology, 2014; Smith, 2012).  However, some evidence suggests Americans are 
less split on the topic politically, and in fact, see GMOs to be a relatively moderate risk (Kahan, 
2015).   
 
Limited evidence on GE awareness and literacy makes it difficult to tell whether Americans truly 
understand the attendant risks of GMOs, particularly the direct risks to human health versus risks 
to the broader environment and ecological systems.  Without a true understanding of the public 
risk awareness, we lack a true picture of whether U.S. adults prefer or disdain laboratory-based 
GE technology versus traditional cross-breeding.  Of the information that does exist, little of it 
focuses on the reasons behind support or lack of support for GE-related agricultural technologies.   
 
Many of these potential solutions to the global food crisis, whether GE, traditional cross-
breeding, or hybrid approaches using DNA evidence to guide traditional breeding, rely on public 
tax dollars for research support.  This research support, in turn, relies on public awareness of the 
utility of the research products (Ding, Maibach, Zhao, Roser-Renouf, & Leiserowitz, 2011; 
Miller, 2004).  A body of research on student attitudes toward biotechnology as a whole exists 
(Gardner & Troelstrup, 2015), but the reported student conceptualizations of attitude toward 
biotechnology vary widely.  However, adult public awareness of, understanding of, and support 
for either traditional or laboratory-based genetic engineering efforts have not been widely 
empirically researched. This understanding and awareness fall under the purview of agricultural 
literacy (Frick, Kahler, & Miller 1991).   
 
Public agricultural literacy is a priority in the American Association for Agricultural Education’s 
National Research Agenda (Doerfert, 2011; Roberts, Harder, & Brashears, 2016).  Science 
literacy writ large is an objective of major research funding agencies in the U.S. (Roos, 2014).  
The understanding of genetic engineering technologies is a component of those literacies based 
on a rapidly-changing field.  Traditionally, however, studies of literacy focus on public 
                                                        
1 Throughout this paper, we will use the term genetic engineering (GE) to be most precise about 
the technology to which we are referencing. However, we will use the term genetically 
modified (GM or GMO) to reflect what particular authors in our review used in their research.

knowledge in a deficit model framework (Biesta, 2007; Sturgis & Allum, 2004), rather than 
considering awareness, term familiarity, or applied knowledge for innovation adoption (Abrams, 
McBride, Hooker, Cappella, & Koehly, 2015).  In this paper, we review relevant public GE 
literacy studies to determine what researchers have studied in order to build a survey related to 
GE agriculture that avoids the deficit model and more adequately assesses public attitudes 
toward GE food as compared to traditional breeding technologies.   
 
Background 
 
Jon Miller began nationwide public surveys of science literacy of American adults in the 1970s 
(Miller, 2010).  While the surveys have been revised over time to include more contemporary 
science topics, the surveys are very knowledge- and fact-based surveys with little attention to the 
application of that knowledge as befits more contemporary definitions of literacy.  Organizations 
such as the Pew Research Center (Funk & Rainie, 2015b) also report “gaps” between non-
scientists and professionals on fact-based measures.  This reliance on simply correct answers 
places respondents often in a place of deficit versus a standard of knowledge or expertise 
(Sturgis & Allum, 2004; Weiner, 2006).  In 1975, Shen introduced the idea of “civic science 
literacy” (Shen, 1975, p. 49), which is having not only knowledge but also the ability to apply 
knowledge in the context of participating in democratic decision-making based on science. 
 
Originally, many of these surveys focused on facts that were related to science broadly, such as: 
“All radioactivity is man-made” (Miller, 1998, p. 208).  Miller (1998) argues this was necessary 
to provide durability of the measure over time, due to the rapidly changing nature of scientific 
issues in the news.  While Miller reports some increase in literacy on these items over time 
(Miller, 2010), the lack of focus on specific current issues makes this measure alone less useful 
in understanding public conceptions of topics involved in contemporary decisions, such as 
legislation about labeling GMOs or supporting scientific research on plant genetic databases.  
Both Miller’s survey (2010) and Kahan’s Ordinary Science Intelligence scale (2014) lack 
specific fact-based questions related to genetics, let alone genetic engineering.  Such knowledge-
based surveys also neglect other stages of decision making, such as awareness and persuasion, 
that precede and follow knowledge acquisition (Rogers, 2003). 
 
In the realm of decision-making, researchers have begun to advance the idea of cultural 
cognition (Kahan, 2008) or partisan-motivated reasoning (Bolsen, Druckman, & Cook, 2014; 
Hart & Nisbet, 2012), which suggests that people are more interested in preserving relationships 
than making fact-based decisions about potentially controversial or emerging issues.  Their 
empirical examination of such affiliations, through a worldview scale, groups respondents into 
quadrants on two continua – hierarchical/egalitarian and individual/communitarian (Kahan, 
2008).  The authors argue these quadrant groupings tend to better predict how people feel about 
an issue and make decisions based on perceptions of risk (Kahan, 2008).  Kahan (2014) 
Review of U.S. Public Genetic Modification Literacy   62 
Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
developed an Ordinary Science Intelligence scale that includes numeracy.  This scale has a mix 
of items from science facts to process questions, especially around risk.   
 
More recently, research on literacy has started to move toward public engagement with science, 
wherein people outside professional circles are actively involved in critiquing and shaping 
science for their own ends (McCallie, 2010).  This requires valuing not only academic 
knowledge but also other forms of knowing and affective dimensions, moving away from a 
deficit model.  According to this movement, both reasoning based on relationships and 
fundamental science intelligence may contribute to overall perceptions of emerging technologies. 
 
While media reports and some research find genetically engineered food to be controversial 
among consumers in the United States, especially regionally (Anderson, Ruth, & Rumble, 2014; 
Krause, Meyers, Irlbeck, & Chambers, 2015), some evidence suggests that such products are less 
controversial than topics such as climate change and gun control (Kahan, 2013).  Specifically, 
Kahan (2013) reports consumers are less split on their perceptions of GMOs based on political 
ideology.  Consumers in the U.S. also reported less overall human risk from GMOs than from 
climate change (Kahan, 2013).  The lack of literature specifically addressing understanding of 
the various genetic modification technologies and their methods complicates the issue and makes 
it difficult to create effective outreach to inform public discourse.   
 
Purpose and Objectives 
 
As a precursor to the development of a national public survey incorporating facets of traditional 
breeding, GMOs, health versus environmental risks, and overall science understanding and 
worldview, we conducted a review of peer-reviewed and gray literature, that is, reports of 
systematic studies that have not undergone peer review, including evaluations, polls, and other 
reports found online.  The purpose of the present study, therefore, is to determine what literature 
exists on the topic of public understanding and awareness of (i.e., literacy about) topics related to 
genetic technology in the context of food production.  We also sought to determine the existence 
of any validated instruments or scales related to the same topics.  We report the results of our 
literature review of journal articles published since 2000 on several terms related to genetic 
technology literacy.  We had two main research questions:  
 
(1) What empirical research exists on the U.S. public regarding understanding of genetic 
engineering technology related to food, particularly resulting in survey instruments? 
(2) What research examines potential differences in the U.S. public attitudes toward the 
human health versus environmental risks of food-related genetic engineering 
technology?

Methods 
 
To conduct our literature search, we followed the systematic review process outlined in Frewer 
et al. (2013). This process included the following steps: 
 
(1) Formulate study questions, including comparisons, contrasts, and population for 
study. 
(2) Generate a list of search terms. 
(3) Search relevant databases. 
(4) Screen candidate papers using titles, keywords, and abstracts.   
 
To gather literature, we first generated a list of search terms related to genetic engineering in 
consultation with other study team members, including a horticultural scientist/Extension agent 
and another social science researcher working on the larger grant funding this study.  To produce 
the final search terms, we combined the genetic engineering terms with the word literacy to 
search for results specifically focused on participant understanding, not only perceptions.  See 
Table 1 for our final search terms.     
 
Table 1. Total Journal Articles Per Database and Term Searched 
 
We searched these seven terms in two different databases, Web of Science and the Educational 
Resources Information Center (ERIC).  Web of Science includes publications in various natural 
sciences journals, as well as some social science sources, while ERIC focuses on journals related 
to education.  The Web of Science searches in December 2015 included the entire collection of 
seven databases available through our university library subscription, including the Web of 
Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Citation Index, and MEDLINE.  In ERIC, we used the ""all 
databases"" search option, including 34 databases made up of several newspapers and periodicals.  
To limit our results to most recent studies, we searched only the year 2000 through November 
2015.  Of the 460 articles found in the two databases, 98 were duplicated one or more times, 
yielding 137 duplicates.  Subtracting these duplicates left 323 unique articles.

We then screened the abstracts and articles for the comparisons of interest in our study.  We 
included articles that: had participant populations within the United States over age 18 in public 
(non-school) settings, studied understanding rather than just perceptions, studied plant genetics 
rather than medical genetics alone, and offered empirical data to which we might ultimately 
compare our own survey results.  This yielded only four papers.  We then searched the reference 
lists of the identified articles meeting our criteria to identify any additional articles that were not 
in the two databases.  We found no additional studies meeting our criteria using this search. 
 
As our initial search turned up only four peer-reviewed studies, upon recommendation from 
colleagues who study consumer perceptions of GE, we also examined peer-reviewed literature 
from Jayson Lusk, a food and agricultural economist.  Agricultural economists do not use the 
keyword literacy in their work, so these articles did not come up in our database searches.  Lusk 
researches consumer demand for food, including GE food.  As of 2013, Lusk also conducted a 
monthly non-peer-reviewed U.S. Food Demand Survey examining a variety of recurring metrics 
that also includes occasional questions on topics such as demand for GE foods.  The occasional 
questions pertaining to GE foods identified in the Food Demand Surveys were not relevant to the 
current study, so we did not examine these surveys further.   
 
We examined titles and abstracts from 160 published peer-reviewed articles from Lusk’s 
curriculum vitae as of December 2015.  All of these articles had been published since 2000.  We 
found 43 articles with titles or keywords containing our search terms to examine further.  We 
applied the same criteria of U.S. population, study topic covering understanding of plant-related 
genetics questions, and presence of empirical data to the Lusk articles as we applied to the other 
database results.  However, none of the results from Lusk in our timeframe (2000–2015) 
concerned knowledge about GE, though several used national samples of U.S. adults. 
 
Finally, the authors knew of several conference publications in agricultural education related to 
GE (Krause et al., 2015; Ruth, Gay, Rumble, & Rodriguez, 2015).  These and additional public 
polls that were not peer-reviewed journal articles are part of the gray literature.  Because of the 
potential relevance of these emerging studies, to examine gray literature, we examined The 
American Association for Agricultural Education’s (AAEA) national meeting conference 
proceedings during our search timeframe (2000–2015) and their reference lists.  This source of 
gray literature included unpublished reports mentioned in these conference articles and their 
reference lists or related works by authors identified in the reference lists.  This search produced 
an additional three sources meeting our national sample criteria and one study that used a 
regional population but examined environmental and health risk separately.  We kept this study 
due to a dearth of other studies containing this differentiation of environmental and health risk. 
Once we identified relevant peer-reviewed and gray literature papers, we examined them to 
determine sample size and quantitative versus qualitative sources of data.  Next, we looked for 
the presence of questions related to food (as opposed to general plant genetics or genetic 
Review of U.S. Public Genetic Modification Literacy   65 
Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
engineering), questions related to traditional plant breeding or other alternatives and questions 
related to health and environmental risk.  Finally, we noted whether the authors performed any 
comparison to overall science literacy and worldview.   
 
Results 
 
Only four peer-reviewed articles from the database searches using the word literacy met our 
criteria.  The review of agricultural economics studies from Lusk and co-authors yielded no 
additional articles.  The final four studies that related to our study came from gray literature.  
Therefore, our total review resulted in eight articles and evaluation reports for investigation in 
more depth.   
 
Peer-reviewed Articles from Database Searches 
 
The four peer-reviewed articles from our database searches ranged in sample size from 62 for the 
one qualitative study to 1,200 for the largest of three quantitative studies.  Table 2 displays the 
differences and commonalities in content covered in the research instruments of the four articles.  
For our research objectives, we noticed that all four articles showed little to no GE understanding 
research, and only one of the three quantitative studies discussed environmental risk separately 
from health risk.  An explanation of these studies and the findings about participant awareness in 
more detail follows.

Abrams, McBride, Hooker, Cappella, and Koehly (2015) study.  Abrams et al. (2015) 
collected data from 1,016 American adults through an electronic survey.  The electronic survey 
from 2013 “captured genetic literacy with three measures that each assess[ed] a different 
dimension of genomic knowledge to align with Rogers’ [diffusion of innovations] hierarchy” 
(Abrams et al., 2015, p. 3).  The three factors were familiarity, skills, and factual knowledge.   
 
An assessment of term familiarity measured awareness.  Participants in the Abrams et al. study 
rated their familiarity of eight terms relating to genetics on a seven-point scale.  How-to 
knowledge was assessed through practical skills where participants were given literature to help 
Review of U.S. Public Genetic Modification Literacy   66 
Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
them answer six multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions relating to genetic testing and 
mutations.  The authors assessed principles knowledge through factual knowledge, where 
participants responded to the veracity of 16 technical statements on the topic of genes and how 
they function.  Results of the study showed that participants scored highest on self-reported term 
familiarity and that the factual knowledge portion had the fewest high scores.  The study did 
compare the participants’ demographics of race and ethnicity, as well as education and income 
level, to the results on the three scales.  The authors provided their instrument for examination. 
 
Christensen, Jayaratne, Roberts, Kardia, and Petty (2010) study.  Christensen et al. (2010) 
“examined understandings of basic genetic concepts among Americans” (p. 467) via telephone 
interviews in 2001.  The sample for this study consisted of 1,200 American adults with equal 
numbers of white and black men and women.  The authors asked participants to agree or 
disagree with eight statements that were facts about genetics and therefore had a correct answer.  
The results showed that each sample category scored less than 50% correct on six of the eight 
statements, suggesting that many Americans at the time were uninformed on several genetic 
concepts across the racial/ethnic categories examined (Christensen et al., 2010).      
 
Lanie, Jayaratne, Sheldon, Kardia, Anderson, Feldbaum, and Petty (2004) study.  The 
oldest study in our sample used telephone interviews in the year 2000 (Lanie et al., 2004).  
Participants, sampled through random digit dialing, answered questions regarding their basic 
understanding and location of genes.  Sixty-two American adults participated over two phases of 
the study and were compensated for their participation.  Phase one consisted of 44 qualitative 
interviews conducted by professionally trained interviewers.  Participants answered two broad 
questions, both relating to the understanding and location of genes.  An additional 18 participants 
participated in Phase two, a pretest for a larger quantitative study, with open-ended questions 
also relating to the meaning and location of genes.  Based on results from this study, the authors 
concluded that there is confusion among the definitions of “genetic” and “gene” (Lanie et al., 
2004).  The authors also indicated that there was much frustration when participants were asked 
questions to which they could not provide a well-thought-out answer.  The authors provided no 
further description of the resulting quantitative study or the instrument used in their study. 
 
Jang (2014) study.  The last article we examined, by Jang (2014), studied “how citizens select 
science information online based on their preexisting issue attitudes” (p. 143).  The authors used 
a national sample of American adult volunteers tasked with browsing an online news magazine 
with articles on four focal issues.  Before the task, participants completed a survey asking 
questions on a six-point scale involving the attitude and importance of the four focal issues, 
including genetic modification of food, plus six additional social issues.  The results showed that 
participants were more interested in literature that challenged their views rather than supported 
them for GM food, and their individual predispositions, such as perceived science knowledge 
and religiosity, did affect their views.  This study did use a baseline scientific knowledge scale, 
Review of U.S. Public Genetic Modification Literacy   67 
Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
which did not affect the views.  However, this study did not assess participant knowledge related 
to the specific issues, and due to the context of a larger intervention study, had a limited sample 
size (N = 238).     
 
Gray Literature  
 
Two studies of regional audiences related to GM technology were identified in the 2015 AAAE 
conference proceedings (Krause et al., 2015; Ruth et al., 2015).  As they did not use survey 
methods about GM food specifically with adult public audiences, we used them to identify other 
gray literature potentially related to GM food but do not discuss them further here.  Ruth et al. 
(2015) directly referenced Anderson et al. (2014).  Ruth et al. (2015) did not directly reference 
the national Hallman, Cuite, and Morin (2013) study but referenced other earlier work by 
Hallman (Hallman & Metcalfe, 1994) that led us to the 2013 survey which we reviewed.  
Similarly, Krause et al. (2015) did not directly reference Funk and Rainie (2015b) but did 
reference other GM related studies from the Pew Research Center, which led us to the Funk and 
Rainie (2015b) work from the Center.  Therefore, we identified four sources from gray literature 
that we deemed related to our purposes as they covered GM food technology specifically in at 
least one question with U.S. adult audiences. 
 
Of the four studies we examined in-depth from gray literature, two evaluation reports published 
online examined genetic modification technology and food specifically: one national population 
(Hallman et al., 2013) and one from Florida consumers (Anderson et al., 2014) that we kept for 
examination due to the dearth of studies with questions on environmental risk.  GM food 
questions were included in the third study as part of a national survey of overall science topics 
for non-scientists and professionals conducted by the Pew Research Center (Funk & Rainie, 
2015b).  The fourth study, the National Science Board’s biennial Science and Engineering 
Indicators report (National Science Board, 2014, p. Overview), presents findings “from a variety 
of national, international, public, and private sources.”  A summary of their characteristics, 
similar to those of the peer-reviewed literacy studies, appears in Table 3. 
 
Of the two gray literature pieces shown in Table 3 that were entirely surveys related to GM food, 
the Florida consumer survey (Anderson et al., 2014) differentiated among environmental and 
health effects of GMO technology, with a larger percentage of respondents (40%) feeling that 
GMOs posed a risk to the environment than those who disagreed (26%) with that feeling.  
Neither study addressed traditional breeding (Hallman et al., 2013).

Note: The National Science Board report covers results from several surveys, each with N > 1,000.   
 
The two surveys varied somewhat on the respondents’ awareness of GM foods.  The Florida 
consumer survey results indicated 83% of the respondents had heard of genetically modified 
foods (Anderson et al., 2014).  In the national GM food survey (Hallman et al., 2013), 75% of 
respondents reported they were aware of GM foods before the survey. 
 
The national GM food survey also showed that participants were evenly split on the safety of 
GM foods for consumption (Hallman et al., 2013).  The respondents were not given an option to 
choose a neutral response.  The Pew national survey (Funk & Rainie, 2015b) reported only 37% 
of the respondents felt GM foods were safe to eat versus 57% who did not.  In contrast, the 
Florida survey indicated a slightly higher percentage of respondents, 45%, felt GM foods were 
not safe versus 22% who felt that GM foods were safe, with 34% being neutral on the subject 
(Anderson et al., 2014).  The Funk and Rainie (2015b) national survey was the only one of the 
gray literature sources to break down findings by demographics such as age, education, and 
race/ethnicity.  None of the gray literature studies contained questions on traditional breeding. 
 
Conclusions, Implications, and Recommendations 
 
Very few empirical, peer-reviewed studies of the entire U.S. public exist on the topic of literacy 
on genetically modified (GM) food or genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  A large number 
of studies identified through the search terms used in this study concentrated on medical 
genetics, examined non-U.S. or non-adult populations, or did not collect empirical data.  Only 
four out of 323 peer-reviewed studies that we found used a nationally representative U.S. adult 
population and did not exclusively concern medical technology genetic engineering.  One of 
these four was qualitative in nature.  In addition, two of the four studies were from the early 
2000s and are therefore nearly 15 years old.  Overall, our review demonstrated that there is little 
research examining U.S. public understanding of genetic engineering related to food production 
and of the separate risks of genetically modified foods to human versus environmental health.   
Review of U.S. Public Genetic Modification Literacy   69 
Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
However, as the authors in Abrams et al. (2015) point out, based on Rogers’ (2003) Diffusion of 
Innovations, consumers may still choose to adopt innovations despite low levels of factual 
knowledge if they have practical knowledge or awareness of the innovation.  The other three 
peer-reviewed studies did not examine consumer awareness.  Only one of the four studies (Jang, 
2014) asked questions differentiating environmental and human health risks, but this study had a 
relatively small sample due to the overarching intervention study for which the assessment was a 
pretest.   
 
In gray literature, we found several more studies that may or may not be nationally 
representative.  However, their general trends do support the conclusion that U.S. adults are 
generally neither well-aware of nor well-versed on the topic of genetics and genetic modification 
(Anderson et al., 2014; Funk & Rainie, 2015b; Hallman et al., 2013; National Science Board, 
2014).  The gray literature reported demographic breakdowns and a separate examination of 
human versus environmental health risks more often than the peer-reviewed literature, especially 
in the regional studies such as Anderson et al. (2014).  However, differences in the regional and 
national surveys suggest the results from regional audiences may not be completely 
generalizable.  The questions available from the regional survey may be used in our own national 
survey for direct comparison.  Finally, the peer-reviewed study from McFadden and Lusk (2016) 
conducted in September of 2015 did reveal a low overall self-reported awareness of and 
knowledge about genetic engineering (GE) and traditional breeding.   
 
Evaluation data may exist for other intervention programs designed to help participants learn 
about genetic technology.  The authors found a reference to a study with visitors to the 
Connecticut Science Center but were unable to obtain a full evaluation report (Nielsen, 2015).  
These data would also not be generalizable to a larger public population, but the findings alluded 
to in the blog post about the Connecticut study support the trends we identified in the other 
studies reported in this paper.  In addition, the agricultural economics literature identifies a 
number of studies about consumer willingness-to-pay or willingness-to-accept GM foods (e.g., 
Lusk, Jamal, Kurlander, Roucan, & Taulman, 2005; Napier, Tucker, Henry, & Whaley, 2004), 
but many of these studies used both U.S. and non-U.S. populations or otherwise non-adult 
populations.  Consumer Reports (Consumer Reports, 2014) and ABCNews.com (Langer, 2006) 
each have reported results online of their own national studies, but they do not share the 
questions asked or the demographic breakdowns that a peer-reviewed article or even an 
evaluation report does. 
 
Few of the studies reviewed in this study included separate questions on human health and 
environmental risks.  Only one of the peer-reviewed articles (Jang, 2014), one national 
evaluation report (Hallman et al., 2013), and the regional study of Florida consumers (Anderson 
et al., 2014) differentiated between the two.  This is reflected in results from recent public media 
campaigns related to legislation for GMO labeling, which showed a strong preference (i.e., 
Review of U.S. Public Genetic Modification Literacy   70 
Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
approximately 4-to-1) for messaging in those campaigns about human health as opposed to 
environmental risk (Krause et al., 2015).  While Lusk’s studies do imply that food safety is of 
greater importance to consumers than environmental impact when considering organic food, it is 
not clear whether food safety is the same as health risk when considering genetic engineering.  
Without empirical data on awareness and understanding of environmental versus human health 
risk, it is unclear whether messaging about health risk is of more value to consumers than 
environmental risk of genetic engineering, or if they are truly unaware of associated 
environmental risks.  A recent review by Nicolia, Manzo, Veronesi, and Rosellini (2014) 
suggests that scientists agree there is little risk to either the environment or human health, so we 
cannot tell whether consumers actually agree with scientists on these individual risks.  The Pew 
national survey suggests a wide gap between public and scientists’ perceptions of overall risk of 
genetically modified foods (Funk & Rainie, 2015b).  Some of the items from survey instruments 
reported by these publications may be incorporated into our own instrument.   
 
Finally, with the exception of Abrams et al. (2015), the peer-reviewed studies identified through 
this review examined knowledge only, reflecting a deficit framework and failing to account for 
other potential factors in U.S. adult decision-making about genetically modified foods, including 
awareness and practical knowledge.  Two of the gray literature studies did assess awareness as 
well as factual knowledge (Anderson et al., 2014; Hallman et al., 2013).  These instruments did 
not assess any overall science literacy or numeracy of the respondents, nor their political 
affiliation as assessed by their worldview (as opposed to mere self-report of political affiliation), 
which may be confounding factors in genetic literacy and perception of risk (Kahan, 2008; 
Kahan, Wittlin, Peters, Slovic, Ouellette, Braman, & Mandel, 2011; Kahan, 2014).  Such 
divisions may also highlight differences among populations that may need different messaging 
for persuasion. 
 
After our initial study that ended with articles that had been published through November 2015, 
and in the agricultural education literature specifically, we identified two additional sources of 
relevant information just outside the scope of this work.  The original search in this study’s 
2000-2015 timeframe of Lusk’s curriculum vitae revealed no published studies in that timeframe 
meeting our criterion of assessing understanding.  However, a more recent study by McFadden 
and Lusk (2016) indicated a low level of knowledge about GMOs among American adults in a 
national survey.  This survey asked about perceived health risk but not environmental risk.  
McFadden and Lusk’s survey did also ask one question about knowledge of traditional methods 
of plant breeding, specifically, how many genes were modified in particular modification 
techniques.  That study also indicated that while about one-third of consumers felt 
knowledgeable about GMOs, their confidence in their knowledge declined after responding to 
questions in the surveys about details of GM technology, suggesting that self-reported levels of 
knowledge may be overestimated. 
  
Review of U.S. Public Genetic Modification Literacy   71 
Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
An additional non-peer-reviewed national survey from the Pew Research Center conducted in 
May and June 2016 (Funk & Kennedy, 2016) also reported that 20% of Americans had not even 
heard of foods with genetically modified ingredients.   
 
In general, the existence of gray literature on an emerging controversial topic such as this and the 
dearth of studies from an agricultural literacy standpoint points to a larger need for more 
systematic sharing of such data.  The potential existence of literacy-related literature in the 
agricultural economics realm means we need to continue to think broadly about literacy and its 
many forms.  Better sharing of evaluation results and conference proceedings ahead of or even 
instead of full peer review would allow researchers to build on these results, despite their 
limitations, without completely re-inventing instruments.   
 
Ultimately, to build a survey for further study of this topic, the results of this review will allow 
us to incorporate questions from previous instruments, including Abrams et al. (2015), and 
questions from the agricultural economics studies for direct comparison within the population of 
our proposed study.  We will also revise items from regional surveys, such as Anderson et al. 
(2014), designed to disentangle ideas of environmental versus human health risk for genetic 
engineering of food through engineering and traditional breeding technologies.  Finally, to 
address overall background on the role that science and ideology may play in acceptance, we will 
use the Ordinary Science Intelligence (Kahan, 2014) and Worldview scales (Kahan, 2008).   
 
The melding of these various instruments will result in a comprehensive set of scales assessing 
not just self-reported knowledge of the topics, but also self-reported knowledge of the terms 
relating to genetic engineering, the alternatives of selective breeding and DNA-directed selective 
breeding, and an assessment of the importance of environmental risk separate from direct risk to 
human health.  This newly created survey will also allow us to relate awareness of genetic 
engineering of plants to general science literacy, worldview, decision-making styles, and 
demographics to inform public outreach on genetic technologies related to food production.   
 
Our purpose in creating the new survey is two-fold.  First, we want to assess underlying public 
knowledge specifically in the realm of plant- and food-related genetic engineering to add to the 
body of knowledge on this topic.  Second, we want to obtain information on public Extension 
audiences that will guide outreach and public engagement strategies on genetic engineering and 
genetically modified organisms.   
 
We invite readers to use this survey with their audiences to add to the body of knowledge for 
specific groups and subgroups on these particular issues and to collaborate with us to create 
revised instruments to continue to build the knowledge base.  We also hope that readers will be 
able to use the newly created survey to assess in pre- and post-fashion changes in their audiences 
based on interventions in outreach and engagement on genetic engineering.

Journal of Human Sciences and Extension  Volume 6, Number 3, 2018 
While we know that knowledge is not sufficient to change attitude, our current literature review 
suggests that previous studies may not have been correctly assessing attitudes or that people 
actually may have attitudes based on alternative conceptions about GE technology.  Recent 
studies also did not consider the benefits of the technology or a risk-benefit ratio, which might 
better represent consumer attitudes (Gaskell et al., 2004).  We must improve these assessments to 
understand why particular patterns of consumer attitudes toward agricultural innovations exist.

Abstract 
 
This project’s goal was to examine American public opinion and media representation of CRISPR gene 
editing technology and its human applications. To do so, we analyzed three data sources: public opinion 
polls, online news articles, and tweets. Our findings show that public perception of CRISPR has been 
changing over time and the frequency of differently toned content (positive, negative, and neutral) 
fluctuates. Variation across the three types of sources reveals that American public opinion on CRISPR is 
not consistent.

Executive Summary 
 
Introduction 
 CRISPR, which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a 
modern advancement in the field of biotechnology for gene editing, which exploits a cellular defense 
system in common bacteria. Scientists use this mechanism to cut-and-paste additions to the genome, and 
even to make pinpoint changes to specific DNA bases, in order to make or correct mutations (Sander & 
Joung, 2014). However, genetic alteration techniques in general are still in the beginning stages, and there 
is much speculation regarding the CRISPR procedure and its future uses. The human application of this 
technology introduces complex morality issues – most of all when modifications on the germline and 
enhancement procedures are considered. 
  While the scientific community provides influential opinions that impact the CRISPR gene 
editing applications, public opinion has also rapidly become one of the influential driving forces behind 
the limitations and advancements regarding genetic modification and its uses. Specifically, there are 
opinions that question whether it is our place to change life for what we believe is the better, and that has 
ultimately become a debate on the legality of the technology applications. Because public opinion can 
have such a deep impact on the advancements of biotechnology, we examined public opinion polls, news 
articles, and social media posts in order to provide a more profound analysis of what the American public 
believes regarding this method of gene therapy and its applications. 
Furthermore, special consideration was taken to discover how these opinions change across a 
variety of demographics, since previous research and literature suggests a wide spectrum of opinions. 
This spectrum is bounded by two extremes: one side favors continuous research and argues that the value 
and the possibilities of CRISPR outweigh the risks of its misuse, while the other side argues that it would 
be irresponsible to use the technology, with all the risks and unknowns currently present, therefore 
arguing that the risks are greater than the benefits.  
 
Methods 
In order to collect representative data of opinion trends across the entire United States that would 
provide answers to the research questions, we used the following methods: identified and analyzed 
opinion polls on genetic engineering and CRISPR, used discourse analysis to evaluate online media 
reports on CRISPR, and mined Twitter for social media activity related to CRISPR. 
In order to gauge the potentially wide range of opinions about CRISPR in the United States, we 
analyzed polls by looking at current snapshots of public opinion within demographics, differently worded 
polls, and how they may have changed over time. Since CRISPR is a newer technology, there are limited 
polls and data that specifically focus on CRISPR alone. From the twenty-one polls analyzed, only two 
explicitly used the term “CRISPR”. For this reason, the terms “gene therapy” and “genetic engineering” 
were chosen for additional analysis because, while they are broader topics that encompass the same ideas 
and technologies as the CRISPR method, they have more data and are more publicly recognized through 
published polls. Different demographics were analyzed within the public opinion polls to get a better 
sense of each of their corresponding opinions. A study of popular opinion – with a focus on whether the 
iv 
 
majority supports or rejects the CRISPR technologies – helped to explain if there are particular 
preferences corresponding to specific demographics. Looking at polls conducted in different years also 
displayed varying results since CRISPR technologies are new to the industry and advancing quickly and 
can reveal the evolution of how and why this correlates with public opinion changes (Blendon, Gorski, & 
Benson, 2016; CGS, 2014). Differences in results found in preliminary searches also tended to shift due 
to the wording of questions asked within the polls. 
The primary analytical method used to gather quantitative data from our analysis of both the news 
media and social media discourse were two coding instruments (Appendices A and B) created specifically 
for the media they would be responsible for parsing. The news media coding instrument was made with a 
long format, nuanced opinion piece in mind, while the social media discourse coding instrument was 
tailored towards short, simple statements about CRISPR. 
To select news articles for analysis through the news media coding instrument (Appendix A), 6 
news sources with different political bias were chosen: two right-leaning, two left-leaning and two 
centrist sources were selected. The following sources were evaluated: Fox News, and The National 
Review, The New York Times, CNN, CBS News, and USA Today. All the sources that were chosen are the 
main, online news sources for significant groups of the U.S. population (Mitchell, et al., 2014). Moreover, 
every article related to CRISPR’s use in humans, controversy on its uses, and analyses of public opinion 
polls published from the start of publication to March 2018 were included in this analysis. Keywords 
present were also counted, including negative terms (“designer babies”, “playing god”, “risk”, “fear”, 
“eugenics”), and positive terms (“life saving”, “revolutionary”, “less expensive”, “accurate”).  We 
identified these keywords because they suggest either a more favorable or negative approach in the tone. 
To select tweets for analysis, we identified five months over the past two years in which major 
events related to CRISPR occurred: a genetic engineering ethics conference (December 2015); the first 
use of CRISPR in adults to treat cancer being approved in China (July 2016); the first use of CRISPR on 
humans in the US (July 2017); the first use of CRISPR on viable human embryos in the US (August 
2017); and the release of a video series by CBS entitled “Playing God” (November 2017). We focused on 
these time periods because we hypothesized that the tone of tweets would differ before and after major 
events regarding CRISPR. As such, within the months the selected events took place, we coded 25 tweets 
from immediately before an identified event and 75 tweets from after the event, for a total of 100 tweets 
per event or 500 tweets total.  
 
Results 
 
Poll Analysis 
The results found from analyzing polls can be represented most effectively by separating them 
into three categories: the evolution of public opinion, public opinion based on poll terminology and 
language, and public opinion based on demographics. 
The evolution of public opinion was found to have changed from high support for inheritable 
genetic modification, starting at 66% of the poll respondents in favor, to declining support, ending at 41% 
of the poll respondents in favor, over the span of three decades (CGS Summary of Public Opinion Polls, 
2014). Support declined when the genetic modification applications changed to altering physical 
appearance rather than improving health. The declining trend was similar to the one found in public 
opinions regarding genetic modification for disease prevention. The support for physical alteration 
v 
 
applications began at 44% in 1986 and progressively decreased to 4% in 2003 (CGS Summary of Public 
Opinion Polls, 2014). 
Overall, there were higher rates of approval in polls that contained questions using positive 
wording as opposed to using negative wording. The positively worded polls revealed support ranging 
from 26-87%, while the negatively worded polls only had 11-45% support. The positive and negative 
language influence in results can also clearly be seen in the questions that referenced somatic therapy 
applications, which displayed 64% support, while only 39% of people supported somatic enhancement 
applications (Abed, 2017). Similarly, 65% of people supported germline therapy applications of genetic 
engineering, but only 26% of people supported heritable germline enhancement (Abed, 2017). 
Demographic results were categorized into one of six groups: religious, non-religious, male, 
female, parents, and non-parental adults. People who were categorized as religious displayed a range of 
support from 28-50% for genetic engineering applications, while non-religious people had an approval 
range from 45-75% (Abed, 2017; Potenza, 2017). The male respondent category had a range of support of 
human genetic modification from 23-63% while the females displayed a range of support from 16-60% 
for human genetic modification (Napolitano & Ogunseitan, 1999). Parents with a child under the age of 
18 displayed 59% approval of the use of genetic engineering to reduce the risk of serious disease, while 
only 45% of the non-parental adults supported these same uses (Greenwood, 2016).  While the absolute 
percentage of support within a demographic group varied from poll to poll, the difference in the approval 
rate between two groups of a given demographic appeared remarkably consistent. 
 
Media Discourse Analysis 
Data collected from the six different media sources (Fox News, The National Review, CBS News, 
USA Today, CNN, and The New York Times) reveal that the discourse employed when discussing 
CRISPR in online news articles shows a similar variation on all bias levels over time, although The 
National Review appears to be an outlier. In addition, we found that events in the scientific community 
have an effect on the number of published articles, with a peak in media interest whenever a new 
discovery is made or a trial is approved. 
Overall, we found that most articles do not include “CRISPR” in the title (only seven or 
approximately 7% mention CRISPR in the title), preferring instead to use umbrella terms such as “gene-
editing technology”, “gene editing technique”, “gene editing tool”, or simply mentioning the purpose of 
the study or trial that is being described. Within the articles themselves, 38.7% give a vague or incomplete 
explanation of CRISPR, 34.7% give a good, if sometimes rudimentary, explanation of what CRISPR 
does, and the remaining 26.3% do not give an explanation on CRISPR at all. 
Furthermore, the analysis concerning the tone of the articles shows a series of trends over time for 
the presence of positively, negatively, and neutrally toned articles. When scientists started debating the 
ethical concerns of using CRISPR in human trials in 2015, journalists started to include more negative 
wording, especially in articles concerning the human germline (embryos and gametes) with a 95.16% 
correlation between mention of embryos and negative wording in the articles. However, the presentation 
of multiple opinions on CRISPR in all sources led to the large presence of articles containing both 
positive and negative words in the form of expositional pieces. 
The National Review is an outlier of this trend. This is the only source where most of the articles 
were written by the same person with a clear bias.  The content of the articles was also very different from 
the other sources. A more “moralistic” approach is employed, giving less importance to whatever new 
discovery or paper had been published at the time and instead focusing instead on regulation. This was 
vi 
 
also the only source that used literary references to science fiction – including references to Brave New 
World and a mention of The Andromeda Strain, both of which can be interpreted as negative dystopias 
related to gene modification.  
On the amount of negative versus positive articles separated by political leaning the findings were 
as follows. Left-leaning sources had a total of 9 (25.71%) positively worded articles, 1(2.86%) negatively 
worded articles, 22 (62.86%) articles with positive and negative wording, and 3 (8.57%) with neither. 
Centrist sources included 1 (4.35%) positive articles, 4 (17.39%) negative articles, 14 (60.87%) with 
positive and negative wording and 4 (17.39%) with neither. Finally, the right-leaning sources had 13 
(35.14%) positive articles (11, 45.83% not including the National Review), 11 (29.73%) negative articles 
(2, 8.33% not including the National Review), 12 (32.43%) articles with positive and negative wording 
(10, 41.67% not including the National Review) and 1 (2.70%) with neither (1, 4.17% not including the 
National Review).   
 
Twitter Discourse Analysis 
 In our analysis of the tone of tweets, we found that 91% of the tweets analyzed were neutral. 
Additionally, we found that the majority of the tweets about CRISPR from the selected time periods 
(65%) appeared to be shared directly from news articles, blogs, and scientific journals. We did not find 
any indication of shifts in tone or content during the selected time periods. 
         When considering the tone of tweets about CRISPR in the selected time periods, the proportions 
of positively-, negatively-, and neutrally-toned tweets do change, but only very slightly. The difference 
between the lowest percentage of neutral tweets, 83% in July of 2017, and the highest percentage of 
neutral tweets, 95% in July of 2016, August of 2017 and November of 2017 is only 12 tweets (12%). The 
difference in the highest and lowest percentages of positively-toned tweets are similarly low (from 6% in 
December 2015 to 0% in July of 2017). In a similar fashion, the difference between the months with the 
highest and lowest percentages of negatively-toned tweets (10%, 12% in July of 2017 and 2% in July of 
2016) are also not significant, given that there were only even 30 tweets (6%) that were negatively 
intoned. 
 
Discussion 
 
Poll Analysis 
From our analysis of polling data, we developed three conclusions. First, public opinion in 
support of genetic modification techniques followed a decreasing trend over three decades. Second, the 
poll questions that were phrased using positive syntax and terminology produced higher approval rates 
than negatively phrased questions. Finally, the demographics of poll respondents also cause differences in 
the amount of support that genetic engineering receives. Overall, these factors resulted in apparent 
variation across polling data. 
The results found by analyzing the evolution of opinion show that, although there is popular 
support for genetic engineering, support is slowly decreasing over time. The waning support trend for 
genetic engineering appears in opinions on both physical changes and disease prevention applications. 
There is a difference, however, in the amount of support for each application; people are always less 
supportive of using genetic engineering for physical characteristic improvements than disease prevention. 
vii 
 
The public was more receptive and supportive of questions that used positive words, categorized 
using Table 1. The most support was typically found in regard to applications to improve health, while 
most of the public did not support the genetic engineering applications for physical characteristic and 
appearance improvements. Support was limited for applications used for embryos or that would affect 
future offspring. These could be interpreted to reflect the morality associated with altering or enhancing a 
living being without their consent, but could also be due to the uncertainty of the resulting effects. 
Our analysis of poll results show that certain demographic factors seem to influence the public’s 
opinion on genetic engineering and whether there is support for or rejection of an application. Women are 
typically less optimistic about the applications than men, and this shows that they are more cautious with 
their acceptance and support of technologies that have possible risks to humans. The limited acceptance 
of religious opinions can be interpreted to reflect the morality associated with all religions, meaning that 
the type of religious affiliation does not matter, but rather it is the degree of religious commitment of the 
individual that will determine the amount of support they have for genetic engineering. 
 
Media Discourse Analysis 
The findings of the analysis made of the six media sources showed results that vary significantly 
from the hypothesis made at the beginning of this study. First of all, while there are differences in the 
presentation of CRISPR from sources of different political bias, the breach is not as big as initially 
thought. Notably, once The National Review is separated as an outlier, the number of negative articles in 
right-leaning sources becomes comparatively smaller to the number of articles with both positive and 
negative wording and those that are purely positive (becoming the most comparatively positive).  
Second, the total number of articles that were analyzed (95, or 20.65% of the original 460) were 
much smaller than expected once repeated and unrelated pieces were excluded. Considering the number 
of articles that mentioned CRISPR in passing or as a reference, and the fact that over half of the analyzed 
articles only vaguely explain what CRISPR is, we can make the inference that the media may have an 
implied standard on the public’s knowledge on the subject. The consistent use of CRISPR as a reference 
seems even more disconcerting when the fact that it is only rarely mentioned in titles is taken into 
consideration. Further studies would be necessary to analyze this discrepancy and are out of the scope of 
this study. 
Thirdly, we can make some assumptions on the level of interest the media sources give to the 
subject based on both the number of articles as well as the investment placed on the articles. While both 
of the left-leaning sources (CNN and the New York Times) and the centrist CBS News have their own 
journalists write the published pieces on CRISPR, both Fox News and USA Today seem to outsource their 
CRISPR pieces. This can be taken as a sign that less interest and resources go into writing pieces on this 
topic. The fact that most of the articles from a different source are taken from centrist authors may also 
explain the number of mixed and positive articles, as well as the smaller number of negative articles. 
 
Twitter Discourse Analysis 
In stark contrast to the results of the other analyses, the analysis of the discourse surrounding 
CRISPR on social media showed that a large proportion of tweets (91%) where neutrally-toned, and that 
325 of the 500 total tweets analyzed were simply shared information without the Twitter user’s opinion 
added.  Further, there were no trends in the relationship between the time period a tweet was posted 
(before or after a major event) and the tone of the tweet, as such a large majority was neutral.

Additionally, 78% of all tweets mention CRISPR in the body of the tweet in addition to being 
tagged with #CRISPR. The percentage of tweets containing CRISPR in the body of the tweet (78%) and 
the percentage of articles with the word CRISPR in their headline (7.4%) are very different. The 
percentage of tweets containing neutrally-toned headlines (92% of all tweets analyzed that were article 
links with headlines included in the tweet) is very different than the percentage of articles analyzed that 
are neutrally-toned (8.3%, articles containing neither positive nor negative wording). These differences 
suggest that the distribution of shared articles on Twitter does not reflect representation of the topic in the 
studied online news sources. In order to have a more comprehensive understanding of American Twitter 
users’ opinions on CRISPR, a further study should be performed to determine what methods American 
Twitter users employ to find, read, and share articles.

Introduction 
The field of genetic modification is constantly changing and advancing to meet the needs 
presented by our society. Currently, CRISPR gene alteration is one of the most advanced new methods 
being used and tested by scientists. This particular technique entails targeting specific sequences within 
the genome and modifying them to change a living organism as desired. These genetic alteration 
technologies are typically used to change the genes in a way that would correct the advancement of 
diseases such as cancer, AIDS, Hepatitis B, and a wide variety of genetic disorders. Genetic alteration in 
general is still in the beginning stages, and, as such, there is much speculation regarding the CRISPR 
procedure and its future uses.  
At the moment, the uncertainty in the future of human genetic modification is due to the limited 
amount of experiments that have been realized so far; a number that is even smaller when we consider 
only research done on modification of germline cells (eggs or sperm). Applying these technologies to 
humans also introduces more complex issues, as different senses of morality and discussions regarding 
consent affect public opinion. However, the benefits of applying the CRISPR technology to our 
advancing world could change the way we are affected by genetic mutations that have the ability to cause 
harm or diseases. 
As in other previous cases of emerging biotechnology, public opinion has rapidly become one of 
the influential driving forces behind the limitations and advancements regarding genetic modification and 
its uses. Public opinion can have a big impact on regulations and federal funding, as well as on the 
number of research projects that get funding and thus could allow for a better understanding of the 
possibilities and limitations of CRISPR. This opinion-driven force has been an influence in limiting 
advancements, not only regarding gene editing applications with humans, but also for applications such as 
genetically-engineered crops and reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization.  
Because public opinion can have such a deep impact on the advancements of biotechnology, we 
investigated public opinion and media representation of CRISPR to provide a more profound analysis on 
what the public believes this method of gene therapy should be used for. To gain answers, current polls, 
articles, and social media were analyzed. Furthermore, special consideration was taken to discover how 
these opinions change across a variety of demographics, since previous research and literature suggests a 
whole spectrum of opinions, for and against, in all segments of the population. This is marked by two 
very polarized opposites, with one side more in favor of continuous research and arguing that the value 
and the possibilities of CRISPR outweigh the risks of its misuse, while the other side argues that it would 
be irresponsible to use the technology, with all the risks and unknowns currently present, therefore 
arguing that the risks are greater than the benefits. The end result is the presence of a group of the 
population that thinks those who oppose the technology are “clutching pearls” and thus preventing people 
from leading healthier lives, and another group concerned that the scientists are “playing god”, especially 
when it comes to modifying embryos.

Background 
 
CRISPR 
The CRISPR gene editing method is a modern advancement in the field of biotechnology. 
CRISPR, which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats is done by 
exploiting a cellular defense system in common bacteria, where pieces of genetic code are identified and 
then cut or edited when affected by viruses. This mechanism is used by scientists to cut-and-paste editions 
to the genome, and even to make pinpoint changes to specific DNA bases, and thus make or correct 
mutations (Sander & Joung, 2014).  The alteration in this method can either be an addition, a removal, or 
a base change in the DNA sequences (What is CRISPR-Cas9?, 2016). This genetic modification method 
is different from others because it is more accurate and can target more specific sections of the DNA, 
making it more cost and time efficient. The increased accuracy of the CRISPR method also decreases the 
amount of off-target effects within the procedure. The limited off-target effects mean that there are less 
edits made at unintended locations, which could have otherwise caused new detrimental mutations within 
the organism. The CRISPR technology permanently alters the genetic code of the organism, which could 
have otherwise created mutations that could cause disease or death. Although these applications within 
CRISPR technology seem to have valuable potential for our society, they are still in their beginning 
stages.  
 
Scientific Community 
This fluidity in opinion is not only present in the general public, but background research 
suggests a great sense of division inside the scientific community as well. Dr. Jennifer Doudna, one of the 
scientists that worked on the first paper that introduced CRISPR-Cas9 (Jinek et al., 2012), has been 
adamant in her hopes that this technique should be used within the boundaries of morality. In 2015, Dr. 
Doudna was part of meetings and contributed to papers on the topic, including the International Summit 
on Human Gene Editing, which ended with a published summary on steps and precautions moving 
forward. The summary includes an expressed desire to prevent any work on the human germline so long 
as we do not know how to avoid the risks of inaccurate editing and the harmful effects that changes of this 
nature could have on the human population (Committee on Science, Technology, and Law Policy and 
Global Affairs, 2015). Moreover, the implications of passing the modified genes on to all of the future 
offspring, especially considering how hard it would be to reverse these changes, the possible uses for 
enhancement, and the moral and ethical challenges of changing the future of human evolution require 
careful deliberation (Committee on Science, Technology, And Law Policy And Global Affairs, 2015). 
Doudna’s publications in Science magazine about the considerations to be had going forward 
have been met with a variety of ongoing responses. Some of these include petitions to include stronger 
guidelines and ban any research that could potentially lead to changes on the germlines for non-life-
threatening reasons, which some scientists argue could lead us back on the path towards eugenics (Pollak, 
2015), while others worry that the fear of this potential may hinder the progress in science, which in turn 
affects a segment of the population who suffers from incurable genetic conditions (Miller, 2015).

Political Context 
In the American democratic system, citizens elect representatives to create and implement 
legislation. People, particularly on the topic of wedge issues, will vote for candidates who represent their 
views and, in this way, public opinion influences the way representatives vote about legislation 
surrounding controversial technologies, such as CRISPR research, stem cell research, and even alternative 
medicines. In the United States, people are currently submitting CRISPR gene therapies under modern 
methods used to evaluate previous genetic treatments, the CRISPR-Cas9 Germline Editing Therapies 
(CGETs) are put through “preclinical trials, clinical trials, and post-approval distribution” and before each 
stage there are “financial and regulatory checkpoints”, which is the method the government uses for 
ensuring that safe therapies reach the market (Evitt, Mascharak, & Altman, 2015). There are, however, 
differences of opinion on the subject of using CRISPR in the United States among researchers (Ledford, 
2015), and those differences are now forming among bioethicists, the public, and legislators (Baumann, 
2016). The scientific community is questioning whether it is our place to change life for what we believe 
is the better, and that has ultimately became a debate on whether or not one should be allowed to legally. 
 
Public Opinion and Polls 
Since this technology is still in its beginning stages of practice, there is much speculation 
surrounding its uses and applications. The public has a wide range of opinions regarding genetic editing, 
but the most prevalent are the two opposing poles: either supporting the experiments and applications or 
opposing the advancements of the technology. Proponents of the gene editing technology approve of 
advancing the uses to experiment more and ultimately to develop the technology for useful future 
applications. Opponents reject the gene editing applications and resist the integration of the technologies 
into society. 
Different opinions have corresponding trends within demographics, as seen in United States 
public polls from the Pew Research Center (Greenwood, 2016). The support or opposition to these 
technologies is highly conditional and context-driven. For example, though most religious groups do not 
have a strong corresponding positive or negative opinion regarding gene editing, the atheist demographic 
strayed from this usual 50/50 split between opinions at either extreme by instead splitting between a 75% 
approval and a 24% refusal when considering whether they would use gene editing on their baby 
(Greenwood, 2016). Specific circumstances also play a role in opinions toward the gene editing 
technology in human embryos. For example, most people, regardless of demographics or religion, would 
approve of the use of genetic modification in their children if it were a life and death situation. Yet, in 
regards to the technology in general, the religiously unaffiliated public believed more in the importance of 
advancing these technologies than in the idea that it is “meddling with nature”, when compared to 
respondents with a religious affiliation (Greenwood, 2016). Across all reviewed polls, opinions in 
demographics based in race and ethnicity were, for the most part, evenly split: 50% in support and 50% 
opposed to genetic editing applications as a whole (Greenwood, 2016). In most of these polls, the 
opinions tend to shift from strongly supporting the technology in applications with grown adults to 
strongly opposing the applications regarding embryos and future generations (Begley, 2016; Columbus, 
2017; Greenwood, 2016).

The Relevance of Media in Public Opinion 
The media also has an impact on the perceptions regarding this area of science. Scientists have 
long seen the media as the “translator” between new technologies and discoveries to the general public 
(McCluskey, Kalaitzandonakes, & Swinnen, 2015). As such, the media has the power to spread new 
notions and validate one position over other, by becoming a platform for a particular idea or agenda for its 
particular reading demographic. This in no way means that what is published by any particular source is 
immediately accepted, as other factors such as religious belief, partisan position, age group and direct 
experience may incline an individual to agree with an article or to rapidly reject it. 
         In America, 81% of the population has a social media account (Edison Research 2017). This has 
created a society in which one is able to converse with others without leaving the home and gives others 
the ability to read and interact with those conversations. Social media is not only used for direct 
conversations between individuals, but also for individuals to respond to news, public statements, and 
current events.  With such a high percentage of the population using social media platforms, they have 
become more important and influential in shaping public opinion. For example, Barack Obama’s victory 
in his 2008 presidential campaign has been attributed in part to the success of Obama’s social media 
campaign that Republicans at the time were not able replicate (Katz, 2013). In the decade since that 
election, the importance and relevance of social media to modern American life has only grown. The 
2016 election of Donald Trump involved many online campaigns in a similar fashion to the Obama 
campaign. Rapid dissemination of information directly from the candidates, the tone of Trump and 
Hillary Clinton’s tweets, and the way that each candidate’s social media followers conversed with each 
other over Twitter all impacted the election of the President of the United States of America (Yaqub et al., 
2017). 
The role of social media has expanded to become not only a forum to discuss the news, but a 
forum from which news is generated, giving these platforms great relevance in the lives of average 
Americans.

Literature Review 
This project required research into a variety of subjects to gain full perspective on the relevant 
aspects surrounding public opinion of CRISPR. Most of the research was refined to categories based on 
the technology itself, the analysis of social media data, the analysis of media reports, and public opinion 
polls. The sources analyzed ranged from scientific journal reports, published articles, national public poll 
reports, and market reports. From these sources, information was gathered to accomplish the project goal 
to determine the public opinions on CRISPR and the influences associated with these opinions. 
 
CRISPR 
To fully understand the basis of this project, it was imperative to research the technology of 
CRISPR itself. The CRISPR-Cas9 method includes several steps to target, cut and alter the genomic 
sequence using crRNAs and the Cas9 enzyme (Questions and Answers about CRISPR, 2017; Sander & 
Joung, 2014; What is CRISPR-Cas9?, 2016). Although there are other genome editing methods, the 
CRISPR technology has proved to be more accurate, and more efficient at editing DNA (What is 
CRISPR-Cas9?, 2016). The research also explained that the CRISPR system has the ability to be 
customizable and will create great advancements in the biotechnology industry (Questions and Answers 
about CRISPR, 2017). These sources proved useful in understanding the logistics of the science behind 
the CRISPR genetic alteration. 
 
Public Opinion 
One relevant subject touched upon in this project was the public opinion regarding CRISPR and 
genetic alteration in general. National public polls put forth through Statista contained a variety of topics 
regarding genetic editing. These polls allowed for research related to specific to topics such as knowledge 
about gene editing, funding for future uses, future applications and how much people would be willing to 
pay for these new advancements. According to Greenwood (2016), gene editing is a topic that is known to 
most Americans. Even with this knowledge, there is speculation about how the public feels these 
technologies should be applied. Jasanoff, Hurlbut, and Saha (2015) explain that, from the scientist 
perspective, there must be regulations. The way in which the technologies would be regulated could 
include a variety of officials from different concentrations, such as the scientific and ethical positions, as 
to represent as much of the public’s beliefs as possible (Jasanoff, Hurlbut & Saha, 2015). To determine 
the public’s beliefs on the gene editing applications, Blendon, Gorski & Bendon (2016) had analyzed 17 
previous polls. These analytic results reflected that the public opinion shifts from supporting the 
applications of altering the genes of adults to opposing the technologies when used in embryos (Blendon, 
Gorksi & Bendon, 2016). These negative feelings are also present with the officials present at the global 
summit, where the criticism was mainly brought by the non-scientific representatives (Begley, 2015). 
Begley’s work is also relevant in the American public opinion that she explains “says no to ‘designer 
babies’”, which brings up the issue of the influences and education regarding gene editing technologies 
(Begley, 2016). According to Eplett, a reason for these differences in support, specifically found in poll 
results, is due to the language used because language has the ability to alter the perception of the 
questions asked (Eplett, 2013). More specifically, Ferenstein reveals the results from specific polls that 
ask the same questions in different wording and produce different results, further reinforcing this idea that 
language can shift results (Ferenstein, 2015).

Scientific Opinion 
 There is a variety of opinions within the scientific community, which can be found both in the 
summary of national and international talks concerning the topic of CRISPR and how scientists should 
move forward. The Committee on Science, Technology, and Law Policy and Global Affairs determined 
during the 2015 International Summit on Human Gene Editing that the technology for gene editing was 
advancing at a rapid pace, with CRISPR being “so overwhelmingly efficient and specific that it is 
changing our entire outlook for future gene editing”. The same summit also mentions the multiple uses of 
CRISPR, including learning more about the function of each gene, curing genetic diseases, improving 
fertilization techniques, and enhancement/selection of traits. The fact that the technology is still in 
development and that there were still several errors that required fixing before proceeding to more 
intensive trials and studies was also mentioned, as well as the complicated moral and ethical 
considerations to be taken regarding gene editing. The presence of very different positions can be seen 
again here. On one side, there is mention of it being “acceptable when its benefits, both to individuals and 
to the broader society, exceed its risks, ... though the relevant risks and benefits and levels of acceptable 
risk are today uncertain” (Harris, 2015). On the other side, there were calls for:  
 
a two-year moratorium on the basic research needed to enable germline human gene 
editing until an international ban on germline gene editing for reproductive purposes can be 
secured. […] The future risks of gene editing are unpredictable [...] which means that the long-
term harms may well outweigh the benefits. In addition, researchers and future parents have an 
obligation to respect the morally relevant status of the human embryo [...] but germline gene 
editing does not meet this obligation because it either renders the embryo morally neutral or 
diminishes it to the status of property or goods. (Hacker, 2015) 
 
Furthermore, a concern that the use of these technologies would end up crossing a line while pursuing a 
noble goal was also mentioned. Some scientists mentioned the possibility of reinforcing existing 
“economic and social disparities” or reinforce stigma associated with disability. While concerns about 
eugenics were no longer considered a serious risk, the possibility of racial stigmatization in the use of 
genetic engineering technologies was also brought up. 
A number of articles considering these different positions have been published by Science and 
Nature. These include papers written by Jennifer Doudna about the ethical and moral considerations, as 
well as the possibilities of future research. One such article, written in April 2015, entitled “A prudent 
path forward for genomic engineering and germline gene modification” was published in Science; it 
called for transparency as science moved forward on CRISPR research, discouraged modifications to the 
human germline and introduced the idea of creating forums and/or organizations that allowed for 
scientific and ethical discussions on the topic (Baltimore, et al,). On December 22, 2015, after the 
International Summit, another article was published in Nature. This article, written by Doudna, describes 
the initial discovery of CRISPR and her growing concerns about the technology being used in unethical 
ways. An explanation of the results of the Napa Convention, as well as her overall conclusions from the 
several months she had been working on spreading awareness and calling for conversation are also 
included, together with a call to scientists to start making more of the conversation and information 
available to the public.   
7 
 
Responses to the aforementioned articles and to new developments regarding CRISPR are also 
common. In June 2015, after Chinese scientists attempted to modify human embryos for the first time, 
Henry I. Miller, who also writes for The National Review, wrote an opinion piece arguing against the 
previous call for a moratorium on this use of CRISPR (mentioned in Baltimore, et al., 2015). His main 
argument was that, while the technology should be used “sparingly and under scrutiny” it should not be 
completely limited by a moratorium that would only result in a longer period of time being used to perfect 
the technique, leaving many of the people who suffer from the effect of genetic conditions, such as sickle 
anemia and Huntington’s, bound to live with their conditions and their side effects for longer than 
necessary (Miller, 2015). A completely different point of view is expressed by Robert Pollack in his May 
2015 letter to Science. The letter mostly focuses on the ability to change the human germline, calling the 
necessity to “design” the desired “aspects of a child’s inheritance” a modern version of eugenics. He ends 
the opinion piece by calling the previous recommendation for a moratorium “not enough” to prevent the 
consequences of designing the genome and asking for a total ban on this use of CRISPR (Pollack, 2015). 
Another article, written in March 2015, for Science discusses the necessity for strict regulation of 
modification of the human germline, mostly showing concern for the yet unknown possible side effects 
and unintended mutations of gene modification (Vogel). A secondary concern mentioned is the lack of a 
good regulatory framework established by the government to regulate the uses and trials of CRISPR. 
 
Media Reports 
 Different online media sources exist at the moment, and while many small, online-based sources 
have emerged in the past few years to benefit from the expansion of social media and the ease of sharing 
information, the most reputable are the ones that have been established for a while. Most of the traditional 
news sources have over time expanded to include web pages that contain both the articles that are printed 
in paper copy,  as well as some articles that are only available through the internet. Different news sources 
have been catalogued by the level of bias they have. One of the most common divisions is due to different 
political leanings – right, left, or center  – based on their political commentary, their editorial position, 
and the bias of the journalist members of the source. This bias can affect the information that is covered, 
which topics are given more importance, and the general tone and language used to describe a situation, 
group, or individual (Eberl, Boomgaarden, & Wagner, 2015).  
 
Social Media  
Social media, as it integrated itself into the daily life of the American public (Edison Research 
2017), has become a powerful research tool due the amount of data that Americans freely give in order to 
partake in these public forums (Tuten & Mintu-Wimsatt 2018). Private business (Kumar & Choi 2017) 
and public politicians (Rill & Cardiel 2013), for example, have an interest in both understanding the 
attitudes and thoughts of the public at large and shaping the attitudes and thoughts of the public to be 
more positive towards their own preferences. This has created a necessity for qualitative and meaningful 
analytical techniques and tools that help researchers to understand public discourse now publicly 
available and saved for posterity (Syrdal & Briggs 2018).  
 Twitter, as a social media platform, is very useful for conducting research due to the structure of 
the site (Bruns & Stieglitz 2013), particularly the use of hashtags to denote topics of conversation within 
tweets. Because topics of conversation are easily searchable, entrepreneurs have been using Twitter to 
find information on the demands of the consuming public (Motoyama, Goetz & Han 2018) and in much 
8 
 
the same way, researchers are able to use Twitter to gain valuable insight into sentiment (Giachanou & 
Crestani 2016) using algorithms. Researchers have also used Twitter to gain data on the way that Twitter 
users interact with each other while discussing particular topics online, how those interactions change 
over time, and how these interactions may possibly affect life outside of Twitter (Yaqub et al. 2017). 
 
9 
 
Methodology 
In order to collect data that would provide answers to the research questions, we used the 
following methods: identified and analyzed opinion polls on genetic engineering and CRISPR, used 
discourse analysis to evaluate media reports on CRISPR, and mined Twitter for data on CRISPR. These 
methods helped us determine public opinion on the use and advancement of CRISPR technologies 
because they provided results from a large sample population, which can be representative of opinion 
trends across the entire United States. 
 
Poll Analysis 
In order to gauge the potentially wide range of opinions about CRISPR in the United States, we 
analyzed public opinion polls. This was done by looking at current snapshots of public opinion within 
demographics and how they may have changed over time. These opinions and changes could have 
underlying influences that explain why they relate to certain demographics and times. For this project's 
purposes, we selected public opinion polls that specifically asked questions about CRISPR technologies 
in the United States, as well as those that used the terms gene therapy and genetic engineering (Begley, 
2016; Blendon, Gorski, & Benson, 2016; CGS, 2014; Greenwood, 2016; Potenza, 2017). Since CRISPR 
is a newer technology, there are limited polls and data that specifically focus on CRISPR alone. From the 
21 polls analyzed, only 2 explicitly used the term “CRISPR”. For this reason, the terms gene therapy and 
genetic engineering were chosen for additional analysis because they are broader topics that encompass 
the same ideas and technologies as the CRISPR method but have more data and are more publicly 
recognized through published polls. 
Different demographics were analyzed within the public opinion polls to get a better sense of 
each of their corresponding opinions. A study of popular opinion – with a focus on whether the majority 
supports or rejects the CRISPR technologies – helped to explain if there are particular preferences 
corresponding to specific demographics. Preliminary searches were done to determine relevant 
demographics and groups to focus on for this project's purpose of gauging the public’s opinion on 
CRISPR technology uses. These preliminary searches were conducted by searching for polls broken up 
by demographics, including: gender, religion, and race/ethnicity. The searches revealed that certain 
demographics had no strong opinion and were equally split between supporting and rejecting genetic 
engineering in humans, and thus would not produce data that could be used to visualize the potential 
influences on determining opinion. Race and ethnicity proved to also be irrelevant for this project’s 
purposes since most of polls found in the preliminary searches displayed no specific race or ethnicity 
displaying a majority opinion leaning toward fully supporting or fully rejecting genetic engineering 
(Greenwood, 2016). Without a popular opinion between groups, the data would not reveal a correlation 
between race/ethnicity and opinions about CRISPR technologies and were eliminated from further 
research. Gender and religion displayed strong popular opinions, either mostly support or mostly reject, 
regarding genetic engineering technologies. These strong popular opinions could produce data to 
determine a correlation between gender or religion and genetic engineering opinions (CGS, 2014; 
Greenwood, 2016; Potenza, 2017). Looking at polls conducted in different years also displayed varying 
results since CRISPR technologies are new to the industry and advancing quickly and can reveal the 
evolution of how and why this correlates with public opinion changes (Blendon, Gorski, & Benson, 2016; 
CGS, 2014). 
10 
 
Differences in results found in preliminary searches also tended to shift due to the wording of 
questions asked within the polls. Most of the support for genetic engineering was found in polls with 
terms regarding human health, as opposed to wording regarding improvements to human abilities 
(Begley, 2016; Potenza, 2017). For example, in the 2017 American Association for the Advancement of 
Science poll, 59% of people supported the use of gene editing to treat medical conditions or restore health 
while only 33.2% of people supported the use of gene editing to enhance or improve human abilities 
(Potenza, 2017). The public was also less receptive to keywords such as ""designer babies"" or ""super 
humans"" (Begley, 2016). These keywords were chosen to describe the correlation between opinion and 
use of language within the poll since these words most clearly demonstrate the positive and negative 
connotations through language (Table 1). These keywords are also the most prevalent among polls and 
other data collection sources such as media and Twitter, which can reinforce the reasoning for the results.

Discourse Media Analysis 
We first analyzed reporting on CRISPR from various online media sources to determine the tone 
of the articles. This analysis included articles that mention the technology – more specifically articles in 
which CRISPR is the main topic and the article describes a use (or potential use) in human therapies 
and/or the ethical and moral implications of said use. A couple of articles that give a review on recent 
polls on the subject were also analyzed and set apart for comparison. 
The media sources were selected from different ideological viewpoints in order to get a more 
comprehensive view of how each source frames the technology and the possibilities and risks that come 
from its use. The necessity to have sources with different bias arises from the fact that this bias is what 
prompts different segments of the population to consider them trustworthy and, as such, use them as their 
primary sources of information. The level of ideological bias was taken from a 2014 survey by the Pew 
Research Center (Mitchell, Gottfried, Kiley, & Matsa 2014), which separated media sources by its 
readers. The sources to be used within each bias segment were chosen due to the high readership that they 
have among the population of the United States. 
Since the entirety of this analysis was constricted to a few weeks, the range of news sources had 
to be narrowed down to only a few representative ones for each segment. All the sources that were chosen 
are the main, online news sources for significant groups of the population (Mitchell, et al., 2014). The 
team evaluated the following sources: The New York Times, CNN, CBS News, USA Today, Fox News, and 
The National Review. Moreover, every article fitting the above characteristics published since the start of 
publication and March 2018 was included in this analysis.

We tabulated the number of articles from each source and identified the author or original source. 
Each source’s website is equipped with a search function that is limited by time periods. As it was not 
always possible to change the date range within the embedded search function, a more detailed search 
was performed using Google Advanced search. The number of articles was reduced by eliminating those 
that mention CRISPR only in passing, as well as those that are not related to applications in humans. 
Then, each article was analyzed to determine whether the article was in favor of, against, or neutral on the 
use of CRISPR. Keywords present were also counted; this include the following negative terms: 
“designer babies”, “playing god”, “risk”, “fear”, “eugenics”; and positive terms: “life saving”, 
“revolutionary”, “less expensive”, “accurate”.  These keywords were selected due to their presence in 
certain types of articles, as they suggest either a more favorable or negative approach in the tone (see 
Table 1). 
The presence of a comparison to science fiction was also noted, as it is usually used by journalists 
in order to “sensationalize” the topic, get a greater reaction based on “shock value”, thus being able to 
more easily give the article either positive or negative connotations (Kendal, 2015). Additionally, the 
tense used to describe potential uses of CRISPR was reviewed. This was done in order to find out how 
13 
 
many articles talk about future possibilities in present tense, and how many give a more realistic view of a 
technology that is still only in its early stages. 
These metrics were combined into a coding instrument (which can be found in Appendix A) – a 
standardized rubric used to analyze a piece of discourse – that was employed by the group to assign a 
positive, neutral, or negative tone to each article. While one member of the group performed the analysis 
on all the sources, ten articles were chosen at random and were given to the two other members of the 
group to recode in order to compare to the original coding and insure that the coding instrument was 
efficient for this study. Once the efficacy of the coding instrument was proved to be high, all of the 
articles found on the media sources that fulfilled the aforementioned requirements were coded. All of this 
analysis allowed for a better understanding of the stances of each media source, and the data we gather 
will be compared to the number on the polls and the discourse analysis of Twitter. 
 
Twitter Discourse Analysis 
In order to determine the nature of the discourse on CRISPR on social media in the United States, 
we used a coding instrument, to analyze content on Twitter. Twitter was chosen as the subject of this 
analysis because Twitter is a popular social media platform in the US, with 68 million active users in the 
country (Twitter, 2018), 74% of whom use Twitter as their primary source of news (Bialik & Matsa, 
2017). 
The coding instrument (Appendix B) is primarily focused on the categorization of tweets by 
language, type of engagement, and date and time posted to allow for analysis of the types of tweets that 
are written concerning important moments in CRISPR’s history. The coding instrument reveals if the 
author of a tweet used positive or negative words about CRISPR, what type of category the tweet is 
(Lovejoy & Saxton, 2012), and what the topic of the tweet is. From research, it was found there are 
generally three types of social media posts, Informational, Community, and Action, based on providing 
people information, engaging the community, and attempting to convince the community to take physical 
action. Because Twitter was chosen as our social media platform to analyze, several other categories of 
tweets, such as opinions (tweets solely containing an opinions), broadcasts (tweets solely containing a 
link to other content with no input from the user who shares the link), and inquisitive tweets (tweets 
addressed to a person or community used to gain information)  were added. Because of the conversational 
tone of Twitter, the coding instrument had to allow for categorization if a tweet was simply an opinion, a 
link to another page with no additional input given, or a tweet meant to gather information from a specific 
person or specific group of people. These categories allow results from the coding instrument to be used 
to compare the tone and type of tweets from different specific time periods. When searching for tweets to 
use for this analysis, tweets from time periods before and after important events within CRISPR’s 
research history were selected. These tweets were also filtered to only include tweets from the geographic 
area of the United States, and from those, only tweets in English. 
The coding instrument begins with three basic questions, asking if the tweet: 1) uses the term 
“CRISPR,” 2) uses positive words to describe CRISPR, and 3) uses negative words to describe CRISPR. 
The next three questions relate to categorizing the tweet. Lovejoy and Saxton’s (2012) three categories of 
tweets were used as categories of tweet, but in addition to informational, community, and action tweets, 
tweets could also be opinion based, a simple broadcasted message with no additional thoughts, or an 
inquisitive tweet.  This data was collected in order to determine how users who discussed CRISPR were 
engaging with Twitter. It is then considered whether the tweet is a response to another tweet, and the 
14 
 
category of that tweet, and then the topic of the tweet is recorded. Because of the potential for 
conversations on Twitter as a platform, understanding which and how many tweets are responses are 
important for characterizing the discourse on Twitter. The topic of the tweet was recorded in order to 
gather data on what people were discussing relating to CRISPR, and to be able to find if there were 
patterns shared between tweets on the same subject. Finally, the type of link within the tweet, should the 
tweet have a link, is recorded, along with the URL of the tweet and the date it was published. These allow 
for the cataloging of tweets within a database, as well as determining the sources that users of Twitter 
were drawing upon. 
Due to the time constraints and the labor required in using a manual coding instrument, it was not 
possible to code every tweet posted around the time of a notable event. We therefore chose to randomly 
select a limited number of tweets before and after notable events or major announcements on CRISPR. 
For each time period selected, twenty-five tweets were taken from before the referenced event, and 
seventy-five after, to allow for a comparative analysis. These time periods include: December 2015, when 
Jennifer Doudna and several other genetic engineering researchers met to discuss a potential ban on 
editing heritable genes in humans using CRISPR (Doudna, 2015); July 2016, when Chinese scientists 
gained approval to test CRISPR derived treatments on adult patients with aggressive lung cancer 
(Cyranoski, 2016); July 2017, when scientists in the US edited a human embryo using CRISPR (Howard, 
2017); August 2017, when CRISPR was again used to alter viable human embryos (Ledford, 2017); and 
November 2017, after CBS released a series of videos and articles entitled “Playing God” (CBS, 2017). 
This selective sampling allowed us to analyze discussions on CRISPR over time and how the discussions 
differ from the news articles published at the time by comparing results from coded news articles and 
coded tweets from the selected time period.

There are, however, inherent issues with using Twitter as a data source. There is very little 
demographic data associated with tweets (other than the location of a tweet being stored in the tweet as 
data), and there is no real way to determine which users are bots and which users are people (Sloan, et al., 
2013). Fortunately, Twitter’s advanced search options allow for users to filter search results by 
geographic location. This allowed for a sample population of tweets for analysis that have been confirmed 
to be from within the United States.

Results 
 
Poll Analysis 
 The results found from analyzing polls can be represented most effectively by separating them 
into three categories: the evolution of public opinion, public opinion based on poll terminology and 
language, and public opinion based on demographics.  
 
Evolution of Public Opinion 
         The evolution of public opinion was found to have changed from high support of inheritable 
genetic modification to decreased support over the span of three decades. As seen in Figure 1, the public 
had high support in regard to the use of genetic modification for applications related to disease 
prevention, starting at 66% in 1992 (CGS Summary of Public Opinion Polls, 2014). This support 
increased slightly to 72% in 1996, but progressively decreased to 41% by 2003 (CGS Summary of Public 
Opinion Polls, 2014). Support was lower when the genetic modification applications changed from 
altering physical appearance rather than health applications, but followed a similar trend as the opinions 
about disease prevention. The support began at 44% in 1986 and progressively decreased to 4% in 2003 
(CGS Summary of Public Opinion Polls, 2014). The difference between the disease prevention and 
physical trait change opinions is that the support for physical trait changes increased again to 16% in 2014 
(CGS Summary of Public Opinion Polls, 2014).  
 
 
 
Figure 1: The graph displays the percentage of the public that supported inheritable genetic engineering 
based on similar poll questions asked over a time period from 1986 to 2014.  
 
Public Opinion Based on Syntax 
         Overall, there were higher rates of approval in polls that contained questions using positive 
wording as opposed to using negative wording. The categorization of wording was based on Table 1. The 
topics within polls that had been worded in both positively and negative language are displayed in Figure 
17 
 
2. The positively worded polls, as seen in Figures 2 and 3, gained support ranging from 26-87%, while 
the negatively worded polls, displayed in Figures 2 and 4, only had 11-45% support. Specific differences 
can be seen in the results from the polls referencing gene editing techniques being applied to “treat 
medical conditions or restore health” that had 60% of people’s support, while only 30% of people 
supported the applications “to enhance or improve human abilities” (Potenza, 2017). Questions related to 
“improving intelligence” only received 44% of support (Blendon, Gorski, & Benson, 2016) and questions 
related to “improving physical characteristics” of embryos received the lowest support of 11% (Bedgley, 
2016; King, 2016). Similarly, it was found that there were high levels of support in questions related to 
“improving health” and “curing fatal disease”, which had 65% and 87% of the public’s support, 
respectively. Language that referenced the genetic alteration of embryos received low support overall, but 
received a higher percentage of support when the applications were in reference to disease risk reduction. 
The support was at 45% for the questions that mentioned the necessity of testing on human embryos 
(Greenwood, 2016), 44% of the public approved the funding of research in genetic engineering before 
birth to reduce disease risk (King, 2016), and only 26% supported gene alteration of embryos to reduce 
risks of disease (Begley, 2016). The positive and negative language influence in results can also clearly be 
seen in the questions that referenced somatic therapy applications that gained 64% support, while only 
39% of people supported somatic enhancement applications (Abed, 2017). Similarly, 65% of people 
supported germline therapy applications of genetic engineering but only 26% of people supported 
heritable germline enhancement (Abed, 2017).

Public Opinion Based on Demographics 
The results for the opinions related to certain demographics were categorized into one of six 
groups. The groups, or demographics, included were people who were either religious, non-religious, 
male, female, parents, or non-parental adults. A range of support was displayed within individual 
demographics due to multiple different questions asked in polls, resulting in varying responses. These 
resulting support ranges are displayed in Figure 5, with separate questions within similar demographics 
displayed as dots along the same vertical axis. People who were categorized as religious displayed 28% 
support for genetic engineering enhancement applications as well as 50% support for applications in 
health restoration (Abed, 2017; Potenza, 2017). Non-religious people had an approval range from 45-
75%. The non-religious respondents showed 45% support in applications to enhance human 
characteristics, while 75% supported genetic engineering applications for health reasons (Abed, 2017; 
Potenza, 2017). The male respondent category had a range of support from 23-63%. The 23% support 
was found in questions related to germ-line therapy uses of gene editing, while the 63% of support was 
found in a general and vague question asking if they supported genetic engineering as a whole 
(Napolitano & Ogunseitan, 1999). Another question revealed that 58% of males support gene therapy in 
somatic cell applications (Napolitano & Ogunseitan, 1999). The female respondents had lower support for 
gene editing, which ranged from 16-60%. The question related to germ-line therapy also had the lowest 
support at 16% for females (Napolitano & Ogunseitan, 1999). The female support increased to 46% for 
the general question about supporting genetic engineering applications as a whole (Napolitano & 
Ogunseitan, 1999). The highest female support of 60% was found in the question asking about gene 
therapy in somatic cells (Napolitano & Ogunseitan, 1999). The final two categories of respondents were 
parents and non-parental adults. The parents with a child under the age of 18 displayed 59% approval of 
the use of genetic engineering to reduce the risk of serious disease, while only 45% of the non-parental 
adults supported these same uses (Greenwood, 2016).  
While the absolute percentage of support within a demographic group varied from poll to poll, the 
difference in the approval rate between two groups of a given demographic appeared remarkably 
consistent. As seen in Figure 6, there are significant differences between the approval rates within groups 
in the same demographic. For example, among all three polls shown in Figure 5, the absolute amount of 
approval varied widely among the polls, from 23-63% approval for males and 16-60% approval for 
females. However, the difference between the approval rate for males and females was highly similar in 
all three polls, with about 7% more approval by men than women in all three polls (Figure 6). A similar 
phenomenon was noted for approval ratings between religious and non-religious people, with non-
religious persons reporting about 21% greater approval than religious persons.

Discourse Analysis of Media Sources  
The results from the data collected on the six different media sources (Fox News, The National 
Review, CBS News, USA Today, CNN, and The New York Times) reveal the overall evolution of the 
discourse employed when discussing CRISPR. Trends over time show a similar variation on all bias 
levels, with The National Review being an outlier, as will be explained in the following paragraphs. 
Certain differences can be found between the writing of articles that come from different sources, but the 
general trend is maintained. The effect of events in the scientific community globally can be seen in 
Figure 7, where the number of total articles from the aforementioned sources is shown in comparison with 
events occurring. The graph clearly shows an increase whenever a major breakthrough or international 
event occurs. Two particular events caused the most reaction from the media, in number of articles: the 
International Summit on Gene Editing conference in December 2015 (National Academy of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine, 2015), and the first viable embryo modification trial in the United States in 
July 2017 (Servick, 2017). 
First, most articles do not include “CRISPR” in the title, preferring instead to use umbrella terms 
such as “gene-editing technology”, “gene editing technique”, “gene editing tool” or simply mentioning 
the purpose of the study or trial that is being described. From the total pool of ninety-five articles, only 
seven (~7%) mention CRISPR in the title; all the others use an umbrella term such as the ones mentioned 
above or mention a possible future use of CRISPR. These can be exemplified by the following titles: “In 
U.S first, scientists edit genes of human embryos” (The Associated Press, 2017), “Gene Therapy for 
Cancer: Overregulation Will Delay Its Benefits to Patients” (The National Review, 2016), “China gets 
into the genetic breakthrough business” (CNN, 2016), “A Powerful New Way to Edit DNA” (The New 
York Times, 2014), “DNA breakthrough: Scientists repair genes in human embryos to prevent inherited 
diseases” (Fox News, 2017), “Cure for HIV reportedly 3 years away” (Fox News, 2016). Within the 
articles themselves, 38.7% give a vague or incomplete explanation of CRISPR, 34.7% give a good, if 
sometimes rudimentary, explanation of what CRISPR does and the rest (26.3%) do not give an 
explanation on CRISPR at all. 
Next, the analysis concerning the tone of the articles shows a series of trends over time for the 
presence of positive, negative and of neutral articles. The selected sources that were analyzed present a 
total of three articles (two by Fox News and one by The New York Times) on CRISPR during the first two 
years after the discovery was made. Of these early publications on CRISPR, written between 2013 and 
2014, both of the ones written by Fox News were hopeful and positive, lauding the technique as a 
technological advancement that could be the key to solve hereditary conditions and cure diseases such as 
cancer and HIV. The article by The New York Times includes both praise for the potential of the 
technology, as well as some negative commentary about the possible misuse of the technology in the 
future. The overall tone of the articles in time, since 2015, can be observed in Figure 8, where all articles 
reviewed are considered and the number of articles that include positive, negative, both or neither 
language are represented graphically over time. 
When scientists started debating the ethical concerns of using CRISPR in human trials in 2015, 
the articles started including more negative wording, especially those concerning the human germline 
(embryos and gametes) with a 95.16% correlation between mention of embryos and negative wording in 
the articles. In the midst of these mostly negative articles, there were twenty-five fully positive articles, 
mostly concerning the use of CRISPR to cure diseases in adults. The mixed positions in all sources have 
led to the presence of articles containing both positive and negative words in the form of expositional 
pieces. The structure of these reports is the following: the subject is presented, scientific opinion is shown 
22 
 
to be mostly supportive, followed by a discussion on the ethical implications of using gene editing 
technologies to make changes in the human genome versus the possible benefits that could come with the 
use of the technology.

25 
The National Review is an outlier of this trend. Its major contributor for science articles, Wesley 
J. Smith, is in opposition to any kind of genetic engineering. Of the thirteen articles that were analyzed 
from The National Review, ten (76.9%) of the articles were written by Smith. Henry I. Miller, a less 
frequent contributor, has a slightly positive leaning on the subject, at least concerning its use to benefit 
adults suffering from cancer and similar diseases. This is the only source where most of the articles were 
written by the same person with a clear bias.  The content of the articles was also very different from the 
other sources. Most of the articles contained some quotes from studies or journals as well as commentary 
about those quotes. A more “moralistic” approach is given, giving less importance to whatever new 
discovery or paper had been published at the time, focusing instead on regulation and criticizing the 
scientists who would proceed with research in the area and the politicians who allow said research. This 
was also the only source that used literary references to science fiction. Four of the total articles written 
include a reference to Brave New World, and one of these also included a mention of The Andromeda 
Strain both of which can be interpreted as negative dystopias related to gene modification. The particular 
effect of this source can be easily distinguished in Figure 9 below. The number of negative articles 
increases dramatically when the data from The National Review are considered.  
 
 
Figure 9: Article tones in Right-leaning news sources with and without considering The National Review. 
Shows the differences the outlier makes in the total trend. 
 
Both left-leaning sources (The New York Times and CNN) have their articles written by members 
of their journalistic group. All fourteen articles from CNN were written by one of their reporters, and 
twenty out of twenty-one articles from The New York Times written by one of their reporters (except for 
one that was credited as being taken from the Associated Press). This is also the case for the center source 
CBS news, which claimed most of the articles (13 out of 14 total) as their own, four (28.5%) credited as 
being in conjunction with the Associated Press, and one article credited to Livescience.com. USA Today 
claimed five of their articles as theirs, with one of them credited as a work in conjunction with The 
Guardian. The other articles were credited to The Motley Fool, The Wilmington, Delaware News Journal 
and The Independent. On the right-leaning side, Fox News only claimed nine (36%) of their articles were 
written by journalist members of their staff. The others were written by the Associated Press (five articles, 
10%), Reuters (six articles, 24%), Stat (two articles, 8%), Digital Trends (one article, 4%) and Newser 
26 
 
(two articles, 8%). Finally, The National Review claimed 100% of their thirteen articles were written by a 
member of their staff. It must be noted that both Fox New sand CBS News just claimed articles by 
labeling them with their name, and no author was actually credited for most of the pieces (only four 
pieces credited to an author by CBS News and five by Fox News).

Figure 11: Total percentage of the tone of the articles separated by political leaning of the source. 
 
On the amount of negative versus positive articles written by each source (which can be seen in 
Figure 10 and Figure 11), The National Review has a total of fourteen negative articles and two positive 
articles. Fox News has two negative articles, ten positive articles, two slightly positive articles, and ten 
articles where both negative and positive wording was used to describe CRISPR. USA Today has zero 
articles with just negative wording, two articles with positive wording only, six articles that used both 
positive and negative terms for CRISPR as well as two articles where neither positive nor negative 
wording was used. CBS News had zero negative articles, four positive articles, eight articles with both 
positive and negative wording and two articles with neither positive nor negative wording. The New York 
Times has a total of two negative articles, five positive articles, thirteen neutral articles and one article that 
include neither positive nor negative wording. Finally, CNN has a total of zero negative articles, three 
positive articles, nine neutral articles and one article that include neither positive nor negative wording. 
 
Twitter Discourse Analysis 
 The results from the analysis of Twitter discourse reveal how some American users of Twitter 
have used the platform to discuss CRISPR. We found that across the selected months studied, only the 
topics of conversation changed. The majority of the tweets discussing CRISPR on Twitter (65%, from our 
analysis, Figure 12) were categorized as “broadcast” and contained links to news articles, blogs, academic 
journals, and videos, 299 of which (92%) contain no positive or negative wording (Figure 13). 
28

Figure 13: Proportion of Positive, Negative, and Neutral Tweets by Selected Time Period 
  
As seen in Figure 10, broadcasts, the category typified as direct links to other content without 
comment are the most common tweets about CRISPR by a wide margin. The vast majority of tweets, 455 
out of the 500 surveyed (91%) where neutrally-worded (Figure 13).

Figure 15: Volume of Tweets by Type of Link by Selected Time Period 
 
As seen in Figure 15, the majority of tweets analyzed (390/500, 78%) mention CRISPR by name 
in the body of the tweet, although CRISPR was present as a hashtag in every tweet analyzed.  When 
analyzed in the context of the results of our media discourse analysis, it appears unusual that the majority 
of tweets analyzed (65%) simply linked to a source about CRISPR without additional comment, as only 
7.4% of identified news stories contained the term CRISPR in the title.  Additionally, in Figure 15, 
newspapers are always the most shared form of link (284 out of the 500 tweets total), and only in July of 
2016 did Twitter users start linking to any other source of media in significant quantities (39 tweets linked 
to academic journals, compared to the 40 tweets that linked to newspaper articles). The 284 tweets with 
30 
 
links to newspaper articles vastly outnumbered the second most likely type of tweet – ones that contained 
no link at all (94 tweets).

 Although we hypothesized that the tone that American Twitter users would change before (Figure 
16) and after (Figure 17) major news about CRISPR is released, there were no major trends. Although the 
tone of the  analyzed tweets did slightly shift before and after a major events occurred, there were no 
persistent trends that formed throughout all time periods.

Discussion 
 
Poll Analysis 
 From analyzing the results found in the poll analysis data, certain conclusions can be found 
within each section. First, the evolution of opinions supporting genetic modification techniques was seen 
to follow a decreasing trend over three decades. Second, the poll questions that were phrased using 
positive syntax and terminology produced higher approval rates than negatively phrased questions. 
Finally, the demographics of the audience also cause differences in the amount of support that genetic 
engineering receives. Overall, it can be seen that different factors within the way polling itself is 
structured results in different outcomes due to underlying influences. 
 
Evolution of Public Opinion 
The results found by analyzing the evolution of opinion show that, although there is popular 
support for genetic engineering, support is slowly decreasing over time. Figure 1 displays this clear trend, 
starting in the mid-1990s with high public support of inheritable genetic engineering, with the approval 
percentage ranging from 44-66%, and slowly decreases over time to 4-41% in the year 2003. The waning 
support trend for genetic engineering appears in opinions on both physical changes and disease prevention 
applications. There is a difference, however, in the amount of support for each application; people are 
always less supportive of using genetic engineering for physical characteristic improvements than disease 
prevention, although that support also decreases over time. 
A possible interpretation of this decreasing trend of support could be that a greater amount of 
knowledge on the part of the public with regard to the genetic engineering technologies leads to better 
understanding of the associated risks. The more publicly known the technologies become, the more of a 
reality they become along with the risks associated with the advancements. Whereas in previous years, 
there may not have been trials and applications of these technologies, and the idea of genetic engineering 
could have been perceived as more futuristic and optimistic. However, more research would need to be 
completed in order to fully confirm this interpretation as an explanation of the results. 
 
Public Opinion Based on Syntax 
As predicted, the public was more receptive and supportive of questions that used positive words, 
categorized using Table 1. The most support was typically found in regard to applications to improve 
health, while most of the public did not support the genetic engineering applications for physical 
characteristic and appearance improvements. Support was limited for applications used for embryos or 
that would affect future offspring. These could be interpreted to reflect the morality associated with 
altering or enhancing a living being without their consent, but also due to the uncertainty of the resulting 
effects. 
These results come with some difficulty, because questions asked about the same features but in 
different ways and using different language produce different results. According to research, this variation 
in results based on language is common among poll questions and could decrease the validity of the poll 
responses (Eplett, 2013; Ferenstein, 2015). This idea is clearly shown in the significant difference 
between the results of the questions asking about support regarding genetic engineering on an embryo and 
33 
 
applications before birth. For example, the question asking “Do you think that changing the genes of 
unborn babies to reduce their risk of developing certain serious diseases should be legal?” only gained a 
support percentage of 26% while the question asking if Americans support germline therapeutic 
applications had 65% support, as seen in Figure 2 . These two statements, in biological terms, are the 
same, but the question including the word “unborn” had a lower approval percentage while the questions 
regarding germline applications had an approval percentage ranging from 26-65%. These results reinforce 
the idea that language can influence the way the question is interpreted. 
 
Public Opinion Based on Demographics 
         The results showed that certain demographic factors seem to influence the public’s opinion on 
genetic engineering, and whether there is support for or rejection of an application. Women are typically 
less optimistic about the applications than men, displayed in Figure 6, and this shows that they are more 
cautious with their acceptance and support of technologies that have possible risks to humans. Men still 
show limited support in all aspects of genetic engineering, but they are typically more concerned about 
regulatory aspects when it comes to scientific advancements (Weisberg, Badgio, & Chatterjee, 2017). 
      Religious influences skewed the support toward the conservative side because these technologies 
are seen as unnatural and “meddling with nature” (Greenwood, 2016). This limited acceptance can be 
interpreted to reflect the morality associated with all religions. In other words, the type of religious 
affiliation does not matter, but rather it is the degree of religious commitment of the individual that will 
determine the amount of support they have for genetic engineering. 
      For this project’s purposes, the poll analysis data failed to establish any correlation between 
racial identity and opinions on genetic engineering.  
 
Discourse Analysis of Media 
The findings of the analysis made on the six media sources showed results that vary significantly 
from the hypothesis made at the beginning of this study. The initial hypothesis was that right-leaning 
sources would include more negative articles than left-leaning sources. This however, proved not to be 
the case in this study. This hypothesis was made based on the notion that the right wing of the US 
political spectrum is conservative and heavily associated with conservative Christians. The poll analysis 
indicated that religious persons are much more likely to disapprove gene modification technologies than 
non-religious persons. First of all, while there are differences in the presentation of CRISPR from sources 
of different political bias, the breach is not as big as initially thought. While an initial view of the results 
may suggest the presence of more purely negative articles, once The National Review is separated as an 
outlier, the number of negative articles becomes comparative smaller to the number of articles with both 
positive and negative wording and those that are purely positive. This can be seen in the previous section 
in Figure 8, and the overall leaning of each source can be appreciated on Figure 9, also on the previous 
section. 
Second, the total number of articles that were analyzed were much smaller than expected. The 
initial number of articles found using the advanced search setting in Google returned about 460 articles 
that included CRISPR, which was then reduced by eliminating all articles that only included a link to an 
article on CRISPR or that had no relation to CRISPR. When the articles that only mentioned CRISPR in 
passing or in relation to studies that did not affect humans were removed, the total number of articles 
available for review was reduced even further. At the end, only 95 of the initial 460 articles were 
34 
 
considered for analysis (20.65%). Considering the number of articles that mentioned CRISPR in passing 
or as a reference, and the fact that over half of the analyzed articles only vaguely explain what CRISPR is, 
we can make the inference that the media may have an implied standard on the public’s knowledge on the 
subject. The consistent use of CRISPR as a reference seems even more disconcerting when the fact that it 
is only rarely mentioned in titles is taken into consideration. Further studies would be necessary to 
analyze this discrepancy and are out of the scope of this study. 
Thirdly, we can make some assumptions on the level of interest the media sources give to the 
subject based on both the number of articles as well as the investment placed on the articles. While both 
of the left-leaning sources (CNN and The New York Times) and the centrist CBS News have their own 
journalists write the published pieces on CRISPR, both Fox News and USA Today seem to outsource their 
CRISPR pieces. This can be taken as a sign that less interest and resources go into writing pieces on this 
topic. The fact that most of the articles from a different source are taken from centrist authors may also 
explain the number of mixed and positive articles, as well as the smaller number of negative articles. 
On a different note, it is important to remember that even with the pictures that are being told by 
the media sources, the public that consumes this information does not necessarily have to accept any of 
the presented information to be true. A 2016 poll by the Pew Research Center shows that public 
perception of scientists remains low, with only 40% of the American population showing a “good” level 
of trust on the scientific community (Funk & Kennedy, 2017). This opinion also changes depending on 
the topic that is being discussed, and while there are no poll numbers for human gene editing as of yet, we 
can look at other polls on types of genetic modification. For example, Americans have been polled on 
their level of trust in scientists regarding gene editing in agriculture. In this case, American’s trust in 
scientists and their claims regarding genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is one of the lowest in the 
poll, with only 37% of respondents trusting scientists’ claims about GMO safety (Funk & Rainie,  2017). 
Trust in media sources is higher, thought barely a majority, with 52% of the population “somewhat” 
trusting national media sources and 20% exhibiting “a lot” of trust (Funk, 2017). These levels of trust also 
affect how the population reacts to the articles they consume. 
 
Discourse Analysis of Social Media 
         The most striking pattern in the data found from the analysis of Twitter was that such a high 
percentage of total tweets (91%) were neutrally-toned. The initial hypothesis was that in a public, casual 
forum, the typical post about CRISPR would be one that contains the Twitter user’s own personal 
opinion, and that the tone of this opinion could be determined to be positive or negative. What was 
ultimately found was that the typical post about CRISPR made by an American Twitter user during the 
selected time periods was a link to an article with a neutrally-toned headline. 
          For Twitter posts, the format was typically the headline of the article to which the user was 
linking, followed by a URL and hashtags that related to the article (in the case of this particular analysis, 
#CRISPR). On many websites, there is a legend containing the logos of several large social media 
platforms, Twitter typically included. These logos are links to the social media websites, which, if a user 
is logged in, will create a tweet with a link to the website the user wanted to share. These “shared” posts 
have very similar formats designed for each social media platform. Oftentimes, the tweets contained 
within the category “broadcast” seemed to be the result of one of these share functions, and if not the 
result of one of them, then certainly created in a very similar fashion. The significance of this is that it 
reveals how American users appeared to have typically posted to Twitter about CRISPR through news 
35 
 
websites (56.8%), research articles (14.8%), and blogs (9.8%) they visited during the time periods 
selected. They then posted a link without adding their own opinion (325 of the total 500 tweets analyzed). 
Thus, out of the 325 “broadcast” category tweets, 299 tweets (92%) are articles that have neutrally 
intoned headlines. This is significant because these “broadcasts” are simply articles Twitter users have 
chosen to link during the analyzed time periods. 
          As American Twitter users who were discussing CRISPR during the time periods analyzed used 
links to news articles to talk about CRISPR an analysis on the discourse surrounding CRISPR on Twitter 
is only complete with the context of the American news media and how American news media discusses 
CRISPR (pages 43-44). We found that only 7.4% of the articles analyzed contained the word CRISPR in 
the title. In contrast, our discourse analysis of Twitter revealed that 390 (78%) of the analyzed tweets 
contained the word CRISPR in the body. The sharing of articles that contain the word “CRISPR” in the 
title generates tweets that contain CRISPR in the body, thus, the major discrepancy between the 
percentage of analyzed tweets containing the word CRISPR and the percentage of analyzed news with the 
word CRISPR in the title indicates that Twitter users, when choosing articles to share, are selective. 
          Further comparison between news discourse and Twitter discourse also shows that, although 
there were trends in the tone of complete news articles over time, tweets did not show any considerable 
trends during the selected time periods. For example, when the bioethics conference of December 2015 
was occurring, the majority of news articles included in our analysis were negatively-toned, while only 
6% (of tweets analyzed from December 1-24, 2015) of tweets analyzed contained negative tone. And, due 
to the prevalence of Twitter users who simply linked to articles our analysis shows that the users who 
posted tweets selected news articles with neutrally-toned headlines to share (76% of tweets analyzed 
during that time period). Only three tweets during that time period (December 1-24, 2015) even link to 
articles with negatively-toned headlines. Further research into the ways that American Twitter users select 
articles to share would be prudent, given this information, but would be beyond the scope of this project. 
A possible way to conduct this research would be to code articles that Twitter users link to during the 
selected time periods, as to gain more information as to what content people are sharing on Twitter. 
          To gather more insight into what Americans feel about CRISPR, a further analysis of the articles 
that Americans link on Twitter about CRISPR should be conducted. In particular, the prevalence of 
sources and how much the American public believes them should be investigated. Because of the 
dependence on these articles for the Twitter discourse, the content of the articles themselves are vital for 
understanding the Twitter discourse surrounding CRISPR. 
          Unfortunately, the coding instrument was not able to interpret tone effectively in every tweet, 
such as in cases of perceived sarcasm or nuanced arguments; rather the instrument focused on the 
appearance of key words and phrases. Due to the character limit on Twitter posts (140 characters during 
the selected time periods), and the tendency of Twitter users to simply repeat the headline or title of the 
media to which they were linking, the amount of nuanced arguments about CRISPR on Twitter were 
limited. Of the positively- and negatively-toned tweets, negatively-worded tweets accounted for twice the 
volume of tweets (30) than positively-worded tweets did (15). This, of course, is relative to the 455 
neutral tweets.

This coding instrument was evaluated by the three members of the team. In order to do this, the 
instrument first went through multiple drafts based on preliminary research on what was generally 
included in the articles that were to be evaluated. Once the instrument was deemed satisfactory, the team 
met and evaluated an article as a group in order to clarify any questions on the language or particulars of 
the code. Then two members were given an additional four articles to code on their own. We then 
compared each set of to insure consistency within our own analysis, and to allow for replication of the 
study using the same coding instrument. This comparison yielded a high percentage of similarity, with 
only a difference in interpretation on [TS4] article over the clarity of the definition of CRISPR, and one 
disagreement over the ambiguity of the tense in another one. Thus, the coding instrument was deemed 
acceptable and data collection was initiated.

a.       Yes 
b.       No 
3.  Does the tweet use negative words to describe CRISPR? (according to the table) 
a.       Yes

4.  What category of tweet is this? 
a.  Informational (has facts about a subject, goal is to familiarize public with information) 
b.  Community (tweets used to engage users of the community) 
c.  Action (tweet includes references to actions the reader should take in real life i.e. ‘Sign my 
petition’) 
d. Opinion (tweet is an expression of a feeling about CRISPR i.e. ‘I hate CRISPR, I have nothing 
but disdain for it.’) 
e. Broadcast (tweet does not express any new sentiment, simply broadcasting another person’s 
message, retweets without comment are all broadcast type tweets) 
f.  Inquisitive (tweet is written by the author with the intention of another person giving them a 
specific piece of information i.e. ‘@Joe6Pack What do you think of this?’, ‘How does

This coding instrument was evaluated by three members of the team by drafting a coding 
instrument based off of the coding instrument for media analysis, but then specialized for Twitter through 
the use of academic papers on the use of social media for conclusive social data (Lovejoy and Saxton 
2012). The paper recommended sorting posts into categories, of which they gave three, and three were 
invented for Twitter specifically, additionally, the topic of the tweet and whether or not the tweet had a 
link were considered. All three group members were given this revised coding instrument, and coded 15 
45 
 
pre-selected tweets picked on the basis of their diversity in topic, tone, and lucidity. When the results of 
these coded tweets were compared to test consistency, the only differences found where in the accidental 
inclusions of words that were similar to words in the table of positive and negative terms and a few 
subjective differences in category. The coding instrument was sufficiently consistent, so it was used to 
gather data.

Genetic Improvement of Software:
a Comprehensive Survey

Abstract—Genetic improvement uses automated search to find
improved versions of existing software. We present a compre-
hensive survey of this nascent field of research with a focus on
the core papers in the area published between 1995 and 2015.
We identified core publications including empirical studies, 96%
of which use evolutionary algorithms (genetic programming in
particular). Although we can trace the foundations of genetic
improvement back to the origins of computer science itself,
our analysis reveals a significant upsurge in activity since 2012.
Genetic improvement has resulted in dramatic performance
improvements for a diverse set of properties such as execution
time, energy and memory consumption, as well as results for
fixing and extending existing system functionality. Moreover, we
present examples of research work that lies on the boundary
between genetic improvement and other areas, such as program
transformation, approximate computing, and software repair,
with the intention of encouraging further exchange of ideas
between researchers in these fields.

I. INTRODUCTION
G enetic improvement (GI) uses automated search in orderto improve existing software. We present a comprehen-
sive survey of GI, summarising its scientific origins, technical
achievements, publication growth trends, software engineering
domain coverage, representations and computational search
techniques, and its relationship with other areas of source code
analysis and manipulation. As our survey reveals, evolutionary
computing is by far the most widespread computational search
technique used in the literature, making genetic improvement
a field at the intellectual intersection of evolutionary com-
putation, software engineering, optimisation, and source code
analysis and manipulation.
Recent work on GI has received notable awards, demonstrat-
ing its acceptance and success within the wider software engi-
neering and evolutionary computation communities. For exam-
ple, work on GI for software repair and specialisation won four
‘Humies’ [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], awarded for human-competitive
results produced by genetic and evolutionary computation [6].
Several papers on genetic improvement also won distinguished
paper awards [1], [5] and technical challenges [7]. GI has also
been the subject of attention from the broadcast media, as well
as popular developer magazines, websites and blogs [8], [9],
[10], [11], demonstrating its influence and reach beyond the
research community to the wider developer community and
the public at large.
J. Petke, M. Harman, W.B. Langdon, and D.R. White are with University
College London.
S.O. Haraldsson and J.R. Woodward are with the University of Stirling.
Our survey of 3132 distinct titles found, resulted in the
identification of 66 core GI papers1. However, genetic im-
provement research draws on and potentially influences many
other areas in software engineering and program analysis.
Therefore, we also reviewed the relationship between GI and
program synthesis, program transformation, parameter tuning,
approximate computing, slicing, partial evaluation and other.
We identified the first distinct publication concerned primar-
ily with genetic improvement from 1995, but we were careful
to consider the full history of the field, its influences and
origins, both before and since. For our review, we collected
and considered all publications on genetic improvement from
1995 to 2015. Since GI is an emerging area that straddles
many fields, it is neither sufficiently well-understood nor well-
defined to support a Systematic Literature Review (SLR).
Our comprehensive survey provides the foundation for
subsequent SLRs, which may use our survey to define scope
and research questions and to help identify primary sources.
Nevertheless, although our survey is not an SLR, we did
use associated techniques to ensure that we systematically
collected potentially relevant publications.
Our survey is the first comprehensive analysis of GI re-
search, drawing together its many research strands, results and
findings. As the survey reveals, the field of GI has witnessed
a rapid recent rise in publications and interest, with more than
half (59.70%) of the overall papers appearing in the last three
years (2013-2015). This indicates both that the time is ripe
for a survey, and that this rapidly growing discipline (and the
wider research communities within which it resides) needs
such a survey.
The survey is structured as follows: Section II describes the
history of genetic improvement (GI); Section III describes the
methodology used to gather core papers on GI; Section IV
provides details on existing GI research covered in the core
papers on the subject; Section V presents related work; Section
VI concludes the survey.
II. HISTORY OF GENETIC IMPROVEMENT
Genetic improvement draws on and develops research in
a number of topics including program transformation (Sec-
tion II-B), program synthesis (Section II-C), genetic program-
ming (Section II-D), software testing (Section II-E) and search
based software engineering (Section II-F).
1Criteria for classifying GI publications as core are presented in Section III
in Table I. All 66 papers are presented in the supplemental material.

We provide a brief history of genetic improvement, tracing
some of its primary origins and influences (Section II-A),
before coming right up to date (Section II-G).
A. Before Electronic Computers
The first mention of software optimisation is due to Ada
Augusta Lovelace [12], whose 1842 work2 on the analytical
engine is arguably among the most prescient pieces of science
writing ever committed to paper. Reading it nearly 200 years
later, it is abundantly clear that Ada was well-aware of the
need to optimise programs, even though none had actually
been executed at the time, and only one program (which she
had written herself) had ever been constructed:
“In almost every computation a great variety of
arrangements for the succession of the processes is
possible, and various considerations must influence
the selection amongst them for the purposes of
a Calculating Engine. One essential object is to
choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce
to a minimum the time necessary for completing the
calculation.” Extract from ‘Note D’ [12].
Clearly, Ada was aware that programs fell into equivalence
classes, and saw the possibility of optimising the choice of
a program within an equivalence class. Of course, as is well
known, the ‘calculating engine’ about which she was writing,
the Analytical Engine, was not built during her lifetime, and it
would be over a century before the first program was executed.
Nevertheless, we can trace ideas about program manipulation
and optimisation back to her observations, made in 1842.
B. Program Transformation
Two independent, yet interrelated, strands of research that
addressed the need for such program manipulation grew up in
the 1960s and 1970s: program synthesis and program transfor-
mation. Both sought to exploit the equivalence classes noted
by Ada, but in different ways. While transformation sought to
apply meaning-preserving transformations to refine an existing
program, synthesis sought to construct new program code.
Program transformation has origins in early work on com-
pilers, which used transformation to automatically transform
computations into canonical minimised forms, for either space
or time efficiency. In early pioneering work on Fortran compi-
lation, Sheridan [13] made a clear distinction between general
and specific transformations, applicable only to a particular
program instance. Sheridan noted that the general transforma-
tions allowed an arbitrary program expression to be ‘reshuffled
into some different order without disturbing the algorithm’.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, researchers sought to
understand the principles that allowed one syntactic repre-
sentation to be transformed into another, while preserving
semantic correctness, drawing heavily on the foundations
laid by Church [14] in the early 1940s. Researchers sought
to define the semantics of programming languages, thereby
2The article was published in 1843 in London as a translation of
Menabrae’s 1842 paper ‘with notes by the translator’ and is available online:
www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html.
providing a sound mathematical foundation for the theory and
practice of software development [15], [16].
A further decade would have to pass before general-purpose
declarative language transformation systems started to appear
[17], [18]. Increasingly sophisticated systems have been de-
veloped for general transformation, such as the Munich CIP
system in the 1980s [19], partial evaluation systems, such
as Tempo, in the 1990s [20], and the TXL transformation
language and system in the 2000s [21].
C. Program Synthesis
By contrast with program transformation, program synthesis
sought to construct new program code, such that the resulting
program would be correct by construction [22]. One of the ear-
liest implementations, initially constructed3 in 1961, and used
to report the results of experiments with program synthesis
was the work on Simon’s ‘Heuristic compiler’ [23].
Both early program synthesis systems and program trans-
formation systems were developed from and inspired by work
on the compilers of the day. Program synthesis has remained
a topic of continued interest and development, throughout the
1970s [24], 1980s [25], [26] and 1990s [27], to the recent
work on spreadsheet macro synthesis by Gulwani et al. [28].
Genetic improvement is closely related to both synthesis and
transformation, yet it differs from each: unlike both program
synthesis and program transformation, genetic improvement
is not always guided by the motivation of correctness-by-
construction. Frequently, software testing is used as an oracle
for correct system behaviour. In this regard, genetic improve-
ment draws on the rich heritage of genetic programming [29],
which is also generally guided by software testing, and does
not claim correctness-by-construction.
D. Genetic Programming
The first record of the proposal to evolve programs is
probably that of Turing [30]. However, there was a gap of some
thirty years before Forsyth [31] demonstrated the evolution of
small programs represented as trees to perform classification
of crime scene evidence for the UK Home Office. Although
the idea of evolving programs, particularly Lisp programs, was
current amongst Holland’s students [32], it was not until his
students organised the first Genetic Algorithms conference in
Pittsburgh that Cramer [33] published evolved programs in two
specially designed languages.
In 1988 Koza (also a PhD student of Holland) patented his
invention of a GA for program evolution [34] and this was
followed by publication in the International Joint Conference
on Artificial Intelligence IJCAI-89 [35]. Koza followed this
with 205 publications on genetic programming. (The name
‘genetic programming’ was coined by Goldberg, also a PhD
student of Holland [36].) However, it is the series of four books
by Koza, starting in 1993 [29] and the accompanying videos
[37], that really established genetic programming and saw the
enormous expansion of number of publications with the Ge-
netic Programming Bibliography4 passing 10,000 entries [38].
3Simon’s paper [23] was published in 1963, but it was an extended version
of an earlier RAND corporation technical report, which appeared in 1961.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION 3
By 2016 there were nineteen GP books including several
intended for students [39], [40], [41].
Excluding GI, genetic programming research and applica-
tions continue to be concentrated on predictive modelling,
particularly data mining [42] and financial modelling [43].
Other active areas include evolving soft sensors (particularly in
the chemical industry [44]), design [45] and image process-
ing [46], finance and the chemical industry. Industrial take
up includes bioinformatics [47], [48] and the steel industry
[49]. GP can also be found in artistic endeavours [50], [51],
[52]. It led to Draves’ Electric Sheep screen saver [53]. Such
distributed evolutionary AI ideas were in the background
which led Reynolds to his Boids technique [54] for which
he won an Oscar in 1998.
Genetic programming shares with program synthesis its
aim of constructing a working program from scratch. Both
traditional program synthesis and genetic programming are
limited in the size of programs they can generate. GI usually
starts from an existing program (rather more like program
transformation, although it makes no claim to preserve ‘perfect
correctness’). Since genetic improvement’s starting point can
be an existing program of arbitrary size, GI can tackle much
larger programs than either program synthesis or genetic
programming. Like genetic programming, software testing is
often relied upon to guide genetic improvement to the software
variant.
E. Testing and Validation
Testing is important for genetic improvement, not only
because it can be used as a guide for semantic faithfulness,
but also because it is often used to assess the degree to which
improvement has been achieved. Software testing research also
has a long history, dating back to the 1940s, when Turing
first delineated the role of ‘program tester’ from ‘program
developer’ [55]. By the 1960s it had been realised that automa-
tion was essential to manage the scale of the software testing
challenge, and the first automated test input generation systems
started to appear [56]. Test data generation systems continue
to be developed and improved throughout the 1970s [57],
1980s [58], and 1990s [59], [60].
More recently, there has been significant development (in-
cluding several breakthroughs and dramatic advances) in many
areas of testing, such as dynamic symbolic execution [61],
search based software testing [62], and mutation testing [63].
Many researchers could be forgiven for believing that testing
could never be sufficient to ensure faithfulness to the semantics
of the original program. After all, it is widely believed that:
“The number of different inputs, i.e. the number of
different computations for which the assertions claim
to hold is so fantastically high, that the demonstra-
tion of correctness by sampling is completely out
of the question. Program testing can be used to
show the presence of bugs, but never to show their
absence! Therefore, program correctness should be
proved on account of the program text.” [64]
This highly quotable aphorism of Dijkstra’s became an
‘article of faith’ in an unfortunate battle between testing and
verification that has only more recently abated [65], [66],
[67]. It is undoubtedly true that testing can never show the
absence of all bugs, but it is also highly questionable whether
any approach to program correctness can now (or could ever)
show the absence of all bugs. We already have techniques
that can prove the absence of bugs with respect to given
assumptions [68], [69], but testing will always have a role,
if only to check whether such assumptions are reasonable.
Work on genetic improvement does not assume that only
testing should be used. Indeed, the field is ripe for the in-
corporation of verification techniques to complement existing
test-based approaches. Nevertheless, a great deal of progress
has been achieved using testing alone, for both assessing
faithfulness to the semantics to be retained, and also for
measuring the degree of improvement achieved.
This raises the question as to how genetic improvement
could be so successful, yet use a combination of techniques
that would appear to be so wrongheaded from the point of
view of such illustrious forbearers. The answer may lie in
recent empirical results. These empirical results confound
some of the widely-held long-established assumptions that
were based on plausible inferences from the theoretical nature
of programming and computation.
It seems reasonable to assume that the number of programs
possible in a given language is so inconceivably large that
genetic improvement could surely not hope to find solutions
in the ‘genetic material’ of the existing program. The test
input space is also, in the words of Dijkstra, “so fantastically
high” that surely sampling inputs could never be sufficient
to capture static truths about computation. Recent empirical
results challenge both of these assumptions.
Gabel and Su [70] found that naturally occurring code (as
opposed to the space of theoretically-constructable programs)
is surprisingly repetitive. A programmer would have to write
more than six lines of code in order to create an original
code fragment not already located somewhere in sourceforge.
This is an important observation, in the context of genetic
improvement, because many of the interventions exploited by
genetic improvement consisted of fewer than six lines of code;
they are patches, fixes and minor modifications.
Barr et al. [71] found that 43% of commits to a large
repository of Java projects could be reconstituted from existing
code. This suggests that a surprising number of changes made
by humans to software systems could already be fabricated by
genetic improvement, or similar techniques that reuse existing
code as ‘mere genetic material’ to be manipulated.
These two studies provided empirical evidence that, al-
though the theoretical space of programs is extraordinarily
large, the practical space inhabited by human-developed code
is far more constrained, making it potentially more amenable
to genetic improvement than might be supposed from a purely
theoretical standpoint.
F. Search Based Software Engineering
Work on automatic inference of statically correct asser-
tions [72], has demonstrated that static truth about program
computation (in the form of assertions that hold for all

executions), can be inferred from a surprisingly small sample
of input-output pairs, in a surprisingly large number of cases.
The observation that a small amount of dynamic information
can yield static truth has also been found in other software
engineering domains [73].
Early automated testing systems [56] formulated test data
generation as a search problem within the search space of
possible inputs to the program under test. This led to the
first application of automated search to software engineering
problems [57], [74]. The application of automated search to
software engineering problems was taken up only patchily and
with arguably less interest than other engineering disciplines.
In 2001 the term ‘Search Based Software Engineering’ was
coined by Harman and Jones, in a manifesto for the application
of automated search to problems in Software Engineering [75]:
“The thesis underpinning the present paper is that
search-based metaheuristic optimisation techniques
are highly applicable to Software Engineering and
that their investigation and application to Software
Engineering is long overdue. It is time for Software
Engineering to catch up with its more mature coun-
terparts in traditional fields of engineering. ”
There had been notable contributions to the field that came to
be known as SBSE, before the term ‘SBSE’ itself was first
coined. However, this [75] was the first paper to advocate a
discipline of ‘Search Based Software Engineering’. The ‘pre-
SBSE work on SBSE’ attacked problems in software project
management [76], [77] software testing [78], [79] and, perhaps
most relevant to this survey, novel forms of GP for software
engineering problems [80], [81]. We can trace back some of
the early ideas associated with genetic improvement to the
work by Feldt [81].
Improving software with several objectives in mind is very
powerful. Indeed evolutionary computing is well-suited to
finding good trade-offs between potentially competing objec-
tives, particularly where there are many objectives. For exam-
ple, Lakhotia et al. [82] were the first to use multi-objective op-
timisation for test data generation, while Kalboussi et al. [83]
considered seven objectives when generating test cases. Simi-
larly both Mkaouer et al. [84] and Ramirez et al. [85] consid-
ered the conflict between objectives in software maintenance
when re-organising Java source code.
The years since 2001 have witnessed an upsurge in SBSE
activity, with many problems in Software Engineering submit-
ting to solutions grounded in the SBSE approach. There are
now surveys on many subareas of SBSE activity, including
requirements [86], predictive modelling [87], [88] software
project management [89], design [90], testing [62], [91], [92],
software product lines [93], and repair [94], and other evidence
of its increasing maturity as a discipline within software
engineering [95]. However, hitherto, there has been no survey
of the area of genetic improvement, which seeks to apply the
SBSE approach to software systems’ source code itself. This
survey seeks to address this gap in the literature.
G. Genetic Improvement and the Way Ahead
Although genetic improvement has a lineage that traces
back to program synthesis, genetic programming and program
transformation, it is only more recently that it has emerged
as an area of research in its own right. This emergence dates
back to the early 1990s with the work by Ryan and Walsh
[96], [97] on auto-parallelisation and the more recent work of
White et al. [98] on energy improvement. It gained impetus
with the work on automated repair [94], [99]. The term
‘genetic improvement’ emerged from a number of previous
studies [100], [101], [102], all of which shared similar goals
but with slightly different terminology (such as ‘evolutionary
improvement’ and ‘genetic improvement of programs’).
A natural question arises, why has genetic improvement
emerged only relatively recently as a separate research area?
The key in answering this question lies in the components
of genetic improvement, the necessary ingredients for which
have only recently come together in sufficiently mature areas
of activity that make genetic improvement possible. In partic-
ular, powerful test data generation techniques, an abundance
of source code publicly available, and importance of non-
functional properties have combined to create a technical
and scientific environment ripe for the exploitation of genetic
improvement.
Over most of the preceding years, software developers have
been concerned with program correctness. A lot of work has
been devoted to semantics-preserving program transformations
that were supposed to serve as building blocks for automatic
program synthesis. Secondly, one widely-discussed ‘stretch
challenge’ has concerned the creation of software from scratch,
perhaps from some higher level specification. This is so much
of a difficult challenge that many influential authors regarded
it to be simply unachievable. In 1988 Dijkstra claimed that
automated programming was a contradiction:
“(...) computing science is — and will always be
— concerned with the interplay between mechanized
and human symbol manipulation, usually referred to
as ‘computing’ and ‘programming’ respectively. An
immediate benefit of this insight is that it reveals
“automatic programming” as a contradiction in
terms.” [103]
The more recent trend of genetic improvement research has
not sought entirely automatic programming, but has consid-
erably pushed back the frontiers of the ‘interplay’ referred
to by Dijkstra, yielding to the machine, a great deal of
territory previously occupied by humans. With the abundance
of software available for ‘genetic reuse’, synthesis from scratch
seems increasingly suboptimal. Furthermore, the increasing
sophistication and power of automated test input generation,
the ability to use the original program as an oracle, and the
increasing importance of non-functional properties, have all
combined to make genetic improvement a timely approach to
automated software improvement.
Given the rich heritage on which genetic improvement
draws, it is likely that we will see hybrids emerging in future,
which draw on aspects of program transformation, program
synthesis, genetic programming, and other source code anal-
ysis and manipulation [104] techniques. Indeed, recent work
on automated program repair, a form of genetic improvement,
also uses a combination of techniques including those inspired
by program synthesis [105] and by genetic programming [2].

III. SURVEY METHODOLOGY
Genetic improvement draws on other research areas and has
only recently emerged as an independent field of research, as
presented in Section II. It uses automated search to navigate
the three-dimensional search space consisting of the amount of
improvement (over the original code), use of existing software
(in the input to the improvement framework) and preserved
functionality of the original code. Several works that lie on
the far ends of this spectrum sit on the boundary between
genetic improvement and other research areas.
Mrazek et al. [106], for instance, used cartesian genetic
programming to optimise for efficiency and energy consump-
tion. They evaluated approximations of 9-input and 25-input
median functions by means of testing, as is typical in genetic
improvement work. However, they evolved the functions from
scratch by generating the initial population at random.
Kocsis et al. [107], [108] and Burles et al. [109] proposed
to use semantics-preserving transformations within their im-
provement framework in order to retain full functionality of
the original code. Therefore, this work also fits within the
field of program transformation [110], [111] (see Section V-C
for details). Similarly, Orlov [102] and Orlov & Sipper [112],
[113] improved extant software by applying a semantics-
preserving crossover operator.
Williams [114] used six evolutionary algorithms to paral-
lelise existing code. In contrast to Walsh & Ryan [115], who
used standard GP trees, they evolved sequences of semantics-
preserving transformations. Williams [114] used knowledge
from program dataflow and dependency analysis to avoid
transformations that break functionality. Where the satisfiabil-
ity of the derived constraints could not be proven, they took
the conservative approach of assuming that the program will
not be functionally equivalent to the original if the sequence
of transformations were to be performed.
Even if code changes within a genetic improvement
framework are restricted to semantics-preserving transforma-
tions, the search space of possible software variants is still
huge [116]. Therefore, metaheuristics have typically been
applied in order to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.
Non-standard approaches to genetic improvement involve the
use of deterministic search. Sidiroglou-Douskos et al. [117],
for instance, explored the combination space of tunable
loops (whose perforation leads to an acceptable efficiency-
accuracy trade-off) with exhaustive and greedy search algo-
rithms. Tan et al. [118] tried applying all their statement-level
mutation operators until either all test cases passed or a timeout
was reached. Mechtaev et al. [119] systematically derived
candidate software repairs from a set of constraints, while
Manotas et al. [120] performed exhaustive search over small
code-level changes for improvement of energy consumption.
Given the wide range of topics that fall within the definition
of genetic improvement, we restrict our detailed analysis to
work that is most frequently associated with this new research
area. For example, although semantics-preserving methods are
extremely interesting (e.g., see work above), the boundary
between program transformation and GI is often unclear. We
identified four criteria under which we consider a publication
to be a core genetic improvement paper. These criteria are
shown in Table I. We also include position and overview
papers on the subject.
TABLE I: Scope of the Survey: criteria used to identify core
papers on genetic improvement (i.e., conference and workshop
papers, journal articles and PhD theses) published by the end
of 2015:
1) metaheuristic search is used;
2) non-semantics-preserving software variants can be
produced during search;
3) existing software is reused as input to the given
improvement framework;
4) modified software is improved over existing software
with respect to the given criterion.
In order to provide a thorough overview of core papers on
genetic improvement, we devised a rigorous procedure when
searching for relevant publications. We searched the Collection
of Computer Science Bibliographies [121] and the online
libraries of four major publishers in software engineering,
that is, ACM (ACM Digital Library [122]), IEEE (IEEE
Xplore [123]), Springer (SpringerLink [124]) and Elsevier
(ScienceDirect [125]). We used the following exact phrases
as keywords: ‘genetic improvement’, ‘software improvement’
and ‘evolutionary improvement’. We considered conference
and workshop papers, journal articles and PhD theses that were
published by the end of 2015. We call this step the primary
search.
Table II presents results of the primary search. It is split
into three parts, based on the keywords used. The first column
contains the source of the publication found, the second
column shows the filters applied, the third column shows the
total number of publications found, using the keyword and
filters provided, while the last column shows the number of
publications on genetic improvement found based on paper
title, abstract or keywords. All the searches were conducted
independently, hence there was an overlap in the publications
found. After removing duplicates, we were left with 54 pub-
lications, 40 of which cover work fulfilling all four criteria
presented in Table I, based on subsequent manual inspection
of their full text.
Subsequently, we inspected bibliographies of selected pa-
pers in order to include other publications that we deemed
relevant according to the criteria (snowballing). Given that we
selected 40 papers in our primary search, we had to look at
an estimated number of over 1000 articles appearing in their
bibliographies. In order to aid this time-consuming manual
process, we devised an automated procedure to partially re-
move duplicates (i.e., papers we had already considered in
previous searches) using pattern matching on paper titles.
Table III (‘Step 2’) shows, for instance, that we found 862
new titles in bibliographies of the 40 publications. We then
selected 34 that meet the criteria (based on abstract, title and
keywords) and inspected the bibliographies of those 34 papers
(‘Step 3’). We repeated this procedure for the selected papers
until we reached transitive closure over all references of the

tion, characteristics of the fitness function and programming

section we list several publications on genetic improvement
that give an overview of specific GI work.
IV. EXISTING WORK ON GENETIC IMPROVEMENT
The need for automated software optimisation has long been
recognised and resulted in the development of various research
areas, such as program transformation and program slicing
(see Section II for details). What differentiates genetic im-
provement from previous approaches, is its generality and
adaptability. It takes advantage of the abundance of source
code available by reusing it rather than devising a new
optimisation from scratch. Furthermore, genetic improvement
opens up a wider search space of software variants by relaxing
restrictions on program correctness.
The oldest core GI publications concern with software
parallelisation by Ryan and Walsh [96]. A resurgence of
literature in the area can be seen in the late 2000s with Arcuri
and Yao’s work on automated software repair [99], [127] and
White et al.’s work on reduction of energy consumption [98],
[128]. Success of these studies has led to a rapid uptake of
GI. This trend can be observed in the significant increase of

the number of core publications on genetic improvement since
2008, as shown in Figure 1.
Fig. 1: Number of core papers on genetic improvement by
year.
The following sections describe the typical genetic improve-
ment process in detail, drawing from the core papers on the
subject (listed in the supplemental material).
A. Preserved Properties
Improvement of software naturally implies that some aspects
change (to improve), while others remain unchanged (oth-
erwise it would be entirely different, not merely improved).
For instance, a system may become faster through GI, while
offering the same behaviour, or a bug may be fixed while
retaining existing non-buggy functionality. Therefore, to assess
the unchanged functional aspects, we need a way of capturing
software functionality that needs to be preserved.
One way of ensuring that the modified software does not
break any functionality of the original program, is to use only
semantics-preserving transformations. However, this limits the
search space of possible program modifications. Furthermore,
this approach might still produce incorrect programs. Orlov &
Sipper [113], for instance, used genetic programming with a
semantics-preserving crossover to improve existing Java byte-
code. Nevertheless, they also encounter incorrect individuals
during the evolution process:
Compatible bytecode crossover prevents verification
errors in offspring, in other words, all offspring
compile sans error. As with any other evolutionary
method, however, it does not prevent production of
non-viable offspring – in our case, runtime errors.
An exception or a timeout can still occur during
an individual’s evaluation, and the fitness of the
individual should be reset accordingly.
Relaxing restrictions on functional faithfulness to the original
program allows for a trade-off between various software prop-
erties. Sitthi-amorn et al. [129], for instance, traded efficiency
for accuracy in pixel shaders. They achieved a 67% reduction
in runtime by allowing flexibility in image fidelity with respect
to the output of the original software. An example is shown
in Figure 2.
Fig. 2: Selected result of two variants of shader simplification
software: original (left) and GI-modified (right). The inset
contains a visualisation of the per-pixel error.
Trading various software properties may prove beneficial espe-
cially in resource-constrained environments. As our co-author
(WBL) put it: “there’s nothing correct about a flat battery”.
The question remains of how to capture software properties
that need to be retained? Several core papers on genetic
improvement describe work on software transplantation, where
a feature is evolved separately from the program to which
it is later grafted. Langdon & Harman [130], for instance,
evolve, i.e. grow, a parallelised version of a part of an existing
program, called pknotsRG, used for predicting the minimum
binding energy for folding of RNA molecules. They start with
the existing program and use a combination of manual changes
to the host code and GI. The GI grows a small piece of new
CUDA code. After inserting, i.e. grafting, it into the original
code, the GI-improved pknotsRG version achieves up to a
10000-fold speedup on certain test instances. Even in this
grow and graft approach Langdon & Harman [130] needed
to capture the properties of the feature evolved that needed to
be preserved. Testing was used for this purpose.
In all empirical work that is covered by the core papers on
genetic improvement, software testing was used as a proxy
for capturing software properties that needed to be retained
(see supplemental material). If the set of test cases is all
possible test cases, then test equivalence becomes functional
equivalence. Of course, such a test set could be conceptually
infinite. Relaxing the notion of equivalence, to allow finite
test suites to be used as the faithfulness criterion with respect
to the original software, has the important technical impli-
cation that equivalence becomes computable and tractable.
Furthermore, the runtime cost of testing can be reduced by the
application of test case selection and prioritisation techniques.
Fast et al. [131] and Qi et al. [132] investigated these issues
in the context of GI-based automated software repair.
In the simplest case the number of test cases passed serves
as a fitness measure. Barr et al. [1] and Marginean et al. [133]
use the following function in their µScalpel tool for automated
software transplantation:
fitness(i) =
{
1/3× (1 + |TXi|/|T | + |TPi |T |), i ∈ IC
0, i /∈ IC
where i represents the software variant; IC is the set of compi-
lable programs; test suite T captures the desired functionality

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION 8
to be transplanted; TXi and TPi are the sets of non-crashing
and passing test cases respectively. In this case fitness(i) = 1
assumes that i preserves all the required functionality.
GenProg [3], a popular tool for automated software repair,
also uses a simple weighting scheme in fitness evaluation of
modified programs [134]:
fitness(C) =WPosT × |{t ∈ PosT | P ′ passes t}|
+ WNegT × |{t ∈ NegT | P ′ passes t}|
where C stands for the candidate patch, i.e. set of modifica-
tions, that produce program P ′ when applied to the original
buggy software; WPosT assigns a weight to the positive
test cases, i.e., those that the original program passes; while
WNegT is the weight assigned to the number of test cases
that fail when run on the original program, but pass when run
on P ′. Negative tests are weighted twice as heavily as the
positive tests. The positive test cases are intended to capture
the program functionality that needs to be preserved.
Arcuri & Yao [99] opted for a more fine-grained fitness
measure for automated software repair. In particular, they use
a distance function based on formal software specification.
It measures how far the output of the modified software is
from the expected result. Arcuri [127] implemented a similar
metric within his Java Automatic Fault Fixer (JAFF) tool. He
also used the underlying framework of JAFF to improve the
efficiency of a triangle classification program. In this case a
set of test cases satisfying the branch coverage criterion was
exercised to establish whether the modified software preserved
the desired behaviour. Arcuri [127] generated the required
test cases automatically, showing another advantage of using
testing as a means of capturing software functionality.
Genetic improvement typically modifies existing software,
therefore, the original program serves as an oracle when testing
improved software variants. Any software test generation
technique can be used to create test inputs. The output of
running tests on the original and modified software can then be
compared to guide search towards fitter individuals. The size
of a test suite capturing the desired software behaviour is thus
potentially infinite. Arcuri & Yao [99], [135] introduced the
idea of co-evolving test cases within a genetic improvement
framework. They use a genetic algorithm, generating unit
tests that pass when run on the original and fail on the
modified programs. The same approach was later adapted by
Wilkerson & Tauritz [136] who created CASC, a variant of
Arcuri & Yao’s [99] framework for C++ programs. Aside from
choosing a different target programming language, Wilkerson
& Tauritz [136] require the CASC user to provide the fitness
function, in contrast to the work of Arcuri & Yao.
It is yet unclear how to characterise test suites that
would best guide search towards improved software variants.
Smith et al. [137] conducted an initial investigation in the
field of automated software repair. They conclude that “the
quality of the patches is proportional to the coverage of the
test suite used during repair”. They also advocate that further
research is needed to fully understand the characteristics of
an appropriate test suite for automated software repair. Fast
et al. [131] proposed to use dynamic program invariants,
i.e. predicates, with testing to evaluate candidate programs
for automated software repair. Their proposed approach leads
to more precise fitness values than the traditional weighted
sum approach. Similar studies have not been conducted in the
context of improvement of other software properties.
Hitherto, in the literature, testing and semantics-preserving
transformations have been applied to capture program be-
haviour. Genetic improvement is a generalist framework and
thus allows for other approaches to be explored.
B. Use of existing software
The power of genetic improvement lies in its applicability to
a plethora of real-world software systems. Typically, GI does
not start from scratch. All work covered by the core papers
starts from an existing system [138].
In the evolutionary computation field existing software reuse
corresponds to ‘genetic transfer’.
1) Source of Genetic Material for Genetic Improvement:
The idea of using existing code is central to the genetic
improvement process. The plastic surgery hypothesis [71]
assumes that the content of new code can often be assembled
out of fragments of code that already exist. Barr et al. [71]
investigated this hypothesis, showing that changes are 43%
graftable from the exact version of the software being changed.
Within the selected core papers on genetic improvement one
can find three options for the choice of code for software reuse:
the program being improved, a different program written in the
same language and a piece of code generated from scratch.
A currently unexplored option is an import from a different
programming language than the software to be improved.
2) Code Transplants: Another area of genetic improvement
when it comes to its software reuse component arises from the
work on software transplantation. Harman et al. [139] set out a
vision for automated software transplantation in their keynote,
where they presented an overview of practices and ideas from
GI and GP that are applicable for reverse engineering.
Petke et al. [4] were the first to use the concept of code
transplants [139] in the GI context. In particular, they use
multiple software variants of the same program, namely Mini-
SAT, a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver. Code for software
reuse was taken from the MiniSAT-hack track competition
specifically designed to encourage SAT practitioners to submit
their manually-modified versions of the solver. GI-improved
variants achieved up to 17% speedup.
Barr et al. [1] took this work further and programmatically
set up a scaffolding mechanism in which genetic programming
can transform a software feature from one system to be
transplanted into another system. They automatically extract
a feature from the donor program (source) and transplant
it into the host program (target). Several experiments were
conducted demonstrating feasibility of the approach, including
a real-world example where a particular video codec was
transplanted into the popular VLC media player.
Marginean et al. [133] applied the same transplantation
technique to transfer a call graph visualisation feature from
the CFLOW program into the KATE text editor. Moreover,
Sidiroglou-Douskos et al. [140] developed a systematic trans-
plantation approach for automated software repair, reusing

fixes available in open source projects. This approach has yet
to be tried with metaheuristic search.
In the absence of the functionality of interest in existing
software, a few researchers used genetic programming to
evolve the desired feature from scratch. Harman et al. [7]
evolved a language translation feature and transplanted it into
a popular instant messaging system. Jia et al. [141] grew
a citation service and grafted it into a web development
framework; the evolved service is available online (see [141]).
Langdon and Harman [130] evolved an enhanced parallel
feature which gave up to 10000-fold speedup in the original
software when run with the evolved feature.
C. Criteria for improvement
Criteria for software improvement can be divided into func-
tional and non-functional. Ryan et al. [96], [115], [142], [143]
and Williams & Williams [114], [144] used evolutionary algo-
rithms to parallelise software. White’s 2009 PhD thesis [128]
focused on energy consumption reduction and both White and
Arcuri [127] advocated the use of GI for improvement of non-
functional properties of software. The importance of this strand
of research was re-emphasized in Harman et al.’s keynote in
2012 [101]. Since then there has been a rapid increase in
work on GI and, as shown in Figure 3, much of this work
has focused on non-functional properties.
Fig. 3: Software applications of empirical studies in core
papers on genetic improvement.
A major difficulty in non-functional software property opti-
misation lies in the measurement of the desired property. For
non-functional properties such as energy consumption, precise
measurements might simply be infeasible. However, these are
not needed for the GI approach; we only need relative not
absolute accuracy. GI only requires a fitness function that will
guide search towards desirable software variants.
1) Testing as a fitness measure: Most of the genetic im-
provement work covered in core GI papers relies on testing
to evaluate the fitness of candidate software variants. The
number of test cases passed has been the prevalent measure in
optimisation of functional properties of software systems. In
particular, Shulte et al. [145], Arcuri et al. [99], [146], Wilk-
erson & Tauritz [136], Forrest et al. [2] and Le Goues et al.
[3] equated successful software improvement with passing test
suites in their work on automated program repair.
Ryan et al. [96], [115], [142], [143] and Williams &
Williams [114], [144] used the number of test cases passed
in their work on software parallelisation.
A lot of the core GI literature is concerned with auto-
mated bug fixing (see Figure 3), improving the correctness
of programs as measured by testing. The largest body of work
revolves around the tool called GenProg [147], either directly
contributing to its development [2], [3], [5], [94], [134], [148],
[149], [150] or using it for comparison [151], [152], [153].
Other examples of program repair with GI include Arcuri et
al.’s pioneering work on small programs [99], [154], [155]
which predates GenProg, as well as Schulte et al.’s [145],
[156], [157], [158] work where the fixing was done post-
compilation on the assembly code. Wilkerson et al. [159]
compared his multi-objective approach to program repair with
Arcuri’s work. Ackling et al. [160] repaired software written
in the Python language with same principles as GenProg.
Apart from the obvious risk of creating new bugs there is
also the danger of introducing malevolent behaviour [156].
Schulte et al. used sandboxing in their work and ran tests on
a virtual machine to ensure no damage is done by the altered
software [145], [156], [157].
Most GI bug fixing work assumes that the faulty program
contains its own potential fixes [148] and assumes freedom
from typographical errors and incorrect variable names [160].
2) Other fitness functions: Most fitness functions that do
not count passing and (or) failing test cases measure some non-
functional property of software. These are dependent on hard-
ware and some of them can be handled in part by compilers,
such as memory usage. Although memory optimisation has
been studied before [161], the core papers present only a single
example of memory usage optimisation with GI. Wu et al.
[162] explored how variables and constants in the source code
can be exposed as parameters that can be tuned for the purpose
of improving memory efficiency and reducing execution time.
The most frequently improved non-functional property is
execution time. It, however, varies between systems and
hardware. The number of lines or instructions executed per
input has been considered as a system-independent proxy for
execution time [163], [164], [165]. Langdon et al. [130], [166],
[167], [168], [169], [170] report wall clock speedups.
Genetic improvement can also be applied per system and
hardware by specialising to program classes [4] or input
distributions [100], [128]. Recent advances in the mobile
device market have seen greater computational power with
increased drain on batteries. Hardware can only be optimised
to a certain extent so software must also be adapted.
An issue with energy optimisation is how the usage is
measured [171]. GI is, however, well-equipped to deal with
noisy measures such as energy consumption [172]. A number
of core papers on GI show promising results for energy
optimisation [109], [128], [173], [174] using various methods
to approximate its consumption. White [128] used simulation
and a linear model to assess the energy consumption while
Bruce et al. [174] used the Intel Power Gadget API to
approximate the usage. For both methods the software is run
in isolation to reduce noise in energy readings due to other
processes. Although Schulte et al. [173] opted to use hardware

counters and a model of energy usage to approximate energy
consumption. Similarly, Burles et al. [109] used an energy
model that is specifically made for Java bytecode to reduce
energy consumption of a function in Google’s Guava library.
Given the difficulty of providing a correct energy measure
for fitness evaluation, Harman and Petke [175] proposed to
use GI to evolve the fitness function itself for a subse-
quent GI process. This idea generalises to any non-functional
(or functional) property of software. Moreover, Johnson and
Woodward [176] proposed to measure the fitness gain, rather
than a total fitness measure, in terms of the accumulated
information at each executed step of the program. GI was also
proposed for product line engineering [177].
3) Multi-objective improvement: Optimisation of non-
functional properties might sometimes mean degradation of
other software properties. These can be either functional or
non-functional. One might, for example, significantly reduce
runtime by deleting certain software functionality, or reduce
memory consumption at the expense of increased execution
time. Given the many conflicting improvement criteria, Ar-
curi [127], White et al. [100], [128] and Harman et al.
[101] suggested the application of multi-objective algorithms.
Wu et al. [162] applied this approach to optimise both
runtime and memory consumption. However, multi-objective
genetic improvement of several non-functional properties is
still largely unexplored.
D. Search
The power of genetic improvement lies in automatically
evaluating multiple software versions in order to find ones
that satisfy the improvement criteria and preserve the desired
properties. Consider bug fixing: human programmers spend a
large amount of their time on this activity. Within the same
amount of time a GI framework can evaluate thousands of
candidate software programs. In order to explore the huge
search space an efficient search algorithm needs to be used.
Currently the state-of-the art heuristic approach for software
improvement is genetic programming, as is shown in the
supplemental material. However, we anticipate more research
in the future on the use of other search heuristics in GI.
1) Search operators: A variety of search operators has been
used in work on genetic improvement covered by the core
papers on the subject. Given that most of this work uses
evolutionary algorithms, genetic programming in particular,
they inherit similar search operators.
Lansborough et al. [178] used dynamic tracing and genetic
algorithms to remove unused features of programs. They
applied deletion operations on the binary of the program to
be slimmed. Schulte et al. [173] maintained a steady state
population, by selecting, modifying and then replacing binary
code using an evolutionary algorithm.
Forrest et al. [2] focused on software repair. They operated
on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) level by deleting, swap-
ping and inserting a statement of code. They also applied
a tree-structured differencing to minimise the final repair.
Le Goues et al. [3] extended this approach and used fault
localisation to bias the repair search. Arcuri et al. [99] operated
on the same level of granularity, but additionally co-evolved
test cases to improve their ability to produce valid bug repairs.
Wu et al. [162] used mutation testing to change logical,
numerical, arithmetical, incremental, relational and bitwise
operators in the original program. They represented program
changes with a linear chromosome where each gene (itself an
integer) represents one of the program statements or parame-
ters that can be modified by GI. Jia et. al. [179] also proposed
higher-order mutation-based GI framework to increase the
search granularity of GI.
2) Representation of Programs used for Genetic Improve-
ment: There are a number of options for representing modi-
fications to programs. These include ASTs, bytecode, and the
source code itself (e.g., treated as a text file).
In some of the early papers on genetic improvement, popula-
tions of entire programs were stored. However, as genetic im-
provement targets large programs, memory becomes an issue.
Therefore, most papers on GI currently evolve a population
of edits (also called repairs or patches) that are applied to a
single master copy of the original program. Representing just
the changes that need to be made to a program avoids storing
redundant copies of unmodified code [3], [94]. In addition,
a number of methods require access to the source code (and
operate on the source code itself), while other methods operate
directly on low-level code (bytecode or binaries).
Arcuri et al. [154] converted programs into a syntax tree
that was then evolved using ECJ, a GP system also used by
White et al. [100]. While the original code is translated into
a GP representation in ECJ, non-functional properties can be
measured when it is converted into source code [98].
Prevalent work on genetic improvement focuses on C and
C++ software, including Petke et al. [163], Bruce et al. [174]
and Langdon et al.’s [180], [181] work. They use a BNF
grammar representation of the code.
With the increasing number of parallel processors available,
there is a need to translate code for parallel processing. This
is a difficult task when done manually, so a natural question
is: can GI achieve this automatically? Early work [96], [115],
[142] described Paragen, which is designed to be language
independent. Programs were represented as tree structures
where each line of the original is a terminal [115].
ASTs are one natural approach to representing programs for
the purposes of genetic programming. pyEDB [160] (python
evolutionary debugger) used ASTs and was applied to Python
applications. However, its underlying algorithm is language
independent. Python was chosen as the modules required are
part of the standard library, including AST compilation and
modification, and tracing of execution paths. The representa-
tion is a bit string that is translated into a list of edits that
point to locations in the AST of the program [160].
Le Goues et al. [3] described GenProg, which automatically
repairs bugs, following Arcuri’s work [127]. GenProg has
generated a great deal of interest and uptake of GI and
related techniques. An important contribution of GenProg is
the choice of representation. In previous work each individual
was represented by the entire AST. Software variants in
GenProg, in contrast, are represented as patches, a sequence
of edit operations for the AST. This promotes scalability, since

the population contains edit sequences, thereby occupying
dramatically less space than full ASTs for large programs to
which only a few changes are required.
To compute each modified program’s fitness, its AST is out-
put as source code, compiled, and executed for each test case.
This is done in a sandbox environment [131]. Forrest et al. [2]
and Weimer et al. [5] represented C programs as ASTs,
but instead of targeting the whole syntax-tree with possible
modifications, they selected only the nodes on the execution
path as determined by negative test cases. By contrast Cody-
Kenny et al. used a syntax tree representation [165], [182] to
implement GI for Java programs.
GI has been applied directly to binaries as well as high level
source code. Schulte et al. [156] states that ‘binary GI’ has the
following benefits:
1) The technique is potentially applicable to any program-
ming language that compiles to assembly code.
2) Intricate repairs at the statement-level can be performed.
These include for example, changing type declarations,
comparison operators, and assignments to variables.
3) The complete assembly code language typically consists
of a small set of instructions.
Schulte et al. [157] repaired defects in ARM, x86 assembly
as well as ELF binaries, and achieved improvements of 86%
in memory consumption and 95% in disk requirements. They
report a 62% decrease in time to repair the binaries, compared
to similar source-level repair techniques. They showed that
their technique can also be applied to different languages (Java,
C, Haskell) [156] and they repaired two security vulnerabilities
[145]. Their approach does not require access to source code.
Landsborough et al. [178] removed unnecessary binary files
from programs such as the Unix echo utility. Results when
using a genetic approach were reported to be better than those
obtained merely by using a trace-based approach alone. This
allows ‘slimmer’ versions of the software to exist, with the
functionality desired by the user.
GI can either operate offline or online. Online GI modifies
software as it executes, whereas offline GI does not, instead
improving software for re-deployment. We have described
offline GI in previous sections. Online approaches include
ECSELR and Gen-O-Fix [183]. ECSELR [184] embeds adap-
tation inside the target software system enabling the system to
transform itself via evolution in a self-contained manner. The
software system benefits autonomously, avoiding the problems
involved in engineering and maintaining such properties. Swan
et al. [185], who created Gen-O-Fix, suggest that developer-
specified variation points should be used to define the scope of
improvement. Hybrid online-offline approaches were proposed
that seek to develop a set of modifications offline, based on
data collected during previous online monitoring of execution.
These ‘dreaming devices’ can then be subsequently applied for
the next online execution [186].
V. RELATED WORK
We also give an overview of work that we found during
our searches, that is either related to or can be considered as
work on GI. In our selection of core papers on GI we used
the criteria presented in Table I. The work in this section does
not conform to one or more of these expectations.
The strength of GI lies in its general applicability, and
other approaches explicitly sacrifice this generality in order
to obtain guarantees of correctness or higher success rates
within a limited range of application. A subset of previous
work also operates at a higher level of abstraction, for example,
at the architectural rather than code level. As well as restricting
generality in terms of the range of transformations that may be
applied, some research also makes assumptions that limit its
applicability to specific subdomains. For example, assuming
the availability of formal contracts written in a language such
as Eiffel [187], or the provision of handwritten imperative
structural integrity constraints [188], might limit applicability.
The field may benefit from the further incorporation of
some of these approaches within a metaheuristic framework.
Similarly, related work often employs metaheuristics, and
methods developed in GI may improve the applicability and
effectiveness of these methods.
A. Program Synthesis
Program synthesis [22] is the automated construction of a
new program from a specification. Early work in this area
aimed to provide formal guarantees of correctness, but more
recent work often relies on a test suite to assess faithful-
ness to desired semantics, in the same vein as genetic im-
provement. Balzer replaced formal specifications with natural
language [189]. By using natural language, he emphasised
the importance of the user-in-the-loop. More recently, Gul-
wani et al. [28], [190], [191], explored and evaluated example-
based program synthesis. They synthesised relatively small-
but-useful Microsoft Excel spreadsheet functions, for example,
learning useful string processing functions and table transfor-
mations that can be inserted into spreadsheets to improve them.
Traditionally, work on program synthesis did not attempt to
reuse existing code, preferring to synthesise new functionality
from scratch. However, the term ‘synthesis’ has recently been
used to refer to the addition of new functionality into existing
software, as achieved by Gulwani et al. [28], allowing for
a certain level of code reuse in a similar manner to code
transplantation and recent advances in genetic improvement.
In addition to program construction and extension, synthe-
sis also includes the duplication of functionality useful for
n-version programming [192], where multiple programs are
derived from the same formal specification. A topic closely
related to program synthesis is the Automated Design of
Algorithms [193], which uses computational search to discover
and improve algorithms for particular problems. The key
difference between genetic improvement and the automated
design of algorithms is that genetic improvement is applied
in-situ or directly to the source code while automated design
of algorithms works ex-situ, i.e., evolves an algorithm.
Within the field of genetic programming, some work has
crossed into the field of formal synthesis. Katz and Peled [194]
applied GP to synthesise mutual exclusion algorithms, verified
using model checking, as well as using testing over parametric
problems when model-checking fails to scale. They also
considered searching for test cases and software repair.

B. Software repair
An overview of all related software repair work, can be
found in the survey by Monperrus et al. [195], which also
includes software repair applications using genetic improve-
ment, and the survey of Le Goues et al. [94]. Typically,
non-GI approaches to repair make assumptions about avail-
able specifications [187], they limit the types of bug under
consideration [196], or restrict the transformations that may
be applied [105]. The advantages of such restrictions are that
they make it possible to exhaustively explore potential repairs,
or to formally verify the correctness of the repair (at least with
respect to a set of supplied test cases).
The most formal approaches rely on the availability of
specifications, typically by assuming contracts or invariants
specified in the implementation. For example, Wei et al. [187]
fixed bugs in Eiffel code by using their specified contracts.
First, they applied random testing to a large amount of
code and observed failing predicates. They then repaired the
program by restoring the relevant invariant through the appli-
cation of template-based transformations. A similar approach
to catching violated contracts is exemplified by Yu et al. [197],
who catch violated preconditions and execute different code
to correct the erroneous state. Related work was performed by
Dallmeir et al. [198]. This work and the work of Gupta [199]
assume the availability of pre- and post- conditions, and
the presence of a single error. They relied on test-based
localisation to narrow down the space of possible changes.
When specifications are unavailable, information can be
derived from the program and its test cases. The SemFix
tool [105] uses fault localisation and a Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solver [200]. It derives a partial specification
via symbolic execution and generates constraints that a single-
line fix must satisfy, while limiting potential repairs to those
captured by a set of templates inferred from human studies.
In order to preserve existing correct behaviour, a heuristic
often employed is to minimise the syntactical or semantic
change to the program. By applying recent advances in SMT
solvers, Mechtaev et al. [119] synthesised minimal patches (in
terms of their semantics) from a possible patch-space based on
fault localisation. They argued that GI tools such as GenProg
are better suited to bugs that require multiple changes to
a program. Constraint solving can also be applied in some
scenarios; for example, Samimi et al. [201] demonstrated the
use of string-based constraint solving to repair PHP code that
generates HTML. The repairs are validated using a test suite.
Concurrency bugs are a popular target for automated repair,
because the correct or desired behaviour is usually straight-
forward to infer, and the possible transformations can be re-
stricted. Jin et al. [196], [202] repaired atomicity violations and
other concurrency bugs by inserting suitable synchronisation
primitives. They relied on testing to ensure the repairs are
faithful to the desired semantics.
One common alternative to metaheuristic search over a
large space of arbitrary transformations is to restrict the
transformations to a relatively small number specified by the
instantiation of a set of templates. The templates are usually
human-designed, or may be extracted from human-written
transformations. For example, Kim et. al. [151] manually
examined 65,536 human-written patches to identify common
templates, such as a change to a method call or branch
condition. They used the templates to eliminate bugs in other
software.
Kocsis et al. [107] exploited available contracts for the Java
equals and hash methods to probe existing Hadoop code for
violations. Simple program transformations were used to repair
violations, before a metaheuristic was used to further optimise
their repairs, in order to improve the quality of hash functions.
In mutation testing, mutants are used to measure how
effective test suites are at detecting faulty programs. Debroy
and Wong [203] and Schulte et al. [204] suggested that the
same operators can be used to repair faulty programs. Debroy
and Wong employed Tarantula for fault localisation to reduce
the set of possible locations for mutation. They also considered
only programs with a single fault at a time.
C. Program Transformation
Program transformation traditionally seeks to improve pro-
grams automatically [110], [111] in order to optimise non-
functional criteria through the deterministic application of
semantics-preserving transformations, although some recent
work relies on test suites as opposed to semantics-preserving
transformations. The general application of search to selecting
transformation sequences has previously been proposed [116].
Code refactoring [205] is one form of transformation. A hy-
brid of automatic and manual transformations is demonstrated
by Meng et al. [206]. Their LASE tool identifies code edits
that need to be repeated elsewhere in a program, while taking
into account the context of the code and matching ‘edit scripts’
expressed as an AST using clone detection.
Traditional program transformation can also be achieved
using metaheuristic search [143], [207], [208]. Usually these
search-based transformations are restricted to semantics-
preserving operations. Kocsis and Swan [108] applied point
mutation to select between alternative algebraic data types that
offer varying asymptotic complexity. An approach that focuses
on the individual software engineer’s role in performing sim-
ilar optimisations is the SEEDS framework [120].
Much work optimises software by replacing heuristic com-
ponents. An elegant example is the Templar tool [209], which
employs a generative hyper-heuristic to improve energy effi-
ciency based on a simple power model, enabling the user to
specify a ‘variation point’ for the search process to specialise.
D. Parameter Tuning
Existing software may offer a set of parameters that can
be used to tune the performance of a program. A well-
known example is the extensive array of options offered by
modern compilers, a target suggested by Williams et al. [144].
Automated parameter tuning [210] can be regarded as a subset
of automated design of algorithms work where search is used
to select the best set of parameters for a given problem.

E. Approximate Computing
Improvement of non-functional properties using genetic
improvement can lead to the exploration of a Pareto front
in objective space, trading off some functionality in return
for non-functional gains. This pushes GI onto the frontier of
Approximate Computing [211].
Sidiroglou-Douskos et al. [117] introduced the notion of
loop perforation, which omits some iterations of a loop to
gain speed at the cost of accuracy. First, they eliminated
perforations that are fatal to the program, before optimising
multiple remaining perforations via a greedy algorithm. They
applied a well-defined set of transformations to the loop, much
like template-based methods discussed above.
Similarly, Hoffman et al. [212] provided ‘dynamic dials’ to
allow a user to tune the performance trade-offs, by transform-
ing static configuration parameters into dynamic code using
‘influence tracing’. They added a ‘heartbeat’ to the program
to provide feedback on its performance, and adjust the trade-
offs based on this feedback.
F. Data Structure Repair
Erroneous programs can result in invalid data structures,
corruption that may be detected by the violation of structural
integrity constraints, such as those provided by a programmer
in a repOK function. By detecting when violations occur, the
Juzi tool [188], [213] uses symbolic execution of the repOK
function to suggest repairs to the data structure and restore the
invariant in a repair that is sound but not complete. It performs
a systematic search through the variables provided.
G. Studies of Existing Code
In order to pursue research goals in genetic improvement, it
is useful to help both researchers and developers to understand
the search space. Several papers examine open source projects
in detail to investigate the assumptions of tools like GenProg.
One assumption of GI software repair tools is that the
material required to fix the fault lies within the existing
code. Martinez et al. [214] examined the code of open source
projects and examined whether code changes, i.e., commits,
contain material previously seen in the source code repos-
itory of the project. They repeated this investigation at a
line and token level, and found extensive redundancy at a
token level: up to 52% of commits are composed entirely of
tokens written by human programmers in the project. However,
they do not correlate this with bug-fixes, and redundancy at
line level is less common. Related work can be found in
Schulte et al. [204]. Similarly, Barr et al. [71] examined the
‘graftability’ of code commits, examining Apache projects at
line level. They considered the parent revision of the software,
code that was later removed, and also code available from
other projects.
H. Slicing, Partial Evaluation, and Specialisation
Program slicing [215] reduces a program to a minimal form
that retains a desired subset of its original behaviour. It can
thus be used both to optimise the size of existing software as
well as to extract a desired functionality. Traditional program
slicing required program semantics to be preserved. More
recently, observation-based slicing (ORBS) has been proposed
[216]: ORBS relaxes the functionality-preservation criterion
by using a test suite as a proxy for desired program behaviour.
In this sense observation-based slicing is a subset of GI,
where the improvement criterion is the reduction in size of
the program, and the only allowed operation is code deletion.
Closely related to slicing is the idea of program spe-
cialisation; optimising the program for an expected range
of inputs. An area of specialisation that has received much
attention in manual software development is the selection of
application-specific memory managers, typically in embedded
or performance-critical systems. Risco-Martı́n et al. [161]
profiled C++ programs and simulated the impact of memory
manager configuration on allocation and fragmentation.
Partial evaluation [217] seeks to optimise a program by
specialising it with respect to some known inputs. Both partial
evaluation and program slicing aim to simplify software.
However, the output behaviour of the input program can be
different from its slice. In partial evaluation, on the other hand,
the transformed program must return the same answer as the
original, given the same inputs. Partial evaluation can also
be regarded as a subset of GI, where the typical criteria for
improvement is software efficiency.
Programs can further be specialised for the environment
in which they execute. For example, the predominance of
mobile apps in software development has led to renewed
focus on energy consumption, and in mobile phones and
tablets energy consumption is dominated by display screens.
Li et al. [218] exploited the correlation between display colour
and power consumption in order to minimise energy usage
of webpages; they used the simulated annealing metaheuristic
to explore the space of colour transforms. In the same vein,
Linares-Vàsquez et al. [219] optimised the colour scheme
of Android apps, incorporating colour theory to reduce the
aesthetic impact of their transformations.
VI. SUMMARY
We provide an overview of research work in genetic im-
provement. With the ever growing amount and size of software
being developed, the need for automated techniques for soft-
ware improvement is paramount. Because of the abundance
of code available optimisation approaches need not start from
scratch. Furthermore, metaheuristics, such as evolutionary
algorithms, have long been shown to be successful at exploring
large search spaces such as the space of possible software
variants. Genetic improvement combines these insights to im-
prove software through the application of search. We provide a
thorough literature review of papers published between 1995
and 2015 to familiarise the reader with the key results and
concepts used in this new research area. We hope that this
survey will lead to further uptake of genetic improvement
techniques.

Saemundur O. Haraldsson is a PhD candidate in
the Department of Computing Science and Math-
ematics at the University of Stirling. He holds an
MSc in industrial engineering from the University
of Iceland. He is the primary developer of the first
live software system that autonomously uses Genetic
Improvement to fix bugs within itself. His research
interests are focused on Genetic Improvement, auto-
matic program repair in particular.
Mark Harman is currently an engineering manager
at Facebook and a part time professor of Software
Engineering in the Department of Computer Science

We present a comprehensive survey of this nascent field of research with a focus on the core papers in the area published between 1995 and 2015. We identified core publications including empirical studies, 96% of which use evolutionary algorithms (genetic programming in particular). Although we can trace the foundations of genetic improvement back to the origins of computer science itself, our analysis reveals a significant upsurge in activity since 2012. Genetic improvement has resulted in dramatic performance improvements for a diverse set of properties such as execution time, energy and memory consumption, as well as results for fixing and extending existing system functionality. Moreover, we present examples of research work that lies on the boundary between genetic improvement and other areas, such as program transformation, approximate computing, and software repair, with the intention of encouraging further exchange of ideas between researchers in these fields","['Genetic programming', 'Software', 'Software testing', 'History', 'Software engineering', 'Genetic programming', 'Software', 'Software testing', 'History', 'Software engineering']",disabled
