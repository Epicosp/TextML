"smart contracts are self-executing
contracts (generally saved on a blockchain) whose terms are directly written into lines of code [].",0
"recently, blockchain and its relations with smart contracts has received increasing attention from
media, which started to address it as “the next big thing” [], “the new black”, “the philosopher’s
stone” [] or “the new graal” [].",0
"in [], blockchain has been compared to inventions such as the steam
or combustion engine, since it is potentially able to bring benefits to a variety of everyday activities
and business processes.",0
"according to gartner’s hype cycle, blockchain is at the peak of inflated expectations, where the
enthusiasm is at the highest level possible [].",0
"nonetheless, concerns started to be expressed as well
about a massive adoption of blockchain [,–].",0

the risk is that one is so much in love with this technology that it becomes impossible for
one to objectively judge its true benefits.",0
"as stressed by adam cooper, a technical architect of the
bank of england, “[with blockchain] the focus as always should be on fulfilling user needs, not on
implementing technologies simply because they are clever or interesting.” [].",0
"the hype cycle for the insurance sector [], however, depicts blockchain technology at the
beginning of the curve connecting the technology trigger phase with the peak of inflated expectation,
meaning that this technology has not been fully explored yet in this particular sector.",0
"hence, the
questions that insurance companies are asking themselves right now are “are there clear use cases
exploiting blockchain technology and smart contracts in the insurance sector?”, “in case we want to
adopt a blockchain, what is the most suitable blockchain architecture for our needs?” and, more in
general, “is blockchain technology mature enough for insurance?”.",0
"it has been estimated that they will
need to wait about  to  years to see whether they made the right choice today by deciding to invest
or not in blockchain for their business [].",0
"the objective of this paper is to help companies operating in the insurance sector to answer the
above questions by providing an overview of blockchain- (and smart contracts-) based use cases in
such specific sector, and by highlighting strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for this
technology.",0
"the authors decided to focus on insurance because, in this sector, blockchain technology
could have a relevant impact on a variety of processes and application scenarios.",0
"notwithstanding,
it is worth observing that, despite the focus on the particular domain the authors are operating into,
many of the examples provided and considerations made throughout the paper could be helpful for a
number of other companies, not necessarily from the financial domain.",0
"in fact, the aim is to stimulate
reflections and discussions on this topic, leaving to the reader the final judgment on the actual benefits
that could come from the adoption of the considered technology in a specific scenario.",0
"the paper is organized as follows: section  provides an overview of the blockchain technology,
by presenting its key concepts.",0
"section  discusses several use cases from the insurance sector, by
mentioning prototype solutions available so far.",0
"discussion is complemented by section , which
reports a swot analysis performed on a wider context to broaden the scope of the analysis beyond
the insurance domain.",0
"finally, conclusions are drawn in section .
. how blockchain works
the blockchain (literally, a “chain of blocks”) made its first appearance in the research scenario in
, in the frame of the bitcoin initiative [,].",0
"the objective was to transfer online payments from
one party to another, without relying on intermediaries.",0
"in this context, the blockchain was acting
as the underlying ledger recording bitcoin transfers and guaranteeing, by means of cryptographic
operations, the authentication and non-repudiation of payments.",0
"even though bitcoin is, by far, the most famous cryptocurrency, it is not alone.",0
"in fact, since ,
more than  cryptocurrencies have been created [], which are being used as exchange tokens in
many different blockchain-based applications.",0
the core concepts behind the blockchain technology are reported in the following.,0
"- transactions: each cryptocurrency transfer from one subject to another is represented as a
transaction from a to b. cryptocurrency is neither a physical nor a software object, but the result
of incoming and outgoing transactions.",0
"for this reason, the blockchain keeps track of all the
transactions occurred from its birth.",0
- blocks: transactions are grouped in blocks.,0
"each block collects all the transactions occurring in
a given timeframe and keeps a reference to the preceding block (that is where the concept of
“chain” comes from).",0
"future internet , ,   of 
- nodes: instead of being stored in a centralized database, the blockchain is spread over network
computers (the “nodes”), each containing a local copy of the entire blockchain.",0
"- majority consensus: since a central authority is missing, decisions on the network are made
according to a majority consensus.",0
"each node modifies its local copy of the blockchain to make it
mirror the status of the majority of the network nodes.",0
"- mining: nodes could either passively store a copy of the blockchain, or actively take part to
the maintenance of the blockchain, in the so-called “mining” process.",0
"during mining, nodes
check previous transactions to verify whether a subject is entitled to spend a given amount
of cryptocurrency and, each time a block has to be added to the chain, solve a complex
computational-intensive mathematical problem.",0
"this problem was specifically designed to
limit the possibility for a malicious entity to manipulate the blockchain by falsifying transactions.",0
"the probability of attacks is extremely low, since adding a new (malicious) block or modify a
previously added block to the chain would require control of the majority of the network nodes
(to make them agree with the modification).",0
- wallet: people transfer cryptocurrency using wallets.,0
"cryptocurrency cannot be stored on a
physical memory; rather, it is the result of previous transactions.",0
"hence, the wallet only stores
credentials (a complex, unchangeable combination of automatically assigned numbers and letters),
which enable blockchain users to transfer cryptocurrencies they own.",0
"each wallet is associated to
one (or more) unique addresses.",0
"should a user want to send a given amount of cryptocurrency to
a peer, he/she would have to specify the recipient’s address and the desired amount, and use
his/her credentials to validate the transaction.",0
"this aspect is particularly important, since in case
of credentials loss, the cryptocurrency owned by the user would not “disappear”, but the user
would be no more able to spend it.",0
"moreover, the fact that the user validates the transaction with
his/her credentials certifies that he/she was the actual initiator of the transaction.",0
"in order to better understand how the blockchain works, it could be worth considering the example
shown in figure .",0
"in the depicted scenario, alice wants to send some amount of cryptocurrency from
her wallet (with address “xz”) to arthur’s wallet (with address “vy”).",0

"in order to
perform this check, they use their local copy of the blockchain and analyze incoming and outgoing
transactions from alice’s wallet address that are stored in previous blocks.",0
"if the message sent by
alice is valid and she is entitled to spend the money, they add alice’s transaction, together with other

they then start solving a complex mathematical problem, where they have to find a random number

"during this

"when a valid result is found, the new
block is added to the blockchain.",0
"as a result, arthur receives the money.",0
"the above example should have allowed the reader to get better acquainted with the main
characteristics of the blockchain, which make it a disruptive technology:
- decentralized validation: the validation of transactions is performed by network nodes without
the need of intermediaries;
- data redundancy: each network node has a local copy of the blockchain, which prevents
data losses;
- data immutability: data stored in the blockchain could not be modified or deleted;
- trust: cryptography enables trust between parties, since a transaction that has been validated
using user’s credentials cannot be repudiated;
- transparency: everyone could read the blockchain and the transactions stored in it.",0
"though the example in figure  refers to a transfer of cryptocurrency, application possibilities of
the blockchain are not limited to monetary assets, but could encompass a wide variety of use cases.",0
"among the early application scenarios that were explored for the blockchain, it is worth recalling
the notarial context.",0
"in fact, since the blockchain is immutable and publicly available, researchers
suggested using it for storing public records and attestations [].",0
"another domain where the blockchain
has been recognized to be able to bring significant benefits is intellectual property protection.",0
"in this
context, blockchain technology could be used to prove/certify the existence of a document at a given
time [].",0
"in contexts where, e.g., freedom of thought is threatened, blockchain technology could be
used to store information in order to avoid censorship []: in fact, everyone can write information on
the blockchain and read it.",0
"as time has passed, researchers have realized that the blockchain could also be used to store other
kinds of assets, including pieces of code.",0
"it was the birth of “smart contracts”, i.e., small programs
stored in the blockchain and programmed to autonomously behave in a given manner when some
conditions are met.",0
"the idea of a smart contract has been known since the s [], but it was only with the blockchain
technology—and, in particular, with the ethereum blockchain (probably the most famous blockchain
after bitcoin)—that smart contracts were able to unleash their full potential [].",0
"with a smart contract, a person could, for instance, encode his/her will in the blockchain in the
form of a set of rules.",0
"in case of death, the smart contract could then automatically transfer the testator’s
money or other kind of assets to the beneficiary.",0
"the testator may also provide additional constraints,
such as enabling the transfer only when the beneficiary reaches the age of majority, when he/she
obtains a diploma, etc.",0
"since smart contracts’ conditions are based on data stored in the blockchain, they need to rely
on external services, which take data from the “real” world (e.g., from death records) and push them
to the blockchain (or vice versa).",0
these services are referred to as “oracles” [].,0
"by considering
the testator’s example, an oracle could inspect death records to identify whether the person passed
future internet , ,   of 
away.",0
"if so, it could write this information on the blockchain (e.g., by changing the value of a boolean
variable indicating whether the person is alive or not).",0
"the smart contract, then, would trigger a
conditional statement (based on the value of the variable), and execute the block of code initiating the
money transfer.",0
"based on the type of information collected and on the interaction with the external world, oracles
have been grouped into “software”/“hardware” oracles, and “inbound”/“outbound” oracles [].",0
"software oracles are in charge of extracting information mainly from web sources, whereas hardware
oracles are meant to extract information from the physical world (e.g., through sensors).",0
"inbound
oracles insert information in the blockchain, whereas outbound oracles allow smart contracts to send
information to the external world (e.g., letting hotels’ intelligent lockers unlock themselves as soon as
a person pays for a night).",0
"oracles have a huge responsibility in the correct execution of smart contracts, as the insertion
of wrong information could trigger a money transfer without possibility of refund.",0
"thus, there are
companies that have developed oracles that certify the authenticity of extracted data for a small
cost [].",0
"in some cases, it could be worth relying on more than one oracle, e.g., by considering a
situation as “happened” if  out of  oracles confirm it [].",0
"recently, an even more complex application of smart contracts and oracles was proposed, which
is associated to the concept of decentralized autonomous organization, or daos [].",0
"in this context,
smart contracts are used to encode rules to govern an organization, e.g., how decisions are taken,
the weight of each member’s vote, etc.",0
"the advantage is that no external party is required to verify
that the organization is properly managed, and underlying rules can be verified by the wider public,
ensuring transparency and trust.",0
"from the architectural point of view, it is worth remarking that there exist different types of
blockchains, which differ in terms of read/write permissions.",0
"“public blockchains” (such as the bitcoin
blockchain) are blockchains that could be readable and potentially writable by everyone.",0
"“private
blockchains” are blockchains that could be written only by organization members.",0
"read permissions
can be either restricted to the organization, or made public.",0
"in “consortium blockchains”, a set of
selected nodes belonging to different institutions control validation, and the blockchain is used to
share information among participant institutions.",0
"public blockchains are particularly useful when
no central entity is available to verify a transaction, and full decentralization is needed.",0
"private
and consortium blockchains provide some advantages, such as lower validation costs and shorter
validation times (given the fact that, because of the smaller number of nodes, the mathematical problem
can be simplified), reduced risk of attacks (since nodes that validate transactions are known) and
increased privacy (as read permissions could be granted only to selected nodes).",0
"furthermore, in case
of errors or bugs in smart contracts, private and consortium blockchains could extraordinarily modify
or revert previous transactions.",0
"the choice of the type of blockchain to adopt should be based on the amount of decentralization
required, and on time/cost constraints [,].",0
"eventually, some hybrid solutions, exploiting cross-chain
exchange layers between public and private blockchains, could be exploited [], e.g., by using a
private blockchain for a company’s backend activities and a public blockchain for receiving/sending
money from/to customers.",0
"finally, it must be underlined that, when selecting the blockchain to
use, one should pay attention to avoiding decentralization for the sake of itself.",0
"in fact, a number of
companies’ processes are currently managed in a successful way using relational databases, and the
switch to a (private) blockchain could not be worth the effort [,].",0
"with respect to private blockchains
versus centralized databases, experts argue that “the biggest advantages of private blockchains in
comparison to centralized databases are cryptographic auditing and known identities.",0
"nobody can
tamper with the data, and mistakes can be traced back” [].",0
"others suggest that a blockchain could be
a solution more suitable than a database only in case a company “plans to start privately and evolve
into a regular public blockchain for public cross-verification as demand/volume grows” [].",0
"blockchain applications in insurance: selected use cases
as illustrated in the previous section, advantages of blockchain are various.",0
"could write qualifications achieved by a person on the blockchain; human resources staff could
then easily obtain information about when and where a given competency was obtained.",0
"a rather comprehensive overview of applications developed in each of the above sectors can be
found in [,].",0
"what should be evident from the above list is that benefits deriving from the adoption
of blockchain technology are not limited to a single sector/scenario.",0
"moreover, even within a given
sector, blockchain can have different impacts considering the various stakeholders operating in it, their
business models, their needs, etc.",0
"in the following, the attention will be specifically devoted to the insurance sector, where the
use of blockchain could positively affect different internal processes (from customer acquisition
and management, to frauds prevention, etc.)",0
"and could even allow companies to reach new
markets [,,,].",0
"in particular, a selection of use cases that could potentially benefit from blockchain
technology will be introduced.",0
"for some use cases, prototype implementations have already been
developed.",0
"in other cases, the use of blockchain has been only analyzed from a theoretical point of view.",0
"for each use case, advantages, disadvantages and impact on the insurance domain will be discussed.",0
".. improvement of customer experience and reduction of operating costs
in this use case, blockchain and smart contracts could be exploited to increase the speed of claim
processing as well as to reduce the costs (and mistakes) associated with the manual processing of
claims.",0
"from this perspective, a smart contract could encode the rules for enabling the transfer of
refund from the company to the insured.",0
"a simple application could consist of triggering an automatic transfer of refund only if the
customer repairs the car at a certified mechanic, with the mechanic sending a transaction to the smart
contract to prove its identity.",0
more complex use cases could also involve oracles to gather information from the real world.,0
"to make an example, in crop insurance an oracle could periodically check weather data and push this
information in the blockchain.",0
"a smart contract could then read these data, and trigger a payment in
case of persistence of bad weather.",0
"these problems have been dealt with, for instance, in the prototype presented in [].",0
"in this case,
the focus is on travel insurances, and the idea is to exploit a smart contract developed on the ethereum
blockchain for automatically refunding travelers if their flight/train was delayed.",0
"another interesting use case, which could widely benefit from the increasing diffusion of sensors,
is the exploitation of smart contracts in combination with iot.",0
"for instance, homes could be equipped
future internet , ,   of 
with sensors that can directly notify a smart contract of a damage (e.g., damp sensors could be used to
monitor damages on the roof) [].",0
"similarly, smart appliances could automatically monitor their state,
and initiate a claim or directly contact the repairer for a quicker assistance when needed.",0
"solutions such as the ones envisioned above bring benefits to different actors: to the insurance
company, which could reduce the amount of resources normally devoted to claim processing, but also
to customers, who would receive money even before having become aware of the damage.",0
another advantage would come from the fact that everyone could inspect the smart contract.,0
"that is, the customer undersigning a policy would get a clear idea of its contractual conditions (even
though, at the moment, he/she should master some programming skills in order to understand
the smart contract code).",0
"consequently, it would become easier for him/her to compare policies.",0
"furthermore, the choice of a policy would no more based only on how much he/she trusts a given
company (since trust would be implicitly guaranteed by the smart contract), but on objective data.",0
"despite these advantages, it must be said that the scenario above could be adopted only for a
limited number of policies.",0
"in fact, the majority of claims processed by insurance companies still need
to be evaluated by an external expert before being settled.",0
"in case of manual processing, however,
the customer experience could still be improved by managing payments in cryptocurrencies, whose
transfer would be quicker than with traditional methods (several seconds or minutes depending on
the blockchain used).",0
"from the architectural point of view, probably the most suitable choice is to adopt a combination
of private and public blockchains.",0
"the private blockchain could be used to record policies and
claims data, whereas the public blockchain could be used to trigger the refund in terms of tradable
cryptocurrencies (such as ethers or bitcoins).",0
"the private blockchain could be maintained by trusted
company’s computers/nodes characterized by lower mining costs with regard to those of public
blockchains.",0
"the public blockchain would be maintained by the wider public, through the mining
incentives presented in section .",0
"alternatively, the company could decide to exploit only a public
blockchain.",0
"this choice could be successful in case the company needs to improve its own reputation
and obtain customers’ trust (as the process would be fully decentralized), but would imply higher
transaction costs.",0
".. data entry/identity verification
the cryptographic mechanism underlying the blockchain could be used to reduce the overhead
related to manual data entry and verification of new customers [].",0
"with the blockchain, customers would be identified by a unique address (e.g., the one linked to
their wallet).",0
"the first time they use a service, a certified intermediary would verify their identity and
link it to their address.",0
"from that time on, every time they undersign a policy, they would no more
need to provide an identification document; rather, they would only need to use their credentials.",0
"benefits of this use case could be seen again in a reduced time and cost to gather/provide
information.",0
"nonetheless, this use case also has some relevant drawbacks the company should be aware of.",0
a first drawback is related to the possible loss/steal of credentials.,0
"as said, since the blockchain works
without intermediaries, no one could reset users’ credentials.",0
"a solution could be to rely on external
services, which could store credentials and return them to the users in case of loss.",0
"however, using such
services would mean providing someone else access to one’s sensitive information.",0
"another drawback
is linked to the fact that the current legal regulations should be modified to include blockchain-based
identification, and some governments could refuse to approve this type of identification, e.g., due to
mistrust in the technology.",0
"from the architectural point of view, companies deciding to exploit blockchain-based know your
customer (kyc) could rely on external services running on public blockchains.",0
"in fact, some kyc
services recently appeared, offering some prototypes based on existing blockchains.",0
"one example is
civic [] (based on the bitcoin blockchain) and kyc legal [] (exploiting the ethereum blockchain).",0
"future internet , ,   of 
such companies already built a network of validators, which receive a reward for each performed
validation and charge small fees to companies requiring their services.",0
".. premium computation/risk assessment/frauds prevention
in this scenario, the blockchain is used to let multiple certified intermediaries record information
related to a person (by linking them to his/her address).",0
"a smart contract could read all the information linked to a person and automatically compute the
premium and perform risk assessment, based on his/her physical health, driving behaviors, etc.",0
another application scenario is represented by fraud prevention.,0
"in this scenario, a smart contract
could analyze collected data and identify frauds during claim processing (e.g., by crossing data related
to a person’s previous claims).",0
"a scenario such as the one depicted in the above examples, however, could be difficultly realized in
the short term.",0
"in fact, it implies that each person possesses a unique blockchain address (as presented
in section .",0
"), and requires the active involvement of different actors (insurance companies, police
officers, medical staff, etc.)",0
"as the quality of the results would be a consequence of the quality and
quantity of data stored in the blockchain.",0
"privacy is another relevant issue (especially for what it
concerns medical records).",0
"in this view, in the construction of such a system, a thorough attention
should be devoted to let only selected actors link information extracted from the blockchain to
a person’s identity.",0
"furthermore, particular care should be devoted to the definition of common
standards to record the information, in order to enable interoperability.",0
the most suitable architecture for this use case is a consortium blockchain.,0
"the blockchain would
be maintained by selected nodes of the consortium, e.g., belonging to the different actors involved.",0
the limited number of trusted nodes would increase security and privacy.,0
"furthermore, the blockchain
would keep track of the sender of each transaction.",0
"finally, being controlled by a small number of
nodes, mechanisms to revert blockchain state in case of transactions erroneously made (e.g., a driving
infraction notified to the wrong person) could be devised.",0
".. pay-per-use/micro-insurance
smart contracts- and blockchain-based payments could enable new revenue sources, such as micro-
and pay-per-use insurances.",0
"though in the past micro-insurances were threatened by administrative
costs, the exploitation of smart contracts could enable quick and cheap policy undersignment and
management (even on mobile devices) [].",0
"similarly, pay-per-use insurances could become a praxis,
possibly in combination with iot solutions for automatic undersignment.",0
"for instance, gps data could
be used to automatically collect, e.g., a travel premium only if the customer is abroad, a car premium
only when the car is moving, etc.",0
"pay-per-use mechanisms could be exploited in services such as uber
or airbnb, e.g., activating the service when a customer is picked up or hosted.",0
"with respect to the other use cases described in the paper, from the point of view of actors and
technology to be involved, this is probably one of the quickest and easiest to be realized (because of
the limited number of involved actors, and because the feasibility of prototypal solutions has already
been demonstrated []).",0
"moreover, from the point of view of the insurance company, introducing
blockchain-based pay-per-use insurances (which could be even paid by using cryptocurrencies) could
bring a competitive advantage, especially attracting young, technology enthusiasts.",0
"concerning architectural choices, companies aiming at addressing pay-per-use insurance could
rely on a public blockchain.",0
"in this way, a smart contract could collect money from customers (e.g.,
ethers or bitcoins), keep them until a given date and transfer them to the insurance company if
no damage occurs.",0
"being on a public blockchain, everyone could inspect the smart contract code,
increasing trust between parties.",0
"in this context, smart contracts could represent an important innovation, as they would enable
the creation of daos, where self-insured groups’ functioning rules could be hard-coded.",0
"a prototype solution named dynamis and based on the ethereum blockchain has already
been implemented [].",0
"this solution aims to provide supplemental unemployment insurance for a
community of self-managed people in terms of underwriting and claims acceptance and processing.",0
"even though in peer-to-peer insurance the blockchain could really become the key technology,
from the insurance company’s perspective it must be underlined that the objective of peer-to-peer
insurance is the removal of intermediaries (i.e., the insurance companies themselves).",0
"hence, a wise
choice insurance companies could make here is to recognize this risk, and turn it from a threat into a
business opportunity, e.g., by providing the infrastructure for peer-to-peer insurance.",0
"from the architectural point of view, since this scenario requires a high amount of decentralization,
a public blockchain would be more suited.",0
"it should be underlined, however, that the adoption of peer-to-peer insurance models by the wider
public is not imminent yet.",0
"in fact, apart from a small amount of technology enthusiasts who aim at
reducing insurance costs, a high number of customers still considers the interaction with intermediaries
important and worth of extra costs [].
. a swot analysis
the above discussion should have provided the reader with a broad overview of potential
applications of blockchain technology in the insurance sector.",0
"as seen, advantages appear to
be numerous.",0
"nonetheless, only a few prototypes exist so far, and it has been estimated that
blockchain-based applications will be available to the wider public only in – years [].",0
"starting from the considerations drawn in section , in the following a swot analysis
summarizing advantages and disadvantages of this technology is provided (table ).",0
"the objective
here is to abstract from the specific domain considered, i.e., insurance, and to perform an analysis,
which could potentially be helpful in a variety of contexts/sectors.",0
"the strengths of blockchain technology are mainly related to the technological aspects presented
in section .",0
"by removing intermediaries, the cost of money transfers can be lowered (e.g., bank
commissions cease to exist).",0
"transfers can also be made faster, as cryptocurrencies are directly moved
from a wallet’s address to another without intermediate steps (as it usually occurs, e.g., in overseas
bank transfers).",0
smart contracts provide a high degree of automation.,0
"transparency is guaranteed as
well, as the blockchain could be accessed worldwide.",0
"the underlying cryptographic mechanism guarantees that
data are not modified and that transactions could not be repudiated.",0
"finally, the replication of the
blockchain on each network node ensures that the blockchain would survive to unexpected events.",0
"the most relevant weaknesses are related to scalability, energy consumption and performance.",0
"in fact, at present, the number of transactions that could be handled per second is extremely
low when compared to traditional systems (mainly because of the computational power required to
validate new blocks).",0
"if, at the present time, blockchain-based transactions are quicker than traditional
bank transfers (on average they require few seconds to several minutes, instead of – days), for instant
payments and for other kinds of applications, performance should not be adequate to needs.",0
"in this
respect, it is worth outlining that some blockchain platforms are changing the process of validating
blocks, reducing the complexity of the mathematical problem to be solved and restricting the possibility
to perform mining only to a subset of trusted nodes.",0
"apart from time, space is also an issue, since
future internet , ,   of 
data are replicated on each network node.",0
"to make an example, the bitcoin blockchain requires more
than  gb of storage on each network node [].",0
"in addition, the amount of energy consumed
by network nodes, and the cost of the hardware required to validate new blocks is extremely high,
estimated around $ per transaction [] (though it must be underlined that several initiatives to limit
the amount of consumed energy are currently under development []).",0
swot analysis of the adoption of blockchain.,0
"- availability of a huge amount of
heterogeneous data, pushed in the
blockchain by different actors
threats
- could be perceived as unsecure/unreliable
- low adoption from external actors means
lack of information
- governments could consider blockchain and
smart contracts “dangerous”
- medium-long term investment
- not suitable for all existing processes
- customers would still consider personal
interaction important
the fact that, once information is encoded in the blockchain, it is immutable and accessible by
everyone is another weakness, and could harm users’ privacy.",0
"to make an example, everyone could
check the amount of money owned by a person, by analyzing his/her incoming transactions.",0
"should
other types of information be stored in the blockchain (e.g., medical records), this issue would become
even more relevant.",0
"to cope with privacy issues, some solutions to anonymize payments/transactions
have been proposed [–].",0
"the immutability and self-execution of code could be another weakness for blockchain, since
smart contracts could become “candy for hackers” [].",0
"in fact, hackers could exploit bugs in smart
contracts to steal money, as it recently happened on the ethereum network, where, in the most famous
attack of this kind, around $ million were “stolen” in june .",0
"even assuming that smart contracts
are free of bugs, some applications would still need external oracles to inject information in the
blockchain.",0
"the weakest point, in this case, would become the oracle.",0
"as said, the consequences of
injecting in the blockchain wrong information could be partially mitigated by relying on more than
one oracle, each getting information from different sources.",0
"apart from technical aspects discussed above, other weaknesses affect blockchain usability.",0
"first
of all, the impossibility to receive assistance in case of credentials loss (even though this weakness
could be partially removed by relying on trusted services, as explained in section ).",0
"another aspect
is cryptocurrencies volatility, which could become a limitation to the adoption of blockchain-based
payments.",0
"in fact, given the fact that cryptocurrencies are subject of speculation and considering
future internet , ,   of 
that technology is not fully mature yet (and bugs frequently appear), value of cryptocurrencies show
huge fluctuations.",0
"another weakness is related to the fact that development tools are still in an early stage,
and standards for developing blockchain-based applications have not been defined yet.",0
"finally, it is worth remarking that, in some cases, blockchain would not be the most suitable
technology to use, as existing, well-mastered alternatives would enable the achievement of comparable
results [].",0
opportunities are mainly related to whether the market would embrace the technology or not.,0
"at the present time, interacting with the blockchain requires some technical skills (e.g., mastering
the concept of blocks, installing a wallet, etc.).",0
"several efforts are currently carried out in order to
reduce/hide the complexity behind the technology (e.g., the development of browser plugins which
let users easily inspect the ledger [], the creation of user-friendly wallets [], etc.).",0
"should the above
initiatives be successful, companies providing blockchain-based applications and services (and, in the
insurance market, companies offering blockchain-based policies) could have a competitive advantage.",0
"this advantage would become larger in case of an increasing diffusion of iot, as smart contracts could
be coded to autonomously make decisions based on data acquired by sensors [–].",0
"another opportunity is related to the possibility to address new markets and create new types of
services, mainly by leveraging daos and low transactions fees.",0
"blockchain could be successfully used
to support the sharing economy, from car and house sharing [] to disk storage rental [] (and, in an
insurance scenario, to support micro, on-demand and peer-to-peer insurances).",0
"finally, should a high number of actors write data on the blockchain, innumerable new
applications could appear.",0
"as a matter of example, a person’s previous medical history could be easily
retrieved by doctors in case of urgency; blockchain could become a repository of medical data which
could be used by research scientists; blockchain-based supply chains could be more efficient as data
could be shared nearly instantaneously among heterogeneous involved actors; in an insurance scenario,
data could be used for frauds prevention, policies personalization, etc.",0
"nonetheless, the type and
impact of these applications would be a function of the amount and quality of information recorded.",0
threats are linked to different external causes.,0
"first of all, there is still a risk that the market
distrusts this technology, perceiving it as unsecure or unreliable, due to bugs, cryptocurrencies
volatility, etc.",0
"other actors could think that it is too complicated, and the adoption rate on a worldwide
basis could be low.",0
"as a countermeasure, such actors should receive a suitable training to be made
aware of the advantages of this technology.",0
"alternatively, efforts could be carried out to hide the
underlying complexity.",0
"particular attention should be paid to legal regulations, which could threaten the adoption of
blockchain.",0
"for instance, the regulation of the use and jurisdiction of smart contracts is still under
debate.",0
"to make some examples, there could be situations in which the outcome of a smart contract
would not be considered as legal by a court under existing laws (e.g., a smart contract regulating
transactions of illegal goods) [].",0
"similarly, there could be situations where hackers exploit smart
contracts bugs to steal money.",0
"some governments could consider blockchain and smart contracts too
“dangerous”, thus resulting in a limitation of the adoption on a larger scale.",0
"concerning practical aspects, blockchain-based applications are a medium- to long-term
investment, and they could not be suited for integration in all the existing processes.",0
"in fact,
as previously discussed for the insurance sector, some claims would still need to be manually processed,
as not all the damages could be evaluated by sensors.",0
"finally, should blockchain technology become a praxis, it could impact on companies’ relationship
with their customers.",0
"first of all, some customers could refuse to adopt it, as they might still consider
the personal interaction important.",0
"similarly, companies that invested in human capital to offer a
good customer service could lose market share, as the competition could be moved from the quality of
service provided, to its price.",0
"conclusions
blockchain is receiving an ever-growing attention from research and industry, and is considered
a breakthrough technology.",0
"the increasing enthusiasm reported in the media, however, could bias
an objective evaluation about whether to invest or not in this technology.",0
"the risk is that a company
decides to embrace blockchain technology because it is fascinating, without reflecting on whether it is
mature enough for an adoption in everyday activities, and by a wider public.",0
"to help companies reduce the risk of chasing decentralization for the sake of itself just because
blockchain is now under the spotlight, in this paper we presented an overview of potential applications
and use cases of blockchain and smart contracts in the insurance sector.",0
"we also drafted a more general
swot analysis of blockchain, which could be potentially applied to a variety of other sectors.",0
"we decided to focus on insurance because this is a sector where blockchain has not been fully
explored yet and in which blockchain could have a relevant impact on several processes and application
scenarios.",0
"hence, use cases in this sector could be helpful in identifying advantages and disadvantages
of the technology itself.",0
"the considerations made throughout the paper helped us answer the key questions reported in
the introduction.",0
"concerning question , “are there clear use cases exploiting blockchain technology and smart
contracts in the insurance sector?”, at the present time a number of use cases and prototype solutions
have been devised in this sector.",0
"in particular, blockchain and smart contracts could be successfully
used to speed up claims processing and reduce operating costs.",0
"in another scenario,
data entry/identity verification, the blockchain could be used as the infrastructure to verify a person’s
identity.",0
"people’s identities could be linked to a blockchain address; then, each time a person needs
to be verified (e.g., to open a bank account), he/she could send a signed transaction from his/her
address, by proving he/she is the address’ owner.",0
"in the context of premium computation/risk
assessment/frauds prevention, the blockchain could act as a shared ledger recording a person’s
previous history (previous claims, committed infractions, medical history, etc.).",0
"insurance companies
could rely on these data to identify frauds, or to automatically compute the premium of a policy.",0
"in the scenario of pay-per-use/micro-insurance, blockchain and smart contracts could be used to
automatically activate/deactivate policies and covers, based on data collected by sensors.",0
"concerning question , “in case we want to adopt a blockchain, what is the most suitable
blockchain architecture for our needs?”, as presented in section , the architectural solutions should
be chosen based on the company’s decentralization needs.",0
"in general, for the backend a private
blockchain may be sufficient.",0
"private blockchains have been frequently demonized, since using an
instrument originally born to foster decentralization in a fully centralized environment may seem a
contradiction.",0
"nonetheless, they have the advantage of keeping track of the sender of a transaction and
of all the previous occurred transactions, reducing the risk of data tampering.",0
"furthermore, together
with smart contracts, they could be used to increase the automatization of existing tasks.",0
"in case
multiple institutions need to access data, a consortium blockchain may be preferable.",0
"this blockchain
could be maintained by nodes belonging to the different institutions of the consortium, and could be
used as a shared ledger.",0
"finally, public blockchains could be useful to manage (automatic) payments
with existing cryptocurrencies, or when there is the need to provide trust (using an unmodifiable
ledger) between parties.",0
"concerning question , “is blockchain technology mature enough for insurance?”, while we
believe that blockchain is a tremendous invention that could have an impact similar to the world wide
web in the s, we also think that this technology still needs several improvements before becoming
future internet , ,   of 
mainstream.",0
"the reasons behind this statement are various: first of all, a current limitation of existing
(public) blockchains is scalability.",0
"in fact, the number of transactions per second is low, and the network
frequently suffers congestions.",0
"in a pay-per-use insurance scenario, these facts would translate into
long waiting times before the desired policy cover is actually activated (and, what if an accident occurs
while the transaction activating a cover was waiting for validation?).",0
"second, a winning blockchain is still missing.",0
"that means that a company could develop an
application exploiting a given blockchain, and discover after few years that the chosen blockchain is
no longer supported by the wider network.",0
"using a public blockchain supported by few nodes could
increase the risk of attacks (as few nodes could control the majority of the network).",0
"third, the interaction with the blockchain is still complex for the “average user”.",0
"mastering the
concepts of wallet, transaction, mining, etc.",0
requires some technical background.,0
"at the same time,
bitcoin has frequently been associated with a pyramid scheme or a fraud.",0
"as a consequence, there
is still a lot of misinformation on blockchain, and people could still prefer “traditional” applications
rather than decentralized ones.",0
"furthermore, cryptocurrency volatility (which sometimes is driven by
media news) could scare the potential users of decentralized applications.",0
"finally, the resources and best practices to develop a free-of-bugs smart contract are still insufficient.",0
"smart contracts frequently experience attacks, in some cases with disastrous consequences [].",0
"this
aspect could especially threaten peer-to-peer insurances, which would widely rely on smart contracts
for their governance.",0
"for the above reasons, we do not expect blockchain-based insurance applications to appear in the
very near future.",0
"it must be said, though, that the blockchain community is devoting great efforts to improving the
above weaknesses.",0
"regarding scalability, lightning network (for bitcoin) [] and raiden network
(for ethereum) [] are currently under development.",0
"both solutions are investigating how to mix
online and offline transactions, in order to reduce mining costs and time.",0
"concerning easing the
interaction with the blockchain, some applications that let users easily interact with blockchain-based
applications using their browsers or mobile phones are currently under development [,].",0
"concerning smart contracts security, bug bounties programs are more and more frequent, and a
wide community of blockchain white hat hackers is currently being created [].",0
"once the above initiatives are successful, blockchain technology could be gradually inserted in
everyday lives.",0
"in the meantime, insurance companies are strongly suggested to start investigating it,
by acquiring the required competencies, and by creating some prototype solutions.",0
"such prototypes
could be useful to evaluate how existing processes would be influenced and to what extent this
technology would be accepted by the staff or by customers.",0
"what is clear already is that blockchain is bringing a radical transformation to the way we act and
think, and we all should be prepared for this change.",0
"author contributions: the paper was prepared by all the five authors, which were involved in a study of
blockchain technology in the insurance sector.",0
all the authors equally contributed to the manuscript.,0
"valentina
gatteschi focused on technical aspects related to blockchain and on state of art approaches and applications,
under the guidance of prof. fabrizio lamberti and prof. claudio demartini, who also provided assistance while
shaping and revising the paper.",0
"chiara pranteda and víctor santamaría provided their knowledge of the insurance
sector and helped developing the discussion on insurance-related use cases as well as revising the paper.",0
conflicts of interest: the authors declare no conflicts of interest.,0
the work mentioned in this paper should be assessed accordingly by the readers.,0

need for an information technology system that can remove the middlemen and cut costs while maintaining trust and
transparency.",0
"the blockchain is a revolutionary technology which can assist in solving the challenges of healthcare by
providing decentralized trust.",0
"blockchain-enabled decentralization promises to minimize the problem of vendor lock-in
that has plagued the healthcare industry.",0
"patient data is scattered across different entities in the value chain of the healthcare industry referred to as data silos and
sharing of data is prone to a multi-level process of permission control.",0
"because of this, oftentimes crucial data is not
accessible and available at the time of urgent need.",0
"blockchain can solve this issue with health information exchange
(hie) by serving as a basis for a trusted decentralized database.",0
"it can enable one-stop access to the entire medical
history of a patient across all healthcare providers.",0
"access control system built using trust on blockchain puts patients
in control of their data; they can grant consent and access rights to external parties like researchers to have access to all
or subset of their medical records.",0
"this feature fits nicely with the patient-centric model of healthcare where blockchain
can act as a catalyst inducing trust.",0
the records written on the blockchain are immutable and cannot be altered or deleted.,0
"this characteristic of blockchain
provides primitives like data integrity and provenance which can be used to build solutions to prevent drug counterfeiting
and medical frauds.",0
"for instance, fraudulent results and removal of data in clinical trials which do not align with
researcher’s bias or funding source can be prevented by enforcing the integrity of data in blockchain.",0
"in addition, it
allows keeping an immutable log of subject’s consent in a clinical trial.",0
"on a financial note, blockchain could save
hundreds of billions for the pharmaceutical industry by defining a chain-of-custody in the supply chain[].",0
"it is possible to write custom laws and rules forming contracts on the blockchain, which are equivalent to real-world
contracts and can be legally binding.",0
these contracts are referred to as smart contracts.,0
"smart contracts can be used in
several processes within healthcare including billing and insurance which helps in automating the process and reducing
the costs.",0
"later in subsequent sections, we see several companies leveraging the smart contracts to build solutions.",0
"in this publication, we discuss the problems in the healthcare ecosystem and how the right use of blockchain technology
may solve these problems.",0
we begin by giving a brief introduction to inner workings of blockchain in chapter .,0
"in
subsequent chapters, we review major use cases of blockchain in healthcare along with the projects pursuing these use
cases.",0
"we have reviewed works in the field of healthcare data management, pharmaceutical use cases like supply chain
and medication adherence, billing/claims management, analytics, telemedicine, and blockchain as a service.",0
"these
fields, though not all-encompassing, represent some of the major areas in the overall healthcare space.",0
"in chapter , we
discuss the challenges in the adoption of blockchain based solutions in healthcare.",0
"the final chapter concludes with
the overall discussion on the landscape of healthcare, problems therein, promises of the blockchain, and the state of
blockchain based solutions.",0
"several other review papers have discussed the applications of blockchain in healthcare [, , , , ].",0
"blockchain
blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin [], an open peer-to-peer (pp) value transfer network that solved the
problem of double spending for the first time.",0
"with the release of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies became the first use case
of the blockchain.",0
"cryptocurrencies are analogous to fiat money like usd or eur facilitating the exchange of value
but use cryptographic protocols as the basis for governance rather than depending on a central authority like banks.",0
"in
recent years, there has been increasing awareness that the blockchain has much more to offer than cryptocurrencies;
blockchain can be an ideal tool for creating trust based solutions.",0
"in bitcoin like cryptocurrencies, a blockchain represents an append-only linear chain of blocks or ledger replicated
across a network of computers; a block is a group of validated transactions in the network, and the two consequent
blocks are cryptographically linked.",0
"however, in recent times we observe variations on how blockchain is defined.",0
"often it is used as an umbrella term for the distributed ledger technology used in any pp network that tries to solve
problems like double spending.",0
"in this publication, we broadly consider blockchain as a pp distributed append-only
ledger with immutable and tamper-proof records.",0
"it is important to understand the concept and life cycle of a transaction
to understand how blockchain works.",0
"in blockchain, a transaction represents a change of state.",0
"for instance, a transfer of
coins from a sender to a receiver is a transaction where the account balance represents the state.",0
"when a new transaction
is created, it is broadcasted to the network where a miner node (computer) picks up the transaction and compose a block
by combining one or more transactions and broadcasts the block into the network.",0
"each blockchain has a set of rules
that determine whether a block created by a miner is valid or not, and only the valid blocks are added to the chain.",0
"for
example, a block is considered valid and mined in bitcoin if it has the correct cryptographic hash [].",0
"these set of
rules form the basis of consensus in the blockchain.",0
"a preprint- december , 
consensus
the consensus in a blockchain network is the mechanism on agreeing on a common version or state of the blockchain
which is considered to be the trusted truth of the blockchain.",0
"the consensus mechanism prevents the double spending
as trying to double spend an already spent transaction causes a conflict with the existing state, thereby the transaction
is rejected and will never be added to the chain.",0
"a consensus protocol includes the rules for transaction validation,
accepting the newly created block into the chain, and selection of fork/partition in case of network partitions.",0
"depending
on the context and the use case, the need and requirement for the consensus could differ.",0
"consensus mechanism can be
broadly classified as global or local.
. in global consensus model, the first block of the chain called genesis block is common for all nodes in the
network and every node agrees on the same state of the network and stores the complete chain to validate any
transaction.",0
"most common examples of global consensus blockchain are bitcoin and ethereum.
. in local consensus model, every participant owns an individual genesis block and the consensus is only reached
among the parties involved in the transactions.",0
"this local consensus reduces the storage requirements on
individual nodes and is generally more scalable than global consensus counterparts.",0
"example blockchains are
trustchain [] and nano [].",0
most of the current blockchains use some version of the consensus protocol of bitcoin called nakamoto consensus [].,0
"the nakamato consensus is a global consensus model; it uses proof of work (pow) for accepting the new block and
dictates to choose the longest chain in case of network partitions.",0
"in pow, miners compete to find a cryptographic hash
that solves a computationally difficult problem and the block proposed by the miner with the correct hash is added to
the chain.",0
proof of work is resource intensive and inherently non-scalable.,0
"proof of stake (pos) is an alternative block
validation model where the creator of the new block is chosen in a deterministic way depending on its wealth, also
called the stake [].",0
pos is much more efficient in terms of performance and energy consumption.,0
"we are observing a
shift from pow to pos or hybrid model in recent blockchains where ethereum remains a strong proponent.",0
"smart contracts
a smart contract represents a self-executing, self-verifying, and tamper-resistant piece of code with programmable
application logic which resides and executes on the blockchain.",0
"it formalizes the transaction rules and relationship
among entities and assets in the blockchain and gives the flexibility to write custom application logic which becomes a
law enforced by the blockchain itself without any reliance on trusted intermediaries.",0
"smart contracts form the basis for
trust in the application layer.",0
"from the early days of bitcoin, it supported a basic scripting language [] that allowed people to write custom
logic to spend transactions.",0
this language gave the people the flexibility to design primitive contracts.,0
"for example,
enforcing a transaction to spend only after a certain time or requiring a multi-party signature to spend a transaction
became possible.",0
"though bitcoin scripts provided a way to write contracts, it was limited and restrictive.",0
"then, the
blockchains specifically designed to support the execution of custom code came into existence.",0
"ethereum [] is a
pioneer blockchain explicitly designed as the smart contracts platform.",0
"with smart contracts, real-world rules and laws
can be embedded and enforced into the blockchain, and thus developing a decentralized trusted application (dapp)
became a lot easier.",0
cryptocurrency token and digital assets became the most popular contract applications.,0
"soon an
outburst of dapps was seen contributing to a world-wide blockchain hype.",0
"prediction markets [] and decentralized
exchanges [] are some examples which demonstrate the real strength and flexibility of smart contracts.",0
"apart from ethereum, there are several other blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts: nem [], hyperledger
fabric [], stellar [], neo [], etc.",0
"types of blockchain
blockchain can be public or private depending on the permission level [], but here we broadly classify it to three
different levels of granularity.",0
"• public blockchain a public blockchain is permissionless, and anyone can easily participate and validate the
transactions.",0
transactions are public and anonymous/pseudonymous.,0
"the blockchain is maintained by the
public community, so there is the highest level of decentralized trust.",0
bitcoin is the pioneer public blockchain.,0
"bitcoin, ethereum, waves [], dash [], and bitshares [] are few examples of public blockchains.",0
"• federated blockchain a federated blockchain is a permissioned blockchain operating under the leadership of
a group often called the consortium.",0
predefined consortium nodes control the consensus.,0
"the transactions may
or may not be public.",0
"some examples includes r corda [], ewf (energy) [], and bi (insurance) [].",0
"a preprint- december , 
• private blockchain a private blockchain is a permissioned blockchain centralized to one governing orga-
nization.",0
transactions are validated internally and may or may not be public readable.,0
"private blockchains
usually have faster block times and can process higher transaction throughput.",0
"however, these are vulnerable
to security breaches.",0
"the value of private blockchain can be seen as a trust transformer where trust is based on
an algorithm rather than an authority.",0
"monax [], hyperledger with sawtooth [], private ethereum are a
few examples of private blockchains.",0
"trust and traceability are the two basic promises of the blockchain obtained out of the box which solves the generic
trust problem on all public, federated, and organization levels.",0
"however, these traits are not always sufficient to
provide a complete solution, which is why we often see blockchain paired with strong cryptographic protocols like
zero-knowledge proofs [].",0
"this pairing ensures to provide trust, traceability, security, and control which are the core
building blocks for critical solutions in several industries including health care and supply chain.",0
"data recorded in the
blockchain cannot be changed or deleted without leaving a trace.",0
"this immutability and traceability of the data is a
critical requirement for any health care system.",0
"thus, the benefits of blockchain seem imminent.",0
"here, we list some of
the core issues/concerns that need to be addressed in health care solutions and later show how blockchain could help in
solving them.",0
"• secure storage and integrity protection
• privacy and ownership of data
• data sharing
• traceability and accountability of data
while each of these concerns can be addressed separately with the proper use of cryptography and privacy-preserving
technologies, the key concerns in such solutions have always been the governing trust model.",0
"in such solutions,
blockchain as a trustful decentralized ledger technology can act as a trust binding glue.",0
"challenges & future
despite the massive potential, there are limitations as of the current state of the blockchain.",0
"currently, every node in
the network processes the transaction which makes the blockchain rather slow and unsuitable to handle real-world
transactions which range in tens of thousands of transactions per second.",0
"this disparity highlights the scaling issue that
blockchains have to overcome for wider adoption across all industries.",0
"moreover, with the growth in usage, the size of
blockchain is increasing enormously, making it difficult for normal users to keep the full copy of it.",0
"on a positive note,
with huge investment and research efforts invested into blockchain [], a better scalable blockchain may evolve in the
future.",0
"decentralization, consistency, and scalability (dcs) are the three desirable properties that blockchain platforms strive
to maintain.",0
"a blockchain system can only simultaneously provide two out of three properties; there will always be
a trade-off.",0
"platforms like bitcoin and ethereum are dc system where they provide sufficient decentralization and
consistency of data but lack scalability.",0
"on the other hand, hyperledger is an example of a cs system which ensures
data consistency and can scale above k+ transactions per second at the cost of losing decentralization.",0
"in the last decade, we have observed the evolution of blockchain in three generations.",0
"cryptocurrencies represented the
first .",0
generation which was primarily designed as an alternative payment system.,0
"then, decentralized applications
based on smart contracts (dapps) represented the .",0
"applications providing business logic abstraction and execution
on a trusted platform where safety and security of smart contracts is the key issue.",0
"smart contracts which can be
validated and tested before deployment on a live blockchain prevents financial losses due to flaws in the code.",0
"the third
generation is taking a pervasive multi-dimensional approach connecting internet of things (iot), machine learning, and
different branches of science.",0
"these different generations of blockchain are evolving simultaneously in their own pace,
addressing the issues like scalability, security, and privacy along the way.",0
"moreover, projects like holochain [] and
hashgraph [] are developing scalable and general purpose platforms for agent-centric decentralized applications;
traditional blockchains are data-centric making them difficult to scale.",0
"we see more of these example use cases in the
following sections.",0

the management of healthcare data which includes storage, access control, and sharing of the data is an important
aspect of the healthcare industry.",0
"proper management of healthcare data improves healthcare outcomes by allowing
holistic views of patients, personalized treatments, and efficient communication.",0
"it is also critical for operating
healthcare industry cost-effectively and efficiently.",0
"however, managing healthcare data is a challenging task due
to its sensitive nature and subsequent trust issues.",0
"and it is one of the main reasons why the healthcare system is
disconnected—healthcare data and services exist in disparate forms in several silos.",0
"this disconnected system is a
culprit for several inefficiencies in healthcare and is a major hurdle for healthcare research.",0
"healthcare professionals
generally do not have access to the complete data of patients, thereby, hampering the subsequent diagnosis and treatment
steps; and researchers struggle to find the desired data for their studies, thereby, slowing down healthcare research.",0
"blockchain may enable the efficient sharing of healthcare data while ensuring data integrity and protecting patient
privacy.",0
"secure, efficient, cost-effective, and interoperable hie can be built with its right use alongside with other
technologies.",0
"moreover, the adoption of blockchain can push forward the movement of patient-centric healthcare
model where patients control their healthcare data.",0
"the major hurdles behind data-sharing in both patient-centric and
traditional models are lack of trust and lack of incentives to share.",0
"the blockchain technology can solve both problems
by acting as a trust layer and introducing the incentive mechanisms such as rewarding crypto tokens for sharing data.",0
"moreover, blockchain can be the bridge for the integration of medical device data and healthcare internet of things; the
healthcare and lifestyle data collected by wearable devices can be critical for correct diagnosis but are underutilized
since there is a lack of a proper way for a physician to access the patient-generated data.",0
"with blockchain-enabled trust and incentive structure, there is a promise for a global hie and a marketplace on top
of it.",0
"but the lack of common healthcare data standards can be one of the major obstacles to overcome before the
development of an interoperable hie connecting multiple disparate data silos.",0
"however, there is a possibility that the
incentives introduced by blockchain-based data exchange may fuel the creation and the development of the open data
standards.",0
"blockchain-based hie will be an interesting use case that requires the balance among privacy, transparency,
and efficiency.",0
"moreover, country-specific regulations will be another obstacle for a hie connecting multiple regulatory
regions.",0
"since patients have full ownership of their healthcare data in many countries, blockchain enabled patient-centric
healthcare data model can be one fitting way to bypass these regulatory challenges.
. blockchain based projects for healthcare data management
several projects are focusing on developing some form of blockchain based hie and providing data and services
marketplace on top of it; see table .",0
"among them, some are targeting general electronic health records (ehr) data
while some are specializing in particular data modalities such as genomics and dermatology.",0
"for example, medrec
[] is an open source blockchain platform for ehr management.",0
"it was recently tested in collaboration with beth
israel deaconess center.",0
"patientory [] is one of the early blockchain based healthcare startup leveraging initial coin
offerings (ico) for funding.",0
it is developing a hie powered by its own blockchain.,0
"healthsuite insights of philips
healthcare is testing verifiable data exchange process, a product that enables the secure and traceable data exchange
between the members inside a network of hospitals and universities []; all the data exchanges inside the network are
stored in a blockchain alongside the identities of the people performing the exchanges to create an audit trail of the
data exchange.",0
"medshare [] provides a blockchain based data sharing of electronic medical records among untrusted
parties by introducing data provenance, auditing, and trailing on medical data.",0
"utilizing smart contracts and an access
control system, they claim that their system can effectively trace the behavior of the data and revoke access to violated
rules and permissions on the data.",0
iryo [] is creating a global repository of health data in openehr format [].,0
"see
table  for other similar initiatives on the use of blockchain-based solutions for healthcare data management.",0
multiple projects are focusing on particular modalities of data such as genomics and imaging.,0
"genomics, in particular,
has attracted a lot of interest from entrepreneurs and companies probably because of the recent popularity of personal
genome sequencing, the importance of genomics data, and an immense possibility of its monetization.",0
"personal
genomics companies such as andme and ancestrydna monetize the genetic data by selling access to third parties
such as labs and biotech companies.",0
"several startups such as encrypgen [], nebula genomics [], lunadna
[], etc.",0
are developing blockchain based genomics data-exchange platform or network.,0

pharmaceutical supplies are an important aspect of clinical care and healthcare delivery.",0
"in this section, we review the
various innovative applications and initiatives in the pharmaceutical sector, covering the entire spectrum right from
the drug discovery and clinical trials for the market introduction to solutions at the end of the chain like counterfeit
drugs identification and patient adherence to medication.",0
"an overview of the reviewed application areas and companies
within those application areas is shown in figure .",0

"per application
areas, examples of companies or initiatives involved in that particular area are also provided.
. drug discovery and pharmaceutical research
drug discovery and research take a significant cost on the operations of any pharmaceutical company.",0
"with increasing
costs of healthcare, together with the need to innovate faster on new medicinal treatments, it is imperative that multiple
pharmaceutical companies find an approach to collaborate competitively.",0
"blockchain can enable the technological
platform to facilitate the transfer of trusted information and knowledge among multiple parties.",0
"the usage of blockchain
for robust digital proof of intellectual property (ip) through immutable records and time-stamping is one fitting
proposition for the collaboration.",0
"blockchain-based solutions can also provide mechanisms to share clinical and trial data
competitively.",0
"even under a non-collaborative research and drug development scenario, blockchain provides benefits for
effectively tracking and managing various aspects of clinical trials like data management, consent management, tracking
side-effects of drugs usage, etc.",0
"also, it is not uncommon for a pharmaceutical research company to outsource their
clinical research projects.",0
"in this case, blockchain could provide a feasible mechanism to assure data integrity and proper
outcome validation.",0
"in the current system, the pharmaceutical companies might have incentives to misrepresent results,

a preprint- december , 
e.g.",0
in disclosing the side-effect of new drugs.,0
"with an open research ecosystem based on blockchain technology,
research outputs are transparent, and research outputs are validated making the false representation of the results
difficult.",0
"many blockchain based solutions for ip management have been proposed in the generic space,
which can also be applied for the innovations in drug development.",0
"an example, in this case, is the ambition to
use blockchain backed electronic lab notebook solutions from labii [].",0
"bernstein [] provides a blockchain
based management of digital trails with timestamping to safeguard priorities in ip; this feature can be beneficial in
collaborative pharmaceutical research.",0
"a solution from iplexus [] uses blockchain to make any unpublished and
published data from drug development studies readily available for use.",0
"blockchain solves the puzzle of maintaining
trust and protecting ips to enable such a groundbreaking initiative and framework.",0
"blockchain also has use cases in the management of the clinical trial process for pharmaceutical
research.",0
"recently, ieee standard association [] organized a forum on blockchain for clinical trial with the aim
to use blockchain to make innovations in patient recruitment, ensure data integrity, and make rapid advances in drug
development.",0
"scrybe [], a blockchain project presented in the forum, enables an efficient and trusted mechanism to
expedite the clinical trials and research process.",0
"of others, it allows an easy and transparent framework for legal and
ethical validations of the trial process by the auditors.",0
"the work in [] shows how blockchain can be used to manage
the consent, data, and outcome from a clinical trial in a trustful and open manner.",0
"such innovations in clinical trial
rollout and management are crucial for advancements in pharmaceutical research.",0
"a lot of clinical trials run over the
budget and timelines.",0
competitive sharing of clinical and trial data can accelerate research and discovery.,0
"such sharing
of data can be enabled with blockchain, using example approaches as discussed in section .",0
"further, the research aspect of pharmaceuticals is quite broad that pervades the drug discovery process to device
manufacturers and clinical trial outcomes.",0
"a solution across this spectrum is provided by blockrx [] using so-called
advanced digital ledger technology (adlt).",0
"the overarching goal is to inter-connect the currently disconnected parties
in silos.
. supply chain and counterfeit drugs detection
the importance of the supply chain in the medical industry cannot be overstated.",0
"right from the raw materials and
production, to different stages of storage and distribution, proper monitoring and tracking are required to ensure
optimal and intended usage.",0
one of the growing concerns in recent years is that of counterfeit drugs.,0
"there must be a
mechanism for the end users and all the stakeholders of the supply chain to verify the ingredients of a drug.",0
"with lack of
a proper tracking mechanism, there are ample weak links in the supply chain where the drug can be tampered with, or a
counterfeit drug can be infused in the supply.",0
"to address this growing concern, new regulations have been brought forth
to have all stakeholders of the medicine supply chain provide a robust mechanism to track and trace the pharmaceutical
supplies that pass through them.",0
"blockchain provides a perfectly fitting solution to this need for tracing and tracking,
where this information has to be maintained in an open yet safe and tamper-proof system accessible to multiple parties.",0
many solutions have therefore been proposed using blockchain to track the supply chain of pharmaceutical supplies.,0
the mediledger project [] is building an open network for the pharmaceutical supply chain.,0
"the network is a
permissioned blockchain for the partners involved in the supply chain of pharmaceuticals.",0
"the concept is in line with
the track and trace regulations.",0
"the law requires a way to track prescription drugs through the entire supply chain
using interoperable systems, which mediledger, a project launched by pharma giants like pfizer and genentech, is
proposing to solve using blockchain technology.",0
"one of the most ambitious projects in this space is ambrosus [] with
its flagship product amb-net, a blockchain based iot network for supply chain targeted for food and pharmaceutical
industries.",0
"on top of amb-net, companies can build their custom supply chain solutions.",0
"modsense t from modum
[] provides a temperature sensor for monitoring the conditions in the supply chain of pharmaceuticals, helping meet
the regulatory requirements on good distribution practice (gdp) of medicinal products for human use.",0
"the sensor data
and other digital records are maintained using a blockchain.",0
"several other blockchain based solutions in the supply
chain industry also list the pharmaceutical industry as their primary application areas.",0
"blockverify [], for example,
list pharmaceuticals as one of the main application areas for their supply chain solution preventing counterfeits.",0
"in the
provided solution, the history of the goods is recorded with the blockverify tag on a blockchain.",0

inbox which will solve issues related to medicine mismanagement.",0
"think about the prescription from your general
practitioner that you had in the recent past which might be problematic for your current ongoing treatment at a hospital.",0
"in the current system, it is challenging to have these different data points in one place that is accessible to the patient and
this, in turn, could lead to undesirable incidents.",0
"the solution from scalamed brings all the information about current
and past prescriptions into a central place which helps avoid situations causing cross-reactions of the prescription drugs.",0
"though several blockchain based solutions are being investigated for prescription management, some centralized
conventional system could also provide a solution for certain markets where the involved parties are very few.",0
"close

"due to enforcement by regulations,
could envision a simple solution like a single sign-on into a common database to have an overview of a patient’s
medication.",0
"billing claims management
financial aspects of medical care are inherently important in the healthcare landscape.",0
"this area of financing aspect in
healthcare is rife with inefficiencies, mostly related to the trust and transparency, which can potentially be optimized by
the use of blockchain.",0
"blockchain provides a mechanism for direct links between patients (one who makes claims) with
the bearers (one who clears the claim), as there is trust inbuilt.",0

 analytics
blockchain can have a huge positive impact on all three pillars of analytics: data, model, and computation.",0
"data
access to the right data is the key to better analytics.",0
"data are more valuable than algorithms, and this is especially true
in healthcare due to the sensitive nature of healthcare data.",0
"with blockchain-enabled hie, researchers and analytics
companies can efficiently acquire the desired data for analysis.",0
"also, confidence in the quality and attribute of the
acquired data increases if its provenance is tracked by blockchain.",0
"not only data but the analytics process, for example,
training and validation of prediction models, can also be tracked using blockchain.",0
"this tracking feature can increase the
confidence of healthcare professionals and regulatory entities such as fda on the prediction models, thereby increasing
their probability of being used in the clinical setting.",0
"model
multiple model predictions can be pooled using a blockchain network to create a final robust model; prediction of
an ensemble of models is usually more correct than individual predictions.",0
"also, incentive features such as crypto
assets and reputation scores can be used to encourage participation and submission of better models.",0
"for example,
numerai [] is a hedge fund which utilizes crowd-sourced machine learning for financial predictions.",0
"a similar
mechanism can be set up in health care for use cases such as early detection of cancer.",0
"modelchain [] has proposed
a framework for crowd-sourced machine learning while preserving patient information; inside a private blockchain
network, participating sites share only model parameters which are used to build the final model.",0
"in addition to the
prediction models, the predictions can come from individuals where correct predictions are rewarded while incorrect
ones are penalized.",0
"this mechanism can be utilized in public health, for example, to predict the outbreak of epidemic
diseases.",0
"for example, using augur [] which is a decentralized prediction platform, a bet has been created to predict
the spread of human-borne nipah virus in united states [].",0
"computation
with the increase in data quantity and model complexity, the demand for computing resources is rapidly increasing.",0
"research centers and analytics companies either have in-house computing servers or use computing services from
amazon, google, or microsoft.",0
"with the introduction of the blockchain, decentralized computation has become the
third option.",0
"recently there has been few promising projects developing open-source pp computation platforms such as
golem [], sonm [], etc.",0
"they have released some early products and have a consistent user base, although a tiny
one.",0
"one of the key challenges in decentralized computation is preserving data privacy while performing computation
on them, and it is particularly important in healthcare.",0
"companies such as enigma [] and oasis labs [] are
developing solutions for privacy-preserving computation on blockchain.",0
"compared to traditional cloud computing
services, blockchain promises cheaper computation with greater data security and removes the need of vendor lock-in.",0
"however, the blockchain-based solutions are still in the early stages and need to prove their claims in practice.",0
"telemedicine
telemedicine is another area in healthcare that can benefit from blockchain technology by introducing a trust layer
between patients and healthcare professionals.",0
"blockchain-based telemedicine platform can validate professional
identity and data integrity, ensure transparency and traceability, and incentivize the players to act fairly by providing
incentive metrics such as reputation scores and crypto tokens.",0
"successful development of such platforms may create a
global healthcare marketplace in the future effectively balancing the global supply and demand of healthcare resources
and needs.",0
"in addition, such a network can incorporate the software services such as artificial intelligence (ai) if the
ai models are properly validated, regulated, and their performance continuously quantified by some proxy measures.",0
"within telemedicine, it is likely that the remote diagnostic services will be at the forefront of blockchain adoption.",0
"it
can be expected that diagnostic services solely based on quantitative and qualitative interpretation of medical data in the
absence of a patient will be first to adopt blockchain technology successfully.",0
"a large number of startups in this area
corroborates this anticipation.",0
"and many of these startups are targeting the services where the diagnosis of a medical
condition is based on interpretation of patient-generated imaging data such as dermatology.",0
"we found the projects
focusing on skin images unusually high in number, most probably due to its close relationship with the beauty industry
in addition to the above-mentioned reasons.",0

"challenges
although blockchain holds tremendous potential to improve and add value to the healthcare system and several
companies have already started testing it for specific use cases, there are several challenges to be tackled before its
mainstream usage.",0
there are various facets to the challenges on the mainstream adoption of the blockchain technology.,0
"these facets are for example:
• technical
• legal
• business
• trust issues
in this section, we touch upon some of the challenges to be expected for the widespread usage of the blockchain
technology in the healthcare sector.
. interoperability & integration with the legacy systems
healthcare space has a vast number of technologies, devices, and components, not forgetting the personnel, which
all come together to solve the current needs in the space.",0
"there are large rooms for improvements, with blockchain
technology providing a promise to cover up some of this room.",0
"however, the blockchain technology would still be
just one piece, though likely very crucial, of the puzzle.",0
"the blockchain technology has to integrate well with existing
systems, and the integration is going to be a challenging ordeal because of several reasons such as interoperability.",0
"that
the healthcare space has multiple numbers of devices and device types make it even more difficult.",0
"all relevant parties
and stakeholders should all come together to make the use of blockchain technology more pervasive in healthcare.",0
"if
blockchain cannot be a catalyst for this cooperation between stakeholders and relevant parties, then it probably does not
have much value above and beyond being a simple and useful tool to solve some issues around trust.",0
"many of the other
issues around ecosystem building will still be there, regardless of the blockchain.",0
"an important aspect of this discussion
also relates to the training of healthcare it personnel.",0
"these personnel might be needed to be re-trained on blockchain
technology if the blockchain technology would enter into the healthcare space.
. adoption and incentives for participation
as discussed, adoption of blockchain technology in the healthcare space would require co-ordination and co-operation
of multiple stakeholders.",0
"as the adoption of blockchain technology would require co-operation from multiple stakeholders, with
some changes in each of these stakeholder’s current operational and business model, it would be natural for these
stakeholders to expect some incentive to participate in the change process.",0
"in order to manage these expectations, new
business models must be explored that can provide fair incentives to all the stakeholders.",0
"the provided incentives
should acknowledge the costs and efforts in deploying or adopting a blockchain based technologies, along with any
underlying changes in the operational model that the deployed solution entails.",0
"consider the solution for blockchain
based patient data management.",0
"in this particular scenario, a fair incentive scheme must be devised in a sustainable
business model that can be accepted by the patients, device manufactures, backend it solution providers, hospitals, etc.",0
"as this application is still evolving, it would be some time before proven robust incentive models are aplenty.",0
"in the
meantime, any associated risk of a particular incentive model must be rigorously assessed and quantified as much as
possible.
. uncertain cost of operation
while blockchain has promising features such as no need of central authority (and hence no central point of failure),
transparency and relatively fast settlement of transactions, the cost of operating blockchain systems are not yet known.",0
"today, a significant amount of resources in healthcare is being spent on personnel, time, and money to build and manage
the current traditional information systems and data exchanges.",0
"on top of that, there is an overhead of continuously
updating the systems, troubleshooting issues, performing backups, worrying about hacks and data breaches.",0
"the
blockchain-based hie system could prove itself to be cost-effective and more efficient compared to the traditional
hie system.",0
"this, for example, could come due to the enhanced security by design.",0
"nonetheless, the overall cost
factors involved in a blockchain technology-based healthcare services must be robustly assessed in a given business and
operational model of a healthcare organization.
. regulation
a solution in the healthcare space needs to adhere to a various set of regulations as the patient’s health and even life
is at stake, directly or indirectly.",0
"further, as it concerns health data, the concerns regarding data privacy are also the
highest.",0
"the blockchain technology being a new technological solution that is being adopted among the early users,
one of the challenges remain on how the solutions on top of blockchain technology comply with existing regulations
and standards.",0
"while existing hie systems have multiple years to evolve towards meeting the regulatory requirements,
the blockchain technology might be still in the evolution phase to find the sweet landing spot within the healthcare
space where it can also adequately adhere to set healthcare standards and regulations.",0
"to achieve this, a number of pilot
deployments and rigorous test and validation of the underlying technological pieces must be considered by the solution
providers.",0
"the requirements to adhere to regulations could also be an impetus for further technological advancements
in the blockchain technology.",0
"the requirements from recently enforced general data protection rule (gdpr) is one of the cases which is leading
discussion and thoughts on how blockchain technology can further evolve to comply with set regulations.",0
"blockchain
and gdpr has a dual relationship.",0
"on the one hand, gdpr, as an example, enforces provisions like the right to
erasure/right to be forgotten, giving a person (data originator) full right and control over his or her data which directly
conflicts with the immutable nature of blockchain.",0
"healthcare data are generally stored off-chain and only pointers
to the data, usually, its cryptographic hash, is stored in the blockchain.",0
"this approach provides a way to make a
blockchain application gdpr compliant.",0
"however, one can always argue that the cryptographic hash can still be
considered a form of the personal data which is a separate discussion in itself.",0
"over time better trade-offs are bound to
come where regulatory compliance feeds very well to only evolution and maturity of blockchain technology for even
more widespread adoption.",0
"at this point, it is wise to consider incorporating gdpr like regulations in blockchain
applications.",0
"on the other hand, from a decentralization perspective, regulations like gdpr and blockchain are perfect
partners.",0
"with the increasing awareness among users about their personal data and enforcement of privacy regulations,
there has been a surge in the interest around the patient-controlled health care data.",0
"given the existence of user-friendly
applications for management of the personal data with proper security and incentive structures, individuals can have
access and control to their healthcare data and can participate in pp global data-exchange required for healthcare
research and services, all powered by blockchain.
. governance
the basic premise of the distributed nature of blockchain helps to bring multiple parties into a trusted transaction
scheme, without the need of any centralized authorities.",0
"however, if we consider how healthcare organizations operate,
there can be several different operational models.",0
"in certain operational models of blockchain based solutions, it might

a preprint- december , 
be imperative to have a certain stakeholder assuming the role of a regulator to govern the overall operation of the
blockchain.",0
"this governing model might, for example, be needed to meet the regulatory requirements.",0
"it is not yet clear
how such a governance structure can be managed properly in a system with multiple disparate parties.",0
"this aspect of
governance will also have a tie-in with the intended incentive schemes.",0
"however, as the adoption of blockchain based
solutions will evolve in the healthcare space, we would see various solutions also to the requirements of governance.
. scaling
not only in healthcare but any industry, the underlying blockchain network has to be scalable for successful application
of any blockchain-based solutions.",0
"it is likely that, at least in the early phase, several solutions in healthcare will use
semi-permissioned blockchains which are scalable and have high transaction throughput at the cost of decentralization.",0
"however, there will still be a need for public blockchains for communication among permissioned blockchain networks.",0
"besides, a blockchain-enabled global hie can only be possible with highly scalable public blockchains.",0
"in current
form, public blockchain networks like bitcoin and ethereum are not fast and cheap enough to host any decentralized
applications on a large scale.",0
and some of them are already being adopted in practice.,0
"in the future,
it is likely that the public blockchains will be fast and cheap enough for their mass adoption.",0
"conclusion
blockchain technology has the potential to solve several problems plaguing the healthcare industry today.",0
"as a trust
mediator, it can enable novel healthcare solutions; and as an incentive machine, it can enable novel business models
that may lead to a new dynamic among various healthcare stakeholders like patients and providers.",0
"for example, a
patient-centric healthcare model and a global hie might be realized by virtue of blockchain enabled decentralized trust
and incentive structures.",0
"similarly, blockchain based decentralized network/services may minimize vendor lock-in
problems in healthcare.",0
"examples
of organizations developing blockchain-based applications for these use cases were also presented.",0
"the proposed
applications range from moonshot projects trying to build a complete decentralized health care ecosystem to specific
applications such as data provenance, counterfeit drugs identification, consent management, etc.",0
"despite the immense potential of blockchain technology and an enormous amount of interest around it, we found that
its impact on healthcare is minimal and is still in the early days.",0
"most of the blockchain based healthcare solutions are
still in the form of novel concepts represented by whitepapers, prototypes, or only a very small number of working
products with a limited user base.",0
"however, the field is evolving rapidly; we anticipate a significant positive impact
of blockchain in healthcare in the future.",0
"challenges such as interoperability, integration with the existing systems,
uncertainty in cost, technological and adoption barrier, regulatory compliance, and scaling have to be successfully
tackled to help blockchain make its mark in the healthcare industry.",0

"by answering the questions, novice developers could know what resources to exploit 
to support their blockchain relevant programming tasks and blockchain project 
communities could better acknowledge how to make blockchain technology more 
practical to front-line developers.",0
"in this article, we conduct a case study by stack overflow, a popular technical 
question and answer (q & a) website attracting millions of developers.",0
"we extracted all 
the blockchain relevant question posts and investigate how blockchain is discussed by 
developers there.",0
"overview of the study 
in this study, we attempt to draw a profile of blockchain in the eyes of developers with 
stack overflow as a point of penetration.",0
"in brief, the motivation of this study contains 
three parts.",0
"first, we want to evaluate the popularity of blockchain, or to check whether 
blockchain is hot.",0
"to this end, we use the frequency of blockchain relevant questions in 
stack overflow as an index.",0
"second, we want to acknowledge what are the frequently 
encountered problems about blockchain.",0
"hence, we analyze the blockchain relevant 
questions in stack overflow to find the common terms.",0
"third, we also want to know 
what frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques can be used by developers in blockchain 
relevant tasks.",0
so we try to identify these entities from tags of stack overflow posts.,0
"in 
summary, the study is to answer the following three questions: 
q: how frequently blockchain relevant questions are posted in stack overflow?",0
q: what are the common problems when blockchain is involving?,0
"q: what blockchain specialized entities (programming relevant platforms, frameworks, 
tools, libraries, techniques, etc) do there exist?",0
"with these questions, the study is conducted according to the following steps.",0
"at first, 
we extract the question posts in which the string “blockchain” is mentioned.",0
"an 
evolvement analysis of these posts is conducted.",0
"next, we manually categorize these 
extracted question posts into different types in perspective of developers’ demands.",0
"the 
description of each type is summarized further.",0
"then, blockchain relevant tags of the 
extracted question posts are selected.",0
"after that, these tags are identified as commonly 
used frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques related to blockchain.",0
"figure  outlines 
the process of this study.",0
"blockchain relevant entities indicate concepts

"then, we go through 
the titles, bodies, and tags of all the question posts.",0

rise.",0

question posts.",0

month.",0

relevant question posts were not mentioned for a long time at the beginning.",0
"the first 
blockchain relevant question was posted in january .",0
"the time span before that date 
is omitted in the figure.",0
the data of march  is eliminated as it is not complete.,0
we have two observations from the evolvement.,0
"on the one hand, blockchain is an 
ongoing topic in stack overflow programming practice.",0
"the monthly number of 
blockchain relevant question posts shows a clearly increasing trend especially since 
january .",0
"moreover, the increasing speed tends to increase, too.",0
"that means more 
and more programming issues about blockchain are raised and discussed.",0
"although the 
current number of blockchain relevant question posts is relatively small, we believe that it 
could rise fast in the future.",0
"on the other hand, the application of blockchain is lagging 
behind the theory of blockchain.",0
"the idea of blockchain was conceptualized in 

.",0
"but only still , it emerged in stack overflow, where blockchain is viewed in the 
application perspective.",0
there is a time delay between theory and application.,0
"however, 
blockchain has attracted the attentions from programming communities and blockchain 
relevant questions are continuously growing.",0
"a. currently, blockchain relevant questions only occupy a small part of all stack 
overflow posts, but the monthly number is increasing over time (figure ).",0
evolvement of blockchain relevant question posts.,0
"question types summarization 
 
posts categorization 
to give a summary of what tasks developers face with, we categorize the blockchain 
relevant question posts into different types.",0
"as the extracted question post set is not very 
large, and for the sake of accuracy, we do this work manually.",0
"to make the results more understandable, we do not focus on technical details but the 
demands of askers.",0
"a question post is labeled with a unique type which reflects the main 
purpose of the asker.",0
"for example, in a post, the asker writes “i want to query the 
blockchain to find the moment when an unconfirmed transaction comes through for a 
particular bitcoin address” (#).",0
"that is, the asker wants to access the 
blockchain to obtain some information of transactions.",0
"then we may label the post as 
“access”.",0
"in another example, “what’s the difference between distributed hashtable 
technology and the bitcoin blockchain?” (#), the asker just wants to 
discriminate the two concepts but does not leak the practical requirements.",0
"then the post 
could be labeled as “discussion”.",0
"with this consideration, we categorize the posts following the iterative process of 
mobile app reviews tagging.",0
"specifically, for each of the blockchain relevant question 
post, we label it with an existing type.",0
"if a question post does not match any existing 
types, then we add a new type to the existing types and relabel the blockchain relevant 
question post from the beginning.",0
"finally  types of blockchain relevant question posts 
are detected.",0
"types of the blockchain relevant question posts 
for the  types of blockchain relevant question posts, we summarize their substances 
and give a brief description and an example question post for each type.",0
"the details are 
shown in figure .",0
"as a question post is labeled with a unique type, the blockchain relevant question posts 
are grouped into  clusters.",0
"if a large number of question posts belong to the same type, 
then this type of issues are frequently encountered and should be paid more attention to.",0
"the number of question posts a type involves (cluster size) reveals the popularity of this 
type.",0
"to find the popular types, we rank the  types according to the numbers of 
question posts and the results are displayed in figure  (a).",0
"the top three types are configuration, deployment, and discussion, which account for 
more than  percent of all the posts.",0
"questions of configuration are about how to 
configure the environment to work well.",0
"many askers reported to get errors during the 
configuring process, such as post#: error running custom blockchain 
(hyperledger) application with security enabled.",0
"similarly, deployment is about how to 
set up or install the blockchain system, such as post#: how can i integrate 
etherium or waves platform wallet on my site?",0
"among all the askers of these two types of 
questions, a number of them are in the learning phase and do not have certain tasks.",0
"askers of  question posts declared that they tried to follow the steps provided in the 
tutorials.",0
questions of discussion are related to more general topics.,0
"the askers may 
want to talk about the ideas (e.g., are there already other practical uses for blockchain?",0
"#), understand the mechanisms (e.g., where are chaincodes executed?",0
"#), resolve their puzzles (e.g., bitcoins, how can someone receive much less 
than have spent?",0
"#), or verify their thoughts (e.g., is blockchain a decentralised 
 
 
database?",0

initial phase.",0

developers have set out to work with blockchain.",0
the  types of blockchain relevant question posts.,0
then we evaluate the  types in another perspective.,0
"a question post can be evaluated 
with different metrics.",0
"for example, score measures the quality of the post, viewcount 
measures the number of visitors, and favoritecount measures how many developers mark 
it as favorite.",0
"a post may get high values of these metrics under the following scenarios: 
access

"(#) 
design decentralized applications by leveraging blockchain technology application

"(#) 
authenticate the participants by verifying the certifications or signatures authentication

"(#) 
make transactions, receive or send cryptocurrency between accounts transaction 
example post: simple -to- bitcoin transaction with bitcore (#) 
retrieve or query information from blocks, cryptocurrency accounts, addresses, etc.",0
"the question is just what many other developers want to ask; the topic of the question is 
what many other developers concern; the question is related to the jobs what many other 
developers are doing.",0
"in brief, many other developers are interested in the question.",0
"to 
find the types developers interested in, we rank the  types according to the average 
score, viewcount, and favoritecount of posts they involve.",0
"the results are shown in 
figure  (b) – (d).",0
"we note that the three metrics of question posts belonging to contract and protocol 
are all in top ranks.",0
"questions of contract are about how to develop or implement the 
smart contract, that is, to contribute, verify or implement the negotiation or performance 
of the contract.",0
"in brief, they are about the business logics of blockchain, e.g., 
post#: how to destroy tokens/coins in a smart contract?",0
"questions of 
protocol are about how to deal with protocols to make blockchain work correctly.",0
"that is, 
they are about the underlying logics of blockchain, e.g., post#: how exactly to 
make consensus when chaincode has coding block of authority or event?",0
"in general, the 
types that developers are interested in are all related to the operating mechanisms of 
blockchain.",0
there are some implications of the findings.,0
"the official organizations of existing 
blockchain platforms, frameworks, or libraries may provide more manuals, tutorials, or 
books to facilitate the novice developers to handle these techniques.",0
"the practitioners of 
blockchain may write more informal reading materials to make the masses understand the 
fundamental principles of blockchain more easily.",0
"moreover, the blockchain 
communities may set up specialized forums or websites so that the blockchain enthusiasts 
could discuss or exchange their ideas more conveniently.",0
"a. questions about blockchain can be roughly categorized into  types (figure 
).",0
"among them, questions about configuration, deployment, discussion, and 
mechanisms (contract or protocol) of blockchain are notable.",0
the ranks of  types according to different metrics.,0
"blockchain relevant entities detection 
 
tags selection 
in stack overflow, a question post contains up to five tags.",0
"the tags can usually reveal 
the main technologies the question post involves

, and they can usually be identified as 
named entities, e.g., operating systems, apis, and platforms.",0
"therefore, we attempt to 
find commonly used frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques which are relevant to 
blockchain from the tags of the blockchain relevant question posts.",0
"to select blockchain relevant tags, we leverage association rule mining.",0
"generally, if a 
tag frequently appears and only appears in the blockchain relevant question posts, then 
this tag is highly possible to be specialized in blockchain.",0
"there are usually two measures 
of each tag: support indicates the frequency the tag appears in the blockchain relevant 
question posts; confidence represents the proportion of the appearances of the tag in the 
blockchain relevant question posts to the total appearances of this tag.",0
"the common process of association rule mining is to set thresholds for the two 
measures respectively and select the tags whose measures are above the thresholds.",0
"however, blockchain is a relatively new topic in stack overflow and blockchain relevant 
tags may appear very few times, for instance, only one time.",0
"therefore, we set the 
threshold of support to be zero, i.e., all the tags which appear in the blockchain relevant 
question posts are considered, so that more potential blockchain relevant tags can be 
selected.",0
"for confidence, we sort the values of this measure of all the tags in a descending order 
and draw a curve of the sorted values with their ranks.",0
"then we find the knee of the 
curve

.",0
"that is, in the curve, the value decreases steeply before the knee and get smooth 
after the knee.",0
the value at the knee is chosen as the threshold of confidence.,0
"in this way, 
 tags are selected as their measures exceed the corresponding thresholds.",0
"entities identification 
for each of the blockchain relevant tag, we check the tag’s descriptions in stack 
overflow to determine what the entity the tag represents.",0
"nevertheless, descriptions of some tags can not be found in stack overflow.",0
"under 
this condition, we search the tag on the internet and check which descriptions are related 
to blockchain.",0
"fortunately, there are no ambiguities.",0
"that means, a unique entity can be 
deduced from the information of the tag which is related to blockchain.",0
"when the entities of all the blockchain relevant tags are identified, the blockchain 
relevant frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques are clear to us.",0

"on october , , satoshi nakamoto published a 
brief but groundbreaking paper to a cryptography forum.",0
"in it he outlined a way to overcome the  
double-spend scenario – a problem which plagued previous cryptocurrencies.",0
"despite not mentioning 
blockchain explicitly, he described its structure as a chain of hashed timestamps: “each timestamp includes 
the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones 
behind it” (nakamoto, ).",0
"although this approach was later refined for bitcoin, the concept was laid out: 
a chain of blocks, each cryptographically linked to the previous, using a hash digest.",0
"from this we denote 
that a blockchain is little more than a sequence of records, each hashed and linked to the previous block 
(figure ).",0
"nakamoto’s blockchain proposal (nakamoto, ) 
however, this approach alone wasn’t sufficient to eliminate the double spend issue.",0
"in a double spend 
scenario, the attacker attempts to create a race condition in which they spend the same virtual assets twice 
before either is validated.",0
"for a blockchain to guard against this, bitcoin needed a method for its network to 
form consensus.",0
"nakamoto introduced a proof-of-work model, in which agents would repeatedly hash the 
block with a random number (nonce) until they achieved a value less than a specified target.",0
"once found, the 
block would then extend the existing chain.",0
"as the blockchain is decentralized over peer-to-peer, any agent

potential economic gains).",0
"the bitcoin cryptocurrency required a construct into which it could record the order of transactions, 
verify them, and then secure the entry.",0
"blockchain technology provided this mechanism through a collection 
of ever extending blocks, where each block represents a pool of transactions, and are cryptographically 
linked to a parent block via a hash digest.",0
"since the blockchain is represented in a freely distributable file, 
there is no master copy; it is distributed among all parties.",0
"the bitcoin network relies on this decentralized 
distribution along with the proof-of-work consensus model to coordinate which blocks are added to the chain 
and to update all other copies.",0
"the blockchain in bitcoin functions as a database to store transactions, using a series of inputs and output 
resembling double entry accounting.",0

outputs.",0
"there are no “coins” minted and serialized for consumption, as one may think.",0
"by traversing the 
blockchain, the available balance for a user can be quickly calculated.",0
"any attempt to “corrupt” the 
blockchain and award more coins in a transaction will fail as the blockchain hashes would have to be 
recalculated – a computationally hard problem – and the blockchain’s decentralized nature ensures other 
nodes will have legitimate copies.",0
"the first usage of bitcoin dates to january ,  at which point nakamoto created the blockchain 
genesis block (the first block in the chain and the only one not to have a parent block to link to), and issued 
himself the first  bitcoins (blockchain luxembourg s.a., ; zohar, ).",0
"all blocks in the bitcoin 
blockchain trace back to this original transaction.",0
"this leads to one more observation: blockchains form an 
immutable historic record of every transaction from the date of origin in a transparent, decentralized data 
store.",0
"a blockchain gains its secure, immutable nature by combining two innovations: a cryptographic link 
between records that makes changes progressively more difficult the longer the chain is, and the distribution 
of the data to all participating nodes on the decentralized network in which it is expected honest nodes

a transaction is an exchange of assets that is managed under the entity service’s rules.",0
"such rules are usually 
operationalized through scripting languages (e.g.",0
"bitcoin’s forth) and are used for advanced transactions 
(such as escrow and multi-party signatures) to be performed.",0
"these rules also form the basis for smart 
contracts.",0
"a smart contract is a set of logic rules in the form of a coded script which can be embedded into the 
blockchain to govern a transaction.",0
"the contract is executed autonomously and is used to govern the 
transaction (buterin, ).",0
"in this way, contracts act as smart software agents (stark, ).",0
"once a smart 
contract is embedded in the blockchain, it becomes an autonomous agent that is permanently tamperproof.",0
"an application then reads the code when performing a transaction, executes and processes the results.",0
the contract nature of a smart contract isn’t just restricted to application specific code.,0
"it can also be 
used to codify the terms and condition of an agreement into the transaction workflow.",0
"ethereum (the second 
largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin) is an alt-coin technology that has been designed to support smart 
contracts.",0

.. consensus & trust 
in events surrounding nuclear disarmament near end of the cold war, president regan made a russian 
proverb famous: “trust, but verify.” the same could be claimed for blockchain.",0
"it is trusted by consensus as 
all parties must have identical copies of the blockchain; but each participant is responsible for verifying it.",0
"blockchain’s decentralization is a core strength, as a copy of the database file is owned by all actors.",0
"in 
order to ensure the integrity of each copy, a consensus algorithm is required.",0
"the consensus algorithm allows 
the community to ensure that each added block is legitimate.",0
"it also prevents attackers from compromising 
and forking the chain (coindesk, ).",0
"nakamoto suggested using a proof-of-work approach, in which a 
hard cryptographic puzzle must be solved by miners (nakamoto, ).",0
"miners expend computing resources 
and are rewarded for their efforts using various incentives.",0
"other consensus models such as proof-of-stake, 
proof-of-burn, proof-of-elapsed-time, and proof-of-capacity have been proposed in the literature to overcome 
some of the weaknesses of the original proof-of-work model by attempting to balance fairness and resource 
expenditure (kiayias et al., ; zamfir, ).",0
the nature of blockchain is trustless.,0
"blockchain is designed to eliminate the need for any one entity to 
gate transactions.",0
"it establishes a trust model based on a group consensus, where the network validates 
transactions and authorizes their addition to the chain.",0
"there are no middlemen; the notion of trust becomes 
implicit as each record in the blockchain is verified by the community which holds multiple copies of the 
blockchain.",0
"by removing trust agents from transactions, blockchain has the ability to disrupt many major 
industries.",0
traditional transaction models rely on central authority to act in the clearinghouse role.,0
"trust is granted 
to the central authority with an expectation that it will remain honest while verifying and clearing 
transactions.",0
the instances of records reside with the authority.,0
"if the central authority is compromised, either 
intentionally (manipulation) or unintentionally (hacked), the interlocutor can wreak extensive havoc on the 
system.",0
"the blockchain model eliminates the central authority (figure ) by instead disseminating copies of 
the records to all parties.",0
each participant maintains their own instance of the blockchain.,0
"they broadcast 
changes by forming new blocks and requesting validation based on the rules of the consensus model.",0
"once 
validated, the block is added to everyone’s chain.",0
"the process is potentially safer than the traditional model, 
and the middleman agent isn’t required, invoking a disruption to the status quo.",0
"traditional vs blockchain transaction model 
a blockchain relies on mathematics via cryptography to establish independent trust for each transaction, 
and on computationally expensive consensus models to replace central authorities.",0
"pools of recent 
transactions are ordered into a block.",0
"the block is then cryptographically linked to a chain of blocks (the 
blockchain) and is verified through a consensus model that involves significant computing resources 
(mining).",0
"as the blockchain is an open-access file replicated on multiple full-nodes of the network, no one 
entity controls the transaction list.",0
"since each block is hashed and inserted into the chain, it is immutable and 
serves as a final record of past transactions.",0
"an entity cannot change the chain without changing all blocks 
that follow it, an effort which is computationally hard and expensive.",0
"this secures the blockchain and 
establishes trust independent of a central authority.",0
".. public and private blockchains 
blockchains can be classified as public, private or hybrid variants, depending on their application (buterin, 
; mougayar, ): 
isbn: ---- © 

 public – public blockchains have no single owner; are visible by anyone; their consensus process is 
open to all to participate in; and they are full decentralized.",0
"bitcoin is an example of a public 
blockchain.",0
" private – (also called permissioned) private blockchains use privileges to control who can read from 
and write to the blockchain.",0
"consensus algorithms and mining usually aren’t required as a single 
entity has ownership and controls block creation.",0
" hybrid – also known as consortium, these blockchains are public only to a privileged group.",0
"the 
consensus process is controlled by known, privileged servers using a set of rules agreed to by all 
parties.",0
"copies of the blockchain are only distributed among entitled participants; the network is 
therefore only partly decentralized.",0
"although a public blockchain distributes itself in a decentralized peer-to-peer fashion, this isn’t 
necessarily true for a private blockchain.",0
"private blockchains are those used by enterprises to record asset 
transactions within a limited user base (restricted scope).",0
"hybrid blockchains can be visualized as very small 
scale public blockchains; they are decentralized only across a limited participant base.",0
"as a summary, we can formalize the afore-noted features of the blockchain into a list of four core 
characteristics: 
 immutable – (permanent and tamper-proof) a blockchain is a permanent record of transactions.",0
"once a block is added, it cannot be altered.",0
this creates trust in the transaction record.,0
" decentralized – (networked copies) a blockchain is stored in a file that can be accessed and copied 
by any node on the network.",0
" consensus driven – (trust verification) each block on the blockchain is verified independently via a 
consensus models which provide rules for validating a block, and often use a scarce resource (such 
as computing power) to show proof that adequate effort was made.",0
"in bitcoin, this is referred to as 
the mining process.",0
"this mechanism works without the use of a central authority or an explicit  
trust-granting agent.",0
" transparent – (full transaction history) since the blockchain is an open file, any party can access it 
and audit transactions.",0
"this creates provenance under which asset lifetimes can be tracked. 
. towards a definition 
there are many different blockchain definitions offered, ranging from application-specific to the excessively 
technical.",0
"for example, coinbase, the  world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, defines blockchain as “a
distributed, public ledger that contains the history of every bitcoin transaction” (coinbase, ).",0
"as an 
application-specific definition, this characterization does not account for the fact that blockchains can be 
reused for other cryptocurrencies and industry applications independently.",0
"the oxford english dictionary 
broadens the definition somewhat, defining blockchain as “a digital ledger in which transactions made in 
bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly” (oxford dictionaries, ).",0
"this definition also falls short as blockchain technology can be used independently of bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies.",0
"both these definitions also highlight the role of a blockchain as a digital ledger, and much 
of the literature would agree with this.",0
"however, this domain is evolving rapidly, and ledger usage is simply 
a feature of the blockchain but not its essence.",0
"this feature only pertains to blockchain applications that focus 
on managing the exchange of value in the case of virtual assets.",0
"a somewhat broader definition is offered by webopedia where a blockchain is defined as “a type of data 
structure that enables identifying and tracking transactions digitally and sharing this information across a 
distributed network of computers, creating in a sense a distributed trust network.",0
"the distributed ledger 
technology offered by blockchain provides a transparent and secure means for tracking the ownership and 
transfer of assets” (stroud, ).",0
"while this definition succeeds in capturing more of the characteristics of 
blockchain, it highlights distribution as a key feature of blockchain computing without acknowledging that 
blockchains are not just a distributed technology, but also a decentralized one (swan, b; wright and de 
                                                          
 websites such as www.blockchain.info provide this service online.",0
"th iadis international conference information systems 

filippi, ).",0
"the key distinction here is that while a distributed system partitions work among participants 
in an optimal fashion, a blockchain requires that each and every participant maintain a full node of the system 
and enforce its rules independently.",0
"in a system where nodes operate on local information (decision locality) 
to accomplish goals rather than the result of a central ordering influence, this decentralization ensures that 
pulling the plug is near impossible – only one node needs to remain operational for the network to function.",0
"evidently, there is a need for a clear and concise definition of blockchain.",0
"based on the theoretical 
underpinnings of blockchain technology outlined in the previous sections, we provide the following 
definition of a blockchain:  
“a decentralized database containing sequential, cryptographically linked blocks of digitally signed 
asset transactions, governed by a consensus model.”
through this connotative definition, we aim to highlight the core constituents for blockchain technology 
in that it is a peer-to-peer networked database governed by a set of rules.",0
"furthermore, blockchains represent 
a shift away from traditional trust agents and a move towards transparency.",0
"as a technological building 
block, it permits applications from a broad swath of industries to take advantage of sharing, tracking, and 
auditing digital assets.",0
"the next section identifies potential opportunities and use-cases for blockchain 
technology in different industries. 
. blockchain business applications 
.",0
"value proposition of blockchain technology 
since the fundamental use-case for blockchain technology is to drive greater transparency and substantiate 
accuracy of transaction data across the digital information ecosystem, potential applications of such 
technology are practically endless.",0
"in addition to virtual currencies such as bitcoin, a multitude of other 
potential blockchain applications and services have been envisioned and discussed by industry pundits and 
technology research firms (cbinsights, ; mougayar, ).",0
"these elements constitute the crux of blockchain business applications by 
facilitating the creation, management and transfer of digital assets through automated validation rules, 
cryptographically verified rights and ownerships, and the validation of transactions without requiring 
intermediaries.",0
"using a blockchain platform implies that each of these six elements is programmable, and by 
disintermediating these facets, blockchains can enable new services to come to market with cheaper 
transaction fees and faster execution.",0
"in this way, blockchain technology is poised to disrupt many business 
models which rely on (often costly) intermediaries.",0
"mougayar () also classifies the role of blockchains as spanning four aspects: blockchain as a 
development platform; blockchain as a smart contract utility; blockchain as a marketplace, and finally, 
blockchain as a trusted service application (rosic, ).",0
"these potential roles are discussed herewith. 
. blockchain as a development platform 
at present, the development of blockchain applications and services requires a highly specialized skillset, and  
the state of the blockchain developer toolkits is immature (aru, ).",0
"the introduction of blockchain as a 
service (baas) platforms such as those by microsoft (azure) and ibm (cloud) provide an inexpensive 
environment for developers to rapidly prototype on test blockchains before deploying to live ones (sofia, 
).",0
"other examples in this space include technology platforms that enable secure sharing of data across 
industrial networks through blockchain’s tamperproof ledgers (e.g.",0
"xage); and technologies that offer 
blockchain enabled verification of data transactions (e.g.",0
"these baas solutions form the basis 
for programmable trust, ownership and identity, and also facilitate the operation and governance of enterprise 
blockchain applications and services.",0
"blockchain as a smart contract utility 
smart contracts provide a programmatic interface to blockchains.",0
"smart contract utility is defined as “being 
able to perform useful functions to create, maintain or augment the value of digital assets” (sorin et al., 
).",0
"the smart contract, when triggered, transacts value based on digital assets.",0
"utility is captured in code 
and stored on the blockchain.",0
this code is executed when a predetermined condition occurs.,0
"activities often 
managed by third party central authorities are mitigated to the blockchain instead, disintermediating 
transactions (mougayar, ).",0
"examples include escrow, multi-party transactions, digital notarization, and 
time stamping.",0
"blockchain startups such as r are collaborating with banks and regulators to operationalize 
blockchains as a new operating system for financial markets (irrera, ).",0
"a specific instance of this 
functionality can be observed in the example of visa and docusign who have partnered to operate a  
proof-of-concept blockchain project to streamline vehicle leasing experience for customers by simplifying 
transaction management between multiple parties including sellers, buyers and insurance companies (hirson, 
). 
. blockchain as a marketplace 
any robust ecosystem requires a market for generating value.",0
"in the cryptoeconomics marketplace, 
blockchain provides a payment infrastructure (via cryptocurrencies) and a proof-of-ownership structure (via 
digital asset tracking).",0
"this has enabled peer-to-peer marketplaces with no governing authority, such as 
openbazaar and soma providing accessible, disintermediated trade (cbinsights, ).",0
"in these 
marketplaces, blockchain platforms can be used to directly match buyers and sellers allowing them to 
transact through smart contracts.",0
"blockchain technology is also being touted as an enabler for next generation 
online workforce marketplaces in the context of the gig economy that relies on independent contract workers 
and freelancers for short-term engagements, and the shared economy where consumers increasingly become 
prosumers.",0
"in such instances, blockchain platforms can ensure that service providers are not constrained by 
any central authority – hence, allowing them to extend flexible offerings, and payment interactions and 
service transactions can function in a transparent environment (aitken, ).",0
"overall, as a marketplace enabler, blockchains can be used to operationalize programmable assets, 
ownership and money. 
. trusted-service application 
finally, in its role as a trusted service application, blockchain technology comprises end-to-end functionality 
by facilitating highly specialized applications for any purpose imaginable.",0
"this more generalized use of 
blockchains to enable all types of applications through a combination of programmable assets, trust, 
ownership, money, identity, and contracts is sometimes referred to as blockchain .",0
"on the front-end, trusted service applications built on the blockchain using smart contracts can 
provide disintermediated, secure services to end users.",0
"on the backend, many of these applications reside on 
public blockchains (e.g.",0
bitcoin and ethereum) which cannot be shut down or restricted.,0
"furthermore, many 
companies now provide apis (application programming interface) allowing developers to build applications 
using blockchain protocols and mechanisms (bheemaiah, ).",0
"based on our discussion of potential blockchain business applications, we propose the following x 
matrix (  
figure ) for mapping industry sectors against blockchain scope (public vs private vs hybrid), and 
blockchain access (as a service or as application).",0
"in this context, an application refers to “a program 
designed to perform a function or a suite of related functions of benefit to an end user” (horak, ), while 
a service is “a transport of data and/or applications”  (horak, ).",0
"th iadis international conference information systems 

  
figure .",0
"blockchain access-vs-scope matrix
in order to map horizontal markets on to the above matrix, each offering can be assessed against the 
following criteria: 
 access - is the primary function to transform data (an application) or to present data (service)?",0
 scope - is blockchain usage globally unrestricted (public) or enterprise permissioned (private)?,0
"for contrast, consider the examples of health care and real estate.",0
"the health care industry is seeking to 
facilitate secure transit of patient records via the blockchain.",0
"access is therefore service oriented while the 
scope remains private to health care partners.",0
"in comparison, the real estate industry has shown interest in 
investigating blockchain for land registration records.",0
"this application is meant to be open and transparent to 
the public.",0
"overall, these current and envisioned use-cases for blockchain technology are poised to create a global 
decentralized yet trusted value ecosystem that can lead to exciting new economic opportunities in the public 
and private sectors alike. 
. conclusion 
this paper offers a conceptual overview of blockchains through a description of its underlying technological 
functions and a discussion of its potential business applications.",0
"as outlined, contemporary and future 
blockchain-based innovations span a myriad of use-cases and industries beyond digital currency and the 
financial sector.",0
"taking this into consideration, we offer a connotative definition that specifies the core 
elements of blockchain technology independent of bitcoin.",0
"furthermore, we describe various functional 
characteristics of blockchain mechanisms, and offer examples of business applications where these 
mechanisms can potentially be useful.",0
"on balance, blockchain technology can lower financial transaction costs ...

"for mason (), the less expensive nature and speed of transactions

via blockchain will be the primary reasons for its revolution in the banking industry, whilst the
citigroup () identifies cost savings as the main value of blockchains in the immediate future.",0
"the origins of blockchain technology dates back to the invention of bitcoin as a response to
the financial crisis in  (nakamoto, ).",0
"as as the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions
(the public ledger is freely accessible via  this main
technological innovation called blockchain is expected to prove to be more significant than bitcoin
itself (swan, ).",0
"as a simple example, figure  below presents a graphical view of how
blockchain technology can facilitate a transaction between two parties.",0
"as fedak () asserts,
blockchain not only makes big data even bigger, but also contributes by making big data more
secure and valuable, as blockchain-ed big data is structured and ready for big data analytics.",0
"for
banks in particular, blockchain has the potential to save costs through reduced transaction and
processing costs, but competition is also likely to increase as new fintech startups emerge given
the opportunity to start a bank with lower costs (iskandar, ).",0
"furthermore, technological
innovation (fintech) has a positive relationship with bank’s profitability according to a research
by rega () which considered  european banks.",0
"thus, embracing blockchains is the way
forward for the banking industry in terms of increasing the competitiveness with fintechs, and
enabling the ability to use the technology to create new business models (kocianski, ).",0

tional food and agriculture conglomerate cargill using rs corda scalable blockchain platform

"interestingly, even
in countries like zimbabwe where the ownership of cryptocurrencies is illegal, the reserve bank
of zimbabwe is said to be considering the implementation of blockchain (cook, a).",0
"the above examples give the reader an indication with regard to the ongoing disruption by
blockchain technology in banking.",0
"() states, the banking industry
is not yet ready to fully exploit what blockchain technology has to offer, and this is partly
because banks fail to appreciate blockchain as an enabling technology (citigroup, ).",0
"in
hope of encouraging more research and development into blockchain technology in banking from
both academic researchers and bankers alike, this paper aims to provide the most comprehensive
review of the opportunities and challenges for the adoption of blockchain in banking.",0
"the consideration of challenges are
equally important as there are several hurdles to overcome before blockchain can truly transform
banking (marr, ).",0
"it is noteworthy that peters and panayi () presented a systematic
discussion on the benefits of blockchain technology in a banking setting, and that cocco et al.",0
"() looked into the opportunities and challenges of implementing blockchain across banking
with a focus on cost savings and energy efficiency.",0
"in contrast, our paper evaluates the overall
opportunities (briefly noted above) and the related challenges from the banking industry’s view
point by relying on both industry and academic research into the subject.",0
"also, to the best of
our knowledge, this paper is the first and most comprehensive review of blockchain in banking to
date, covering both industry and academic research into the subject area with over  articles
and publications being reviewed and summarised for the reader.",0
"as this review is being undertaken, the banking industry is making significant strides into
the blockchain.",0
"bank-based blockchain projects are expected to transform the financial services
industry and ibm-backed hyperledger fabric project, the utility settlement coin, and rs
blockchain consortium are few such examples (harsono, ).",0
"the forex settlement giant cls
has partnered with ibm in creating a blockchain app store for banks which is now in its final
testing stages and is expected to standardize global forex markets and reduce costs (partz,

"however, there is also evidence of resistance towards the adoption of
blockchain in banking.",0
"for example, whilst visa is exploring the possibilities with distributed
ledger technologies, its chief executive officer stated that they do not currently see the potential
for blockchain in its core business (kulkarni, ).",0
"other banks are opting to embrace the cloud
at the expense of blockchain technology for the time being (noto, ).",0

"finally, we present some concise
conclusions for the future of blockchain in banking.",0
"blockchain-ed opportunities in banking
.",0
"a better way to know your customer (kyc)
verifying the authenticity of consumer identities is a frequent and important task for banks ow-
ing to anti money laundering regulations (sarnitz and maier, ).",0
"given the ever increasing
problems of terrorism, kyc is a crucial aspect related to the prevention of criminal use of bank-
ing funds and services in the form of money laundering and terrorism (marr, ).",0
"however,
kyc also represents a significant cost for banks with thomson reuters () estimating that
financial institutions spend between  million -  million usd per annum to keep up with
kyc.",0
"therefore, the current kyc processes are not only expensive, but also inefficient and
feeds towards poor customer experience for banks (walker, ).",0
"in addition, th eu money
laundering directive requires consumer data to be monitored and constantly updated (wolos,
) whilst the general data protection regulation (gdpr) requires strict internal controls
pertaining to consumer security (walker, ).",0
"as such, blockchain technology, if implemented correctly for kyc can be extremely useful.",0
"this is because, the use of blockchain technology can do away with the need for filling out endless
kyc questionnaires when opening a bank account (sarnitz and maier, ).",0
"an example of a
blockchain based kyc process in banking is demonstrated via figure .",0
"figure : an example of a blockchain based kyc process (persistent systems, ).",0
"as lang (a) states, blockchain can enable banks to share customer information across
their company securely and thereby simplify the administrative process by reducing unnecessary
duplication of information and requests.",0
"blockchain helps cut down on duplication as it can allow
the independent verification of one client by one bank to be accessed by other banks (marr,
).",0
"standardized sharing of customer account opening information using blockchain creates
a single non-editable kyc record further demonstrating compliance with regulations (walker,
).",0
"to this end, recently, several banks completed a kyc app test on the r blockchain
platform (partz, b) whilst a major polish bank, pko bp started using a blockchain-based
document management system earlier this year (biggs, ).",0
"yet another emerging trend is the
increasing importance of inclusivity across sectors.",0
"blockchain technology could also be a means
of enhancing inclusivity in banking as consumers who do not have a credit score can create
a verifiable, decentralised, self-sovereign digital identity and thereby gain access to banking
services (garcia, a).",0
"as luu () asserts, efforts to kyc are more important today than
ever before as decentralization of cryptocurrencies opens it up to the risk of money laundering
and terrorism financing.
. improved transaction speeds
you thought digital payments were fast?",0
"the use of blockchain technology can enable banks
to speed up the time to settlement through the certainty it provides by enabling individuals
and corporations to transact directly and view the same ledger of transactions updated through
consensus and made immutable through cryptography (lang, a).",0
"in fact, tapscott and
tapscott () notes that settlement times can be cut down to minutes or seconds via blockchain
technology whilst ho () alerts us of the possibility of processing bank transaction /.",0
"decentralising via blockchain speeds transactions further as it can enable buyers and sellers
to deal forex in real time in addition to doing away with the need for intermediaries for processing
transactions (hillsberg, ).",0
"moreover, traditional banking practices and local banking stan-
dards dictate various necessities for financing which results in significant delays in completing a
single transaction (lowry, ).",0
"blockchain allows trade partners to interact with greater trust
by using a shared version of the truth about transactions in real-time and thereby increasing
efficiency with regard to access to funding and saving time throughout the trade process (smith
a; lang a).",0
"companies like ripple ( are completing cross-border payments today

in seconds (sarwar, ) but swift is competing rapidly without blockchain technology by
showing that nearly % of gpi payments are credited to end beneficiaries within  minutes,
and almost % of payments within  hours (wass, ).",0
"as the average transaction rates
have reached  to  transactions per second (tps) for blockchain technologies, miyamae
et al.",0
"() proposed a more efficient application programming interface between containers and
achieved a transaction rate improvement by %.",0
"asian banks are also exploiting blockchain
with banks in india turning to blockchain to speed up internal trade deals (satija and antony,
).",0
"furthermore, mitsubishi ufj financial from tokyo is to launch a  million transactions
per second blockchain payment platform in  (asia times, ) whilst more recently, taka-
hashi () noted that liqueneqs blockchain bank payments scales to millions of transactions
per second for both commercial and consumer purposes.",0
"however, not all authors agree that blockchain will be the answer to improved transaction
speeds.",0
"for example, marr () highlights that the complex, encryption based and distributed
nature of blockchain transactions can take a considerable amount of time to process when com-
pared to traditional payment systems, and therefore requires more advances in engineering and
processing speeds which leads to several challenges which are considered later on.
. enhanced security
security is of paramount importance to the banking industry.",0
"as tapscott and tapscott ()
stated, % of financial intermediaries are experiencing economic crimes in comparison to the
% and % for the professional services and technology sectors.",0
"therefore, applying blockchain
for extra sense of security is a critical component of the future digital banking model (maiya,
).",0
"blockchain can offer enhanced security for banking data as historical information cannot
be altered and the new information which is added in real-time is essentially shared by multiple
entities and thus making it difficult to manipulate the data (garcia, b; harsono ).",0
"as
patel () points out, any alterations to data within a block can be tracked and monitored
to prevent fraud and misuse and more importantly blockchain technology allows for real-time
communication and updating on potential scams (patel, ).",0
"blockchain is also affecting the antecedents of trust including confidence, integrity, reliabil-
ity, responsibility and predictability (beck, ).",0
"the transparency in blockchain’s distributed
ledger is also useful as it would enable regulators to easily scrutinize financial actions (tap-
scott and tapscott, ).",0
"as a trust network, consumer data stored via blockchain can only
be accessed by trusted sources in addition to the data security attainable via the encryption
capabilities of blockchain (patel, ).",0
"blockchain can also achieve simultaneous security and
privacy by enabling confidentiality through “public key infrastructure” and by maintaining the
size of a ledger (schou-zibell and phair, ).",0
"since the  financial crisis, there has been a surge in the importance of risk management
and the development of risk management capability (silva et al., ).",0
"furthermore, loan asset
integrity is identified as a major problem leading to the  financial crisis (moore, ).",0
"to this end, the adoption of blockchain in banking can enable low risk credit transactions.",0
"for example,the global debt registry ( is evaluating
the use of blockchains to ensure the integrity of loan assets and protect pledged assets on the
network from errors or misrepresentation in the future (moore, ).",0
"assets can be placed
on the decentralized ledger which will generate an immutable record of each asset, enabling all
participants in the lending ecosystem to trust and be certain they are looking at the same loan
data (moore, ; tapscott and tapscott, ).",0
fraud reduction is another form of enhanced security offered by blockchain technology.,0
"risk.net () recognised fraud as one of the top operational risks in  whilst pwc ()
notes that % of financial intermediaries suffer from economic crimes each year.",0
"the centralised
nature of banking systems make it more vulnerable to cyber attacks as it has one point of failure,
unlike with blockchains which are less susceptible to fraud as each block contains a timestamp
and holds batches of individual transactions with a link to a previous block (marr, ).",0
"in
india, there is an interest in evaluating whether blockchain technology can be a means of stop-
ping bank frauds (d’souza, ).",0
"as mauri (a) asserts, the distributed, immutable and
permissioned nature of blockchain will help prevent fraud.",0
"in fact, chiles santiago exchange
plans to use blockchain to technology to reduce errors and possible fraud in its short selling
system for securities lending (mauri, b).",0
"in addition, the uae’s emirates islamic was the
first islamic bank to adopt blockchain technology to issue new cheque books as a means of fraud
prevention (lyon, ) whilst the bank of thailand too is considering blockchains as a means
of fraud reduction (yakubowski, ).",0
"the recent facebook data scandal has heightened the
case for data privacy and blockchain can support this process as data can only be shared or sold
with the consent of the individual (garcia, a).",0
"technology giants such as microsoft ()
are also researching into developing ‘corda’ an enterprise-grade ledger that enables banks to
limit who sees what information and selectively share data with only relevant parties as a means
of reducing the risk of fraud.",0
"they also envision their efforts can lead to reducing many other
forms of banking risks in future.",0
"nevertheless, it is noteworthy that whilst many authors harp on the immutable nature
of blockchains, schou-zibell and phair () note that blockchains are technically prone to
modification.",0
"as such, the challenges pertaining to the security aspect of blockchain are dis-
cussed further in what follows.",0
"nevertheless, security expert frank abagnale is of the view that
blockchain is the future of secure information processing and data settlement (marinova, )
and english () notes that while blockchain is not immune to all forms of cyber risk, its
unique structure provides security capabilities not present in other legacy technologies.",0
"this is
because, the distributed nature and computing power required to make changes renders modi-
fication nearly impossible.",0
"in fact, altering a blockchain requires control of more than % of
computers in the same distributed ledger and alteration of all of the transactional records within
 minutes for bitcoin (schou-zibell and phair, ).",0
"those interested in more insights into
how blockchain is impacting the security landscape in banking are referred to gupta ().
. cost reductions
economics will always play an influential role in the adoption of technology, and its no different
when it comes to blockchain technology.",0
"the banking sector will have to consider a cost/benefit
analysis to determine the feasibility of implementing blockchain.",0
"first and foremost, the en-
hanced trust made possible by blockchain can reduce friction that comprises all kinds of direct
and indirect costs and efforts due to the lack of trust, and bring certainty via transaction logic
instantiated as code (beck, ).",0
"() summarized that the permission-less
and non-territorial features of blockchain can significantly reduce the institutional exit costs.",0
"in
brief, accenture () concluded that blockchain can result in dramatic costs savings for bank-
ing along the lines of  billion usd whilst a  goldman sachs report (as cited by garcia
(b)) suggests that blockchain technology could save financial institutions between  and 
billion usd per annum via reductions to the number of mistakes that result in fees and higher
operating costs.",0
"according to santander, blockchain-based solutions could generate cost savings
of up to  billion usd per annum (meola, ).",0
"in addition, settlement periods resulting from traditional banking processes cost the financial

industry between - billion usd per annum and blockchain has the potential to reduce or
even eliminate settlement times (harsono, ).",0
"further cost reductions are made possible by
doing away with the need for intermediaries (marr, ) and their associated charges when
completing bank transactions in a world where global enterprises could pay up to usd for an
international transaction (hillsberg, ).",0
"the ability to share information openly across banks
via the blockchain system would also significantly reduce administrative costs for compliance
departments (marr, ).",0
"those interested in a more detailed discussion on cost savings from
blockchain for banking are referred to cocco et al.",0
"(), and nguyen () for an outlook
from the sustainable development perspective.",0
"below, some practical examples of cost reductions
made possibly by blockchain are presented.",0
"ibm’s blockchain app store (ledgerconnect) is a sound example of how blockchain can
help reduce back-end costs for banks by providing financial companies access to seven vetted
blockchain vendors enabling banks to streamline their trading processes and back-end opera-
tions by establishing one set of records (garcia, b).",0
"there is also evidence that the icici
bank and emirates nbd are researching into the use of blockchain technology for reducing
transactional costs (higgins, ).",0
"furthermore, banks can reduce infrastructure costs by %
using blockchain technology, which translates into savings of - billion usd annually (ngo,
).",0
"finally, the central bank of india estimates cost reductions between - billion usd
by  via the use of blockchain for interbank transactions (richter, ).",0
"banks can also seek
to integrate fintechs as service providers and this will prevent costly interaction efforts (drasch
et al., ).",0
"therefore, it is evident that significant cost reductions are attainable through
the adoption of blockchain technology, however, the challenges around investments required for
setting up the systems are discussed later on.
. smart contracts
contracts are complex and time consuming affairs in the financial world.",0
"blockchains can be used
to create smart contracts by programming and storing a computer code that can be executed
to create contracts or authorise financial transactions once two or more parties enter their keys
and meet a certain set criteria (marr, ).",0
"figure  below summarises the process underlying
smart contracts.",0
"the accenture technology vision () report found % of all surveyed
executives believing that blockchain and smart contracts would be critical over the next three
decades.",0
"figure : smart contracts simplified (institute of international finance, ).",0
there is evidence of the banking sector already exploiting smart contracts.,0
"for example, gat-

teschi et al.",0
"() has systematically analyzed the implementations of blockchain based smart
contracts in insurance and finance.",0
"furthermore, a smart contract for travel insurance and au-
tomatically issuing refunding was developed based on the ethereum blockchain by bertani et al.",0
"() whilst the commonwealth bank of australia exploited smart contracts with blockchain
technology to monitor and track the shipment of  tonnes of almonds (mittal, ).",0
"however,
as sarnitz and maier () argue, smart contracts could make the role of banks in contract
management redundant in future.",0
"thus, banks must look into ways in which it can exploit smart
contracts and the related technology to its benefit and one such option would be to become the
provider of the said facility.",0
"those interested in more details around blockchains and smart
contracts are referred to alharby and van moorsel ().
. more transactions with more transparency
as it stands, there is considerable disagreement within the banking industry with regard to the
transaction capacity of blockchain technology.",0
"as a result, this issue is both an opportunity
and challenge (discussed later on).",0
"currently, visa’s transaction capacity is at , tps,
but research and development into ethereum’s plasma multi-child-chain solution blockchain
technology has the potential to enable  million tps (cook, a).",0
"in addition, japans mit-
subishi ufj financial group (mufg) is also competing with ethereum by researching into a
blockchain-based financial-transaction solution capable of conducting over  million tps (cook,
a).",0
"more recently, the south africa reserve bank used blockchain technology to settle the
country’s typical , daily payment transactions within two hours (average settlement rate
of - seconds per transaction) while preserving full anonymity (zhao, a).",0
"transparency is an increasingly important consideration along side the increase in transaction
capacities.",0
"whilst the traditional banking system is extremely secretive, blockchain technology
presents means of making the entire banking process more transparent and secure as it locks
records and then enables users to access the full historical data with possibilities of giving
authorised parties only access to shared transaction ledgers (hillsberg, ).",0
"moreover, any
changes made to public blockchains are publicly viewable by all parties (ho, ).",0
"in fact,
as tapscott and tapscott () asserts, blockchain technology can lower or even eliminate
the need for trust in transactions and make auditing transparent and real-time.",0
"it is also
promising for automating financial reporting (collomb and sok, ) and the transparent
nature of blockchain allows banks and regulators to communicate in real-time and enables swift
action when compliance violations take place (patel, ).",0
"blockchain-ed challenges in banking
.",0
"costs and standardization requirements
developing a blockchain enabled system is a high cost affair, and if the banking industry is
to make the most of the system, then it should be standardized across banks (walker, ).",0
"for example, for kyc information to be usefully shared across the banking industry, a common
policy on identification and verification of consumers is mandatory (walker, ).",0
"as clarence-
smith () asserts, kyc blockchain-based registries are unlikely to get buy-in from all banks
because of their wariness about relying completely on third party verifications of data.",0
"as it stands, each bitcoin transaction costs about .",0
"usd and can only store  bytes of
data (bauerle, ).",0
"the lack of harmonized industry standards (schou-zibell and phair, ),
unless addressed, will be a major hindrance to the adoption and development of blockchain in

banking.",0
"bech and garratt () proposed the money flower taxonomy of money, where the
central bank creates its own cryptocurrency.",0
"to this end, the bank of canada is validating the
implementation of a digital currency cad-coin for the use of interbank transfers (iansiti and
lakhani, ).",0
another concern is the energy cost required to power blockchain algorithms.,0
"if we take
bitcoin as an example, galeon () pointed out that the energy required to mine bitcoin is
equivalent to more energy than what  countries consume in a year.",0
"in fact, if cryptocurrencies
were to grow to % of global money supply, it is estimated that the processing would require
% of the energy consumed by china (caplen, ).",0
"moreover, as a result of electricity costs,
the single transaction cost for bitcoin can vary between - usd (bloomberg, ).",0
"the cost of storage is yet another growing concern for blockchain technology in banking
with some estimating that the long-term storage cost per gigabyte for a bitcoin node will exceed
 million usd or more (bloomberg, ).",0
"there is also a cost in terms of lost revenue for
banks.",0
"this is because blockchain technology threatens the livelihood of middlemen and banks
make huge profits playing this role (marr, ).",0
"however, to support the wide adoption of
blockchain, e-identity validation services will be crucial, for which, the banks may still be able
to take significant role as a trusted organization (buitenhek, ).",0
"therefore, the question
remains as to whether the cost reductions from adopting blockchain technology can in fact
outweigh the operating costs of maintaining same.
. currency stability
bankers are not open to the use of bitcoin as a currency (hillsberg, ).",0
"one major concern
for the adoption of blockchain payments in banking is the stability of the underlying currency,
especially as the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile (luu, ).",0
"currency stability
is crucial for ensuring that neither the buyer nor the seller loses out in trade due to price
fluctuations (lund, ).",0
"instead of regular crytocurrencies, lund () suggests a ‘stable coin’ which is basically a
digital token that will have low price volatility as a result of being pegged to some underlying
fiat currency, thereby acting as a store of value, a medium of exchange and unit of accounting
for blockchain payments.",0
"an example of a stable coin is stronghold usd (corradino, )
which is backed by usd deposits and is currently undergoing research and development at ibm
as a credible token for blockchain payments (lund, ).",0
"another example is the digital coin
called utility settlement coin backed by six of the world’s largest banks with the aim of allowing
financial groups to pay each other or to buy securities without waiting for traditional money
transfers to be completed (arnold, ; harsono, ).
. security
the security element features as both an opportunity and challenge for the adoption of blockchain
in banking.",0
it is no secret that banking requires high security.,0
"historically, banks had to only
be concerned with protecting their safes and deposits in high street banks.",0
"the move to online
banking saw the emergence of a new security threat from hackers around the globe, thus cre-
ating a job market for cyber security and increased costs for banks.",0
"in the recent past, cyber
attacks have resulted in losses of  million usd in the banking sector and therefore, banks
are cautious with regard to letting its financial data sit outside their secure firewall (hillsberg,
).",0
"as a security measure, miners can verify daily records in the blockchain, but given that trans-
actions are irreversible, manual data entry errors can prove extremely problematic (hillsberg,

).",0
"satoshi nakamoto highlighted the ‘% attack’ which means if half of the computers
working as nodes to service the network tell a lie, the lie will become the truth (bauerle, ).",0
"data privacy too remains a concern within blockchain technology as transactions can be seen
throughout network nodes which produce meta data leading to pattern recognition (schou-zibell
and phair, ).",0
"however, “self-sovereign identity” which allows consumers to control personal
information and have better control over with whom they share it is an emerging solution to
the privacy concerns (schou-zibell and phair, ).",0
"also, it is noteworthy that blockchains are
more secure than a centralised system in many ways (schou-zibell and phair, ).",0
another security challenge posed by blockchain is anonymity.,0
"as blockchain technology al-
lows for anonymity, such untraceable transactions would threaten the banking sector and the
regulator as it increases the difficulty to tax and can also aid criminals with money laundering
(cook, a).",0
"for retaining privacy to its maximum extent, there are cryptographic techniques
like zero knowledge proofs, which allows the block verification and transaction correctness with-
out providing visibility into the details of the transactions (eyal, ).",0
"as a possible solution,
more countries are moving towards crypto and initial coin offering (ico) legislation (cook,
b; cook a).
. legislation & regulations
in an early review by guo and liang (), the authors addressed the significance of es-
tablishing a regulatory sandbox, so that the implementation and operation of blockchain will
have a restricted scope and still maintain sufficient space for innovation.",0
"red tapes associated
with central bank rules and bank secrecy regulations are adversely impacting the adoption of
blockchain in banking with government intervention likely to be blocked further by lobbyists
battling against this disruption (hillsberg, ).",0
"the general data protection regulation
(gdpr) and other privacy laws too hinder the full exploitation of blockchain technology in
banking.",0
"a recent report suggests that regulators are now working with banks to develop more
blockchain friendly regulatory frameworks (kocianski, ) whilst other authors are urging
central banks to start adapting to blockchain technology (thew, ).",0
"however, as iansiti
and lakhani () stated, every party of monetary transactions will be required to adopt it,
which challenges the government and institutions that have been overseeing and managing these
transactions for a long time.
. scalability
it is agreed that as it stands, blockchain has very limited transaction capacity (caplen, ).",0
"in
fact, limited scalability is one of the serious concerns underlying blockchain technology (schou-
zibell and phair, ).",0
"bitcoin was built to be decentralized and secure at the expense of
scalability (tomaino, ).",0
"this is formally referred to as the “scalability trilemma” in which
only two of three properties decentralization, security or scalability can be attained (schou-
zibell and phair, ).",0
"therefore, more research and development is required for enhancing
the scalability of the blockchain technology to process more transactions than visa for a start.",0
"there is also disagreement between the actual scalability of blockchains as thew ()
states, currently, the bitcoin blockchain can only process  tps whilst caplen () states
bitcoin can process only - tps in relation to visa’s  transactions per second.",0
"furthermore,
some central banks like de nederlandsche bank is of the view that distributed ledger technology
is not suitable for existing financial payment infrastructure owing to scalability restrictions for
large volumes of transactions (zhao, b).",0
"therefore, the scalability issues, when coupled with

the energy concerns, suggests that blockchain is more suited to wholesale banking solutions than
the mass market (caplen, ).",0
"discussion
the big data trend keeps getting bigger and blockchain will further add to increasing the size of
big data in banking, as well as influencing the exchanging or trading platform for big data (chen
and xue, ).",0
"therefore, any blockchains used in the banking sector will need the software
and infrastructure to handle big data as never seen before (marr, ).",0
"whilst blockchains are
likely to result in more structured big data, the analysis would have to overcome significant issues
pertaining to increased signal and noise ratios which are already a problem in pre-blockchain
era big data (hassani and silva, ).",0
"this in turn means that investments into research and development of denoising and signal
extraction in big data is likely to be a worthwhile investment for the banking sector.",0
"as an
example, we consider the number of bitcoin transactions added to the mempool per second
( as a proxy for banking
blockchain transactions in future.",0
"this is a reasonable assumption given that the entire globe
could be transacting on blockchain in future should the banking industry exploit the opportuni-
ties and overcome the aforementioned challenges.",0
"the proxy time series captures data for 
seconds from th july  to nd august  and is represented via the first time series
in figure .",0
"here, we rely on a filtering and forecasting technique called singular spectrum
analysis (see, hassani and silva (), silva et al.",0
"while the “disruptive” potential of blockchain has been extensively debated, scientific studies about 
the impact on business processes and professional practices remain scarce (weber, et al., ) and 
the development of business models remain primarily associated to the financial sector (e.g.",0
"for the 
first semester of  the global investment in fintech companies – across venture capital, private 
equity and mergers and acquisitions - hits $.",0
"billion which is well above ’s total investment 
results (kpmg, )).",0
"thus, the academic and professional literature mainly presents two kinds of 
contributions about blockchain:  
i) advantages and pitfalls of blockchain technology both from a technical and business perspective; 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
and  
ii) business applications mainly focusing on cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and traceability at 
large.",0
"in this context, compliance, control, and audit activities have been neglected in the academic and 
scientific community in analyzing their developments or proposing new business processes and 
services.",0
"the purpose of this study is to explore the perception of financial auditors and information systems 
(is) auditors working in audit firms of different size in switzerland on how the use of blockchain 
technology could impact practices in the audit profession.",0
"the innovative point of this study can be tied to the focus on the audit profession and more 
specifically on the view of professionals in practice regarding the potential impacts of blockchain 
technology on their daily work and profession as this sector is currently under-researched despite the 
significant disruptive potential.",0
the next section reviews the literature and related work.,0
"section two describes the research 
methodology.",0
the research results and discussion are presented in section three.,0
"section four 
concludes the paper with current and future work.",0
"i. literature review 
    blockchain technology is a distributed data structure, or ledger, in which transactions are recorded 
in append-only mode and verified through consensus algorithms (erbguth and morin, ).",0
"in other 
words, it is “a distributed general ledger recording that a transaction happened, when it happened and 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
that it happened correctly, without exposing any confidential details about the subject or the parties’ 
involved” and consists of a software protocol of its own (kehoe, et al., ).",0
"blockchain technology also offers users the feature to make transactions irrevocable (immutability) 
thus increasing accuracy and trustworthiness of records (lemieux, ; wespra, ) while at the 
same time simplifying back office processes.",0
"blockchain makes it possible to tie a set of rules or 
procedures to specific transactions to standardize process activities.",0
"from a conceptual perspective, blockchain technology provides a series of features, which can 
revolutionize some of the existing architectures in the digital business world.",0
"this transparent 
distributed database records each network’s user intervention and allows encoding rules and 
procedures within the platform at the transaction level.",0
"it allows business enterprises to create and run 
applications as well as conduct business without a central authority or server as a control point (trusted 
third parties).",0
"in this regard, blockchain technology helps businesses craft applications and conduct 
transactions, which can be self-executing and autonomous at the same time (dupont and maurer, 
).",0
"the autonomous, decentralized and secured capabilities characterizing blockchain technology 
can help in redefining the foundational patterns of business applications (schatsky and muraskin, 
; swan, ; mahajan et al., ).",0
"in today’s business ecosystem, financial auditors are the trusted professionals who guarantee the 
existence of transactions, attest of their evidence, accuracy, and completeness as well as the 
presentation of related information in financial statements (hayes et al., ).",0
"in order to fulfill these 
objectives, the auditors need a good understanding of the client business, it infrastructure and it 
systems relevant to financial reporting and controls in place.",0
"in order to do so, the international 
standards on auditing (ias) allows them to team up with is auditors to gather and interpret evidence 
(axelsen, et al., ; ias , ).",0
"in other 
words, is auditors evaluate the design and effectiveness of an organization’s it systems and internal 
controls against policies and regulations.",0
"audit and control functions have been mainly established to provide assurance to shareholders, 
regulators, governments and other stakeholders.",0
"all types of audits (financial, operational, compliance, 
governance, etc.)",0
"share the same characteristics and consist of systematic processes “of objectively 
obtaining and evaluating evidence regarding assertions about economic actions and events to ascertain 
the degree of correspondence between these assertions and established criteria and communicating the 
results to interested users.” (hayes et al., ).",0
"an audit ultimately aims at providing trust among its 
intended public.",0
"for example, the purpose of a financial audit is to enhance the degree of confidence 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
of financial statements readers (ifac  revised, ).",0
"spoke m., a senior consultant at deloitte 
canada, stresses that an audit is an opinion provided on the financial statements of companies based 
on pre-determined accounting guidelines.",0
"however, after scandals such as enron in  among the most notable, the global audit industry 
has lost its principal asset; public trust (spoke, ).",0
"this is highlighted by the literature which shows 
that trust in audit has been undermined due to scandals and is still in a recovery process within the 
public (mueller, carter and whittle, ; fearnley, beattie and brandt ; zabihollah, ).",0
"as a response to rebuild this trust, new regulations as well as accounting and auditing standards 
have been imposed, adding complexity, and increasing the cost of control activities and reporting for 
companies.",0
"those features could not only decrease the accounting, 
auditing and compliance costs but also transform and facilitate the work of auditors (spoke, ).",0
"it 
is clear that such technology can enable more efficient access to data and completion of financial audit.",0
"indeed, the fact that any asset or document can be codified and referenced or encapsulated by a ledger 
entry helps simplify the work of auditors and accounting professionals (schatsky and muraskin, ), 
and reduce the manual work (drane, ) while at the same time help to ensure complete transaction 
traceability.",0
"large international audit firms themselves foresee that the cost and time necessary to conduct an 
audit would decline considerably (allison, ; tysiac, ).",0
"it seems therefore reasonable to expect 
a significant increase in the commoditization of financial audit services (anderson, ) and a 
decrease of audit costs.",0
"kpmg llp and microsoft reported a partnership to 
create a series of innovation workspaces and other initiatives dedicated to developing use cases and 
applications of blockchain technology (alarcon, ).",0
"and pwc also created its 
global blockchain team and set up a blockchain experience lab that works in co-creation with 
industry experts.",0
"blockchain is also expected to reduce reliance on auditing for testing financial transactions 
providing an “automated third-party verification” (spoke, ).",0
"this could ultimately lead to the 
elimination of control and audit activities or at the least to a profound redefinition of those professions.",0
"for example, access could be granted to auditors and regulators, providing a “single source of the 
truth” (roberts, ) and allow for real time audit (macmanus, ).. another example is the 
confirmation process that could be eliminated from the auditors’ review process; especially 
confirmation of outstanding receivable and payable balances.",0
"however, even though blockchain technology offers many different features and seems to be 
secured, there are several existing challenges that need to be addressed.",0
"one major issue is 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
interoperability.",0
"interoperability is defined by the francophone association of free software users as 
“a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with 
other products or systems, present or future, in either implementation or access, without any 
restrictions”.",0
"as of today, even though multiple blockchain projects have been set up and some of them 
are even well established, such as bitcoin and ethereum, there are still interoperability issues among 
blockchain infrastructures.",0
"are currently being addressed by several erp vendors and technology 
companies (kacina, et al., ).",0
these systems are widely used across all industries nowadays.,0
"lastly, 
blockchain’s benefits are best realized when different industry participants come together to create a 
shared platform which increases interoperability challenges at two levels (pwc, ), first at the 
technical level as each participant’s systems need to be compatible with the shared blockchain and 
second at the blockchain governance level as each participant needs to agree on the shared network 
rules.",0
another key issue is the blockchain scalability.,0
"scalability is the ability for a system to continue to 
function well when it changes in size or volume - typically, to a larger size or volume (rouse, ).",0
"in the blockchain context the scalability issue arises when the number of participants increases over 
time.",0
"scalability has several components: latency, which is the “time for a transaction to confirm” 
(croman, ).",0
"as of today, latency takes at least  minutes with the blockchain bitcoin, and  
seconds for ethereum which is significantly more than current payment processing systems is.",0
"moreover,  % of transactions on public blockchains exceed  minutes, and  percent can exceed 
an hour (kanaracus, ; harris, ).",0
"potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
    size and storage are other important scalability components that need to be worked on.",0
"indeed, by 
design, the ledger of a blockchain contains all the transactions since the genesis block.",0
"thus, as the 
number of users and transactions grow, the size of the ledger also grows.",0
"bandwidth is also important as transactions need to be relayed through the network prior to being 
validated through consensus algorithm.",0
"indeed, when the number of users increases and consequently 
the number of transaction increases, a better network connectivity is necessary.",0
"good network 
connectivity and large storage capacity require effective record management leading to centralization, 
increased costs (harris, ), and more energy consumption.",0
"the last component of scalability is throughput referring to the maximal rate at which the network 
can work properly (i.e.",0
"transmit, receive and validate transactions).",0
"because of the design of the 
blockchain infrastructure, the number of transactions being transmitted, received and validated over 
the network is small in regard to other existing, centralized, infrastructures.",0
"with bitcoin, for example, 
the maximal rate is of approximately  transactions per second.",0
"this issue mainly concerns public 
blockchains and is already managed for private blockchains for which some infrastructures can already 
handle thousands of transactions per second.",0
there are other important types of risks.,0
"for example, credentials can be compromised or stolen, 
and there are concerns that it might be vulnerable to programming errors (such as in the decentralized 
autonomous organization or dao platform, which lost $ million in ) or systems weaknesses 
(such as the vulnerabilies behind the scandal of the bitcoin exchange, mt.",0
"this is also 
true for smart contracts.",0
"they are stand-alone programs that, once started, automatically execute pre-
defined conditions encoded within the blockchain.",0
"they work just like any conditional statement of 
the ""if - then"" type (if such a condition is satisfied, then such a consequence runs).",0
"no form or human 
intervention is needed to process those transactions.",0
"a study recently revealed that % of all smart 
contracts are fatally flawed (nikolic et al., ).",0
"another analysis performed by a blockchain security 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
company showed that among projects that have collectively raised $ billion, more than one quarter 
of them had critical vulnerabilities (de havilland, ).",0
"in addition to these technical challenges, the biggest barrier to blockchain adoption today as reported 
by pwc and deloitte in their reports (pwc, ; deloitte, ) is the regulatory uncertainty.",0
"indeed, 
even though many territories have begun studying and discussing the issues (pwc, ), particularly 
as they relate to financial services, the regulatory environment remains unsettled.",0
"overall, there are 
currently insufficient standards and controls in place to ensure that the systems are functioning as 
intended (alarcon, ).",0
"for example, in the european union it is unclear how any blockchain project 
can meet the general data protection regulation (gdpr) privacy standards (pwc, ).",0
blockchain impact on audit and control professions remains an under-researched area.,0
"in a context 
where blockchain developments flourish, our general hypothesis is that blockchain technologies have 
the potential to significantly disrupt and transform the audit and control work.",0
"research methodology 
    this section describes the methods used in developing the research, collecting and analyzing data.",0
the grounded theory approach was used for this research.,0
"strauss and corbin have defined grounded 
theory as “theory that was derived from data, systematically gathered and analyzed through the 
research process”, and charmaz and bryant as a method of qualitative inquiry in which researchers 
develop inductive theoretical analyses from their collected data.",0
"grounded theory was the selected 
research approach as it stresses the importance of allowing theoretical ideas to emerge from data 
(bryman, ) and provides a methodological framework to develop “emergent” theories that 
particularly fit exploratory studies such as this one where theoretical concepts have not yet been 
developed.",0
"research based on grounded theory “involves using multiple stages of data collection and 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
the refinement and interrelationship of categories of information” (creswell, ).",0
"the initial phase

is audit which has been defined by weber as “the process of collecting and evaluating evidences to 
determine whether a computer system safeguards assets, maintains data integrity, allows 
organizational goals to be achieved effectively and uses resources efficiently” (weber, ).",0
"as 
controls can be embedded into the technology, some auditors think that audit and accountancy firms 
will have to ensure that the technology is properly deployed and set-up and that automated controls 
are proper.",0
"as such, some of the interviewees hypothesized that auditors will be primarily “it engineer 
auditors” with specific it skills such as programming and not financial auditors as it is the case today, 
some even mentioned “blockchain auditors” whose function will be to certify blockchain.",0
"% of the interviewees anticipate that auditing firms will hire more is auditors in the very near 
future instead of financial auditors.",0
"more importantly they expect that auditing firms will hire new 
profiles such as analytics specialists, data scientists and statisticians.",0
"this is reinforced by the fact that 
today, in most cases, when the it environment is not complex, even though financial auditors are not 
it experts and have no training in is audit, they perform themselves is audit work by following a 
predetermined audit program to complete this part of the engagement (axelsen et al., ) as 
confirmed by the interviewees.",0
"however, blockchain technology is complex and not well understood 
by most financial auditors and even by many is auditors as demonstrated by the answers obtained.",0
"none of them has had hands-on experience with it and none of them knows how to audit such a 
technology.",0
"we noticed that  the two major auditing standards bodies, the international auditing and assurance 
standards board (iaasb), and the public company accounting oversight board (pcaob) do not 
dissociates technologies from one another and have both set up working groups to investigate “new 
technologies”, which include among other data analytics and blockchain.",0
"potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
    the interviewees also highlight the fact that there is currently no blockchain-specific auditing 
standard and report a lack of personal experience with this technology, suggesting the need for the 
audit firms to integrate new skills.",0
"as 
the scope of the audit is expected to shift, and as audit firms are expected to hire people with a wider 
range of skills, better interaction and better communication among financial and is auditors, and other 
specialists will be necessary for the audits to be as efficient, effective and of higher quality as 
anticipated by the use of new technologies.",0
"at the same time, % of the interviewees foresee that the traditional auditing workload will 
decrease.",0
"this trend appears to be in line with 
the literature that foresees efficiency gains as a result of the use of new technologies in auditing 
(raphae, ; sheehan, ; smith ).",0
"thus % of the interviewees think that auditors will 
therefore be able to focus on value added activities and provide better insights to their audit clients 
based on their professional judgment.",0
"this is aligned with current literature explaining that the 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
traditional role of data verification responsibilities will change and evolve over time, but the need for 
data interpretation and integration into strategy are positioned to grow and change moving forward 
(smith, ).",0
"some auditors also predict that they will be able to perform real time audit, as also mentioned in the 
literature.",0
"indeed, if operational and financial information is uploaded into the blockchain network on 
a continuous basis, and if auditors have continuous access to the blockchain used by their clients, then 
they will be able to analyze this information in a real time manner (banham ).",0
"real time review 
will also contribute to providing better insights to audit clients, thus not only increasing the value of 
the audit but also bringing audit quality to a new level as exceptions will be detected earlier and 
corrected by clients on a timely basis.",0
findings have some other implications for the audit firms.,0
"indeed ‘the future is characterized by 
unparalleled organizational and informational complexity, with corporate and business reporting 
evolving rapidly’ (axelsen, et al., ).",0
"if the auditors and the audit firms are to keep up with these 
changes and the it current development, accounting firms should think about what the audit of the 
future will look like and whether their audit teams have the required skills (macmanus, ).",0
"as of 
today, the big four have already invested in the use of new technologies such as data analytics 
software, and ai programs and started proof-of-concept projects on blockchain.",0
"all interviewees are 
anticipating a “people challenge” at two levels.",0
"first, auditors need to stay up to date on new auditing 
and accounting standards and latest developments, and more importantly increase their is skills.",0
"indeed % of the interviewees think that auditors, financial and is, in place and in training need 
deeper it skills.",0
"to address those requirements, the big four continuously invest to ‘re-train’ and ‘re-
skill’ their employees and keep them informed on “hot topics”.",0
"however, it seems that smaller auditing 
firms are not investing as much as larger auditing firm in training their employees on new technologies 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
including blockchain and therefore are not as prepared for the changes to come as our study shows.",0
"indeed % of the audit firms surveyed that are not among the big four have not started investigating 
the subject matter.",0
"they are in a “wait and see” mode and hope that they will be able to catch up with 
any new developments when time comes, but this might be too late.",0
"the second challenge comes from 
the fact that the tedious and manual audit processes and tests that are currently performed by junior 
auditors will be automated, therefore, auditing firms will not need as many juniors as they need today.",0
"instead they will need more specialists and more experienced professionals who will be able to use 
their professional judgment to solve complex problem, analyze data, identify control improvements 
and provide value-added insights to their clients.",0
"this will affect the audit pyramidal organization and 
the way auditing firms manage their workforce careers, which is partially based on a high turnover 
rate especially at the junior and senior auditor positions.",0
"lastly as reported by % of the interviewees, the auditing standards will have to be updated to 
include more it related guidance.",0
"indeed, as of today there is no auditing standard describing how to 
perform an audit on blockchain.",0
"the extent and the pace to which international rules will be modified 
in relation to the growth of blockchain use and other new technologies such as data analytics and ai 
remain unknown at this stage.",0
"we can say that the iaasb initiated an awareness process that can be 
illustrated both with the presentation of blockchain done by chuck landes, chair of the iaasb 
innovation working group, and the feedback statement by the data analytics working group 
(dawg) on ‘exploring the growing use of the technology in the audit, with a focus on data analytics’.",0
"the feedback statement reports that the respondents to their request for input from the audit 
professionals emphasized the need for the iaasb to ‘reflect the digital era in application guidance’ 
and recommended that the dawg members ‘consider other technologies whose impact on auditing 
deserves further consideration such as blockchain technology’(iasb, ).",0
"also, the pcaob 
announced in december  the plan to form a new task force on data and technology to explore 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
whether there is a need for guidance, changes to pcaob standards, or other regulatory actions in light 
of the increased use of data analytics and of other new and emerging technology-based tools (pcaob, 
).",0
"to the best of our knowledge, the swiss transmitter of the national auditing standards, 
expertsuisse, has not yet set up such a working group to assess the impact of blockchain on the 
audit profession.",0
"in the meantime, swiss financial auditors already face the challenge to audit 
companies active on blockchain or companies that have implemented blockchain platforms to run 
some of their business processes.",0
"this situation requires them to use their professional judgement when 
auditing standards are silent or not adequate.",0
"the evolution of norms or the development of new 
standards may follow and draw on the evolution of this professional practice.",0
"over all, the findings suggest that the profession is at a turning point and three major hypotheses 
have emerged:  
 
h.: the potential disruptive effect of the technology on the profession is not fully anticipated and 
smaller auditing firms are not tooling up to face the changes to come.",0
"the impact of blockchain on the audit profession would be different if audit clients adopt it as part 
of their business process, or if it is used by auditing firms as an audit tool.",0
"even though both venues are possible, none of the auditors interviewed, even the auditors working 
for the big four mentioned blockchain as a possible audit tool on its own.",0
"all of them only considered 
the potential impacts blockchain would have on their profession if it is used by their clients, how this 
would have an effect on the relationship with their clients, how they would access clients’ data, and 
how they would audit the new system in place.",0
"those companies, at the strategic level, are developing the knowledge and the resources to not only 
anticipate but also influence the deployment and usage of blockchain by their clients, and the audit of 
the technology by audit professionals.",0
"on the other hand, smaller auditing firms have not started to 
invest and to investigate the technology, as they do not have the financial and human capacity.",0
"they 
also believe that their client type (smaller firms) will not embrace the technology at the same pace as 
larger firms and therefore they can wait to develop their capacities and capabilities.",0
"however, as 
blockchain offer many interesting characteristics and as the technology is based on “shared and 
distributed” features, we can anticipate that once it will start to root into the business ecosystem, its 
adoption will most probably be rapid and general.",0
"indeed, pwc recently reported that in the  
countries where they surveyed leaders, % of them explain that their company is already engaged 
into a project related to blockchain (pwc ).",0
"another survey from deloitte led in  countries 
reported that % of the  senior executives working in companies with annual revenues over $ 
million think that their company will adopt the technology within the next  months (deloitte, ).",0
"we can thus infer that most smaller audit firms as they do not have sufficient current knowledge and 
understanding of the technology are not anticipating the impact of the technology on their profession 
and sooner than later might not be able to answer their clients’ emerging needs on the technology.",0
h.: the profession will change its paradigm to become more it oriented and more forward-looking.,0
"first, blockchain allows controls to be embedded into the technology, therefore some processes and 
transactions will be automated.",0
"moreover, records of all transactions will be instantly available to the 
auditors and will be automatically validated by the technology itself.",0
"we can then induce that the main 
focus of the auditors will not be to guarantee the existence of transactions, attest of their evidence, 
accuracy, and completeness as those checks are going to be performed by the technology itself but to 
attest that blockchain is working as intended.",0
"is auditors will have to not only understand the 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
technology but also the underlying code, they will have to assess the related risks and the emerging 
issues that could affect their clients.",0
"indeed, as demonstrated by kinney, businesses place a great 
reliance upon is as part of their business strategy and operations (axelsen, et al., ), which will be 
reinforced by the use of blockchain.",0
"the change in the profession paradigm will also be accelerated 
by the fact that not only the audit clients but also the audit firms use more and more different kinds of 
technologies to perform their audit work.",0
"for example, kpmg has partnered with ibm watson to 
begin automating and streamlining audit and tax processes (smith, ), other type of artificial 
intelligence systems can also be used to reconcile data, while drones can help with inventory counts.",0
"second, audit has always been a “back-looking” activity whose purpose is to obtain reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements of an audited entity are free from material misstatement (isa 
, ) to provide an audit opinion for an ended period (isa , ).",0
"thanks to the use of 
blockchain and data-driven analysis, auditors will be able to provide new insights to their clients.",0
"we 
can then construe that the profession will move from checking past data to providing new types of 
analysis and therefore become “forward-looking”.",0
"even though none of the  auditors interviewed 
already provides forward-looking information to their audit clients, we expect this move to happen 
sooner than later.",0
"indeed, audit clients will probably urge their auditors to provide them with advisory 
as it would bring them additional value.",0
"however, auditors are currently restricted in the type of 
services they can provide to their audit clients for independence reasons, which might represent an 
ethical challenge that the profession will have to tackle.",0
h.: profile of auditors will change.,0
"the hypothesis  suggests that the audit paradigm will change as it will be more it and advisory 
driven.",0
"even though today’s financial auditors and is auditors are well educated - indeed many 
financial auditors are also cpas, is auditors cisa and both financial and is auditors have graduated 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
with a bachelor or a master’s degree - we can induce that to address the changes brought by the 
paradigm shift, profile of auditors will have to change in several ways.",0
"if the role of 
auditors is less and less to audit the financial data but to audit the blockchain and certify that it is 
properly implemented, then auditors will have to be able to thoroughly understand those features.",0
"they 
will have to widen their technical skillset to master coding, hashing, cryptography and also work on 
their soft skills.",0
"indeed, if auditees use smart contracts that execute automatically  predefined 
conditions within the blockchain (if such condition is satisfied then such consequence runs), auditors 
will have to first understand the underlying code and second will have to be able to communicate 
clearly with lawyers to ensure that those contracts are legally valid.",0
"indeed, all the auditors interviewed who work for a big 
four mentioned that they already use data analytics as an audit tool, which is, however, not yet the 
case in smaller cpa firms, as only a few interviewees working for this type of firm already use it.",0
"therefore, audit firms will have to hire data scientists or train their auditors in order to drill down large 
volumes of data.",0
"those data scientists will team up with experienced auditors or field specialists (tax, 
finance, valuation) to interpret data and provide the insights and advice auditees will expect to receive 
from their auditors.",0
"as such audit firms will need more experienced professionals instead of juniors 
and, instead of hiring juniors who gain experience over the years and climb the hierarchy, will directly 
hire experienced people.",0
"today auditors leave audit firms to work in the industry, in the future the 
other way around might prove to be true.",0
"professionals might leave the industry and work for audit 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
firms directly as managers or directors, which will deeply impact audit firms’ organizational chart.",0
"conclusion 
    indeed, blockchain is sometimes compared to automation and data analytics that will require 
transforming how audits are performed (raphae, ).",0
"blockchain technology has the potential not 
only to make the accounting and auditing rules change, but also to impact the nature of the accounting 
and auditing profession.",0
"some top executives highlight the fact that blockchain is a better ledger 
because it allows adding entries to a ledger and to have multiple ledgers crosschecking against each 
other (martindale, ).",0
"in addition, it provides a third validation point that did not exist before, 
where auditors have previously stepped in and may not have to do so anymore in a near future 
(martindale, ).",0
"finally, a major opportunity resides in the fact that blockchain could facilitate the 
audit and control work by encoding rules directly in specific processes.",0
"but, a major challenge exists 
in terms of potential redefinition of audit and control activities based on the properties of blockchain 
technology (transparency, traceability, security, persistency and immutability of transactions).",0
"the question of the nature and scope of audit work in the case of blockchain use has been raised and 
not fully answered yet.",0
"some emphasize the growing need of digital technology profiles (raphae, 
) while others emphasize the move towards less numerous but more value-added activities 
(macmanus, ) which is confirmed by our study.",0
"more importantly, blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to cause the greatest 
level of disruption for the audit profession.",0
"while this potential disruption may be years away, some 
commentators have suggested that the potential impact on the auditing profession could be as 
significant as the impact of the internet on industries such as travel or retail (sheehan, ).",0
"and yet, 
our research results highlight the fact that auditors in practice do not completely foresee the radical 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
changes that blockchain technology could bring, potentially far more important compared to evolution 
of companies towards automation and increased use of data analytics.",0
"in that sense, the audit profession could in fact be facing a paradigm change.",0
"legal obligations to 
perform audits of financial statements may become useless once blockchain technologies will be 
mature enough and have proved their scalability.",0
"automated and certified audits will be on blockchain 
and financial statements information accessible to stakeholders in real time.",0
"while auditors are 
foreseen to become blockchain technology experts and certifiers, it is unclear whether they will encode 
the rules in blockchain themselves or work together with accounting, internal control, risk management 
and compliances experts.",0
"will the work be limited to assessing whether or not blockchain is working 
correctly (macmanus, ), or go beyond that?",0
"is the audit profession about to change its paradigm 
to move from being back-looking to forward-looking?",0
"will it change its perspective and be more 
future-oriented?",0
"how will this move toward less independence be perceived by investors, especially 
as trust in the profession has not fully recovered yet?",0
"we believe that because blockchain technology and the development of auditing and control 
standards are not envisioned in an integrated way, the potential impact of blockchain on audit and 
control professions has not yet been systematically and thoroughly assessed.",0
"we think that the results of this study can be of interest to the profession and to the organizations 
that are in charge of training auditors.",0
"indeed, the use of blockchain and other “new technologies” will 
require very different skillsets.",0
"such skills will be more it oriented and at the same time will require 
a strong business and accounting technicity; a mix of skills that is rare among the profession as well 
as in the current academic and professional training.",0
"potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
    this study also contributes to both blockchain and auditing scientific literature because it describes 
and explores the financial and is auditors’ perceptions regarding the impact of blockchain technology 
on their profession.",0
"it also provides accounting and auditing firms as well as auditing continuing 
education institutions with insights on the required future skillset of auditors and the evolution of their 
scope of work.",0
"finally, we stress the limited nature of our study, whose purpose was to serve as an initial 
exploration of the impacts of blockchain on the auditing profession.",0
"we should insist on the fact that 
these research hypotheses need to be validated in subsequent research.",0

both the management and the technical dimensions of the research question.",0

what degree they believed that cryptocurrencies were safe investments utilizing a scale 
from -, a majority of the participants fell within the - range.",1
"when asked about their 
familiarity concerning cryptocurrencies using the same scale, most participants fell 
within the - range.",1
"these findings prove that more people need to be educated about 
the potential dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies before they invest in them.",1
"ever since bitcoin began the cryptocurrency craze when it was introduced in 
, many investors have flocked to cryptocurrencies believing that they can be newest, 
hippest way to ‘get rich quick’.",1
"many crypto-investors have experienced massive payouts 
from investing in cryptocurrencies as well as enjoyed the perks of having capital in a 
decentralized exchange.",1
"however, there is a dark side to this budding cryptocurrency 
market.",1
"as they have for centuries, fraudsters and con men have evolved with the times, 
finding new ways to defraud unassuming crypto-investors every day.",1
"this new 
generation of fraudsters has found ways to perpetrate ponzi schemes, create fake initial 
coin offerings, pull exit schemes, coordinate pump and dump schemes as well as concoct 
many different schemes to steal investors’ cryptocurrencies out from under their noses.",1
"more and more people lose money to these frauds as the popularity of cryptocurrencies 
rises.",1
"a recent survey conducted by bitcoin.com news found that crypto-investors lose 
$.",1
"million a day on average to cryptocurrency fraud (shobhit, ).",1
"this statistic just 
goes to show that the public needs to become more educated on the many ways one can 
lose money when investing in the proverbial ‘wild west’ of investments.",1
"ponzi schemes are frauds in which perpetrators pay off old investors’ dividends 
with new investments from new investors.",1
"most of the time, the perpetrator’s investment 
firm will not even own a single share of stock.",1
"new investors are wrangled in by falsified 
reports, unrealistically high return rates and the recommendations of older investors.",1
"many are familiar with this fraud scheme due to the publicity that the bernie madoff case 
elicited.",1
"however, due to the general public’s naiveite concerning cryptocurrencies, most 
may not be familiar with ponzi schemes that can be committed with cryptocurrencies.",1
"probably the most infamous ‘crypto-ponzi scheme’ would be the scheme perpetrated by 
 
 
bitconnect.",1
"on the surface, bitconnect seems like a perfectly legitimate 
cryptocurrency/exchange with a user-friendly website complete with a fun, animated 
video explaining its supposed perks.",1
"however, bitconnect perpetrated a ponzi scheme 
that relieved thousands of investors of their cash.",1
"initial investors were promised returns 
of up to % in the early days of the cryptocurrency.",1
"investors were told by bitconnect 
that they would earn ‘interest’ on their bcc’s if they stored and traded them on 
bitconnect’s native cryptocurrency exchange thus rendering % of bcc transactions to 
occur on said exchange (buntinx, ).",1
"another red flag was that any purchases of 
bitconnect coin (bcc) had to be paid in bitcoin.",1
"this was most likely due to the fact 
that cash purchases are easier to trace as opposed to purchases using bitcoin or any other 
cryptocurrency.",1
"bitconnect supplied investors with earnings reports that would show how 
much they had gained in interest.",1
"the ‘interest’ was no doubt earned through the funds 
coming from new investors; the textbook definition of a ponzi scheme (jenkin, ).",1
"as 
of january th, , many believe that bitconnect’s ponzi scheme has come to a halt.",1
"the price of bcc had decreased drastically by % in a short amount of time falling 
from a lofty $ per bcc to a mere $ per bcc (buntinx, ).",1
"this rapid decline is 
no doubt in response to many crypto-investors’ realizations that they were most likely 
being scammed out of their money and had no chance of recovering their funds.",1
"unfortunately, the perpetrators of the scheme covered their tracks very well.",1
"by operating 
anonymously and requiring that all bcc purchased be made be bought with bitcoin, they 
made it nearly impossible for investigators to track them down.",1
"some estimate that 
anywhere between  and  million dollars were stolen as a result of this fraud (cryptick, 
et al).",1
"regardless of what the scope of the damage of this crypto-ponzi scheme actually 
 
 
was, the fraud was prominent enough to make many potential crypto-investor wary of his 
or her next crypto-investment.",1
"another notable ‘crypto-ponzi scheme’ would be the one 
that a company by the name of bitfinex perpetrated.",1
"bitfinex started out as legitimate 
‘crypto-company’ that took in investors just as any public company would.",1
"the scam 
began when bitfinex servers were hacked and thieves made off with $,, worth 
of customer investments.",1
"in an attempt to minimize the effects of the theft, bitfinex 
executives encouraged investors to convert their shares into equity within the company 
thus creating value from nothing at all.",1
"once most of the investors had converted their 
investments to shares, bitfinex then encouraged them to sell their equity as shares to new 
investors.",1
"once enough people had fallen for the fraud, they used the new investors’ 
funds to pay off the hack victims’ hold outs, in effect, creating an effective ponzi scheme 
(bitfinexed, ).",1
"the cryptocurrency tether is yet another example of a ponzi scheme 
committed with cryptocurrencies.",1
"tether is a type of cryptocurrency that is purposefully 
set to an equal exchange rate.",1
"theoretically, this allows tether to act as a safe medium 
for investors who are constantly trading one cryptocurrency for another.",1
"tether claims 
that for each tether on the marketplace, there will be one u.s. dollar to back it up.",1
"red 
flags manifest when you look into the numbers for yourself.",1
"on the open exchange at the 
time this research was conducted, tether has approximately ,,, tethers in 
circulation (www.coinmarketcap.com).",1
"according to tether’s last audit at the time of this 
research, which occurred on may rd, , auditors could only account for 
$,,.",1
"in u.s. dollars which is not even close to the figure of tether in 
circulation (crypto investor, ).",1
"many crypto-investors believe that tether is 
perpetrating a ponzi scheme since the amount of cash that they are supposed to have to 
 
 
back up their cryptocurrency is nowhere close to the amount of cryptocurrencies on the 
market as there should be.",1
"along with the numbers not matching up, many crypto-
investors are also wary of a few other red flags surrounding tether’s business practices 
such as the business ties with the aforementioned bitfinex, the disintegration of 
relationships with many prominent banks, lawsuits against said banks, the tendency of 
tether to withhold crucial information from investors as well as ronn torrosian’s (head 
of public relations for tether) past association with a company that had committed a 
ponzi scheme in the past (bitcoinexchangeguide,).",1
"fraudsters are famous for their 
craftiness and ingenuity, so it is no surprise that they have adapted an age-old scheme to 
cryptocurrencies.",1
"another typical fraud associated with cryptocurrencies would be the fake ico 
scheme.",1
"in the world of cryptocurrencies, ico’s or initial coin offerings are similar in 
many aspects to initial public offerings for stocks.",1
"typically, a cryptocurrency company 
will release a predetermined number of coins to the open market in the same way stocks 
are issued when a company goes public.",1
"many ico’s are in fact legitimate 
cryptocurrencies that have potential to make the investor a profit like any other security.",1
"however, there is a substantial portion of ico’s that are deemed fraudulent since the 
executives of these companies attempt to coerce investors to invest in cryptocurrencies 
that do not actually exist in an attempt to relieve them of their money in a quick and 
efficient manner.",1
"these con artists capitalize on potential investors’ fomo, or ‘fear of 
missing out’ on the next big cryptocurrency payout (zhu and zhang, ).",1
"researchers 
from a ‘big ’ accounting firm, ernst & young, estimate that more than % of the $.",1
"billion invested in ico’s thus far have been stolen due to fake ico schemes such as these 
 
 
to date (zhu and zhang, ).",1
"fake ico perpetrators will attempt to entice potential 
investors to become ensnared in their scheme by fabricating exorbitantly high return 
rates, lying about the numbers of investors and how much they had invested as well as 
advertising novel features in an effort to make their non-existent cryptocurrency 
irresistible.",1
"a fake ico scheme under the guise of a fake cryptocurrency by the name of 
plexcoin did just this.",1
"plexcoin’s executives promised unbelievable returns of up to 
,% in the first  days, which of course cannot be a number that any feasible security 
could guarantee (levine, ).",1
"plexcoin also brought in investors by suggesting that 
they were in the process of developing a credit card like instrument deemed ‘plexcard’.",1
"supposedly, this fictitious card was designed to draw plexcoin out of atm’s as well as 
“be used anywhere in the world and [would] be connected directly to [a] plexwallet.",1
"it 
will give you the opportunity to spend your money in a totally confidential way” (levine, 
).",1
"in addition to the ridiculous statements concerning the fake cryptocurrency, 
plexcoin’s website and business plan were also worryingly vague.",1
"it turns out that the 
fake ico scheme perpetrated by plexcoin was the brainchild of a repeat fraudster, 
dominic lacroix.",1
"was able to prosecute lacroix since fake ico’s fall under 
securities fraud (levine, ).",1
"unfortunately, lacroix was still able steal over $ 
million before his arrest (lee, ).",1
"another interesting example of a fake ico scheme 
would be the recoin scheme.",1
"recoin was a fictitious cryptocurrency created by a 
fraudster by the name of maksim zaslavskiy.",1
"zaslavskiy pedaled his ‘revolutionary’, new 
cryptocurrency as being the first ever cryptocurrency to be backed by real estate.",1
"one 
article described recoin as a great investment vehicle for investors wary of the world of 
cryptocurrency since, unlike any other cryptocurrency, the “proceeds from the initial sale 
 
 
of tokens will be invested in the highly regulated real estate market in virtually all 
jurisdictions while reinforcing the holders' and investors' confidence in the recoin 
“(zaslavskiy, ).",1
"zaslavskiy also perpetrated the same fraud with another fake 
cryptocurrency with the designation of drc for diamond reserve club.",1
"the theory 
behind drc was similar to recoin, but instead of proceeds being invested in real estate, 
proceeds were supposedly invested in diamonds (morris, ).",1
"however, it seems as 
though zaslavskiy never did invest any proceeds from recoin into any real estate or any 
proceeds from drc into diamonds.",1
"according to an investigation conducted by the sec, 
it was discovered that neither recoin or drc had any operations (morris, ).",1
"zaslavskiy and lacroix are just a few of many fraudsters that have attempted to 
perpetrate fake ico schemes.",1
"believes that this problem is so prevalent that 
this is such a prevalent issue for potential crypto-investors, that they have even made a 
mock, fake ico website in order for them to consult when wondering whether or not 
invest in a cryptocurrency (liao, ).",1
the next scheme to be discussed is exit schemes.,1
"according to investopedia, an 
exit scheme is “a fraudulent practice by unethical cryptocurrency promoters who vanish 
with investors’ money during or after an ico” (shobhit, ).",1
"sometimes, exit schemes 
may be able to start out as legitimate enterprises.",1
"however, due to adverse economic 
conditions, poor business planning or a combination of both, future perpetrators of exit 
schemes may attempt to vanish into thin air in an attempt to escape the consequences of 
overseeing a failing business, making off with all the investors’ funds in the process.",1
"this 
 
 
sort of scheme has become popular with cryptocurrency start ups seeing as anonymity is 
easy to maintain when all a business’s operations are virtual.",1
"a crypto-company by the 
name of giza perpetrated a scheme just like this.",1
"investors believed giza to be a 
legitimate company since it had announced a partnership with a russian tech firm, third 
pin llc.",1
"giza contracted third pin to aid in the creation of a secure device that could 
store cryptocurrencies.",1
"giza in turn raised over , ethereum coins, an amount equal to 
roughly $.",1
"investors began to worry when third pin announced that 
they had cut ties with giza.",1
"around february of , all of the investors’ funds were 
transferred out of the known giza wallet, supposedly by the mysterious and anonymous 
c.e.o.",1
"no one has been able to track down fike (if that is even his 
real name) since his linkedin profile contained falsified information such as the fact he 
attended oxford university when oxford has no record of his attendance (kharpal, 
).",1
"giza has now become synonymous in the crypto-trading community with exit 
schemes.",1
"a similar exit scheme was perpetrated by the crypto-company, loopx.",1
"loopx 
told investors that it had developed a complex crypto-trading software that contained an 
algorithm that would earn investors weekly profits.",1
"contrary to the payouts that they 
were expecting, investors were instead relieved of  bitcoin and , ethereum in 
january .",1
"it appears as if loopx decided to pull an exit scheme when they decided 
that they would not be able to convince investors that they were unable to come up with a 
software that could do everything that they promised.",1
"there are no traces of loopx’s 
website or the type-o riddled white paper anywhere on the internet seeing as the 
fraudsters wiped every trace of loopx’s existence from the internet (mix, ).",1
"even 
though some crypto-companies may pull an exit scheme to escape a business plan gone 
 
 
wrong, there are many more fraudsters perpetrate the same scheme with no intention of 
ever delivering anything for their customers or investors.",1
"one of the biggest exit schemes 
that fits into this category would be the one pulled off by cabbagetech.",1
"of cabbagetech pulled his exit scheme by offering customers crypto-
investment trading advice in exchange for payments of cryptocurrency.",1
"cabbagetech 
claimed that with their service, one could expect as high as a “% return on an 
investment in less than a week” (cheng, ).",1
"however, mcdonnell never delivered the 
service to his customers, and attempted to simply exit the business with approximately 
$.",1
million worth of customers’ bitcoin.,1
"however, the securities and exchange 
commission and commodity futures trading commission have filed charges against 
mcdonnell and cabbagetech to thwart ever growing cryptocurrency fraud in america 
(cheng, ).",1
the cabbagetech fraud is not alone by any stretch of the imagination.,1
"benebit was supposed to be a novel cryptocurrency company that would use benefits to 
incentivize customers to invest.",1
"benebit also claimed that it would the rewards system 
would work like racking up frequent flyer miles from your airline.",1
"however, investors 
began to question benebit’s authenticity when they discovered that the photos of the team 
members were fake.",1
"soon after the allegations were brought up, the scammers exited 
with estimated funds of $.",1
"to $ million before ever even bringing their novel 
cryptocurrency idea to the market (kean, ).",1
"a cryptocurrency by the name of opair 
has a very similar story.",1
"a mysterious developer who went by wasserman offered a 
cryptocurrency that supposedly would act as a sort of “decentralized debit card system 
using its own token, xpo” (kean, ).",1
"the cryptocurrency brought in an estimated 
$.",1
"million before the fraudsters exited with all the funds after investors noticed that the 
 
 
team’s linkedin profiles were fake.",1
"to date, nobody knows the true identity of 
wasserman, or where the money from opair has gone to (kean, ).",1

schemes have to be as elaborate as the previous examples do.",1

ridiculous exit scheme was perpetrated by the ironically named ponzicoin.",1

raised over $, before the perpetrator vanished with the funds.",1
"apparently, the 
cryptocurrency openly marketed itself as a scam, however, gullible investors were still 
drawn to invest money into what they must have thought was a legitimate cryptocurrency 
(kean, ).",1
"with the ever-increasing amount of exit schemes that are uncovered every 
day, prospective crypto-investors must remain careful to research the legitimacy of these 
cryptocurrencies and businesses now more than ever.",1
"pump and dump schemes have been around for ages and have proven to be fairly 
lucrative schemes for fraudsters to perpetrate.",1
"according to investopedia, pump and 
dump schemes can be defined as a fraud “that attempts to boost the price of a stock 
through recommendations based on false, misleading or greatly exaggerated statements” 
(investopedia, ).",1
"in other words, fraudsters will pump up the price by buying 
substantial amounts of the stock as well as propagating fake news through fake celebrity 
tweets or fake articles to entice others to help them inflate the price of the security, then 
dump it all in one single coordinated effort to make a profit.",1
"this may seem like a 
victimless crime, but one must consider the amount that investors who are purchasing the 
‘dumped’ securities are purchasing them at an artificially inflated price under the false 
pretenses of the scammers.",1
"these new investors will no doubt lose significant amounts to 
the scam.",1
"pump and dump schemes have been popular ever since the ’s and remain 
relevant today almost  years later.",1
"fraudsters have now taken to perpetrating these 
 
 
schemes with cryptocurrencies.",1
"due to cryptocurrency’s markets inherent qualities of 
volatility and unpredictability, crypto-investors’ extreme fear of missing out on the next 
big cryptocurrency as well as the ability to remain completely anonymous using the 
internet, pump and dump perpetrators have found it relatively easy to make a quick profit 
off budding cryptocurrencies.",1
"usually these scams are started by only one or a handful of 
people.",1
"these ‘investment groups’ (as many pump and dump groups like to refer to 
themselves) coordinate their efforts through anonymous messaging apps such as discord 
and telegram and recruit new members through means of shameless social media 
advertising and member recruitment.",1
"recruitment is vital to the success of these pump 
and dump schemes since the biggest contributing factor to how much the price of the 
cryptocurrency can be inflated is based solely on how many coins are bought up by how 
many investors.",1
"members are enticed to recruit new members with the incentive of being 
promoted to higher ranks within the group based on how many new members that they 
have invited.",1
"the advantages of being of a higher rank means that you will get anywhere 
.",1
"to a . second earlier notification when to dump your coins to get a higher return on 
an investment since you will be selling before a majority of the group does.",1
"this means 
that the higher rank you are within the group, the better opportunity you will have to 
make the highest possible profit.",1
"however, this logic backfires for most of the members, 
in effect, scamming the scammers.",1
"only the top of the group sees any real profit while 
the ones who lost are left to rationalize their loss based on the assumption that they 
simply sold too late (martineau, ).",1
"as these scams have become more and more 
popular over the past couple years, the government has decided to step in to try to 
regulate them.",1
"the commodity futures trading commission has announced that they 
 
 
will focus on “detecting and deterring fraudulent activities, such as pump and dump 
schemes, while not stifling early innovation in the crypto space” (cftc, ).",1
"the 
cftc and sec can prosecute pump and dump schemes under the securities act of  
(sec, ).",1
"however, due to the anonymity of the message groups, it is hard to discern 
who is involved in these schemes.",1
"this is the reason for the cftc offering rewards of 
$, or up to % of the sanctions recuperated by the fraudsters for whistleblowers 
who expose the heads of these pump and dump schemes (crypto insider, ).",1
"in addition to the aforementioned schemes that can be committed with 
cryptocurrencies, there are a few schemes that i have categorized simply as 
‘cryptocurrency theft’.",1
"due to the inherent nature of cryptocurrencies being a virtual 
currency, hackers have attempted to relieve unsuspecting investors of their 
cryptocurrencies for years.",1
"i have chosen to categorize the following frauds as 
cryptocurrency theft since they all involve some sort of perpetrator stealing 
cryptocurrencies from an unsuspecting holder.",1
"most financially literate individuals will 
be familiar with the infamous ‘nigerian prince’ or  fraud (labeled  due to the 
section of nigerian law that makes it illegal).",1
"this scheme is a type of advance fee 
scheme that involves a scam artist, stereotypically from nigeria, that entices someone to 
wire him or her a small sum of money in order to clear a large sum in which the scammer 
claims can be split between both the con-man and the conned.",1
"however, all these stories 
are fictitious, and the investor usually never sees any of their investment ever again.",1
"these scammers are now perpetrating these same  scams, but now with 
cryptocurrencies.",1
"in addition to scamming citizens abroad such as us in america, these 
nigerian scammers have also taken to scamming their own countrymen.",1
"the goal is to 
 
 
convince unsuspecting nigerians to wire over naira; the local, nigerian currency, for 
phony cryptocurrencies such as ‘billion coin’ (mcdonnell, ).",1
"in addition to these 
crypto-nigerian schemes, hackers have also become prevalent threats to the security of 
investors’ cryptocurrencies.",1
"these hackers will use many different tactics to steal 
cryptocurrencies.",1
"despite the many safeguards that blockchain technology can offer to 
help protect investors from hackers, they still manage to steal cryptocurrencies every day.",1
one man in a suburb of los angeles lost his life savings to crypto-hackers.,1
"chris dejrit 
lost over $, to hackers posing as technicians for the exchange that he was using.",1
"the requested that dejrit give them his personal logins so that they could fix some bugs 
in his profile.",1
"the next time dejrit logged in, he noticed that his entire stash of bitcoin 
was gone without a trace (cbs los angeles, ).",1
"another type of cryptocurrency theft 
that has become more and more popular over the past couple years are ransomware 
schemes.",1
these schemes have caught the entire crypto-world off guard.,1
"fraudsters 
perpetrate these schemes by utilizing ransomware to take over people’s computers and 
vow only to unlock them once a payment of untraceable cryptocurrency has been made to 
the fraudster’s e-wallet.",1
"in , it was estimated that cryptowall, a specific type of 
ransomware virus, made off with over $ million worth of cryptocurrencies (the 
data team, ).",1
"ransomware, another prominent ransomware virus, also swept 
across europe in may of  causing considerable damage to all those affected.",1
"the 
impact was so great that many european legislators attempted to make cryptocurrencies 
illegal so that scams such as ransomware would not be allowed to persist (coleman, 
).",1
"however, the most egregious cryptocurrency thefts that the world of 
cryptocurrency has ever seen would have to be the hacks of mt.",1

cryptocurrency exchange acts as a market place where cryptocurrencies can be stored and 
traded.",1
"these exchanges hold massive amounts of the world’s cryptocurrencies and are 
trusted by their customers to provide a safe trading environment.",1
"gox was not hacked 
once, but twice.",1
"the first hack occurred in  when the hacker gained access to the 
exchange by using an auditor’s credentials that were supposed to be kept confidential.",1
"the first hack made off with , bitcoins, a miniscule amount compared to what was 
lost during the second hack.",1
"the second hack, which occurred in , relieved mt.",1
"gox 
of , bitcoins which is the equivalent to around $ million, an amount equal to 
over % of bitcoins in circulation at the time.",1
"with the second hack, all of mt.",1
"gox’s 
customers had lost all faith in the company, and it filed for bankruptcy shortly afterwards 
(khatwani, ).",1
"gox hack, hackers were also able to do 
comparable damage to the bitfinex exchange.",1
"hackers were able to exploit a weakness in 
bitfinex’s authentication controls and steal , bitcoins from investors making it the 
second biggest cryptocurrency theft since mt.",1
"gox and bitfinex, other popular exchanges such as bitfloor, poloniex and bitstamp, 
rendering the aforementioned examples to not be isolated incidents (khatwani, ).",1
"it 
is important to note that all the hacks were made possible due to negligence or oversight 
by those in charge of the exchanges and not simply investor error such as some other 
examples mentioned earlier.",1

activities.",1

tailored for law enforcement agencies such as directorate general of taxes. 
 
. background 
this chapter describes the background knowledge of our paper, which 
consists of three parts, namely cryptocurrency, taxation, and digital forensics.",1
"to enable the feature, several cryptographic techniques are 
implemented in the system, making it fully run by the automated protocols.",1
"cryptocurrency runs on the internet, where traditional boundaries such as 
working hours, geographical locations, and jurisdictions are eliminated.",1
"international money transfers can be done through cryptocurrency network which 
can be verified within minutes.",1
"the success of bitcoin has caused a rapid adoption 
of cryptocurrencies across the world.",1
"... the technologies behind cryptocurrency 
in recent days, there is a huge collection of technologies being implemented 
in various cryptocurrencies.",1
"however, there are several core technologies that are 
used in (almost) all cryptocurrencies.",1
"pkc is a cryptographic technique which 
utilises two keys: public key and private key.",1
"as the name implies, the public key 
is intended to be publicized (shared) to other parties, while the private key needs 
to be kept secret by the owner.",1
"both keys are different but having a -to- 
relationship.",1
"this technique enables the cryptocurrency users to prove the 
ownership of the coins without revealing their real identities by the help of digital 
signatures.",1
distributed ledger technology (dlt).,1
"dlt is a public ledger where the 
information stored in the ledger is shared among system participants.",1
"the 
                                                             
 based on information published by coinmarketcap.com on  november  
information inside dlt is constructed such that stored data is infeasible to tamper.",1
"dlt is an append-only database; consensus method is applied to determine which 
participant can write the next data.",1
"there are at least two major types in dlt, 
namely blockchain and directed acyclic graph (dag).",1
"in dlt, new data is first 
collected and then stored once every predetermined period (epoch), constructing 
a sequential historical data.",1
"the way it is stored in the existing storage is by linking 
it to the previous data: the hash of the previous data is included in the new data.",1
"while blockchain can only have one main branch in the system (nakamoto ), 
dag allows multiple branches when storing information (popov ).",1
"in this 
paper, blockchain and dlt will be used interchangeably to refer dlt as a general 
concept.",1
hash functions and merkle tree.,1
"hash function is an algorithm to convert 
an arbitrary length data into a value which has a constant length over the same 
hash function.",1
"one of the main roles of hash function is to represent data without 
mentioning the data at all, hence it acts as the commitment of the represented 
data.",1
"merkle tree is a form of binary tree where anyone can verify the correctness 
of any data within its leaves without the need of knowing all the leaves.",1
"the merkle 
tree is often used as an authenticated data structure (ads) where it is easy to 
verify the integrity of its leaves.",1
"... various types of cryptocurrency 
classifying cryptocurrencies is important in digital forensics as it will 
determine the tools and methods during the investigation, or even determine how 
difficult the investigation will be.",1
"based on its characteristics, we can classify the 
cryptocurrencies into several types.",1
"the naming convention is coined based on 
bitcoin as the standard cornerstone, hence we also use the blockchain technology 
in our classification.",1
"blockchain .. the cryptocurrencies in this class are those 
cryptocurrencies following the identical (or with minor changes) protocols of 
bitcoin.",1
"litecoin and dogecoin are two most popular cryptocurrencies other than 
bitcoin.",1
"this class is marked by its legacy protocols such as nakamoto consensus, 
pseudo-anonymity, and input-output transactions.",1
"the main function of these 
cryptocurrencies is payment method.",1
"blockchain .. this class is for those cryptocurrencies that have evolved 
from version .",1
by embedding additional features on their systems.,1
"the 
cryptocurrencies in this class are nxt, ardor, nem, waves, and others.",1
"not only 
as payment methods, these cryptocurrencies also provide rich features such as 
peer-to-peer marketplace, child chains, digital asset management, electronic 
voting, and so on.",1
"blockchain .. the need of stronger anonymity motivated people to embed 
extra anonymity features on cryptocurrencies.",1
"the members of this class are 
known to be more difficult to analyse than bitcoin, such as monero, zcash, and 
dash.",1
"several other cryptocurrencies such as verge claimed that these products 
are anonymous, despite it is still unclear how their proposed protocols can provide 
a strong anonymity to the data and to their users.",1
"blockchain .. the development of ethereum has expanded the scope of 
blockchain from merely storing data into a system that enables its users to run 
programs on its virtual environment which is in sync to its permanently-stored data.",1
"offers smart contract capability to its users, where the users are 
given the flexibility of creating complex algorithms using the provided software 
development tools.",1
"not only providing a payment scheme, the smart contract can 
be utilised to develop decentralized applications (dapps) with unlimited features 
which will be run directly on the blockchain (wood ).",1
this class exists due to the popularity of smart contract.,1
"in a smart 
contract platform, a developer can create a contract which contains values, or 
tokens.",1
these tokens can be set to be transferred from their owners to receivers.,1
"token can be treated as a different class of cryptocurrency, but it can also be a 
derivation of smart contract.",1
"the most popular token platform at the time of the 
writing is ethereum, where erc (vogelsteller and buterin ) is the most 
known standard when creating tokens.",1
"by implementing the erc standard, a 
token can be traded with other tokens in a peer-to-peer token market as they have 
identical functions and characteristics.",1
"this type of token is also commonly called 
as erc token.",1
"... activities related to cryptocurrency 
as a system, several activities are closely related to cryptocurrency.",1
"these 
activities are: mining/staking, transacting, trading, and providing services.",1
"mining 
and staking are activities related to cryptocurrency’s open consensus.",1
"in a 
cryptocurrency implementing a proof-of-work (pow) consensus, a miner uses 
computing devices such as computers and application-specific integrated circuit 
(asic).",1
"the miners compete to compute mathematical questions, where the 
winner can write the next block.",1
"stakers are participant of any cryptocurrencies 
implementing proof-of-stake (pos) consensus mechanism, where coins are being 
staked and raffled to determine who has the authority to produce the next block.",1
"both miner and staker are motivated by the prize coin promised to be rewarded by 
the protocol as well as the right to claim the transaction fees paid by the 
cryptocurrency users.",1
"while mining requires investment in the form of computing power and staking 
requires a huge amount of money to acquire a significant portion of the coins, 
creating transactions can be done by anyone.",1
"the two requirements for creating a 
transaction are a wallet and a fraction of coin.",1
"creating a transaction in a 
cryptocurrency system means the user utilises the wallet application to construct a 
digital information which expresses the coin movement from the payer to the 
payee(s).",1
"this information will be authorized by using digital signature(s) which will 
validate that the payer owns the coin(s) to be sent to the payee(s).",1
"it is feasible to 
send a fraction of a coin only if the amount exceeds the minimum amount (if 
determined by the cryptocurrency system) and sufficient to pay the transaction fee.",1
cryptocurrency trading activity is a logical result of the emerging digital asset.,1
"as the cryptocurrencies were getting more valuable and usable in daily life, 
cryptocurrency trading facilitates supply (ask) and demand (bid).",1
"while the trading 
platform will receive trading fees, the traders expect to make profits from their 
trading activities.",1
"as a valuable intangible asset, it is possible that the cryptocurrencies are 
used as a payment method, as most of them were intended to be.",1
"however, until 
now the indonesian government do not facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies as a 
legal tender, where currency act  defines rupiah as the only legal tender in 
indonesian jurisdiction.",1
"the statement is further clarified by indonesian central 
bank through a press release on  january  (press release no.",1
//dkom) with a lengthy explanation through a faq document.,1
"... cryptocurrency-related tools 
in general, a cryptocurrency system is entirely run by its set of protocols.",1
"the 
protocols are implemented in one or more application (software) bundles, where 
there will be multiple and separated parties are running the main application, 
usually called as a node.",1
"each node manages a copy of the blockchain containing 
the entire transactions from the genesis block to the newest block.",1
"it also validates 
new transactions, (re)publish transactions to its connected peers, and lets wallets 
request information about the blockchain data which will be responded with the 
requested information by the node to the requesting wallets.",1
"a wallet is a client-side application which helps a user to create transactions, 
manage private keys, and compute the remaining coin balance.",1
"the wallet does 
not store any information about the blockchain, hence it relies on the node when it 
requires certain information.",1
"there are multiple types of wallet, namely mobile 
wallet which runs in smartphones, desktop wallet in computers, web wallet which 
can be accessed through web browsers and hosted by service providers.",1
"there 
are also special wallets such as hardware wallet which contains secured storage 
to protect the private keys and paper wallet which stores private keys in a piece of 
paper.",1
"most wallets (excluding paper wallet) are spv-wallets (simplified payment 
verification wallet) which only store the blockchain header.",1
"the correctness of the 
information received from the node it is connected to will be checked by using the 
blockchain header it manages.",1
"merkle tree and the chained blocks structures help 
the data integrity checking.",1
"the relationship between nodes and wallets can be 
expressed in figure .",1
"an illustration of a blockchain system with multiple nodes (daemons) and several wallets 
connected to one of the node (wijaya, et al.",1
"a blockchain explorer is an application which will help the users to explore 
the content of a blockchain.",1
"normally, every cryptocurrency provides at least one 
blockchain explorer as a way to prove the transparency of the system.",1
"however, 
popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have many options of 
blockchain explorers which are provided for free by multiple parties.",1
"... indonesian cryptocurrency markets

importance of taxation for the country.",1
"self-assessment policy has been 
implemented as a part of the first indonesian tax reform in  to replace the 
legacy tax administration system which was highly inefficient and low compliance 
(prasetyo n.d.).",1
"however, the self-assessment policy does come with a cost.",1
"tax avoidance 
cases could happen as the taxpayers tend to minimize their tax due.",1
"tax audits 
will be established to measure the compliance, and when preliminary proofs are 
found, the case can be escalated into tax fraud case, which is an offense according 
to taxation act .",1
".. digital forensics techniques 
digital forensic has multiple branches according to various medium to store 
or to compute digital information.",1
"nevertheless, disk-based forensics and network 
forensics are popular due to their wide scope and usefulness in during the 
investigation.",1
"in the disk-based forensics, the focus of the analyses includes but 
not limited to operating system analysis, deleted file analysis, password recovery, 
and user-related data.",1
"while the network forensics’ focus is on how multiple 
computers communicate through computer networks, including how network 
protocols are utilized to carry information from the sender to the receiver.",1
"digital forensic activities are supported by various forensic tools in the form 
of hardware and software.",1
"in accordance to the activities, there are also protocols 
and standard procedures to be followed such that the digital information gathered 
during acquisition process is well-preserved, hence it can be presented as a valid 
evidence in the court. 
 
. cryptaxforensic: cryptoforensics for taxation 
purposes 
in this chapter, we describe cryptaxforensics in details.",1
"we coined the term 
cryptaxforensic to define cryptoforensic activities in the taxation area.",1
"data 
collection methods, challenges, and proposed methods to enhance 
cryptoforensics are covered in this chapter.",1
".. the (potential) role of cryptoforensics in directorate general of 
taxes 
cryptoforensic techniques have increased in demand and popularity in 
recent years due to the massive increase of cryptocurrency use.",1
"while 
cryptocurrency was not created for ill-purposes, people always find ways to utilize 
the medium in legal offences.",1
"tax offense and other financial fraud cases, 
unfortunately, are not unfamiliar cases in cryptocurrency area, for example in 
(pearce ).",1
"moreover, cryptocurrencies are considered as tax havens due to 
their technologies (marian ).",1
"while traditional tax fraud cases will be one of the main concerns for 
directorate general of taxes, cryptocurrency-related cases must also be on the 
list.",1
"cryptoforensics as digital forensics methods and procedures can be useful in 
collecting information related to cryptocurrency activities.",1
".. data collection in cryptoforensics 
we have identified several methods for data collection in cryptoforensics, 
including disk-based cryptoforensics, network cryptoforensics, blockchain 
cryptoforensics.",1
"wallet seizure will be discussed in a separate subchapter as it 
serves a different purpose.",1
"... disk-based cryptoforensics 
disk-based cryptoforensics focuses on the examination of wallet applications 
which can be used to manage their coins and/or create transactions.",1
"as it has been 
described that there are various types of wallet, multiple digital forensics 
techniques are also needed to gather information.",1
"the desktop wallets are 
generally compatible with multiple operating systems such as windows, osx, and 
linux.",1
"moreover, multiple wallets store information in different methods.",1
"however, it is almost certain that the database file to store the private keys 
and transaction details is encrypted and password-protected.",1
"despite the difficulty 
to read the private keys, it is advisable to collect all information from the application 
folders as well as other locations such as home folder and application data folder 
to investigate the log files.",1
"passwords, pin keys, or seed words might need to be 
obtained from the users through any appropriate procedures.",1
"web browsers such as mozilla firefox and google chrome are also good 
places to search.",1
"two most popular ethereum wallets, myetherwallet (mew) 
and metamask provide web browser addons for their clients.",1
"in mew, addresses 
are visible without login to the wallet, as shown in figure .",1
myetherwallet shows several addresses it manages.,1
"once the ethereum addresses are known, the balance will be easily defined 
by the help of any ethereum explorer, for example etherscan.",1
"not only the 
balance, their associated erc tokens can also be concluded by using the same 
tool.",1
"... network cryptoforensics 
as with other standard network forensic methods, network cryptoforensics 
also can be done through packet capture techniques.",1
"in most cryptocurrency 
systems, there will be two types of network packets, namely rpc and pp 
connections.",1
rpc is the protocol for the connection between a node and a wallet.,1
"the wallet sends requests by using rpc interface, and the responses will be sent 
by the node, either in json (javascript object notation) or bin (binary) formats.",1
captured network packets showing rpc communication.,1
"pp (peer-to-peer) protocol, on the other hand, is used to exchange 
information between nodes.",1
"the protocol’s packets are identified by its “packet 
magic” as a fingerprint.",1
"every cryptocurrency system has its own packet magic, or 
often called as “magic bytes”.",1
an example is shown on figure .,1
captured network packets showing pp communication.,1
"... blockchain cryptoforensics 
the increase use of cryptocurrency motivated the development of blockchain 
analyses.",1
"taint analysis is commonly used in blockchain ., where all related 
addresses can be concluded.",1
"taint analysis shows other addresses and 
transactions that are directly and indirectly related to a specific address.",1
"however, 
the taint analysis will eventually produce a cluster which contains a massive 
number of related addresses, as they are mostly using “haircut” method 
(greenberg ).",1
"several companies such as chainanalysis, coinfirm, and 
ciphertrace use the method to track bitcoins (greenberg ).",1
"furthermore, 
clustering analyses have been developed and being used to check the information 
stored in bitcoin’s blockchain (meiklejohn, et al. )",1
"a recent research describes a novel approach which was based on a british 
legal system (anderson, shumailov and ahmed ).",1
"the new approach 
describes first-in-first-out (fifo) method instead of taint analysis, which results 
in a shortened list of related address.",1
"... wallet/coin seizure 
unlike any other digital assets or financial instruments where user ids are 
required to transact, cryptocurrencies only require private keys to move coins to 
other addresses.",1
"when the private keys are seized from the users or suspects, it 
                                                             
 an example of bitcoin taint analysis can be seen in  
  
  
  
is advisable that the information is carefully managed such that anyone having 
access to the private keys cannot easily move the digital assets.",1
"the event where 
rogue law enforcement agents moved seized bitcoins has happened in the past 
(redman ) 
the way the problem can be mitigated is to create a new wallet with 
multisignature feature.",1
"several cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin has this feature, 
although unfortunately not all cryptocurrencies have implemented it.",1
"in a 
multisignature wallet, each transaction requires more than one valid signature 
which implies that every transaction is approved by multiple parties.",1
"of course, it 
is assumed that the new multisignature wallet’s private keys are held by different 
parties.",1
".. challenges 
we identify several challenges for cryptoforensics activities.",1
"sometimes, 
they are not straightforward as its counterparts.",1
"some of these challenges are 
pseudonymity, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, and worldwide markets.",1
"... pseudonymity 
although the public blockchains utilized by the cryptocurrencies are 
transparent and accessible through blockchain explorers, it does not mean that 
determining the owners of the coins being transacted in the blockchains is trivial.",1
"pseudonymity is a default characteristic in those public blockchains, where the 
users are identified by their addresses.",1
"however, complications occur because one 
user can create unlimited number of addresses.",1
"a quantitative analysis has 
successfully determined the activities conducted by a cryptocurrency thief (ron 
and shamir ), however the same technique cannot be applied to other cases.",1
"... privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies 
privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies such as monero and zcash have 
implemented extra cryptographic techniques such that several information in the 
blockchain is obfuscated.",1
"monero is using ring signature method where the real 
signer is obfuscated by using decoys or false addresses.",1
"moreover, the 
implementation of ring confidential transaction (ringct) encrypts the amount of 
coins such that it cannot be seen by anyone but the payer and the payee (noether 
and mackenzie ).",1
"several studies have discovered the weaknesses in monero 
system (moeser, et al. )",1
"), and since 
then monero has gone through several updates to improve its security.",1
"different compared to monero, zcash is using zero knowledge proof (zkp) 
technology, zk-snarks to be specific, where transaction history is completely 
obfuscated and relationships between coins are hardly identified (ben-sasson, et 
al.",1
"however, recent finding discovered the weakness of the implementation 
of zcash (quesnelle ) (kappos, et al. )",1
"due to the extensive computing 
requirements for its wallet which hinders its users from using the secure mode, 
namely z-addr.",1
"despite this finding, it is difficult to say that zcash technology has 
been broken, as the problems found are in the system level.",1
"... worldwide markets 
although there are already exist several cryptocurrency markets in 
indonesia, it does not mean that all indonesian cryptocurrency users are only using 
them when conducting trading.",1
"a trader is motivated to open accounts in as many 
exchanges as possible, where it is free to create them; all she needs to do is to 
provide a username and password followed by identity verification.",1
"cryptocurrency market is unique and totally different compared to stock 
market, such that there will be multiple prices in different markets.",1
"a skilled trader 
can leverage the opportunity by buying on the lowest price market and selling on 
the highest price market.",1
"by doing this, it is expected that she could gain significant 
profits.",1
"however, this so-called opportunity for the traders could become a significant 
obstacle for law enforcement agencies.",1
"unlike any fiat currencies where their 
transactions are limited by regulations and boundaries, cryptocurrencies do not 
share the same limitations.",1
"a user can send payments through cryptocurrency to 
the other side of the world in a matter of several minutes.",1
"as there are many 
cryptocurrency markets in the world, a trader can store her digital assets not in the 
local cryptocurrency exchanges but in any exchanges beyond the reach of any 
local law enforcement agencies.",1
".. enhancing cryptoforensics 
after identifying several challenges for cryptoforensics, we propose methods 
to enhance cryptoforensics.",1
"our proposed methods are not about enhancing 
technical capabilities, but mainly about legal instruments, collaboration, and 
extensive research.",1
"... legal instruments 
we propose the use of any available legal instruments to support 
cryptoforensics activities.",1
"the legal instruments could ensure that information 
related to cryptocurrency activities within the country’s jurisdiction can be acquired.",1
"this includes but not limited to enforcing kyc/aml procedures for onboarding new 
customers of cryptocurrency-related businesses.",1
"... collaboration 
collaboration is important in cryptoforensics, especially for gathering a 
proper information.",1
"the main actors for collaboration in this matter are 
cryptocurrency markets or exchanges.",1
"they hold important information about the 
users, as the users provided their real identities to the markets and this information 
can be utilized to connect cryptocurrency-related activities with the persons doing 
them.",1
"an important scheme developed in the monero community called eabe 
shows the importance of cryptocurrency exchanges (holmes ).",1
"eabe stands 
for exchange-alice-bob-exchange.",1
"in this scheme, alice purchases several 
cryptocurrency coins from an exchange, then she transfers the coins to bob.",1
"bob 
then sells the coins to an exchange (not necessarily the same exchange where 
alice purchased the coins) to get the local currency.",1
"in the scenario, although 
normally it is infeasible to determine who alice and bob are, with the help of two 
cryptocurrency exchanges, it is now possible to map the transactions and identify 
two parties, alice and bob.",1
"... extensive research 
with the rapid development in cryptocurrency technology, digital forensics 
need to keep up with the pace, hence extensive research in cryptoforensics field 
need to be conducted.",1
"the research focuses on finding relevant artefacts that can 
help law enforcement agencies to track down illicit activities.",1
"the massive adoption of 
cryptocurrency, the growing number of new technologies that have brought new 
products into the markets, and the significant rise in the prices could shift the 
taxation problem from its traditional landscape into a global, broader, and more 
complex ecosystem as in the cryptocurrency.",1
"we also have described the recent development in both areas: 
cryptocurrency and digital forensics, including how existing digital forensic 
methods can be utilized to explore digital evidences with regards to 
cryptocurrency-related activities.",1
"we then discussed challenges in the areas, 
including proposals to enhance cryptoforensics.",1
"cryptocurrencies represent new payment technology, which allows payers and payees to directly  
send value to each other electronically and anonymously without the need to use the services 
of trusted third parties, like financial institutions (ex.",1
"digital currency is 
both a virtual and a cryptocurrency (with computer encryption protecting coin supply and ownership 
(gilbert and loi, ).",1
"cryptocurrency is defined as currency that is stored and transferred 
electronically (wagner, ) and is a medium of exchange that rely on cryptography, in order to 
secure transactions and control the creation of new units (christou & kassianidis, ; roussou and 
stiakakis, ).",1
"throughout this paper, we use term cryptocurrency (virtual, digital, encrypted).",1
"blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin being one of the most famous one, is the 
new business model which aims to compete with traditional financial services (lou and li, ) and 
could even affect the functioning of the monetary system (halperin, ; stevens, ).",1
"decentralized cryptocurrencies have the potential to drastically change the existing retail system and it 
is important to understand factors that influence their adoption (jonker, ).",1
"technology innovations may help organizations achieve competitive advantage, improves 
performance and competitiveness (wang and qualls, ; roussou and stiakakis, ).",1
"it has been 
stated that perceived relative advantage positively affect intention to use innovation (shih, ; lee, 
).",1
"businesses, including hospitality 
industry may achieve competitive advantage via the provision of cryptocurrency payments to 
customers and the issue associated with appropriate cryptocurrency payment usage is the important 
research topic for exploration (roussou and stiakakis, ).",1
"acceptance of digital currencies as an 
additional payment option could be a marketing tool and help companies to stand out (roussou and 
stiakakis, ).",1
"there is a need to investigate whether digital currencies will be accepted and adopted 
as a trading instrument with or without traditional currencies and the conventional payment systems 
(roussou and stiakakis, ).",1
"younger generation of travellers have an expectation of using more 
technology in their business interactions, examples include commonplace of having television, wireless 
connection in hotel rooms (dipietro and wang, ) as well as being able to book and pay for the 
hotel room online.",1
"rapid 
advancement of cryptocurrency market has a strong potential on business and individuals payment 
transactions choice behavior.",1
"this paper focuses on a recent innovation for which acceptance and 
adoption behavior is poorly understood- cryptocurrency payment.",1
"the purpose if the present study is 
threefold.",1
"first, authors aim to provide insight into the factors that influence hospitality industry 
organizations to express intention to use cryptocurrency payment.",1
"second, from the theoretical 
perspective, we examine widely used technology acceptance model (tam) to develop and test an 
integrated model which is better able to predict hotel owners intention to use an innovation technology 
in the form of cryptocurrency payment.",1
"third, this research integrates strong predictor of technology 
acceptance external variable- perceived security, which considered a strong predictor for new payment 
technology adoption (folkinshtein and lennon, ; khalilzadeh et al.",1
"; liao and cheung, ; 
cheng et al. )",1
"we suggest that perceived security is crucial to 
understanding and predicting adoption of cryptocurrency payment, however it is not yet explored in the 
literature in the context of cryptocurrency payment or hospitality industry.",1
"there are paucity of papers regarding cryptocurrency payment adoption and usage (jonker, 
; polasik et al., ; schuh and shy, ; tsanidis et al.",1
"there are no 
studies available on the adoption of cryptocurrency payment among hospitality industry.",1
"another novelty is that this paper contributes to new payment technology adoption and 
hospitality industry related research by examining integrated technology adoption model in taiwan 
hotel industry.",1
"taiwan provide a good setting for this research as it has a well-developed technological 
infrastructure and is welcoming to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.",1
the paper is structured as follows.,1
"the first section introduces overview of technology 
adoption models and factors influencing adoption decisions of new payment technology.",1
"second, we 
provide the background of cryptocurrency payment technology.",1
"we then develop hypothesis, explain 
methodology and data collection and conclude with discussion of the findings and their implications 
for theory and practice.",1
"literature review  
theoretical background / technology acceptance theories  
 
there are several social psychology based classical models of behavioral decisions and 
behavioral intentions which analyze people’s behavior when faced with something novel (pavloy, 
a).",1
"theory of reasoned actions (tra) is a general model explaining person’s behavior based on 
the relationship between the variables beliefs-attitude-intention-behavior (fishbein and ajzen, ).",1
"this model takes into consideration the attitude towards behavior and the person’s subjective norm as 
an explanation factors for intention.",1
"tra became a base for technology acceptance model (tam) 
which aims to explain information technology and information systems adoption behavior (davis, 
; davis, bagozzii and warshaw, , munoz, ).",1
"tam states that adoption 
behavior is determined by the intention to utilize a particular system determined by the perceived 
usefulness and ease of use.",1
"tam states that information technology users act rationally during their 
decision whether to use technology or not.",1
"user’s intention to use new technology depends on their 
beliefs of perceived usefulness (pu) and perceived ease of use (peu) of the technology.",1
"pu is defined 
as the degree to which a person perceives that adopting the system will boost his/her performance.",1
"peu 
is defined as the degree to which a person believes that adopting the system will be effortless.",1
"tam 
model is relevant as it provides a framework by which the effect of the external variables on a system 
usage can be assessed.",1
tam became the base for several models of innovation technology acceptance.,1
"for example tam was extended to tam which includes social and organizational variables 
(subjective norm, image, job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability) which are shown to have 
direct impact on pu (venkatesh and davis, ).",1
"tam and utaut models continued to be 
explored and improved in new research (luarn and lin, ).there are tam (venkatesh and bala, 
), moptam- mobile phone technology acceptance model (renaud and biljon’s, ).",1
"research on new technology acceptance by different user types is ever more relevant and 
necessary in the era of disruptive innovation technologies.",1
"tam provide a core elements and could be 
developed and expanded differently in line with the it and is innovations (venkatesh and morris, 
; lin and nguen, ).",1
"there are several primary constructs that have been recognized to strongly influence 
technology acceptance in the past research.",1
"in 
relation to financial interactions and new payment system acceptance perceived security (security, 
risk, trust) is especially relevant in the context of financial transactions (khalilzadeh et al., ) and 
would be of critical importance for the present cryptocurrency payment adoption study.",1
"are all explicitly identify the payer in transactions, and are centrally or quasicentrally administered 
(pomarole et al., ).",1
"in other words the user provides his account information to the merchant, and 
trusts the merchant and the processor to withdraw only the agreed-upon (folkinshtein and lennon, 
).",1
"on the other hand cryptocurrency payment is pseudo anonymous, it do not explicitly identify 
the payer or the payee, transactions are irreversible but requires third party, a global peer-to-peer 
network, mediation which makes all transactions completely transparent (pomarole et al., ).",1
"cryptocurrency is a ―push-basedǁ payment system—the user creates a transaction transferring a 
specific amount to the merchant and without specific further action on the part of the user in creating a 
new transaction, no other amount can be taken.",1
"to make an analogy to the world of cash, with 
cryptocurrency you take some cash out of your wallet and hand it to the merchant.",1
"with the bank/credit 
card system, you give your wallet to the merchant and ask him to take out the amount you agreed upon, 
while you turn your back and do not look (sigala & christou, ; folkinshtein and lennon, ).",1
"blockchain technology and cryptocurrency and widely recognized by the scientific and 
business community as a pioneering technological innovation which contributes to the shaping of a 
new market and network (roussou and stiakakis, ).",1
"growing popularity of crypto currencies is influenced by decreasing public confidence and trust in the 
credibility of financial institutions as well as leading to new ways of transactions, without third party 
mediation (roussou and stiakakis, ) which is very popular among millennial generation (lou and 
li, ).",1
"for example bitcoin currency is considered the first application of block chain innovation 
which gradually changes the current organization and structure of the market and the financial system, 
displacing previous value systems (antonopoulus, ).",1
"cryptocurrency payment involves fast, secure, anonymous, person to person payment via 
internet, without time or space limitation.",1
"as block chain technology increases in popularity, 
cryptocurrency payment continue to facilitate secure electronic commercial transactions between 
organizations or individuals.",1
"this paper focuses one the important innovation that is steadily gaining 
popularity for which adoption processes are not yet understood- cryptocurrency payment.",1
"block chain 
is a decentralized public transaction ledger, it is transparent and immutable technology which has a 
potential of fast, cheap, peer-to-peer financial transactions (folkinshtein and lennon, ).",1
"cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin is an entirely digital distributed currency, not dependent on any 
particular national currency or geographic location (folkinshtein and lennon, ).",1
"there are several primary constructs that have been recognized to strongly influence technology 
acceptance in the past research.",1
"in relation to financial interactions and new payment system acceptance perceived security 
(security, risk, trust) is especially relevant in the context of financial transactions (khalilzadeh et al., 
) and would be of critical importance for the present cryptocurrency payment adoption study.",1
"in this paper, authors adopt tam as the robust and widely used theoretical foundation for 
understating one of the latest technologies of cryptocurrency payment adoption.",1
"we therefore propose 
to include several constructs at the same time the study of cryptocurrency payment.",1
"following tam sequential approach authors add attitude 
construct as a mediator of the impact of perceived usefulness and ease of use on behavioral intention 
(davis, bagozzi and warshaw, ).",1
"sequential approach of tam model logic has a potential to 
enhance the explanatory power of the current study research model.",1
"integrated research model 
proposed in this study focuses on cryptocurrency characteristics and perceived security constructs 
influence on behavioral intent.",1
"with an empirical test of this model, this paper seeks to achieve three research purposes: ) to 
extent the explanatory power and predictive accuracy of tam model in technology acceptance studies; 
) to investigate integrated effect of technology, individual and social characteristics on business 
owners intention to use cryptocurrency payment technology in hotels; ) to address differences in 
determinants of block chain technology based cryptocurrency acceptance in hotels.",1
"the paper is 
organized as follows: first theoretical background of the study is presented, then hypothesis are 
developed and a conceptual framework is introduced, third research method, analysis and results are 
explained and finally the findings, implication, limitations and contributions of this study are discussed.",1
"perceived security (security, risk, trust)  
security  
 
perceived security is ―the degree to which a customer believes that using a particular mobile 
payment procedure will be secureǁ (shih, , p.).",1

protection of security threats, for example in relation to cryptocurrency it is the loss/hijack of digital 
wallet, money loss due to privacy volatility, etc.",1

shown that risk is a strong influencer on user’s trust, and as a result reduces intention to use the new

"demand factors and 
regulatory framework
a. cryptocurrency and the historic price run
cryptocurrency is “digital money” secured through cryptology and running 
on a “blockchain”—a distributed, decentralized ledger where individuals can 
anonymously transact and maintain records without an intermediary.",1
"see teddy wayne, grandpa had a pension.",1

":
there are many others, most notably ether, the token that powers the popular 
ethereum blockchain (the technology behind smart contracts), and litecoin, a 
cryptocurrency designed for smaller payments.",1
"cryptocurrency is “divorced 
from governments and central banks” which makes it “decentralized” and 
immune from inflation (and deflation) and some believe a “quicker, cheaper and 
more reliable form of payment.” in , the value of cryptocurrency surged 
with bloomberg calling the initial price run “staggering” and noting that its run 
was larger than the dot.com boom in technology stocks.",1
"in , the market 
values of popular cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) experienced a steep de-
cline.",1
"nevertheless, current market prices are still significantly higher than 
those of late  and early .",1
"so what exactly has driven the demand for 
cryptocurrency?",1
"b. familiarity, ease of access, speculation, and network effects
the ease of purchasing cryptocurrency combined with increased media at-
tention has led to an influx of new, less sophisticated buyers, and there is an 
.",1
"the market cap of bitcoin, on december , , was just under $ billion.",1
"as of 
november , , the market cap is just under $ billion.",1
"universities around 
the world are starting to offer courses on cryptocurrency, and netflix and 
khan academy series have increased public familiarity with cryptocurrency, 
dlt, and blockchain.",1
"demand is also amplified by a “network effect,” where 
a technology becomes more valuable simply because more people are using it.",1
"for example, coinbase (the largest bitcoin exchange in the united states) add-
ed over , customers in one day after the chicago mercantile exchange 
announced it would launch bitcoin futures.",1
"there has also been significant 
mining and development activity as well as purchases of cryptocurrency as a 
hedging substitute for gold or the u.s. dollar.",1
"c. the initial coin offering market
another factor driving demand is the initial coin offering (“ico”) market 
(which was red hot in ), where a company issues digital coins or tokens 
that provide access to a service (called a “utility” or “app” token) or that repre-
sent an investment opportunity (like a traditional security).",1

"also, partici-
pation in an ico generally requires bitcoin or ether.",1
"so, as the economic 
principle of supply and demand dictates, greater demand for icos means great-
er demand for bitcoin or ether (hence the price rise).",1
"d. regional instability and post-financial crisis institutional distrust
another demand factor is the continuing, post-financial crisis distrust of the 
traditional banking sector.",1
"some investors (mostly outside of stable monetary 
systems) view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against volatile lo-
cal currencies and geopolitical risk (for example the large “mining” activity in 
venezuela, despite the physical risks).",1
"as long as some countries support 
bitcoin, there will be continuing demand for it.",1
"some investors are taking the 
position that it is a “new gold” given its fixed supply.",1

gain traction, and there is currently “more money trying to get in than out”—

even if a utility token is not a “security” under the howey test, or other-
wise triggers the criteria set out in the sec’s dao determination, it may still

"a utility token might be classified by the 
cftc as a currency or a contract for the future exchange of services, rights, or

suers would undoubtedly challenge such an interpretation (and would argue 
their offering is akin to a prepaid service or expense).",1

bright lines in the primer—only general guidance that the cftc considers cryp-
tocurrencies to be commodities and that it is actively monitoring this market.",1

fessor lawrence baxter has summarized this phenomenon as follows: “target 
regulation is inherently self-defeating because strategic action will be taken to

tem” and act strategically around the regulations.",1

components, and how they differ from flat currencies such as cash.",1

related to cryptocurrency would also be discussed in order to understand their 
connection to cryptocurrency.",1
"what is cryptocurrency 
cryptocurrency are digital assets that are designed to work as a medium of exchange, 
using cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, 
and to verify the transfer of assets.",1
"cryptocurrencies can be classified as a subset of 
digital currencies.",1
"what is unique regarding cryptocurrency is that they utilise 
decentralised system; in decentralised banking system, boards or governments does not 
hold control over the system.",1
"this differs from traditional banking system, which utilises 
centralised control.",1
"what are some of the terms associated with cryptocurrency 
there are a few terms that are closely associated with cryptocurrency.",1
"brief description 
will be given below, in order to assist with understanding the later contents of this work.",1
"cryptography 
cryptography is the practice and study of secure communication in the presence of a 
third party.",1
"this also includes construction of protocols that prevent third parties, or the 
public, from reading private details within a message.",1
"blockchain  
blockchain is a public transaction database.",1
"blockchain also functions as a distributed 
ledger which contains list of records called blocks – linked and secured using 
cryptography.",1
"each block contains a pointer as a link to the previous block, a timestamp, 
and transaction data.",1
"decentralised  
a decentralised system in economy means that none actually holds control of them 
system; neither the government, nor the boards.",1
"in other words, the government holds 
no power in setting market cap for cryptocurrencies, or how much a cryptocurrency is in 
circulation, whereas in the traditional banking system such as cash, the government 
regulates how much cash are in circulation, and setting the market cap.",1
"digital asset 
a digital asset is anything that exists in binary format, and is able to be used for trade 
purposes.",1
"ledger  
a ledger is a summary of all amounts entered in supporting journals which list individual 
transactions by date.",1
"the function of a ledger is to record, and total economic 
transactions.",1
"volatile  
cryptocurrencies are known to be volatile.",1
"a cryptocurrency can have a high value in a 
moment, and become significantly cheaper the next moment.",1
"such risk is common 
amongst cryptocurrencies.",1
"components of cryptocurrency 
cryptocurrency trading involves several key components, in which without would result 
in failure to trade cryptocurrency.",1
"the components are cryptocurrency keys, 
cryptocurrency wallets, blockchain, and cryptocurrency mining.",1
"details of each 
component will be discussed below.",1
"keys  
there are two types of keys that are essential in cryptocurrency trading: private keys and 
public keys.",1
"a private key is stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and proves ownership of a 
public key.",1
"a public key is connected to a particular amount of cryptocurrency, and can be 
used to access that amount.",1
"both the private and public keys are significant tools to 
maintain the security of crypto-economy.",1
"private key 
a private key is a sophisticated form of cryptography that allows a user to access his or 
her cryptocurrency.",1
"a private key is an integral aspect of cryptocurrency, and its security 
helps in protecting a user from theft and unauthorized access to their cryptocurrency.",1
"in cryptocurrency trade, a use is commonly given a public address and a private key to 
receive cryptocurrency in a form of coins or tokens ().",1
"the private key is made up of  
alphanumeric characters, which make it hard for a hacker to obtain.",1
the private key of a user is typically stored in a digital wallet belonging to the same user.,1
"when a transaction is commenced, the wallet software creates a digital signature by 
processing the transaction with the private key.",1
"this symbolizes a secure system, since 
the only way to generate a valid signature for any given cryptocurrency transaction is to 
use the private key.",1
"the signature is then used to confirm that a transaction has come 
from a particular user, and ensures that the transaction cannot be changed one it has 
been broadcasted into a blockchain.",1
"if a transaction is altered, the signature will change 
as well.",1
"if the private key is lost, the user can no longer access their wallet to spend, withdraw, or 
transfer cryptocurrency.",1
"hence, it is imperative that to save the private key in a secure 
location.",1
"private keys can be stored on paper wallets, or hardware such as smartcards or 
usb devices.",1
an offline software wallet can also be used to store private keys.,1
"this type of 
wallet has an offline portion for private keys, and an online portion which contains the 
public key.",1
"in short, a private key is an indispensable component in order to conduct a 
cryptocurrency transaction.",1
"security measures need to be taken to prevent loss of private 
key, whether accidental, or theft by hackers.",1
"a solution to cryptocurrency private key security was suggested by wisekey international 
holding ltd, a leading cyber security and iot company in january , about the use of a 
 
 
secure mechanical watch called wis.watch, powered by contactless secure hardware 
enabled wallet ().",1
it was designed to offer security and ease to cryptocurrency users.,1
"the wis.watch can securely store a user’s private key, and allows them to make 
contactless transactions.",1
"every time a contactless blockchain transaction is initiated, 
including a bitcoin transaction, the private key must be validated by using the near field 
technology, before enabling the transaction.",1
"while software wallets continue to be 
vulnerable to hackers, the secure hardware wallets have gained popularity.",1
"with the 
existence of wis.watch, hardware wallets such as usb flash drives are now able to be 
used without contact, and users can establish multiple private keys into the secure store 
by using the wisewallet application, and access these private keys to make transactions 
().",1
"the wisewallet application was said to be compatible with most of the existing 
blockchain technologies, and works as a part of payment using wisekey blockchain-as-a-
service technology offerings.",1
"the wis.watch is also said to be able to be used as a 
unique personal key identifier and trusted device to access smartphones, applications, 
personal data, and secured cloud storage.",1
"public key  
the public key is where cryptocurrency funds are deposited and received.",1
"it is a 
cryptographic code that allows a user to receive cryptocurrencies into their account ().",1
"when a user initiates their first transaction with a cryptocurrency, a unique pair of public 
key and private key is created.",1
"the transaction would also be broadcasted to the 
network, where distributed nodes confirm the validity of the transaction, before finalising 
it and recording it on the blockchain.",1
"it was noted that before a transaction is 
broadcasted, it needed to be signed digitally using the private key.",1
"the signature would 
 
 
prove the ownership of the private key, but not divulge the details of the private key to 
anyone.",1
"since a public key is created based on the private key, the user’s public key is used to 
prove that the digital signature came from their private key.",1
"once the transaction has 
been verified as valid, the cryptocurrency funds are sent to the recipient’s public address.",1
the public address is a hashed version of a public key.,1
"since the public key is made up of 
extremely long string of numbers, it needed to be compressed and shortened, hence the 
creation of public address.",1
"in other words, a private key generates a public key, which 
then generates a public address.",1
"when two users agreed to conduct a transaction, they 
would reveal their public addresses to each other.",1
"the sender needs the recipient’s public 
address to be able to send the funds to, which will then be able to spend or withdraw the 
amount using their private key.",1
"the recipient can also verify the sender’s batch of 
cryptocurrency coins using the sender’s public address, which is displayed on their 
screen.",1
"cryptocurrency wallets 
cryptocurrency wallets are essential component of cryptocurrency.",1
"they are digital 
wallets that are used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.",1
"a cryptocurrency 
wallet is commonly used to store a private key that proves ownership of a public key, 
which is a public digital code connected to a particular amount of currency.",1
"types of cryptocurrency wallets  
there are several types of cryptocurrency wallets, and each wallet has their advantages 
and disadvantages.",1
"most cryptocurrency have their official wallet, or a few officially 
recommended third-party wallets.",1
"typically, no wallet can store many cryptocurrency; 
 
 
most can only hold one, or two cryptocurrencies.",1
"cryptocurrency users would need to 
figure out which wallet can store their chosen cryptocurrency.",1
"cryptocurrency wallets can also be divided into two categories: cold wallet, and hot 
wallet.",1
"a cold wallet is generally considered to be effective for long-term storage of 
unused funds.",1
"a hot wallet is described as a type of wallet that is carried around for 
immediate use of the funds within.",1
"the key difference between hot and cold wallets is 
that hot wallets are connected to the internet, whereas cold wallets are not.",1
"hot wallets 
are also considered to be more likely targets from hackers, as they’re connected to the 
internet – cold wallets are offline/not connected to the internet; hence they’re safe from 
hackers.",1
"due to this, it was recommended to have as many layers of protection as 
possible on hot wallets.",1
"layers of protection can include two-factor authentication, 
strong password, and security settings.",1
"it was also thought to not have many funds in a 
hot wallet.",1
"the reason being that hackers can see how much funds are inside a hot wallet 
as it’s connected to the internet.",1
lesser funds would naturally mean less appealing target.,1
"however, despite having an offline feature to protect them from online threats, cold 
wallets are not immune to threats.",1
"a study found that a malware can be preinstalled, or 
pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet ().",1
"alternatively, it can infect the 
cold wallet’s system when removable media such as usb flash drives is inserted into the 
wallet’s computer in order to conduct a transaction.",1
"the study found that these attack 
methods have been repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade (, , , , ).",1
"in conclusion, even though cold wallets provide a high 
 
 
degree of isolation, it is still possible for attackers to compromise such wallets and steal 
private keys from the owners.",1
"desktop wallet  
a desktop wallet is the type that is considered more secure, when compared to both an 
online and mobile wallet.",1
"however, the degree of security is directly related to the quality 
of the desktop’s protection against online threats, such as computer virus, and malware.",1
"examples of desktop wallets are desktop applications, such as exodus, multibit, armory, 
and bitcoin core.",1
"a desktop wallet also has a feature that can identify it as a ‘cold’ wallet; when not 
connected to the internet, the desktop wallet is impervious to online threats from 
hackers, viruses, etc.",1
"a cold, desktop storage can be an older laptop that is completely 
offline, and on a clean operating system install.",1
"some of the advantages of desktop wallets are that they are easier-to-use cryptocurrency 
wallet as compared to the others, good cold storage solution, and private keys not stored 
on a third-party server.",1
"it was noted however, that they are only great solution for a cold 
wallet, only if they have never been connected to the internet before; if they have been 
connected to the internet, they would obtain an ip address, which hackers can trace and 
use to access the desktop.",1
"desktops can also store private keys by downloading and 
storing them - eliminating the need to rely on third-party server.",1
"disadvantages of desktop wallets include the security concerns, when and if they are 
connected to the internet.",1
"as mentioned before, connecting to the internet would 
present the desktop with an ip address, which hackers can use to hack the desktop.",1
"being 
able to or connected to the internet also exposes the desktop to other online threats, 
 
 
such as malware, key loggers, and viruses.",1
"desktops are also not immune to physical 
damages.",1
"fixing desktops by relying on service of others can expose its contents to them; 
they can examine the desktop’s contents, potentially obtaining access to cryptocurrency 
funds of the owner.",1
"it was also mentioned earlier that desktops can download private 
keys into them for storage.",1
"this also creates a risk such as that if a backup key/s were not 
made and the desktop become disabled or inaccessible; the key/s would be lost, and 
likely impossible to retrieve.",1
"mobile wallet 
mobile wallet is a type of wallet that is run from a phone application.",1
"it provides access to 
cryptocurrencies via mobile devices and provides additional features via the applications; 
however, it does create security risks similar to desktop wallets when connected to the 
internet.",1
"advantages of mobile wallets include them being practical and easier to use and access 
than other cryptocurrency wallets; mobile phones can be carried around and accessed 
anywhere, so long as there’s internet connection.",1
"this enables users to accept, or send 
cryptocurrency payments practically from anywhere.",1
"it was also mentioned that mobile 
wallet have additional features via the applications.",1
"one such feature includes qr code 
scanning to access cryptocurrency funds.",1
"the disadvantage of mobile wallets is the fact that mobile phones in general are 
incredibly insecure devices; just as desktops, they can also be infected with online threats 
such as malware and viruses.",1
"online wallet 
online wallets are commonly cryptocurrency wallets that are accessed via web browsers, 
which is why they can also be referred to as web wallet.",1
"advantages of online wallets include the fact that they are the fastest way to complete 
cryptocurrency transactions, given that there is no lag between locations of the 
application and server.",1
they are also ideal to hold small amounts of cryptocurrency.,1
"this 
characteristic categorise them as hot wallets, and share their property; ideal for quick, 
daily transactions that does not involve massive amount of cryptocurrency.",1
"some online 
wallets are also able to manage multiple cryptocurrencies, transfer between them, or be 
directly integrated into a cryptocurrency exchange marketplace.",1
"disadvantages of online wallets include users being susceptible to phishing scams, 
malware, and insider tracking, and out-dated security measures.",1
"the risks mentioned are 
a part of the hazard of using web browser services, and often out of the user’s control.",1
"information relating to user’s cryptocurrency details are also out of their control, as in 
they are stored in a third-party storage, the internet.",1
"use of online wallet requires a 
desktop, and as mentioned earlier, desktops connected to the internet are at risk from 
malware, key loggers, and viruses.",1
"as such, it is generally not recommended to use 
services such as internet café, to reduce the risk of information theft.",1
"hardware wallet  
hardware wallets are dedicated hardware that is built to be able to hold cryptocurrency, 
and keep it secure.",1
"hardware wallets include usb devices, and external hard disks.",1
"these 
devices are able to go online when connected to desktop, conduct transactions, and 
taken offline upon completion, for transportation and security.",1
"requiring a desktop and 
 
 
internet connection to conduct transactions relating to cryptocurrency classifies this type 
of wallet as hot wallet.",1
"paper wallet 
paper wallets are a medium in which stores information related to both public and 
private keys.",1
"an example of the information stored is qr code that belonged to a private 
key.",1
"using that qr code, a user can both send, and receive digital currency using a paper 
wallet.",1
"overall, paper wallets enabled an option of not storing digital data about a user’s 
data, such as private key, by using a paper wallet.",1
"mining  
cryptocurrency mining is the process of generating new cryptocurrency in the form of 
coins.",1
"cryptocurrency mining is called such, from to the fact that when transactions are 
added to the public ledger that is blockchain, new coins is created, or in other word, 
mined.",1
"cryptocurrency mining is an integral part of how cryptocurrency functions as a digital 
currency.",1
"the mining network relies on miners to verify and update the public ledger of 
cryptocurrency transactions, to verify that cryptocurrency users are not trying to cheat 
the system, and to add newly-discovered coins into the system.",1
"miners 
as explained earlier, miners work together to verify transactions, ultimately mining new 
coins into the system.",1
but that does not mean that all miners are on the same team.,1
"cryptocurrency miners gets rewarded in the form of some new coins for their hard work 
in mining coins, but the amount of coins rewarded are directly proportional to the 
contribution a miner had in the process of generating new coins.",1
"hence, there are 
competitions amongst cryptocurrency miners in adding new transactions into the ledger 
 
 
as part of generating new coins.",1
"to put it simply, the more a miner contribute into adding 
new transactions into the ledger and generating coins, the more coins the miner obtains 
as rewards.",1
"proof-of-work  
in cryptocurrency, proof-of-work is a system that utilises hard-to-compute, but easy-to-
verify functions, in order to limit exploitation of cryptocurrency mining by miners.",1
"a proof-of-work system’s hash function is the algorithm used to find a solution to the 
computational puzzle, which is simple to calculate the output is if the input is known.",1
"however, it is virtually impossible to calculate an output, if the input is unknown; trying 
every possible input would be done until the correct input is found.",1
"when cryptocurrency 
miners mine digital coins and add blocks of transactions to a blockchain, they effectively 
complete a proof-of-work system by using high-powered computers to solve a 
mathematical problem that is cryptographical puzzle.",1
"one of the most popular proof-of-work functions is called sha, a part of the sha- 
family of secure hash algorithms.",1
it is also the one that is used as bitcoin’s proof-of-work.,1
it was first used by adam back in  as a way to block spam emails.,1
"recently however, 
bitcoin started utilising an alternative to proof-of-work, called proof-of-stake (, ).",1
"it 
was a new proof-of-work mechanism that improves decentralisation and reduces risk of 
% attack, without increasing the risk of sybil attack – an attack in which a single node 
such as a cryptocurrency miner assumed multiple identities ().",1
"there is a single major flaw to the proof-of-work system, and that is requiring a large 
amount of computing power, to solve cryptographical puzzle.",1
"the proof-of-work system 
holds no use apart from protecting the validity of cryptocurrency transactions and 
 
 
generally ensuring cryptocurrency system are ran honestly.",1
"this would mean that the 
process of mining cryptocurrency with proof-of-work is horribly wasteful, in terms of 
energy-use.",1
"given the wasteful energy spent on proof-of-work system, it was not viewed 
as a long-term for cryptocurrency.",1
"alternatives such as the aforementioned proof-of-
stake are seen as a more friendly function.",1
"in short, proof-of-work is indeed designed to be difficult, in order to prevent malicious 
behaviour, such as a miner trying to add fake transaction block into a blockchain to get 
reward coins.",1
"proof-of-work would not only protect digital currency such as 
cryptocurrency from malicious miners, but also prevent a single person from assuming 
control over which transaction block to next be added into the blockchain.",1
"how cryptocurrency are mined  
in order to add transactions into a blockchain, all miners collect all transactions that were 
recently broadcasted by cryptocurrency users, verify the transactions, and compile them 
down into a transaction block – a condensed record of all transactions for that period of 
time.",1
"it is possible for a miner to simple create a fake transaction block and adding it into the 
blockchain.",1
"due to this, the cryptocurrency algorithm was designed to make 
cryptocurrency mining difficult.",1
"to prevent a miner from adding a transaction block at 
their will, they have to solve a difficult computational puzzle – a proof-of-work scheme.",1
"the proof-of-work scheme was designed to provide solutions that are easy to verify, but 
difficult to find.",1
"in short, cryptocurrency miners compete against each other to see who can solve a 
difficult, cryptographic puzzle first.",1
"as one miner found the solution, they broadcast the 
 
 
solution to all the other miners, for them to verify that the solution is correct.",1
"if the 
solution is indeed correct, the network adds the successfully-mined transaction block to 
the accepted blockchain permanently.",1
"the miner who was the first to successfully solve the cryptographic puzzle of transaction 
block is the rewarded for their effort, by receiving new coins – the amount of coins differs 
and depends on the transaction block size.",1
"the possibility of reward acts as an incentive 
for cryptocurrency miners to keep investing in computational time and effort into mining 
new cryptocurrency coins.",1
"the process of rewarding cryptocurrency miners with coins for 
their hard work of solving cryptographic puzzle also contributes to the overall 
cryptocurrency coins supply.",1
"where cryptocurrencies are mined 
it was explained that cryptocurrencies are mined by miners, in which they solve 
cryptographical puzzle to add transactional blocks into a blockchain, creating new coins 
as a result.",1
"as such, cryptocurrency mining can be done from practically everywhere, 
providing that the miner have access to a computer with sufficient computing power.",1
"it was also explained that mining cryptocurrency with proof-of-work in place would 
require a large amount of energy.",1
this raised a concern such as carbon footprint ().,1
"it 
was estimated that the combined electricity consumption for bitcoin and ethereum 
mining, which represented as high as % of the total cryptocurrency market 
capitalisation (), had already reached a staggering  terawatt-hours yearly, and is on 
the rise.",1
"in terms of perspective, greece’s population of  million consumed close to  
terawatt-hours annually; the consumption of energy to mine bitcoins and ethereum coins 
alone nearly require as much energy as greece, a nation.",1
"a vast majority of cryptocurrency mining (%) was done in china, and is typically 
powered by coal plants ().",1
"with the use of life-cycle impact-assessment methodology, 
it was estimated that the annual carbon footprint for bitcoin and ethereum mining was 
comparable to that of some .",1
"million average european inhabitants; hence the 
conclusion of the study being that the cryptocurrency industry was in need of reform to 
be more environmentally sustainable.",1
"however, despite the claim that cryptocurrency mining was environmentally hazardous, a 
different study found that findings to be economically unsound.",1
"in a review, stuart 
wimbush mentioned a possible fault in the claim of the combined annual electricity 
consumption due to bitcoin and ethereum mining was % that of greece ().",1
"it was 
found that bitcoin and ethereum generated a total wealth of us$ billion in , 
whereas the  million inhabitants of greece generated a total wealth of approximately 
us$ billion in the same year.",1
"given that greece generated less wealth than 
cryptocurrency mining, and would have consumed much more than simply electrical 
energy in the process, it was thought that the mining of cryptocurrency seemed to be 
considerably less wasteful.",1
"in other words, it was natural for 
cryptocurrency mining to have consumed as much power (electrical) in order to generate 
a large amount of wealth.",1
"it was also suggested for nations to transit from using fossil-
fuel-based electricity generation, to nuclear or other sustainable alternatives ().",1
"this 
 
 
would allow generation of a large amount of wealth such as from cryptocurrency mining, 
and using a large amount of sustainable energy.",1
"blockchain  
in terms of cryptocurrency, a blockchain is a public ledger of all a cryptocurrency’s 
transaction.",1
"as new transactions are made, they are compiled into blocks, which will be 
added into the sequential blockchain.",1
"in order for a transaction to be considered 
successful, it has to be added into the blockchain.",1
"once a transaction block is added into 
a blockchain, it will remain there permanently and are considered as public record.",1
"other uses for blockchain 
aside from cryptocurrency, there are emerging theories in ways to utilise the blockchain 
technology.",1
"amongst them are medicines, gun control, stock exchange, and other 
investments such as gold.",1
"medicine  
a use of the blockchain ledger system was suggested by m. hoy in medicines ().",1
"it was 
suggested to tie everything from medical records to library checkouts using a blockchain 
ledger containing verifiable time-stamped records of creation and ownership.",1
"the system 
can also potentially prevent changes in documents, and data tampering.",1
"gun control 
it was suggested by thomas f. heston that the blockchain used for effective gun control 
().",1
"the blockchain protocol can be used to keep track of gun flow from manufacturer to 
end user, and track sales from a gun owner to another.",1
"the blockchain’s anonymity 
feature would also allow better privacy than existing background check systems, and 
simultaneously link ownership of a particular gun to an individual in an immutable 
manner.",1
"stock exchange  
in december , it was announced that asx, australia’s main stock exchange, would 
start using blockchain technology to process its equities transactions ().",1
"asx would begin 
replacing its current system, chess, with the distributed ledger technology to help 
manage the clearing and settlement for buying and selling stocks.",1
"asx chief executive at 
that time, dominic stevens, stated that the change into using blockchain technology 
would put australia at the forefront of innovation in the financial markets.",1
"other investments – gold  
it is apparently possible to implement the blockchain system onto other types of 
investment.",1
"an article was published about australia’s biggest gold refiner, perth mint, 
developing their own blockchain-based gold products, as a response to the threat posed 
by the increasing in popularity of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ().",1
"richard hayes, 
chief executive of perth mint at that time, commented that the underlying blockchain 
technology behind cryptocurrencies presented an opportunity for perth mint to develop 
new products with greater security, and traceability.",1
"in summary, blockchain has features that are beneficial to many fields.",1
"such features 
include anti-tempering, as all records added into a blockchain are final, anonymity, and 
continual records to keep updated about a matter.",1
"how to trade cryptocurrency  
trading cryptocurrency requires having good background knowledge, and the 
components needed to trade cryptocurrency.",1
"the two main components a user needed 
to start trading cryptocurrency are cryptocurrency wallet, and cryptocurrency exchange.",1
"in terms of having good background knowledge, there are several notes to consider.",1
"first, 
a beginner should choose a trading company with a good reputation that offers an 
 
 
exchange and a wallet.",1
"a beginner should also trade prominent coins, as starter.",1
"bitcoin 
and ethereum are two of the most prominent coins as of june  (, ).",1
"how to spend cryptocurrency  
one of the major concerns regarding cryptocurrency is finding ways to spend it.",1
"conducting a search using a search engine was thought to be one of the best ways to look 
for ways, or merchants who accepts cryptocurrency.",1
"gambling is also a way to spend 
cryptocurrency () 
spending cryptocurrency is not always possible, as some countries have banned trading 
of cryptocurrency.",1
some countries opted for a compromise in the form of regulations.,1
government regulations will be discussed in more detail in a later section.,1
"how cryptocurrencies differ from flat currencies 
as explained earlier, cryptocurrency differs from regular, flat currency.",1
"the difference lies 
in two major ways.",1
"cryptocurrencies are only accepted as payment by other users – if no 
one accepts it, then it is considered worthless.",1
"flat currency however, will always be 
accepted as payment by the government, at the very least.",1
"the second major difference 
is that cryptocurrency token supply is not managed by a central authority, whereas flat 
currency is managed by the government and can lead to either inflation, or deflation.",1
"popular cryptocurrencies (latest price)  
there are thousands of cryptocurrency.",1
"it can be hard to determine which cryptocurrency 
is the best, or worst.",1
"there are several parameters that can be used to rank 
cryptocurrency: their price, market cap, supply rate, and existing volume in circulation.",1
"in 
 
 
terms of price, the four highest-ranked cryptocurrency as at june  are bitcoin, 
bitcoin cash, mixin, and ethereum ().",1
"crime types in australia 
the types of crimes in australia will be listed, and matched with some of the cases related 
to cryptocurrency discussed below.",1
"some of the most recent crimes in relation to cryptocurrency  
to understand more as to how cryptocurrency can be related to crimes, various case 
involving cryptocurrency in general, or a particular cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, various 
case that occurred in the last decade will be discussed below.",1
"swoop for cases that 
occurred in the last decade was decided, as cryptocurrency, or at least the proof-of-
concept, was published in  by satoshi nakamoto ().",1
"december  – hacking of nicehash  
one of the case examples to be explained is the cyber-attack against nicehash.",1
"the crime 
happened on the th of december , where nicehash, a crypto-mining company 
based in slovenia, reported that their system was breached in a cyber-attack().",1
"nicehash is known as the world’s largest crypto-mining marketplace, and was created 
based on the concept of a shared economy.",1
"they were founded on the th of march 
, and has grown to exponential heights ever since, and harboured , 
cryptocurrency miners daily on average ().",1
"nicehash is different from any crypto-
mining marketplace in that they applied a new system to cryptocurrency mining that 
 
 
resolved around the relationship between cryptocurrency sellers and buyers.",1
"nicehash 
users upon registration are presented with three options.",1
"the first option would be that 
users can choose to sell their hashing power generated from their mining hardware to 
receive earnings.",1
"the second option would be that investors can choose to buy a package 
to mine a particular cryptocurrency at a designated set pool with the support of crypto-
algorithm.",1
"the last option would be to be a combination of a buyer, and a seller via 
nicehash.",1
"on more detail about the case, it was reported on newstex finance & accounting blogs 
that about , bitcoins were stolen ().",1
"the approximate worth of those stolen bitcoins 
was $ million.",1
"it was reported earlier that day, that the price of bitcoins was at a 
record-high of more than $, ().",1
"the record-high price of the bitcoin was very 
possibly be the motive of the crime, or at least tempted them to steal bitcoins.",1
"in terms of bitcoin-theft, the case was not the first reported case in the field.",1
"gox, a bitcoin exchange based in japan, reported a theft of , coins ().",1
those bitcoins were worth nearly $ million at that time.,1
"gox were shut down not 
long after the case (), and filed for bankruptcy protection in japan, later that year ().",1
"a 
study of this case found that a meteoric rise in price and rapid growth were associated 
with cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin – this also attracted thieves/hackers ().",1
"in regards of the aftermaths of the case about nicehash, the ceo of nicehash at that 
time, marko kobal, had resigned following the incident (), and reimbursements were 
carried out by the company.",1
"on the st of january, nearly two months after the hacking 
of bitcoins, the company announced that they are going to reimburse their service users 
that were affected by the security breach that occurred on th of december  ().",1
"it was also reported along with the fourth stage, that % of the 
old balance amount was already reimbursed to all users that were impacted by the 
security breach.",1
"more details about the program are unknown, or if there will be any 
more, but  given that there are four stages thus far and % of the stolen amount 
reimbursed, it can be predicted that there will be about seven more stages of 
reimbursements, with each stage reimbursing approximately % of the stolen amount.",1
"it 
was concluded that users of blockchain are able to add non-financial data for purposes 
such as describing a transaction’s purpose, and insert benign messages or record 
information for other financial services.",1
"the objectionable contents were found to be 
imbedded in such data, and given that blockchain are viewable by practically all users, the 
data would be downloaded and persistently stored by them.",1
this discovery would place certain users of the bitcoin network in legal difficulties.,1
"the 
researchers also mentioned that this discovery could pose an obstacle for greater 
adoption and mainstream acceptance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",1
"upon 
further analysis, the researchers found that most of the files were harmless, but some of 
the files contained copyright violations and the disclosure of the people’s identifiable 
information, and at least eight files were said to containing sexual content ().",1
"amongst 
 
 
the child pornography materials, two files were found to contain  links to child 
pornography websites, and a file depicting a nude image of a minor.",1
"experts said that the files were likely to be downloaded as a part of notes to transactions, 
or inserted as the transactions themselves.",1
"users of blockchain are able to add non-
financial data for purposes such as describing a transaction’s purpose insert benign 
messages, or record information for other financial services – anyone with access to 
bitcoin software such as miners, exchanges, and traders, have the ability to upload any 
content into the blockchain.",1
"arbitrary data insertion methods for bitcoin’s blockchain  
as explained before, aside from recording financial transactions, bitcoin’s blockchain are 
also able to be filled with non-financial data.",1
"non-financial data can take a form of short 
messages via special transaction types, or even complete files.",1
"to add complete files into 
a blockchain, arbitrary data has to be encoded as standard transactions.",1
"there are two 
insertion methods for non-financial data: low-level insertion methods, and content 
insertion services.",1
"benefits and risks of arbitrary blockchain content 
bitcoin’s blockchain design included several ways to insert arbitrary, non-financial data 
into its blockchain, both intentionally, and unintentionally.",1
"potential benefits of engraving 
arbitrary data into the bitcoin’s blockchain and the risks associated with them will be 
discussed further below.",1
"benefits  
bitcoin offered coinbase, a digital currency exchange headquarters, and op_return, a 
special transaction template that allows one small data chunk as an attachment onto a 
transaction, as explicit channels to insert small chunks of non-financial data into their 
 
 
blockchain.",1
"the benefit of using op_return is that different services use op_return to 
link non-financial assets such as vouchers, to bitcoin’s blockchain.",1
"coinbase differ from 
op_return in those only miners who dedicate significant computational contribution to 
maintain the blockchain, to be able to add extra chunks of data into the new transaction 
blocks.",1
"risks  
there are several risks associated with adding data into blockchain content.",1
"some of 
them are copyright violations, malware, privacy violations, politically sensitive content, 
and illegal & condemned content.",1
"as the blockchain are akin to file-sharing networks, 
pirated data can be distributed as part of a transaction block.",1
"malware is also a threat, as 
they can be inserted as an attachment, and if downloaded and opened, can cause 
cataclysmic damage onto the system or device.",1
"governments have valid concerns 
regarding a leakage of classified information.",1
"if such classified information is added into a 
blockchain, it would mean that more than a single user having the file, and the ability to 
access it, potentially exposing sensitive information about a government.",1
"in short, there are ways for someone to add an objectionable content into a blockchain, 
and cause harm if possessed or accessed by other users.",1
"unlike systems such as social 
media platforms, file-sharing networks, and online storage systems, contents that are 
stored in a blockchain can be do so while remaining anonymous, making it hard to trace 
the culprit.",1
"examining the data (non-financial data) 
there are three methods to examine non-financial data in a blockchain: low-level 
insertion methods detectors, and service detectors, and suspicious transaction detectors.",1
"low-level insertion method detectors 
the low-level insertion method detectors were designed to match individual transactions 
that are likely to contain non-financial data.",1
"they detect manipulated financial 
transactions, as well as op_return, non-standard, and coinbase transactions.",1
"service detectors  
the service detectors enabled the detection and extraction of files based on the service’ 
protocols, and also tracking of data used in service-created transactions.",1
"suspicious transaction detectors  
the suspicious transaction detectors examine standard transactions that are likely to 
carry non-financial data, but were not detected.",1
"for a transaction to be examined by this 
method, it has to have at least  suspicious outputs.",1
"illegal drugs  
there was a reported case in india about a drug trade related to cryptocurrency ().",1
"an 
arrest was made by the police against two university students that were caught 
purchasing drugs using cryptocurrencies.",1
"the duo would purchase an amount of drug, 
and then have it transported into a particular place where it’ll be picked up.",1
it was not the first case where cryptocurrency was used to purchase drugs.,1
"there was a 
case in , where a university student sold/auction drugs via an online drug 
marketplace called ‘silk road’ ().",1
"the student had created a fake profile and auctioned 
drugs online, where customers would buy, and have it delivered to an address of their 
choice.",1
"the method of payment was cryptocurrency, with different drugs cost different 
amount of coins.",1
"the case was ultimately solved when police made an arrest of the 
student in a public library, where he logged in into his silk road profile.",1
"march  
in a newspaper article published on march , it was announced that pavel lerner, a 
cryptocurrency businessman, was kidnapped in ukraine by armed assailants, and was 
forced to pay $ million ransom in the form of bitcoins from his digital wallet ().",1
"the 
case led to demands being made to the government to clamp down on cryptocurrency 
crime.",1
"it was mentioned that every month, the ukrainian police would raid the kvazar 
semiconductor plant in kiev, and seize millions of pounds in form of computer 
equipment, which were claimed to be taken by russians and used to finance the 
separatist regions of donetsk and lugansk.",1
"base on the case examples below, in terms of type of crimes in australia by acic, 
cryptocurrency had been used in two categories of crimes: illicit drugs (silk road), 
cybercrime (hacking of nicehash).",1
"child pornography and kidnapping did not quite fit into 
the crime categories listed, but they are serious crimes, nonetheless.",1
"government regulations  
in response to several concerns such as environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining 
and the risks of owning cryptocurrency, several governments had decided to take actions 
against cryptocurrency.",1
"actions taken include total banning, and putting regulations in 
place.",1
"china  
china as of february  had completely banned cryptocurrency trading within their 
country.",1
"the process actually started from september , where it was announced that 
chinese regulators declaring initial coin offerings illegal ().",1
"this meant that 
cryptocurrency owners are not allowed to promote, much less sell, their cryptocurrency 
 
 
to anyone in the country.",1
"the regulatory action was said to be caused by growing fear 
from initial coin offerings, which caught investors’ imagination that further leads to 
phishing activities.",1
"ultimately, cryptocurrency was banned in total starting february .",1
"it was announced 
in an article that was published by financial news, a publication company that is affiliated 
with the people’s bank of china, that the chinese government’s recent attempts to stamp 
out digital currency trading by shutting down domestic cryptocurrency exchanges were 
not successful in completely eradicating cryptocurrency trading, and that the government 
will strengthen measures, to thoroughly remove any onshore or offshore trading 
platforms related to virtual currency trading ().",1
"south korea 
south korea is another country that moved to regulate cryptocurrency.",1
"initially, it was 
reported that south korea planned to ban cryptocurrency trading, in light of 
cryptocurrency abuse.",1
"south korea’s justice minister at that time, park sung-ki, 
mentioned there being great concerns regarding virtual currencies (, ).",1
"however, as 
at mid-january , a ban had not been placed, but instead considered taxing 
cryptocurrency transactions, according to the south korean finance minister at that time, 
kim dong-yeon ().",1
"later in the month, raids were conducted by the country’s police 
and tax agencies on major cryptocurrency exchanges for alleged tax evasion.",1
"aside from 
alleged tax evasion case, the police were also looking for a seoul-based cryptocurrency 
exchange, over possible gambling allegations.",1
"ultimately, the south korean government officially banned anonymous cryptocurrency 
trading commencing at the end of january  ().",1
"this would mean that 
 
 
cryptocurrency traders could only make cryptocurrency transactions from bank accounts 
set up under their real names.",1
"ukraine & kazakhstan 
ukraine had started to intensify the search for methods to regulate cryptocurrencies, due 
to growing concerns in their capital, kiev, that exploitation of the digital assets by 
criminals and geopolitical adversaries presented a growing national security risk ().",1
"ukraine’s national security and defence council chief, oleksandr turchynov, warned that 
the current legal vacuum posed a threat to the economy and security of the state.",1
"he also 
mentioned that given the rapid development of cryptocurrencies around the world, the 
issue could not be left out of attention, hence the plans to develop regulations.",1
"the 
soaring prices of cryptocurrency have made the market an increasingly lucrative target 
for cyber criminals.",1
"there was also a growing concern among regulators and governments 
that cryptocurrency could be used by organised crime-groups for money laundering (, 
), and other criminal activities.",1
"in a response to growing concerns of cryptocurrency being used, or simply being related 
to crimes, the kazakhstan association of blockchain and cryptocurrency submitted a 
proposal to the eurasian economic union (eaeu) to create an advisory board on 
blockchain and cryptocurrency ().",1
"the proposal was submitted during the 
cryptoconference  in almaty, and had gathered some support for governments to 
adopt legislation to regulate the cryptocurrency market.",1
"conference participants were 
pushing for the adoption of cryptocurrency laws within the eaeu in order to protect the 
best interests of all market from third parties such as cryptocurrency exchange 
marketplace.",1
"the regulation also aimed to prevent the use of cryptocurrency as a tool for 
 
 
illegal transactions, the legalisation of proceeds from crime, and the financing of 
terrorism.",1
"australia  
as of april , new laws for digital currency exchange (dce) providers operating in 
australia were implemented by austrac, australia’s financial intelligence agency, anti-
money laundering, and counter-terrorism financing regulator (amf/ctf) ().",1
"the new 
laws would cover regulation of service providers of cryptocurrency, such as 
cryptocurrency exchange marketplace.",1
"the austrac ceo, nicole rose, announced that the new laws would strengthen the 
agency’s compliance and intelligence capabilities to help dces implement systems and 
controls that can minimise the risk of criminals using them for purposes such as money 
laundering, terrorism financing, and cybercrime.",1
"with the new laws in place, dces with a business operation located in australia must now 
register with austrac, and meet the government’s aml/ctf compliance and reporting 
obligations.",1
"the transition period were run until may , to allow dces time to register 
them.",1
"corporate regulations  
countries are not the only one capable of banning, or at least regulating 
cryptocurrencies.",1
"it was found that massive corporations such as google, and apple, have 
also moved to regulate cryptocurrency – cryptocurrency mining, to be exact.",1
"google 
on the rd of april , it was reported that google had decided to start cracking down 
on malicious cryptocurrency mining via extensions on their website platform, google 
 
 
chrome ().",1
"until that period, google chrome’s web policy had been permitting 
cryptocurrency mining in their extensions, providing that cryptocurrency mining was 
indeed an extension’s single purpose of use, and that the user is adequately informed of 
the cryptocurrency mining behaviour.",1
"unfortunately, it was found that approximately % of extensions with cryptocurrency 
mining scripts that developers have attempted to upload to the chrome web store failed 
to comply with google chrome’s policies ().",1
"that resulted in their rejection or removal 
from the store, according to james wagner, extensions platform product manager, 
explained in a blog post.",1
"it was then decided that chrome web store would no longer 
accept extensions that mine cryptocurrency.",1
"however, the currency existing extensions 
with blockchain-related purposes other than cryptocurrency mining would still continue 
to be permitted in the web store.",1
"apple  
apple is one of the latest companies to ban cryptocurrency mining on their devices ().",1
it began with the release of a new set of developer guideline updates.,1
"virtual currencies 
such as cryptocurrency heavily rely on cryptocurrency mining to sustain their existence.",1
"the process required using a computer’s processing power in order to obtain fractions of 
coins – this consumes an incredible amount of power.",1
"the power drains could potentially 
end up leading to a higher electricity bill, surpassing the price of what are mined.",1
"it could 
also put a significant burden on the mining device.",1
"the reason of apple banning 
cryptocurrency mining seemed to be caused by the latter concern, as they banned 
cryptocurrency mining on their devices due to power consumption, and the potential of 
the process to put unnecessary pressure on the devices.",1
"in summary, some countries actively ban cryptocurrency, while others opted to 
compromise by placing regulations in place.",1
"concerns regarding cryptocurrency being 
used for crime seemed valid, but with regulations such as the new law implemented by 
australia’s austrac would ensure transparency of dces, and assist in solving crimes by 
having decs registered in the system, and keeping track into their activities.",1
"the new law 
would also help in monitoring decs for any sign of criminal activities.",1
"conclusion  
in conclusion, cryptocurrency indeed have a relation to crimes.",1
"there have been cases 
where cryptocurrency was used to commit a crime such as purchasing a drug, kidnapping 
a person and demand ransom in the form of cryptocurrency, and hacking into a 
cryptocurrency marketplace to steal cryptocurrency.",1
"based on the crime types listed by 
acic, two crime categories have been proved to be related to cryptocurrency: 
cybercrime, and illicit drugs.",1
"in response to crimes related to cryptocurrency being 
committed, laws were put in place in several countries.",1
"some laws were implemented to 
ban cryptocurrency completely such as in china, whereas others such as south korea and 
australia opted to regulate cryptocurrencies as opposed to completely banning them.",1
"as 
cryptocurrency are able to continue to rise, so too are the number of people that accept 
them as payments – this can be a cause for a crime.",1
"in this study, there was no search 
conducted on the relation between cryptocurrency against other crime types such as 
violence and arson.",1
"a future study concerning the relation between cryptocurrency and 
other crime types, including the lesser ones, would be helpful in identifying more ways 
cryptocurrency can be used, or related to a crime – this can help in placing laws, or create 
methods to counter, or solve those crimes.",1

dures that are built on cryptographic methods of protection, governing the identification 
of owners and fixation of their changes facts (ober, ).",1
"a key feature of cryptocurrencies is the lack of any internal or external administra-
tor.",1
"therefore, banks, tax, judicial and other public or private bodies may not affect the 
transactions of all participants in the payment system (kobrin, ).",1

use of cryptocurrency bitcoin, there are two main way of seeing the applicability of this 
currency (figure ).",1
"the first group consists of the so-called «bitcoin radicals» who believe that the 
cryptocurrency will be used as a complete substitute for modern currency and money in 
the traditional sense, but their purpose has rather ideological arguments rather than real 
solutions to the modern monetary problems (greenspans, ).",1
"the second group – representatives of the «аltchain» – see cryptocurrencyas more 
than just a sharing tool.",1

modern advancement in the scientific community has been astounding, and sometimes 
very unexpected.",2
"we have discovered smaller particles than ever before known, bioengineered 
body parts for humans, developed cures and vaccinations for diseases that we never thought 
would be possible, and so much more.",2
"science is leading us, as humans, down a future path that 
nobody expected, and a path that some may not want.",2
"some of these new scientific discoveries, 
especially the new technologies involving genetic engineering, could change the human race for 
the good and possibly for the bad.",2
"the possibility (and success) of editing the genomes of 
different organisms around the world, including humans, has recently come into light, and has 
proven to be one of the most significant and promising technologies in the scientific and medical 
communities today.",2
"however, the ethical dilemma that the new genetic engineering technologies has 
presented cannot be ignored.",2
"whether these technologies should actually be used on the human 
population, and if so what they can and cannot be used for, is a question that can change the 
future of humans in innumerable ways.",2
"there are many proposed uses of the new genetic engineering technologies, including 
cancer therapy and other therapies for genetic diseases.",2
"however, the ability to alter the human 
genome in any form raises many ethical concerns, as altering our genetic makeup can go much 
further than disease therapy.",2
"altering the human genome would not only allow us to edit out 
mutant genes that cause disease in humans, but also to alter multiple other traits.",2
"we have 
already developed the technology to genetically test the genomes of human embryos (a human 
which is in the early stages of development and has not been born, and is derived from the 
zygote, which is the single cell resulting from the fertilization of an egg by a sperm) for their 
  
genetic makeup (what genes they are positive for), and those who participate in in-vitro 
fertilization have the ability to take advantage of this technology.",2
"for example, parents are able 
to choose the sex of their child if they desire to.",2
"any action similar to this introduces the ethical 
debate associated with genetic engineering: what should it be used for?",2
"there is a major fear of 
using the new genetic engineering technologies to perform similar actions and create “designer 
babies” or “genetically modified humans.” 
the genetic engineering techniques we have developed involve the precise modification 
of dna and allows genes to be turned on or off, meaning that certain genes will not be 
physically expressed if they are turned off, and they will be expressed if they are turned on.",2
"this 
allows scientists to identify traits they want to remove or to insert other traits found somewhere 
else in an organisms’ genome through the process of editing alleles out and replacing them with 
non-mutant alleles.",2
"should we alter a human embryo if we are able to genetically test and 
confirm that it will be born with a lethal, degenerative disease, or should we allow the human 
race to populate naturally?",2
"even in the case of using genetic engineering technology on already 
born humans, the question of what we are able to do versus what we should do still introduces an 
ethical debate, as altering the germline of an adult human changes the genetic makeup of not 
only the adult but also any offspring of that person.",2
"for example, some genetic mutations that lead to the development of alzheimer’s disease 
are known.",2
"if we are able to test for chromosomal content of human embryos, then we are able to

crispr today would carry the risk that its genome had been changed in unexpected ways.” not

the crispr-cas genetic engineering technology to edit the genetic makeup of a human 
embryo, and more specifically to modify the genetic makeup of the embryo’s germline.",2

helix consisting of two complementary strands made up nucleotides, which contain a phosphate 
group, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base.",2

adenine (a), cytosine (c), guanine (g), and thymine (t), and rna has the same four except that 
uracil (u) is substituted for thymine.",2

and cytosine pairs with guanine.",2
"each dna sequence that codes for a gene is converted into a 
protein through two different processes that make up the central dogma of genetics.",2

unwound and replicated, and then converted into rna (which is single-stranded rather than 
double-stranded) through a process called transcription, and then the rna is translated into the 
corresponding protein through a process called translation.",2

and most importantly, edited safely.",2
"this means that there were no observed detrimental (and 
  
unexpected) off-target effects in the embryos in the trial.",2

successfully edit out the mutant hbb gene in one of their trials, they reported multiple off-target 
effects and mosaicism, both which mean that some un-targeted dna was edited.",2
"in both of the 
above cases, the germline of the human embryo was altered, whether the target gene was 
completely or only partially edited.",2

theories of bioethics: deontology and consequentialism.",2

violate rules which depend on rational thought, and we must not intentionally harm someone 
else.",2

rational thought.",2

violate, regardless of the outcome (i.e.",2

humans for the purpose of achieving our goals.",2

we cannot lie.",2
"kant also states, as a part of deontological theory, that no person can be simply 
used to fulfill one’s own goals, and we cannot intentionally harm.",2
"the consequentialist theory, formulated by jeremy bentham and john stuart mill, is 
quite similar to an economic theory.",2
"this theory focuses on the outcomes of behavior, and is 
therefore commonly contrasted to deontological theory.",2
"it judges whether something is ethically 
justifiable or not based on what a behavior produces and not the path it took to get to that 
outcome.",2
"according to consequentialism, we are trying to achieve the greatest good for the 
greatest number of people, which is similar to a cost-benefit analysis.",2

consequentialists will sacrifice individuals to save the many and achieve personal goals.",2
"case study : introduction 
  
in this section, i am answering the following question: is it ethically justifiable to use the 
crispr-cas technology, in its current condition, to eliminate risk or determinate genes of 
alzheimer’s disease?",2
"in order to answer this question, i propose the following scenario: 
 a middle-aged couple had been attempting to conceive a child and they just found out 
that the woman is pregnant.",2
"they have both been screened for their genetic makeup, and the 
father is positive for the mutated apolipoprotein ε- (apoe-) gene that is the major precursor 
for the formation of β-amyloid plaques, and therefore a large precursor for alzheimer’s disease.",2
"worried about the possible inheritance of this gene, the couple decides to screen their embryo for 
the apoe- gene.",2
"they have the belief that they should do anything and everything to make sure 
that their child has the best and longest life possible.",2
"after screening, it is determined that the 
embryo also carries the mutated apoe- gene that is a precursor for alzheimer’s.",2
"they decide 
that they want to use current genetic engineering technology, the crispr-cas system, in order 
to edit out the mutated gene and replace it with a normal one.",2
"however, the couple’s physician is 
skeptical about using the technology in its current state to perform this procedure.",2
"is it ethically 
justifiable for the couple and the physician to do go ahead with the editing of the embryo?",2
"my 
conclusion, as shown in the arguments below, is that at the current state of the crispr-cas 
technology, it is not ethically justifiable for the couple to edit out the mutated apoe- gene from 
their growing embryo.",2
"case study : analyzing deontological theory 
 editing the mutated gene out of the couple’s embryo would violate major aspects of 
deontological theory.",2
"first of all, it can be argued that the couple is not currently relying on 
rational thought.",2
"although it could be argued that wanting to do everything for your child is 
  
rational, in this case the parents are not scientists that know the small details of the unintended 
consequences, even if they have been informed of these consequences by their physician.",2
"they 
are trying to do everything possible to help their child, and even though editing out the mutated 
gene is possible, it is not rationally okay to do in its current state.",2
"as stated in the previous 
section, the scientific issues of unintended base changes and mosaicism could lead to 
consequences we have not yet discovered or predicted.",2
"even though the couple wants to use it to 
possibly eliminate the risk of alzheimer’s or alleviate later symptoms of alzheimer’s in their 
future child, they are not considering the possible side effects.",2
"although alzheimer’s could be 
gone, many other complications, which possibly could be fatal, could arise from the use of the 
crispr-cas system.",2
"from the physician and scientist standpoint, the physician would be violating 
deontological theory as he would be using someone else in order to reach his own goal of 
eliminating and/or alleviating alzheimer’s disease, especially knowing that there could be 
possible consequences.",2
"deontological theory states that we cannot use others to achieve personal 
goals.",2
"he has the obligation to give the best possible care to each patient he encounters, and to 
make sure that he helps the patient become as healthy as possible.",2
"knowing that there are 
possible detrimental consequences of using the crispr-cas technology in its current state 
would be violating the commitment he made when he became a physician.",2
"kant places a lot of emphasis on the importance of the rational person, and how humans 
must be considered rational in order to make the decision of what is right and wrong.",2
"around the 
age of -, kant allows children moral status because they are then capable of rational 
thought.",2
"according to this theory, embryos are not capable of rational thought and do not have 
moral standing.",2
"however, the embryos will eventually develop into infants and later adults with 
  
a moral standing.",2
"kant would originally discount the moral standing of embryos, but they do 
have potential to eventually develop rational thought, which must be considered in the 
deontological analysis of each of the following case studies.",2
"in the real world, deontological 
theory would not apply to these embryos that we are able to genetically manipulate until they are 
capable of rational thought.",2
"kant also states, as a part of deontological theory, that no person can be simply used to 
fulfill one’s own goals.",2
"this applies in the sense that embryos cannot give consent at the time 
they would be edited, and when they reach the point of rational thought we have already violated 
the prohibition against using them for our own personal goals without their permission and 
consent.",2
"case study : analyzing consequentialist theory 
 not only through the theory of deontology, but also through the consequentialist theory, 
the gene editing of this embryo would not be ethically justifiable.",2
"in this theory, we are trying to 
act in a way where the outcome produces the greatest good for the greatest number.",2
"in the 
scenario described above, the physician would be editing a gene that is in the embryo’s germline, 
which means that the edited would be passed on to future generations.",2
"since the crispr-cas 
technology is not at the current state of a % success rate, or even a very high success rate, he 
could be causing more harm to the masses than good, which would violate this aspect of 
consequentialism.",2
"through a cost-benefit analysis (as this theory is similar to economic 
theories), the risk of harm resulting from performing this procedure in this scenario greatly 
outweighs the benefits, as the unpredicted consequences could end up to be more fatal than 
alzheimer’s.",2
"unlike the theory of deontology, however, the consequentialist theory allows for sacrifice 
of the individual to save the many (i.e.",2
one is able to use others to accomplish personal goals).,2
"following this principle, it would be okay to try to edit the germline of this embryo in order to 
observe the outcome.",2
"even if the outcome were detrimental rather than successful, it would still 
provide new research and new observations on what may happen when altering a human embryo, 
and therefore could help the masses in the future.",2
"however, this still would violate the other 
concepts of consequentialist theory.",2
"going along with the same concept of providing the greatest good for the greatest 
number, it could also be argued the opposite way, that it would not be providing good for the 
greatest number.",2
"using crispr-cas, with its known complications, could easily cause more 
harm than good, as stated above, especially in the discussion of editing the germline and not just 
somatic cells.",2
"in this sense, using the technology and harming the human embryo would not 
provide the greatest good to the greatest number as it would not only harm the human embryo 
but also emotionally harm the parents and others involved in the procedure, as well as harm all of 
the future offspring of the embryo.",2
"case study : analyzing non-maleficence 
 the physician, in this case, is also clearly violating the medical ethics principle of non-
maleficence.",2
"this principle requires that we do not intentionally harm any patient, whether it be 
from performing an act or not performing one at all.",2

knowledge that using the crispr-cas system will not introduce harmful consequences, but we 
do know that it will introduce consequences as mosaicism and unintended base changes.",2

editing out the mutant alzheimer’s gene in this embryo would violate the medical ethics 
principle of beneficence.",2
"beneficence states that physicians have the duty to take steps towards 
removing harm from any patient and to always be of benefit to the patient.",2
"on the contrary, in 
knowing all of the possible consequences, the physician would really be harming the patient.",2
"the 
principle of beneficence includes preventing harm and doing good along with removing harm.",2
"in 
this scenario, the physician would not be preventing harm as he, again, does not know what the 
possible consequences are.",2
"although not removing the mutant gene would allow the human 
embryo to grow into someone who develops alzheimer’s disease, the unexpected consequences 
of the crispr-cas system may cause other, more harmful consequences, and therefore 
performing the procedure would not be preventing harm but rather causing harm.",2
"lastly, 
although it may seem as if the physician is doing good in this scenario by preventing or 
alleviating alzheimer’s disease in the viable human embryo, once again the unintended 
consequences like unexpected base changes and mosaicism may end up being worse or more

develop alzheimer’s disease or not, and he knows that there are possible, unpredicted 
detrimental outcomes if he chooses to go ahead with the procedure.",2

may not be in the position to decide whether to do right or wrong because he is not god.",2

of the visible human embryo in question is the fact that the crispr-cas system is not in a 
scientifically current acceptable state for use on humans, and still has many problems to 
overcome.",2

point of an extremely low off-target effect rate, to eliminate risk or determinate genes of 
alzheimer’s disease?",2

 we project ourselves into a future in which multiple studies and trials with the crispr-
cas system have been performed, and the off-target effects like mosaicism, unpredicted base 
changes, etc.",2
"(the problems explained in the previous chapter) have been reduced to a % 
occurrence rate.",2
"the crispr-cas system has recently been implemented in a small number of 
premier hospitals and research centers around the world, with only few in america (in large 
metropolitan cities as houston, new york city, and boston), in order to edit mutant and possibly 
fatal genes in genetically screened human embryos.",2
"at this point in time, the crispr-cas 
system is only being used in a clinical setting to edit mutant genes that are the sources of genetic 
diseases that are eventually fatal or cause an extremely painful and poor quality of life.",2
"the price 
  
to screen your fertilized embryo for the diseases that are being edited by crispr-cas, attend a 
diagnostic appointment with a physician and scientist who will perform the procedure, and have 
the procedure done with follow up appointments is extremely expensive (although the price to 
perform the procedure with crispr-cas is actually very low), and only very little if any of 
these costs are covered by private insurance (none of the process covered by medicare of 
medicaid, or any government subsidized public insurance).",2

school aged daughter who learned the basics of genes and dna in her science class and asked 
her parents if she could be genetically screened, as one of her classmates had been and shared 
about it in her class.",2

back, both the mother and the daughter realized that they were positive for the mutated apoe- 
gene that is the major precursor for the formation of β-amyloid plaques, and therefore a large 
precursor for alzheimer’s disease.",2
"although the daughter did not know what that meant, the 
mother, who had to undergo in-vitro fertilization to have her daughter, was very worried about 
her daughter and her next child (as she and her husband were planning to have at least one other 
child).",2
"once the couple, who had a very good private insurance plan, was ready to have their 
next child, again via in-vitro fertilization, they decided to screen the fertilized embryo for the 
mutated apoe- gene.",2

hospital to them, which was a two-hour flight away.",2
"the physician and scientist jointly decided 
that the couple was a good candidate to undergo crispr-cas editing to edit the mutated 
apoe- gene out of their embryo.",2
"although insurance did not cover the procedure, the couple 
had enough money to go forward with the process.",2
"my conclusion, as shown in 
the arguments below, is that even with an almost-perfected crispr-cas technology (almost-
perfected as there are always risks of any clinical procedure), in considering the principle of 
justice in the distribution of scarce resources, it is still not ethically justifiable for the couple to 
edit out the mutated apoe- gene from their growing embryo until the technology is much more 
accessible around the world.",2
"case study : analyzing justice 
 performing the clinical procedure of editing out the mutant genes with the crispr-cas 
system violates the principle of justice.",2
"this principle requires the fair distribution of goods in 
the healthcare system, and that equal people should be able to receive equal treatment.",2
"according to the principle of distributive justice, the criteria for the just allocation of scarce 
medical resources includes the following: “to each, an equal share; to each, according to need; to 
                                                     
 mccormick, t. r. ().",2
"for any kind of medical procedure of the like, only the very few 
who can afford the travel and the cost of the medical portion itself are able to go through with 
this process.",2
"the accessibility is also very limited, as it is, in this scenario, only performed at 
very few hospitals around the world.",2
"is this fair to those with the same problem, but not the same 
financial stability?",2
"“what if these improvements were only available to the richest societies, or 
the richest people?” there must be some fairness in the distribution of technology and scarce 
resources like the crispr-cas gene editing system.",2
"from a financial aspect, the fairness of medical treatment is a large issue in our current 
society and in this specific scenario.",2
"it can be argued that it would not be ethically justifiable to 
perform this procedure on this specific family because this family is only one of the extreme few 
who could follow through with it, and then the only embryos that would have the disease edited 
out would be those of wealthy upper-class families.",2
"since this clinical procedure is not covered 
by insurance, it would be extremely expensive.",2
"therefore, a new gap between rich and poor 
would be created.",2
"in this case, alzheimer’s disease would eventually shift to only be present in 
those families who were not as financially stable, as the general cost of the treatment is

"in order to remedy this issue with distributive justice, a much more

"whether the treatment is covered only partly 
or fully, it would need to be covered by both private and public insurance policies.",2
"if not covered 
by insurance, the price would need to be reduced or an association be created that would finance 
the procedure for those who do not have the funds to pay for it at the more expensive price.",2
"without fixing the financial instability and cost, there would be no distributive justice in a 
financial aspect, and the gap created would render the technology ethically un-justifiable.",2
"another reason the procedure is only accessible in few hospitals and few countries is due 
to the views of genetic engineering.",2
"for example, in a study conducted in the united kingdom, 
“the public’s ethical concerns [regarding genetic engineering] are associated with applications 
involving the use of animals or of human genetic material,” and a large portion of those concerns 
are based on the “’unnaturalness’” of altering animal and human genetic material.",2
"in “western 
europe,  of  nations prohibit the modification of the germ line.",2
"although the united states 
has not officially prohibited germline modification, the us national institutes of health’s 
recombinant dna advisory committee explicitly states that it ‘will not at present entertain 
proposals for germ line alterations.’” although using the crispr-cas technology in some of 
these areas may not be banned or illegal, in countries that have an extreme negative attitude 
towards using the technology on human genetic material, the procedure may not be accessible.",2
"public concerns in the united kingdom about 
general and specific applications of genetic engineering: risk, benefit, and ethics.",2
"science, 
technology, & human values, (), –.",2
"right.” if it is not available in certain countries or areas like this, people may have to travel 
further and therefore spend much more money solely on travel and lodging expenses, which 
would polarize the distribution of the crispr-cas resources even more (to where it is available 
to a much smaller, wealthier group of people only).",2
"this would further violate the medical ethics 
principle of justice.",2
"from a healthcare perspective, the distribution of this resource would also be extremely 
unfair and unequal.",2
"this procedure would have to be in effect with little risk for a long period of 
time before it would be largely or fully covered by private healthcare companies, and even much 
longer for public or government subsidized healthcare policies.",2
"therefore, even if it were 
partially covered by healthcare, only those with very good, private healthcare plans would be 
able to afford the procedure.",2
"therefore, only the wealthy who are able to pay for the more 
expensive and higher-coverage healthcare plans would be truly able to pay, so the only people 
able that would have the procedure covered by their healthcare plan would be those who could 
probably afford to pay for it out-of-pocket in the first place.",2
"it would only further the two-class 
system of healthcare.",2
"the coverage of this procedure by all healthcare plans is very, very far into 
the future (if it would even happen at all), especially with how new the technology is, even after 
more years of research to when the technology makes very little to no off-target, unpredicted 
changes.",2
there would be no distributive justice under these circumstances.,2

thought to make decisions (especially those of right or wrong).",2

yet have moral standing and cannot make rational thoughts.",2

consequentialist theory can be used to argue both for and against the ethical justifiability 
of use of crisper-cas.",2
"from one standpoint of a consequentialist theorist, using the crispr-
cas technology to edit out the mutant apoe- gene in this scenario (where the technology is 
scientifically sound and extremely accurate), is not ethically justifiable.",2

the opposite of what consequentialist theory calls to do.",2

certain physical aspects would lead to less diversity and variety around the world, which would 
not be providing the greatest good for the greatest number.",2

any gene editing technology must be questioned.",2

one embryo would produce greater good than harm for the greatest number of people, as the 
parents are happy and the viable embryo will have a less extreme case of alzheimer’s disease or 
not develop alzheimer’s disease at all (and will also affect later generations).",2
"also, through the 
argument of possibly making enhanced humans, whether it be with greater intelligence or a

public, would address how far we should be allowed to take this technology and what exactly we 
should use the technology for.",2

profound questions is just the appreciation that if germ-line editing is conducted in humans, that 
is changing human evolution.’” although most physical traits like hair color, skin color, eye 
color, etc.",2

genes could very likely lead to the embryo being born with the desired trait or a trait much more

genetic to epigenetic, behavioral, and ecological—and, therefore,

"the current framework of diversification and adaptation
tenets of the current, widely-held conceptual framework used to 
characterize diversification and adaptation are defined by muller 
():
in a condensed form, these tenets are as follows: (i) all 
evolutionary explanation requires the study of populations 
of organisms; (ii) populations contain genetic variation 
that arises randomly from mutation and recombination; 
(iii) populations evolve by changes in gene frequency 
brought about by natural selection, gene flow and drift; 
(iv) genetic variants generate slight phenotypic effects 
and the resulting phenotypic variation is gradual and 
continuous; (v) genetic inheritance alone accounts for 
the transmission of selectable variation; (vi) new species 
arise by a prevention of gene flow between populations 
that evolve differently; (vii) the phenotypic differences 
that distinguish higher taxa result from the incremental 
accumulation of genetic variation; (viii) natural selection 
represents the only directional factor in evolution (p. ).",2
"muller’s equivalence of diversification and adaptation with 
evolution is questioned by those in creationist and intelligent design 
circles.",2
"the principle 
incongruities which prompted the  royal society meeting 
are recently identified mechanisms regularly characterized with 
non-random descriptors such as: biased and directional, rapid, 
predictable, and repeatable (table  lists multiple examples).",2
"these findings are contrary to the classic framework of gradual 
diversification and adaptation resulting from random variation 
fractioned out through diverse death-driven scenarios where 
survival and reproduction are highly dependent on “luck” (snyder 
and ellner ).",2
"accordingly, there is a growing insistence on 
modification of this framework (laland et al.",2
"some believe the current framework is so out-of-date that it 
still fails to incorporate knowledge of developmental regulatory 
mechanisms into both theoretical population genetics and genetic 
accommodation theory (laland et al.",2
"while 
true, criticizing the current framework as merely “out-of-date” may 
be misidentifying the problem.",2
"this paper explores the possibility 
that the primary cause of the clash between recent discoveries and 
the current framework is that the basic tenets of the framework—
and their underlying naturalistic, design-exclusive assumptions—
are fundamentally incompatible with recent discoveries.",2
"adaptive 
mechanisms characterized as regulated, rapid, repeatable, and 
predictable are anomalous precisely because those words seem to 
describe the purposeful outcomes of engineered systems.",2
"in areas 
of applied biological research, a growing trend is to incorporate 
engineering principles to frame biological phenomena.",2
"we believe 
that there are good reasons to incorporate this approach into a 
replacement framework for diversification and adaptation as well.
. a growing tendency to explain biological functions with 
engineering principles
life itself seems to have attributes which are currently beyond 
the reach of scientific methods to discover, but making sense 
of biomolecular, physiological, or anatomical functions is not 
mysterious.",2
"could it prove useful to apply engineering principles 
to explain how a biological function like adaptation works?",2
"there 
is good justification to begin doing so.",2
"despite their vastly different 
substrates, living organisms are subject to the same fundamental 
constraints that govern all regulatory mechanisms, and they 
function within the same laws of nature as man-made designs 
(khammash ).",2

insight into aircraft design, for example.",2

advocate the mimicry of systems found in living things and use 
them for inspiration in design (socha ).",2
"biological researchers 
already “reverse engineer” biological systems by methodically 
disassembling their components piece by piece to discover their 
operation.",2
"further, the ever-increasing awareness that biological 
functions bear striking resemblance to man-made systems using 
sophisticated engineering has not been ignored.",2
"in , an 
international conference dedicated to engineering biology was

"conference organizers maintained that engineering-
inspired fields such as integrative systems biology, biomedical 
engineering, and synthetic biology appear to have more in common 
with engineering approaches than with traditional biological ones.",2
"thus, even evolutionary biologists, though rooted in design-
exclusive assumptions, will face the inevitable rising tide of 
scientific literature from other disciplines that are using engineering 
principles to better explain biological functions.
. biblical rationale for explaining biological functions using 
engineering principles
it would seem natural for researchers who claim to embrace the 
explanation that living things look designed because they are 
designed, to get out in front of this trend for using engineering 
principles to explain biological functions.",2
"for those who believe 
that the bible provides insight into biological function, there 
is justification for approaching research from an engineering 
perspective.",2
"psalms :- and romans :- are key passages 
stating that some attributes of god are revealed in nature.",2
"both 
texts emphasize that living things manifest “workmanship.” nature 
displays features unique to designing agency that humans would 
ascribe to the workmanship of artists or engineers.",2
"for instance, 
living things are full of systems with multiple parts working 
together for a purpose, which are otherwise only found in human-
engineered devices.",2
"it is this clearly-seen tight correlation between 
the function of living things and human-engineered contrivances 
that strongly indicates that living things were, in fact, designed 
by an intellect—with engineering prowess far surpassing the 
best human engineers.",2
"analysis of romans :- prompts a 
profound question related to biological research: is there a biblical 
(or scientific) reason to believe that any biological function will 
be discovered that will operate by different engineering principles 
than those by which human-engineered apparatuses are already 
operating or could be operating?",2
"therefore, researchers open to 
intelligent causation for living creatures should expect to find an 
ever-increasing resemblance of biological function to sophisticated 
engineering.",2
"since creatures were commanded to “fill the earth” (genesis :, 
; :; :, ) which was a highly dynamic place after creation 
and the flood, design-guided biological researchers should begin to 
identify the basic engineering principles governing the operation of 
systems which appear to self-adjust to dynamic external conditions 
(i.e., the how of biological adaptation).",2
"incorporating several 
broad observations and re-interpreting them in this light will form 
a new description of what organisms achieve when they adapt (i.e., 
the design objective for what they are doing).",2
"further, there is a 
growing body of evidence that appears to indicate that recently-
discovered regulated mechanisms enable organisms to actively 
and continuously track environmental changes.",2
"for instance, 
organisms appear to quickly respond to significant environmental 
changes—often making surprisingly rapid adaptations—and then 
more gradually adapt to conditions during periods with relatively 
little environmental change (reigner ).",2
"we posit that organisms are continuously tracking 
environmental changes and responding with suitably self-adjusted 
traits to maintain homeostasis—within their lifetime and cross 
generationally—resulting in adaptation.",2
"how might they achieve 
this objective within realistic constraints?",2
"a. hypothesis
we observe sophisticated human engineering demonstrated in 
automated, autonomous robotic drones equipped with exquisite 
detectors, logic-centered algorithms, and locomotive performance 
to reliably track a target.",2
"if the application of engineering design 
objectives, constraints, and variables for human-created tracking 
systems can be applied to biological systems, then this readily 
offers a testable hypothesis:
organisms actively and continuously track environmental variables 
and respond by self-adjusting to changing environments—utilizing 
the engineering principles that constrain how human-designed 
things adapt to changing conditions—resulting in adaptation.",2
"this assumes that fluctuating environmental conditions are 
comparable to the variability of moving targets followed by tracking 
systems.",2

understanding diversification and adaptation.",2
"scientific activities 
including interpretations of findings take place within a structure 
of ideas and assumptions defining a field of study.",2
"the framework 
we offer promotes comparing data and observations (findings) 
of reported biological functions to those of human-engineered 
entities to search for: corresponding systems and their elements, 
mechanisms, engineering principles fundamental to operation, and 
assembly processes to assist in research.",2
"our framework widens 
the bi-directional conduit between engineering and biology by 
aiding bioengineers in their job of biomimicry and aids biologists 
to predict where to search for elusive system elements or steps, 
guided by the assumption of functional purpose(s).",2
"reinterpreting 
the findings of biological studies by an “engineering approach” 
or “design analysis” means that they are evaluated with this 
comparison of biological functions to those of human-engineered 
entities in mind.",2
"b. expected features of cet biological mechanisms
what are the elements of biological systems that should correspond 
to man-made tracking systems?",2
"tracking systems are generally 
part of larger, robust, adaptive control systems.",2
"these follow 
the movement of a select “target” within a specified “field of 
view” and elicit response per a predetermined algorithm.",2
"these 
“surveillance systems” use one or more sensors, coupled to a 
computer system, that gather and interpret incoming data about 
uncertain environments.",2
"there are three irreducible elements common to all tracking 
systems: ) sensors to detect pre-specified conditions; ) condition-
consequence logic mechanisms that process information by 
specifying if (+) condition then (+) consequential output response, 
and ) output responses which adjust activities to effectively pursue 
a target (blackman and popoli ; ioannou and sun.",2
"(if 
navigation or interception at a precise location is desired, then a 
chronometer or circadian device to measures time is also an essential 
element.)",2
"if the cet hypothesis is correct, we would expect to find 
biological mechanisms with corresponding irreducible elements 
that are recognizable by the following characteristics:
() sensors.",2
"the element linking the system to its environment is 
the sensor.",2
"understanding three key characteristics of how sensors integrate 
into systems helps illuminate important details of the relationship 
between an entity and exposures.",2
"first, sensors are exquisitely 
designed to be selective by specifying the environmental conditions 
to which they will be sensitive and insensitive.",2
"sensors should 
minimally disturb the condition being monitored so its “true value” 
remains.",2
"second, a sensor must be ready to collect data by means 
of detecting a condition, often by “active surveillance.” third, 
sensors are an integral part of the system.",2
"this relationship may be 
difficult to see since sensors are often remotely located.",2
"sophisticated internal logic mechanisms 
are currently being designed as more than basic if-then types of on-
off switches (or gates.)",2
"engineers are patterning logic mechanisms 
in tracking systems after the nervous system in living organisms 
so that they function as artificial neural networks.",2
"ioannou () 
believes his approach to adaptive control systems “…will be of 
great interest to the neural and fuzzy logic audience who will 
benefit from the strong similarity that exists between adaptive 
systems, whose stability properties are well established, and neural 
networks, fuzzy logic systems where stability and convergence 
issues are yet to be resolved” (p. xiv).",2
"the logical programming 
may be extraordinarily complex and mathematically rigorous to 
process the array of incoming variables, especially when multiple 
sensors are tracking multiple moving targets (oh et al.",2
"advanced logical programming integrates data from multiple 
sensors with pre-programmed ranges to further reduce target-
tracking uncertainties by filtering out useless data or “noise” and to 
make determinations on the validity of data prior to specifying an 
output response (luo et al.",2
"the final step in tracking is to respond to 
target movements.",2
"though the response is usually a necessary 
consequence when specific conditions are encountered, responses 
can range from a simple discreet on-off action, to a continuous 
range produced by an algorithm utilizing input variables.",2
"this 
is illustrated in the multiple uses for tracking eye movements 
which range from medical diagnostics, refractive surgery, human-
computer interfaces, and commercial marketing (gneo et al.",2
"responses may be integral to a tracking system itself, such as a 
mechanism using stepping motors to keep a solar panel tracking 
the sun’s movement.",2
"implications of this hypothesis help clarify biological adaptability
a fundamental design constraint is that the capacities for a designed 
entity to both relate to—and adapt to—external conditions must be 
built entirely into an entity.",2
"in terms of external conditions, these are 
insufficient to cause changes to an internal system’s function.",2
"an 
engineer would identify conditions pertinent to performance and 
may specify some (amongst a myriad of conditions) as variables 
that are either present or not.",2
"the implication of the utilization 
of engineering principles and causation is reflected in the second 
half of our engineering-based, organism-focused characterization 
which keeps the operational spotlight on the organism rather than 
the environment.",2
"an engineering approach focuses on whole systems and not 
individual elements.",2
"since the entire system ceases to function 
with the loss of any vital element, then, no single element is 
declared to be causal.",2
"only verifiable elements are included—and 
no vital element is omitted—in causal chains.",2

descriptive approach, causal chains in organism will: ) generally

 examples that are a select subset most representative of different 
types and mechanisms for adaptation.",2

of the paper) lists  different highly regulated, non-random

environments.",2

the major source materials, but not all those reviewed.",2

questions about adaptive mechanisms: do published results identify 
a predominant mechanism for adaptation utilized by organisms?",2
"is modification of genetic sequence the principle mechanism to 
express phenotypic changes?",2
"could variations be categorized, 
irrespective of genetic or epigenetic causality, in discernable 
patterns that would give clues that organisms were tracking 
environmental changes?",2

mechanisms, and an output.",2

results as evidence for the cet framework is withheld until the 
discussion section.",2
"by way of overview, results can be grouped into systems-based 
adaptive mechanisms and phenotypic responses.",2
"non-random 
phenotypic output responses could be traced to both genetic and 
epigenetic mechanisms.",2
"responses encompass modifications 
to physiological systems involved in maintaining cellular and 
organismal homeostasis.",2

color variation to the total non-development of organs, major 
morphotypic reformations, and alterations in behavior.",2
"some 
responses happened in a single organism within minutes, while 
others were found to affect entire populations and persist for several 
generations.",2
"other novel responses did not result directly from 
either genetic or epigenetic changes but were the consequence of 
internal processes initiated upon detection of changed conditions.",2
"of particular note was the identification of certain mechanisms and 
phenotypic responses which are both predictable and reversible.",2

in color of an artic fox’s fur from grey-brown to white in the fall is 
an example of seasonal polyphenism.",2
"the significance of phenotypic plasticity to diversification and 
adaptation is described by west and packer () who say that 
the “environmental effects on trait morphology can be substantial, 
outweighing both genetic effects and reproductive advantages” (p. 
).",2
"a few illustrations highlight the importance of external-
condition detectors to initiate developmental, physiological, 
phenotypic, or behavioral changes, and the extent to which these 
changes could lead to speciation and diversification.",2
"observable phenotypic differences that distinguish species, 
and certainly genera, are assumed to be the result of genetic 
polymorphisms.",2
but this assumption may not be accurate.,2
"() report experiments which indicate that some genera-level 
morphotypes of a fig-associated nematode pristionchus are the result 
of polyphenism and not genetic polymorphism.",2
"upon colonizing 
the island-like microecosystem of individual figs, symbiotic 
nematodes of the genus pristionchus expressed a polyphenism with 
up to five discrete adult morphotypes per species.",2
"the principle 
target condition in this study was found to be both fig type and fig 
maturation.",2
"since juvenile development cannot be cultured outside 
of figs, any environmental cues detected during development 
associated with differing morphs cannot be identified.",2

major morphotypes identified were associated with fig type, fig 
phase (early and late interfloral), and transit on, versus through, 
their specific wasp vector (ceratosolen spp.).",2
"genetic sequencing

had led to discontinuous novelties whose variation exceeded level 
of genera in the same family.",2

of “macroevolutionary-scale” diversification, with some structures 
having no analogs in other nematodes, without genetic divergence.",2

developmental phenotypic adjustment when exposed only to 
aquarium tank water that had harbored dragonfly larvae of the 
tadpole predators aeshna or anax.",2

() document that tadpoles have exquisite capability to, “detect 
waterborne chemical” substances “produced by predators” (p. ).",2
"post-exposure, tadpoles developed a thick, muscular, bright red tail 
which increased their probability to escape future predation better 
than tadpoles isolated from predator exposure during development.",2
"relyea () followed up on the tadpole-predator study to 
determine whether a plastic trait expressed in one generation could 
be passed on to offspring which themselves experienced variable 
levels of the exposure during their development.",2
"he concluded that 
“predator-induced traits can frequently be heritable, although the 
magnitude of heritability can be wide ranging across environments.",2
"moreover, the plasticity of these defenses also can be heritable” 
(p.).",2
"multiple studies identify an exquisite detection-response linkage 
in some organisms.",2
"they detect the presence of predators, respond 
with phenotypic adjustments either during development or as 
adult forms, and then pass a tendency for the adjusted form on 
to offspring.",2
"stabell and lwin () conducted experiments to 
determine elements of an underlying mechanism that might explain 
why the body depth and muscle mass of crucian carp, carassius 
carassius, increases in the presence of the predator northern pike, 
esox lucius.",2

with growth changes after exposure to either the pike itself, nor 
to pike-fed arctic char, salvelinus alpinus.",2

feeding on other crucian carp, or when exposed to water containing 
skin tissue (prepared and homogenized) of conspecifics.",2

are a stimulus for induction of the phenotypical changes.",2

plasticity and conclude that “generally, phenotypic plasticity can 
play a largely underappreciated role in driving diversification and

and biological processes, or industrialization.",2

target condition was ambient heat.",2

assumption that guinea pigs have a neurological mechanism to 
detect temperature changes (without identifying a specific sensor.)",2
"prior to the next mating, males were 
kept in cages placed on a heating plate which kept the floor at  °c 
for one cycle of spermatogenesis ( days).",2
"f and f generations 
were obtained after mating with the same females.",2
"comparison 
of epigenetic methylation of specific genomic regions in liver 
and testis between pre-and-post heat treatment found epigenetic 
changes in both paternal guinea pigs and f offspring on  of  
temperature-regulating genes, and  additional genes involved in 
temperature regulation had their promoters epigenetically altered.",2

() conditioned male lab mice (mus muluscus) to fear a 
target condition: acetophenone (cherry blossom) odor.",2

olfactory bulb developmentally controlled by the m gene related 
to acetophenone.",2

an increased number of odor-specific cells, increased size of odor-
specific glomerulus in their nose, and % increase in response 
to acetophenone compared to controls.",2

mediated by epigenetic methylation of an unaltered m sequence.",2
"offspring conceived by artificial insemination from sperm of 
acetophenone-fearing fathers had similar changes.",2
"the molecular basis of the adaptive changes in darwin’s finches 
on the galapagos islands is assumed to be genetic variation 
fractioned out through differential survival.",2
"() note that “growing evidence suggests that epigenetic 
mechanisms, such as dna methylation, may also be involved 
in rapid adaptation to new environments” (p.).",2
"copy 
number variations between populations of either species were 
mostly unchanged.",2
"phenotypic differences were associated with the 
dramatic dna methylation variances discovered between urban 
and rural populations.",2
"they speculate that a change toward human-
associated foodstuffs is the target environmental condition.",2
"urban 
finches face far greater exposure.",2

c. distributive response
drosophilids have innate and species-specific humidity 
p",2
"scientists use this mechanism to cut-and-paste additions to the genome, and 
even to make pinpoint changes to specific dna bases, in order to make or correct mutations (sander & 
joung, ).",2
"however, genetic alteration techniques in general are still in the beginning stages, and there 
is much speculation regarding the crispr procedure and its future uses.",2
"the human application of this 
technology introduces complex morality issues – most of all when modifications on the germline and 
enhancement procedures are considered.",2
"while the scientific community provides influential opinions that impact the crispr gene 
editing applications, public opinion has also rapidly become one of the influential driving forces behind 
the limitations and advancements regarding genetic modification and its uses.",2
"specifically, there are 
opinions that question whether it is our place to change life for what we believe is the better, and that has 
ultimately become a debate on the legality of the technology applications.",2
"because public opinion can 
have such a deep impact on the advancements of biotechnology, we examined public opinion polls, news 
articles, and social media posts in order to provide a more profound analysis of what the american public 
believes regarding this method of gene therapy and its applications.",2
"furthermore, special consideration was taken to discover how these opinions change across a 
variety of demographics, since previous research and literature suggests a wide spectrum of opinions.",2
"this spectrum is bounded by two extremes: one side favors continuous research and argues that the value 
and the possibilities of crispr outweigh the risks of its misuse, while the other side argues that it would 
be irresponsible to use the technology, with all the risks and unknowns currently present, therefore 
arguing that the risks are greater than the benefits.",2
"methods 
in order to collect representative data of opinion trends across the entire united states that would 
provide answers to the research questions, we used the following methods: identified and analyzed 
opinion polls on genetic engineering and crispr, used discourse analysis to evaluate online media 
reports on crispr, and mined twitter for social media activity related to crispr.",2
"in order to gauge the potentially wide range of opinions about crispr in the united states, we 
analyzed polls by looking at current snapshots of public opinion within demographics, differently worded 
polls, and how they may have changed over time.",2
"since crispr is a newer technology, there are limited 
polls and data that specifically focus on crispr alone.",2
"from the twenty-one polls analyzed, only two 
explicitly used the term “crispr”.",2
"for this reason, the terms “gene therapy” and “genetic engineering” 
were chosen for additional analysis because, while they are broader topics that encompass the same ideas 
and technologies as the crispr method, they have more data and are more publicly recognized through 
published polls.",2
"different demographics were analyzed within the public opinion polls to get a better 
sense of each of their corresponding opinions.",2
"a study of popular opinion – with a focus on whether the 
iv 
 
majority supports or rejects the crispr technologies – helped to explain if there are particular 
p",2
"the suitable values for the hyperparameters are determined before training; 
hence, it requires proficiency in machine learning, whereas the learned‐parameters are derived by 
the machine learning algorithms from the training data sets.",3
"when interdisciplinary applications 
are merged in big data analytics framework, a big question comes to everyone's mind is that, 
with the huge spectrum of users of big data, how the big data analytics framework will serve 
them better by grouping them into individuals with different levels of proficiency, ranging from 
nonexpert users to data analysts to data scientists, for both big data analytics research and 
applications.",3
"the aforementioned parametrization approaches in machine learning models, 
adopted by big data analytics, create problems and challenges to several disciplines when, in 
general, the expertise in machine learning is lacking.",3
"similarly, the adaptive selection of machine 
learning algorithms for different applications is also a challenge to nonexpert users of big data 
analytics and machine learning.",3
"therefore, the expectations of the individuals from different 
disciplines are the availability of a flexible big data analytics framework that is more intelligent 
and can minimize the need for user expertise for tuning model parameters and selecting suitable 
machine learning models and algorithms for their applications.",3
"the bayesian optimization is not fully 
understood in a big data analytics settings; hence, it is still questionable whether the automl 
approach will provide desired results with big data analytics framework under interdisciplinary 
settings.",3
"what is required now is a newly defined research domain that allows exploration of big 
data analytics with the advancement of automl toward developing smart machine learning that 
is fully automated, adaptive, and cognitive in nature.",3
"this new research domain can make big 
data analytics more interdisciplinary by changing big data analytics framework much smarter 
through the adoption of fullautoml techniques.",3
"the purpose of this review article is to report the recent progress in big data analytics, machine 
learning, and bayesian learning, and the way these three areas work together as companions 
toward meeting the expectation of interdisciplinary research and applications.",3
"in particular, this 
article reviews and reports the research progress in big data analytics and in the efforts made to 
make machine learning much smarter so that the interdisciplinary research can benefit from big 
data analytics techniques and technologies.",3
"big data analytics 
 
the current progress in big data analytics can be appreciated by observing its widespread 
applications in many scientific and nonscientific disciplines.",3
"the recent major conference in the 
discipline—the  i.e.",3
"international conference on big data, held in boston, ma, usa, on 
december –, —incorporated several topics that highlight the trend of big data analytics 
and the interests of research community in the field.",3
"using the compiled conference program and 
the proceedings published in this research forum, we can divide the current progress in big data 
analytics into the following focused‐driven research domains: 
 
• descriptive big data analytics: it addresses the theoretical and design aspects of modeling 
and algorithms of big data analytics and associated big data characteristics; 
• predictive big data analytics: it focuses on the topics of machine learning that helps the 
study of predictive and classification models and algorithms for big data analytics; 
• visual big data analytics: it defines the preprocessing and visualization techniques that 
help us understand the big data characteristics through exploration analysis; 
• streaming big data analytics: it describes the theory and methods required to study 
spatiotemporal characteristics of big data and machine learning models and algorithm; 
• graphical big data analytics: it helps to study big data environment using graphical 
models and network analysis under machine learning and big data analytics paradigm; 
• big data systems and software: it addresses the designing and building of big data 
systems and software that focus on efficient resource utilization and big data processing.",3
"hence, it cannot be separated from big 
data analytics.",3
"the research 
in systems and software also focuses on the optimization of the performance of a computing 
environment; hence, the parametrization and parallelization of the computing processes and 
resources are explored (dean & ghemawat, ; white, ).",3
"the systems and software are 
essentials to house the big data analytics framework; hence, their progress is first discussed, and 
then the research progress in machine learning and bayesian optimization, focusing on big data 
analytics, is discussed.",3
"systems and software 
 
the current big data systems and software have been developed as a parametric platform using a 
divide‐and‐conquer algorithm so that the distributed resources (e.g., cores, memory, executors, 
and software modules) can be parallelized to achieve optimal performance for big data analytics.",3
"it also focuses on providing both local and global (i.e., cloud) computing resources as an 
affordable mechanism for different levels of users and applications—an essential feature that is 
required for an interdisciplinary setting.",3
"figure  illustrates these two types of big data analytics 
framework (local systems and software, and cloud computing resources) that are observable 
clearly in the current progress.",3
"it mainly shows the currently available cloud computing 
resources such as the microsoft azure (azure:  amazon web 
services (aws:  and google cloud platform 
(gcp:  and the way they are utilized with apache hadoop 
( and spark ( systems, and the machine 
learning framework tensorflow ( along with the programming 
languages such as r ( and python (

"a possible set of systems and software for big data analytics framework 
 
.",3
"parametrization 
 
presently, the big data systems and software adopt the concept called (key, value)‐pair to 
parametrize big data computing environments.",3
"these big data processing computing platforms were initially 
developed to perform big data analytics in local computing environment; however, as the 
research in big data analytics progresses, a lack of resources has been realized and the ideas were 
extended to cloud architecture for addressing scalability issues with other big data 
characteristics.",3
"a simple example of systems and 
software parametrization and parallelization can be found in chapter  of book by the author 
(suthaharan, ).",3
"in the current big data system, this parallelization is not transparent and it 
performs optimal resource allocation and utilization automatically.",3
"however, in some situations, 
it is important for the users to set the system parameters such as the number of cores, executors 
and memory size.",3
"machine learning 
 
the initial progress in machine learning has defined the standard methodological processes that 
include the development of parametric models and development of algorithms that help optimize 
the model parameters using training, validation, and testing processes, and given (labeled) data.",3
"these methodological processes may be grouped into two categories: interpretable knowledge 
discovery (suthaharan, ) and actionable knowledge discovery (cao, ).",3
"additionally, the 
machine learning models are defined using two types of parameters, namely, hyperparameters 
and learned‐parameters.",3
"the hyperparameter values must be selected at the beginning of the 
training process—requires some expertise in the research domain—and the learned‐parameters 
are optimized by machine learning algorithms. 
 
. parametrization 
 
to date, the machine learning models are parametrized in three groups: mathematical, 
hierarchical, and layered models.",3
"the mathematical models include the models developed using 
the concept of support vectors and statistical regression—examples are support vector machine, 
logistic regression, and lasso regression.",3
"the hierarchical models include the models developed 
based on the concept of decision tree—examples are random forest models.",3
"the layered models 
include the models proposed based on the concept of neural networks—examples include deep 
learning models.",3
the first two types of approaches have been proposed to address batch learning.,3
"these approaches are based on the concepts of gradient descent or 
stochastic gradient descent (luketina, berglund, greff, & raiko, ).",3
"smart machine learning 
 
as deep learning technique progresses—of course!",3
"as a promising solution to solve big data 
analytics problems—researchers have been trying to make machine learning techniques more 
intelligent as possible to meet the requirements of interdisciplinary research and applications.",3
"hence, the expected features of machine learning techniques are currently divided into three 
groups: automatic, adaptive, and cognitive features.",3
"as a result, the current trend in big data 
analytics focuses on three types of machine learning—automl, adaptive machine learning, and 
cognitive machine learning.",3
"in essence, bayesian learning, bayesian optimization, and related 
approaches can help us develop smart machine learning. 
 
. bayesian learning 
 
the bayesian learning, which includes bayesian optimization and bayesian mixture models, is 
especially adopted to optimize hyperparameters because of its ability to defend the difficulties 
that come from the big data characteristics using probabilistic approaches.",3
"these approaches replace mathematical optimization with 
probabilistic optimization—a preferable approach for big data settings. 
 
. bayesian mixture model and machine learning 
 
the bayesian mixture models assume data heterogeneity and represent a data domain in action 
as a composition of multiple sub domains (or clusters) with finite or infinite number of mixture 
distributions (tafaj, kasneci, rosenstiel, & bogdan, ).",3
"an example of its implementation in 
software systems for a big data environment is that the master node in a data sharing network can 
distribute these sub domains to worker nodes by associating them with general prior distributions 
and then the worker nodes process them and generate corresponding posterior distributions to 
specify hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms, such as the kernel and regularization 
parameters in support vector machine (svm) (klein et al., ), and weights and learning‐rate 
parameters in deep learning (suthaharan, ). 
 
. automated machine learning 
 
a machine learning technique can be claimed to be truly automatic, only if every step of the 
machine learning technique is automated such that it can minimize the problems of 
interdisciplinary applications.",3
"the research in automl for big data analytics is still in progress 
and it includes the research work reported in (feurer et al., ) and (luo, ).",3
"the current 
approaches mainly focus on the optimization of hyperparameters and the selection of models and 
algorithms to create suitable automl approaches that can be adopted by any types of users of 
interdisciplinary applications.",3
this objective requires efficient learning models and algorithms.,3
"the current research 
progress in this area shows a significant interest and an appropriate use of computational 
techniques based on bayesian (klein et al., ) and radial basis function (ilievski, akhtar, 
feng, & shoemaker, ).",3
"another aspect of an automl is the automatic selection of models and algorithms for 
optimization and learning.",3
"as we know, the hyperparameter selection requires the automatic 
selection of suitable models and algorithms from a large pool of models and algorithms for 
optimization with respect to a given data set.",3
"however, in big data analytics environment, this 
selection process is problematic and very challenging because of the data characteristics that 
include complexity, scalability, and heterogeneity.",3
"today, it can be 
observed that the big data characteristics and the current widespread interdisciplinary 
applications have enforced new constraints and requirements that triggered the exploration of 
novel approaches for adaptive machine learning.",3
"one aspect of adaptive machine learning is the selection and optimization of the learned model 
parameters with respect to changing data characteristics between interdisciplinary domains.",3
"in other words, 
we can say that the progress in adaptive machine learning focuses on learning techniques that are 
adaptive to unseen data.",3
"another aspect of adaptive machine learning is the revision of machine 
learning models and algorithms, with a minimum effort, to work with changing data 
characteristics between interdisciplinary domains.",3
"for example, in a recent paper, the authors 
have proposed a learning‐based approach that generates an adaptive best‐fit algorithm from a set 
of supervised learning algorithms to detect silent errors that occur in a high‐performance 
computing environment (subasi et al., ).",3
"they described the silent errors as silent data 
corruption in high performance computing systems, and these errors corrupt the execution results 
with no warning and undetectable by hardware or software. 
 
. cognitive machine learning 
 
cognitive machine learning is an emerging field and it includes both the adaptive and automl 
concepts.",3
"in big data analytics, the use of exact or complete knowledge for making decisions is 
impractical because of the big data characteristics that include data heterogeneity, 
unpredictability, and scalability.",3
"hence, the machine learning research community has realized 
the need for developing techniques and technologies that mimic the cognitive processes that the 
humans use to solve complex environmental problems and make decisions through 
approximation, hypothesis, and reasoning.",3
"in this computing platform, cognition‐enable 
means the availability of methodologies and techniques that mimic human cognitive process that 
utilize object‐recognition, speech‐recognition, and functional brain networks (machine learning, 
reasoning, and analysis) to make cognitive decisions.",3
"similarly, the cost‐effective feature 
includes computational cost as well as affordable systems and software that support 
interdisciplinary settings.",3
"finally, resource‐efficient feature includes the automated resource 
allocation and resource utilization with no transparency to users—it is especially useful to 
nonexpert users of the learning models (hurwitz, kaufman, & bowles, ). 
 
. smart deep learning 
 
a literature review suggests that machine learning for big data analytics is converging to deep 
learning techniques.",3
"for example, based on the proceedings of the  international conference 
on machine learning held in sydney, australia, on august –, , we can clearly see that 
the research interest of the machine learning community has shifted toward deep learning 
significantly.",3
"the deep learning, compared to other machine learning techniques, focuses on 
single‐data‐point analysis (i.e., it enables both on‐line learning and batch learning), which is a 
highly preferred option for a big data analytics framework.",3
"hence, it is expected in the current 
research of big data analytics that the deep learning will be studied, focusing on automated, 
adaptive, and cognitive approaches to create smart deep learning.",3
"conclusions 
 
the progress of research in big data analytics and machine learning was reviewed and 
understood in three phases: past, present, and future.",3
"in phase , a significant amount of research 
has been done on data analytics and machine learning by defining data‐driven approaches.",3
"in 
other words, the focus of research in phase  was mainly on interpretable knowledge 
discovery theme (i.e., the development of models and algorithms that enhance the discovery of 
interpretable knowledge from a given set of data).",3
"in essence, the data‐driven approaches 
focused on the discovery of patterns that help understand the source that produced the data.",3
"in phase , the focus of data analytics research shifted to big data analytics based on the 
redefinition of data that describe big data characteristics.",3
"hence, the research has started to shift 
toward domain‐driven approaches (which of course included data‐driven approaches).",3
"in other 
words, the focus of the research in phase  was on actionable knowledge discovery theme.",3
"the 
actionable knowledge discovery defines the practical significance of the knowledge discovered 
from data through domain‐driven data mining.",3
"hence, it defines the flow of knowledge from 
data‐driven approaches to domain‐driven interdisciplinary applications.",3
"it is now well understood that big data analytics research spans across multiple disciplines where 
automl models and algorithms are required to solve problems without the help of data science 
experts.",3
"hence, as we have seen, the selection and optimization of hyperparameters became a 
very strong research component among machine learning (or artificial intelligence) and data 
science research community.",3
"a significant research still has to be done on hyperparameter 
selection and optimization using bayesian optimization to develop automl approaches that are 
useful for interdisciplinary big data analytics.",3
"in phase , over the next two decades, a significant research is expected on fullautoml 
approaches, toward achieving smart machine learning techniques that are fully automated, 
adaptive, and cognitive under big data characteristics.",3
"however, to advance this research, it is 
important to study approaches that help discover patterns that are sensitive to changes between 
interdisciplinary domains.",3
"hence, the progress reported in this paper suggests an establishment 
of a new research theme—transformative knowledge discovery.",3
"it means that, when a learning 
model is developed for a big data environment (big data domain or a discipline), it is important 
to discover the knowledge that can cause a noticeable change to the model, in addition to 
discovering the knowledge that is interpretable and actionable.",3
"this knowledge will help the 
model to become adaptive to a new environment.",3
"hence, when a learning model is built for a 
data domain, it is important to study all the potential alternatives, which include both the real and 
hypothetical alternatives.",3
"the discovery of transformative knowledge from big data can significantly benefit from 
bayesian learning, including bayesian optimization and bayesian mixture models.",3
"in other 
words, we need to define a new research discipline called transformative data science and 
analytics, or transformative data science and big data, or transformative big data 
analytics that study bayesian optimization approaches and bayesian mixture models 
extensively.",3

"how machines learn  
ibm employee arthur samuel, is the ability of computers 
(“machines”) to learn without being guided or re-programmed.",3
"samuel’s initial machine learning example was a machine that can 
be programmed to play checkers better than the person who 
designed the program.",3
"remarkably, a computer could be trained to 
do this in eight to ten hours of playing time over sixty years ago 
using machine learning.",3
"all that was necessary to train the 
computer was to provide it with the rules of the game, a general 
sense of direction regarding how the game worked, and a list of 
parameters that were thought to have something to do with the game, 
but whose correct background signs and relative importance were 
unknown and unspecified to the computer.",3
"in relatively short order, 
the machine learned how to play checkers better than its 
programmer, without the programmer having to revise the initial 
computer code or manually train the computer in strategy.",3
"the use cases for modern machine learning are virtually 
boundless.",3
"machine learning is best used in tasks for which 
designing code with explicit task-specific instructions is difficult or 
impossible, such as ranking, optical recognition, complex problem 
solving, and filtering.",3
"machine learning applications typically 
involve feeding (relatively) automated programs a large data set of 
inputs, and solving problems or identifying issues using results-
driven decisions based on the data set.",3
"to be clear, machine learning (in the classic sense) is not 
artificial intelligence.",3
"although machine learning does involve 
learning by experience, a machine learning algorithm does not act 
intelligently, and is not flexible in changing environments.",3
"however, we see the concepts become increasingly conflated, as

"machine learning should 
not be conflated with data mining, either.",3

which usually focuses on uncovering previously unknown 
properties of a dataset, machine learning typically focuses on better-
predicting outcomes or revising an algorithm based on already-
known properties of that dataset.",3
"below we discuss the common types of machine learning and 
the different levels of data use associated with different machine 
learning models.",3
"b.  types of machine learning 
 
machine learning can be split into three major categories: () 
supervised, () reinforcement, and () unsupervised.",3
"we discuss 
each in turn below. 
 
. supervised 
 
with supervised machine learning, one knows the desired output 
of the algorithm based on a dataset, usually referred to as “training 
data,” that is used to optimize a performance criterion.",3
"supervised 
machine learning algorithms are typically “taught” using a training 
dataset.",3

"washington journal of law, technology & arts, vol.",3
"how machines learn  
after analyzing the base data using the training dataset, the 
programmer can make algorithmic tweaks (or changes to the 
training data) to right the course.",3
"in supervised machine learning, all 
of the data within a training data set is “labeled” (or assigned a 
value), which allows the machine to easily compare analysis data 
against the training set baseline.",3
"the algorithm generates 
information based on its analysis of the training data, and uses that 
information to produce inferred or revised functions.",3
"these revised 
functions can be used by the end user to discern new trends 
regarding a dataset, or to refine the algorithmic analysis itself.",3
"analyzing enormous data sets at a speed only computers can 
achieve, the algorithm can identify trends, flag otherwise 
unidentified issues, and give the algorithm operator other desired 
results that can be tweaked using variations in the algorithm or 
training data.   
 
. unsupervised 
 
in unsupervised machine learning, there is no training data, and 
the outcomes are unpredictable.",3
"unsupervised machine learning 
algorithms can solve problems using input datasets alone, with no 
reference or training data, by recognizing patterns in the data and 
grouping together reoccurring or common data characteristics.",3
"unlike supervised algorithms, which rely on labeled data, 
unsupervised machine learning uses functions to uncover previously 
unknown properties of a dataset using unlabeled data.",3
"for example, 
say you had a dataset comprised of apples, oranges, and bananas, 
and want to analyze and identify trends in the fruit.",3
"; see also deep learning for java., supra note .",3
"unsupervised algorithms can identify 
these similarities and group together the apples with the apples, the 
oranges with the oranges, and the bananas with the bananas.",3
"unsupervised machine learning can seem to border on artificial 
intelligence, and companies often use it to analyze large datasets 
of customer transactions, generate common trends or characteristics 
based on the past transactions, group those customers into clusters, 
and use that cluster of information to refine the company’s business 
model.",3
"there is a sub-class of supervised machine learning called 
“semi-supervised” machine learning, in which an algorithm-
operator uses a small amount of labeled training data to inform a 
much larger unlabeled dataset.",3
"semi-supervised machine learning 
is usually thought of as halfway between unsupervised and 
supervised learning.",3
"both supervised and semi-supervised 
machine learning tend to lend themselves to relatively predictable 
outcomes, and are often used by companies to optimize user 
experiences based on predicted or predetermined outcomes.  
 
. reinforcement 
 
reinforcement learning is based on an algorithm that has a 
concept of how an environment should behave, and learns an 
optimal behavior for such an environment by analyzing repetition 
and repeated failures over time.",3
"unlike supervised machine 
learning, reinforcement learning algorithms are not presented with 
input/output pairs for correction—instead, the algorithm is 
performance-driven.",3
"one well-known example of reinforcement

learning is the self-driving car industry.",3
"many self-driving 
algorithms are not artificially intelligent in the traditional sense, but 
instead use repetition (i.e.",3
"driving thousands of test miles and 
tracking driving errors and successes) to optimize the algorithm and 
underlying technology in a way that human programmers could 
never do on their own.",3
"another way to think about reinforcement 
learning is “trial-and-error”, but on a massive scale accomplishable 
only by computers.",3
"over time, the software learns what to do, and 
what not to do, until its functionality is optimized for the task at 
hand.",3
"levels of data use associated with different machine 
learning models 
 
the use case for machine learning implementation dictates the 
data rights that must be obtained, as well as the applicable data 
retention and use policies.",3

different use cases: 
 
● opentable recommends restaurants, but can only do so 
based on the information it collects (e.g.",3

companies obtain, use, and retain data in different ways, depending 
on their business model and their machine learning models.",3
"a.  supervised 
 
supervised machine learning presents clearer use cases.",3
"the 
outcome is predictable, and in fact, programmed.",3
"netflix and 
opentable, for example, ingest user preference data to produce 
individualized recommendations to that user.",3
"these algorithms do 
not necessarily rely on extraneous data inputs—they are trained to 
provide recommendations if certain inputs are present.",3
"but by 
continuously ingesting new data, the engine can be refined and 
perfected on an ongoing basis.",3
"for example, over time, netflix may 
be able to distinguish between medical-drama fanatics who want to 
binge grey’s anatomy and those who prefer er.",3
"for this reason, the 
results of supervised machine learning can be highly valuable to 
companies in any industry, but especially those industries that are 
consumer-facing.",3
"however, for both netflix and opentable, the use of the data 
(recommendations) is not these companies’ core business; rather, it 
is an added feature that has helped propel both companies to the top 
of their respective industries.",3

recommendations, netflix would still be a video streaming service.",3

agents execute the task and determine the appropriate response to the input before provid-
ing an easy response that the student can easily understand.",3
"• both machine learning and virtual assistants are used to interpret patterns and human in-
teraction which supports deeper learning and provides users with fast and accurate data.",3
this chapter proposes a new education framework that is powered by virtual assistance.,3
it provides customized research for students.,3
"the suggested framework allows teachers to 
monitor their students’ progress through their learning activities at any time.",3
"this is the 
best approach to training students to enhance their experience.",3

teachers save time that is normally spent in preparing lectures, creating exams, document 
review, document creation, and light specific research.",3

the leveraging of the most powerful technologies in improving the quality of education for

learning and virtual assistants is that it is less prone to the errors that usually encumber

consumes information, machine learning allows the learner to move ahead only after they have 
truly grasped the previous content.",3

behind.",3
"this is true even if they are the only one in class that has not yet understood the con-
tent.",3
"the machine learning system also allows teachers to individually monitor student and 
help them those areas where they are deficient.",3

allocate ample time to explain specific concepts taught in class to the student.",3
"therefore, the 
student misses out on these concepts that might cause low academic performance.",3
"in other 
cases, teachers recommend students with clarifications to get the assistance of their class-
mates.",3
"this hampers full understanding as one needs to develop a rapport with their fellow 
student to enhance learning, and others become intimidated.",3
"however, the virtual assistant 
allocates enough time and is able to answer all questions, providing detailed explanations.",3
"the third student said that she found it was an effective supplement to one teacher’s exten-
sive use of multiple choice exams.",3
"according to the student, while such exams might tell her 
whether or not she knows the answer to a question, they do not help her understand the logic 
underlying the answer.",3
the virtual assistance was helpful in achieving that understanding.,3
the fourth student also reported satisfaction with the system.,3
"firstly, the student confessed 
to being a slow learner.",3
this had really affected how she grasped concepts.,3
"most of the times, 
she felt left behind in classwork and had no one to consult as she was shy about her condition.",3
"however, the system helped her to learn at her pace and recommended interactive learning 
model that allowed her ask for clarification after every  minutes of the learning session.",3
"she 
was enthusiastic to note that this has helped her understand most of the concepts taught in 
class and generally improve her grades.",3
"lastly, a teacher who had made use of the assistance 
said it allowed her more time to figure out what her students actually understood and where 
they were having difficulties.",3
"by so doing, it helped her know which areas needed much atten-
tion to enhance understanding.",3
"she recounted that teaching a class of  students can some-
times be difficult to know who understood well, who needed extra attention on a specific topic 
and what learning model suited a specific group of students.",3
"the virtual assistant, according 
to the teacher, answers these questions.",3
"the system is able to compile interactive activities to 
address specific learning outcomes to indent whether the students understood the topic.
. conclusion
machine learning with ai has opened incredible possibilities in various fields.",3
"this is espe-
cially the case in terms of the education sector and education-related fields.",3
"this means that 
future learning environments are likely to be highly personalized, with the ability to help 
machine learning in educational technology


learners realize their utmost potential in the most fulfilling way.",3
"there will be a steady adop-
tion of machine learning in various areas of concern for educational technology.",3
"in the initial 
stages, its impact will not be clearly apparent or significant to the end user.",3
"despite this, teach-
ers have started to see how tasks can be simplified and more effectively completed through 
the employment and application of machine learning technologies.",3
"the advances made in 
adopting machine learning into education sector have significantly saved teachers’ time in 
both the classroom and non-classroom-related activities.",3
"stakeholders have welcomed this 
unprecedented benefit, as it makes learning easier and more appealing.",3
"the future work on machine learning, especially in the education context, shall witness the 
development of more sophisticated ai tools.",3
"there are multiple prospects for designing com-
plex chatbots that will improve the sophistication of virtual assistants.",3
"this development shall 
foster more human interactions that will replace emails and text messages.",3
"already, plans 
are underway for developing online virtual assistants named “amy” or “andrew” at x.ai 
to schedule meetings with both tutors and learners.",3
"ai coupled with machine learning that 
incorporates deep learning and natural language processing is projected to go a level higher 
by incorporating more sophisticated systems laced with capabilities to adapt, learn and pre-
dict systems with utmost autonomy.",3
"the future works on these systems shall incorporate a 
combination of advanced algorithms and embedded massive data sets.",3

"this paper considers the parallelisation of
such consistent and efficient learning algorithms, e.g., support vector machines, regularised least
squares regression, and logistic regression.",3
"we additionally assume that data is abundant and that
f can be parametrised in a fixed, finite dimensional euclidean space rd such that the convexity of
the regularised risk minimisation problem (equation ) is preserved.",3
"in other cases, (non-linear)
low-dimensional embeddings [, ] can preprocess the data to facilitate parallel learning with our
scheme.",3
"with slight abuse of notation, we identify the hypothesis space with its parametrisation.",3
"the main theoretical contribution of this paper is to show that algorithms satisfying the above con-
ditions can be parallelised effectively.",3
"we consider a parallelisation to be effective if the (ε,∆)-
guarantees (equation ) are achieved in time polylogarithmic in n(ε,∆).",3
"the cost for achieving
this reduction in runtime comes in the form of an increased data size and in the number of processing
units used.",3
"for the parallelisation scheme presented in this paper, we are able to bound this cost by
a quasi-polynomial in /ε and log /∆.",3
"the main practical contribution of this paper is an effective
parallelisation scheme that treats the underlying learning algorithm as a black-box, i.e., it can be
parallelised without further mathematical derivations and without writing dedicated code.",3
"similar to averaging-based parallelisations [, , ], we apply the underlying learning algorithm
in parallel to random subsets of the data.",3
"each resulting hypothesis is assigned to a leaf of an
aggregation tree which is then traversed bottom-up.",3
"each inner node computes a new hypothesis
that is a radon point [] of its children’s hypotheses.",3
"in contrast to aggregation by averaging, the
radon point increases the confidence in the aggregate doubly-exponentially with the height of the
aggregation tree.",3
"we describe our parallelisation scheme, the radon machine, in detail in section .",3

the size necessary to achieve the same confidence, we are able to show a reduction in runtime from
polynomial to polylogarithmic in section .",3
"the empirical evaluation of the radon machine in section  confirms its potential in practical
settings.",3
"given the same amount of data as the underlying learning algorithm, the radon ma-
chine achieves a substantial reduction of computation time in realistic applications.",3
"using  pro-
cessors, the radon machine is between  and around -times faster than the underlying learning
algorithm on a single processing unit.",3
"compared with parallel learning algorithms from spark’s
mllib, it achieves hypotheses of similar quality, while requiring only − % of their runtime.",3
"parallel computing [] and its limitations [] have been studied for a long time in theoretical com-
puter science [].",3
"parallelising polynomial time algorithms ranges from being ‘embarrassingly’ []
easy to being believed to be impossible.",3
"for the class of decision problems that are the hardest in p,
i.e., for p-complete problems, it is believed that there is no efficient parallel algorithm in the sense

this connection and other approaches to parallel learning are discussed in section .,3
"from radon points to radon machines
the radon machine, described in algorithm , first executes the underlying (base) learning algo-
rithm on random subsets of the data to quickly achieve weak hypotheses and then iteratively aggre-
gates them to stronger ones.",3
"both the generation of weak hypotheses and the aggregation can be
executed in parallel.",3
"to aggregate hypotheses, we follow along the lines of the iterated radon point
algorithm which was originally devised to approximate the centre point, i.e., a point of largest tukey
depth [], of a finite set of points [].",3
"the radon point [] of a set of points is defined as follows:
definition .",3
"a radon partition of a set s ⊂ f is a pair a,b ⊂ s such that a ∩ b = ∅ but
〈a〉 ∩ 〈b〉 = ∅, where 〈·〉 denotes the convex hull.",3
"the radon number of a space f is the smallest
r ∈ n such that for all s ⊂ f with |s| ≥ r there is a radon partition; or ∞ if no s ⊂ f with
radon partition exists.",3
"a radon point of a set s with radon partition a,b is any r ∈ 〈a〉 ∩ 〈b〉.",3
"we now present the radon machine (algorithm ), which is able to effectively parallelise consistent
and efficient learning algorithms.",3
"input to this parallelisation scheme is a learning algorithm l on
a hypothesis space f , a dataset d ⊆ x × y , the radon number r ∈ n of the hypothesis space
f , and a parameter h ∈ n. it divides the dataset into rh subsets d, .",3

algorithm l on each subset in parallel (line ).",3
"then, the set of hypotheses (line ) is iteratively
aggregated to form better sets of hypotheses (line -).",3
"for that the set is partitioned into subsets of
size r (line ) and the radon point of each subset is calculated in parallel (line ).",3
"the final step of
each iteration is to replace the set of hypotheses by the set of radon points (line ).",3
the scheme requires a hypothesis space with a valid notion of convexity and finite radon number.,3
"while other notions of convexity are possible [, ], in this paper we restrict our consideration to
euclidean spaces with the usual notion of convexity.",3
"radon’s theorem [] states that the euclidean
space rd has radon number r = d + .",3
"radon points can then be obtained by solving a system
of linear equations of size r × r (to be fully self-contained we state the system of linear equations
explicitly in appendix c.).",3
"the next proposition gives a guarantee on the quality of radon points:
proposition .",3
"given a probability measure p over a hypothesis space f with finite radon number
r, let f denote a random variable with distribution p . furthermore, let r be the random variable
obtained by computing the radon point of r random points drawn according to p r. then it holds
for the expected regret q and all ε ∈ r that
p (q (r) > ε) ≤ (rp (q (f ) > ε)) .",3
the proof of proposition  is provided in section .,3
"note that this proof also shows the robustness
of the radon point compared to the average: if only one of r points is ε-bad, the radon point is
still ε-good, while the average may or may not be; indeed, in a linear space with any set of ε-good
hypotheses and any ε′ ≥ ε, we can always find a single ε′-bad hypothesis such that the average of
all these hypotheses is ε′-bad.",3
"a direct consequence of proposition  is a bound on the probability that the output of the radon
machine with parameter h is bad:
theorem .",3
"given a probability measure p over a hypothesis space f with finite radon number r,
let f denote a random variable with distribution p . denote by r the random variable obtained by
computing the radon point of r random points drawn iid according to p and by p its distribution.",3
"for any h ∈ n, let rh denote the radon point of r random points drawn iid from ph− and by ph its
distribution.",3
"then for any convex function q : f → r and all ε ∈ r it holds that
p (q(rh) > ε) ≤ (rp (q(f ) > ε))
h
.
the proof of theorem  is also provided in section .",3
"for the radon machine with parameter
h, theorem  shows that the probability of obtaining an ε-bad hypothesis is doubly exponentially
reduced: with a bound δ on this probability for the base learning algorithm, the bound ∆ on this
probability for the radon machine is
∆ = (rδ)
h
. ()
in the next section we compare the radon machine to its base learning algorithm which is applied
to a dataset of the size necessary to achieve the same ε and ∆.",3
"sample and runtime complexity
in this section we first derive the sample and runtime complexity of the radon machine r from
the sample and runtime complexity of the base learning algorithm l. we then relate the runtime
complexity of the radon machine to an application of the base learning algorithm which achieves
the same (ε,∆)-guarantee.",3
"in this case all base learning algo-
rithms can be executed in parallel.",3
"in practical applications fewer physical processors can be used
to simulate rh processing units—we discuss this case in section .",3
"the runtime of the radon machine can be decomposed into the runtime of the base learning al-
gorithm and the runtime for the aggregation.",3
"the base learning algorithm requires n ≥ nl (ε, δ)
samples and can be executed on rh processors in parallel in time tl(n).",3
"the radon point in each of
the h iterations can then be calculated in parallel in time r (see appendix c.).",3
"thus, the runtime
of the radon machine with n = rhn samples is
tr,h(n) = tl (n) + hr .",3
"()
in contrast, the runtime of the base learning algorithm for achieving the same guarantee is
tl(m) with m ≥ nl (ε,∆).",3
"ignoring logarithmic and constant terms, nl (ε,∆) behaves as
hnl (ε, δ).",3
"to obtain polylogarithmic runtime of r compared to tl(m), we choose the parame-
ter h ≈ ldm − ld ldm such that n ≈ m/h = ldm .",3
"thus, the runtime of the radon machine is in
o (ldκm + r ldm).",3
this result is formally summarised in theorem .,3
"the radon machine with a consistent and efficient regularised risk minimisation al-
gorithm on a hypothesis space with finite radon number has polylogarithmic runtime on quasi-
polynomially many processing units if the radon number can be upper bounded by a function poly-
logarithmic in the sample complexity of the efficient regularised risk minimisation algorithm.",3
"the theorem is proven in appendix a. and relates to nick’s class []: a decision problem can
be solved efficiently in parallel in the sense of nick’s class, if it can be decided by an algorithm
in polylogarithmic time on polynomially many processors (assuming, e.g., pram model).",3
"for the
class of decision problems that are the hardest in p , i.e., for p -complete problems, it is believed
that there is no efficient parallel algorithm for solving them in this sense.",3
"theorem  provides a
step towards finding efficient parallelisations of regularised risk minimisers and towards answering
the open question: is consistent regularised risk minimisation possible in polylogarithmic time on
polynomially many processors.",3
"a similar question, for the case of learning half spaces, has been
called a fundamental open problem by long and servedio [] who gave an algorithms which runs
on polynomially many processors in time that depends polylogarithmically on the sample size but
is inversely proportional to a parameter of the learning problem.",3
"while nick’s class as a notion of
efficiency has been criticised [], it is the only notion of efficiency that forms a proper complexity
class in the sense of blum [].",3
"to overcome the weakness of using only this notion, kruskal et al.",3
"[] suggested to consider also the inefficiency of simulating the parallel algorithm on a single
processing unit.",3
"we discuss the inefficiency and the speed-up in appendix a..
we derive αε, βε for hypothesis spaces with finite vc [] and rademacher [] complexity in app.",3

 empirical evaluation
this empirical study compares the radon machine to state-of-the-art parallel machine learning al-
gorithms from the spark machine learning library [], as well as the natural baseline of averaging
hypotheses instead of calculating their radon point (averaging-at-the-end, avg).",3
"we use base learn-
ing algorithms from weka [] and scikit-learn [].",3
"we compare the radon machine to the base
learning algorithms on moderately sized datasets, due to scalability limitations of the base learners,
and reserve larger datasets for the comparison with parallel learners.",3
"the experiments are executed
on a spark cluster ( worker nodes,  processors per node).",3
"all results are obtained using -fold
cross validation.",3
"we apply the radon machine with parameter h =  and the maximal parame-
ter h such that each instance of the base learning algorithm is executed on a subset of size at least
 (denoted h = max).",3
"averaging-at-the-end executes the base learning algorithm on the same
number of subsets rh as the radon machine with that parameter and is denoted in the figures by
stating the parameter h as for the radon machine.",3

the same base learning algorithm and a compara-
ble spark machine learning algorithm.",3
"there, the radon machine is between  and
around -times faster than the base learner
using  processors.",3
"the speed-up is de-
tailed in figure .",3
"on the susy dataset
(with    instances and  features),
the radon machine on  processors with
h =  is  times faster than its base learn-
ing algorithms.",3
"at the same time, their predic-
tive performances, measured by the area under
the roc curve (auc) on an independent test
dataset, are comparable.",3
"how does the scheme compare to averaging-
at-the-end?",3
"in figure (b) we compare the
runtime and auc of the parallelisation scheme
against the averaging-at-the-end baseline (avg).",3
"in terms of the auc, the radon machine out-
performs the averaging-at-the-end baseline on
all datasets by at least %.",3
"the runtimes can
hardly be distinguished in that figure.",3
"a small
difference can however be noted in figure 
which is discussed in more details in the next
paragraph.",3
"since averaging is less computa-
tionally expensive than calculating the radon
point, the runtimes of the averaging-at-the-end
baselines are slightly lower than the ones of
the radon machine.",3
"however, compared to the
computational complexity of executing the base
learner, this advantage becomes negligible.",3
how does our scheme compare to state-of-the-art spark machine learning algorithms?,3
"we
compare the radon machine to various spark machine learning algorithms on  large datasets.",3
"the
results in figure (c) indicate that the proposed parallelisation scheme with h = max has a substan-
tially smaller runtime than the spark algorithms on all datasets.",3
"on the susy and higgs dataset,
the radon machine is one order of magnitude faster than the spark implementations—here the com-
paratively small number of features allows for a high level of parallelism.",3
"on the casp dataset,
the radon machine is % faster than the fastest spark algorithm.",3
"the performance in terms of auc
of the radon machine is similar to the spark algorithms.",3
"in particular, when using wekalogreg
with h = max, the radon machine outperforms the spark algorithms in terms of auc and runtime
on the datasets susy, wikidata, and casp.",3
"details are given in the appendix b. a summarizing
comparison of the parallel approaches in terms of their trade-off between runtime and predictive
performance is depicted in figure .",3
"here, results are shown for the radon machine and averaging-
at-the-end with parameter h = max and for the two spark algorithms most similar to the base

learning algorithms.",3
"note that it is unclear what caused the consistently weak performance of all
algorithms on wikidata.",3
"nonetheless, the results show that on all datasets the radon machine has
comparable predictive performance to the spark algorithms and substantially higher predictive per-
formance than averaging-at-the-end.",3
"at the same time, the radon machine has a runtime comparable
to averaging-at-the-end on all datasets and both are substantially faster than the spark algorithms.",3
how does the runtime depend on the dataset size in a real-world system?,3
"the runtime of
the radon machine can be distinguished into its learning phase and its aggregation phase.",3
"while
the learning phase fully benefits from parallelisation, this comes at the cost of additional runtime for
the aggregation phase.",3
"the time for aggregating the hypotheses does not depend on the number of
instances in the dataset but for a fixed parameter h it only depends on the dimension of the hypothesis
space and that parameter.",3
"in figure  we compare the runtimes of all base learning algorithms per
dataset size to the radon machines.",3
"results indicate that, while the runtimes of the base learning
algorithms depends on the dataset size with an average exponent of ., the runtime of the radon
machine depends on the dataset size with an exponent of only ..
how generally applicable is the scheme?",3
"as an indication of the general applicability in practice,
we also consider regression and multi-class classification.",3
"for regression, we apply the scheme to
the scikit-learn implementation of regularised least squares regression [].",3
"on the dataset yearpre-
dictionmsd, regularised least squares regression achieves an rmse of ., whereas the radon
machine achieved an rmse of .. at the same time, the radon machine is -times faster.",3
"we
also compare the radon machine on a multi-class prediction problem using conditional maximum
entropy models.",3
"for multi-class classification, we use the implementation described in mcdonald
et al.",3
"[], who propose to use averaging-at-the-end for distributed training.",3
"we compare the radon
machine to averaging-at-the-end with conditional maximum entropy models on two large multi-
class datasets (drift and spoken-arabic-digit).",3
"on average, our scheme performs better with only
slightly longer runtime.",3
"the minimal difference in runtime can be explained—similar to the results
in figure (b)—by the smaller complexity of calculating the average instead of the radon point.",3
"discussion and future work
in the experiments we considered datasets where the number of dimensions is much smaller than
the number of instances.",3
what about high-dimensional models?,3
"the basic version of the paral-
lelisation scheme presented in this paper cannot directly be applied to cases in which the size of the
dataset is not at least a multiple of the radon number of the hypothesis space.",3
"for various types of
data such as text, this might cause concerns.",3
"however, random projections [] or low-rank approx-
imations [, ] can alleviate this problem and are already frequently employed in machine learning.",3
an alternative might be to combine our parallelisation scheme with block coordinate descent [].,3
"in this case, the scheme can be applied iteratively to subsets of the features.",3
in the experiments we considered only linear models.,3
"learning
non-linear models causes similar problems to learning high-dimensional ones.",3
"in non-parametric
methods like kernel methods, for instance, the dimensionality of the optimisation problem is equal
to the number of instances, thus prohibiting the application of our parallelisation scheme.",3
"how-
ever, similar low-rank approximation techniques as described above can be applied with non-linear
kernels [].",3
"furthermore, methods for speeding up the learning process for non-linear models ex-
plicitly approximate an embedding in which then a linear model can be learned [].",3
"using explicitly
constructed feature spaces, radon machines can directly be applied to non-linear models.",3
"we have theoretically analysed our parallelisation scheme for the case that there are enough process-
ing units available to find each weak hypothesis on a separate processing units.",3
"what if there are
not rh, but only c < rh processing units?",3
"the parallelisation scheme can quite naturally be “de-
parallelised” and partially executed in sequence.",3
"for the runtime this implies an additional factor of
max{, rh/c}.",3
"thus, the radon machine can be applied with any number of processing units.",3
"the scheme improves ∆ doubly exponentially in its parameter h but for that it requires the weak hy-
potheses to already achieve δ ≤ /r.",3
is the scheme only applicable in high-confidence domains?,3
"many application scenarios require high-confidence error bounds, e.g., in the medical domain []
or in intrusion detection [].",3
"in practice our scheme achieves similar predictive quality much faster
than its base learner.",3
"besides runtime, communication plays an essential role in parallel learning.",3
"what is the commu-
nication complexity of the scheme?",3
"as for all aggregation at the end strategies, the overall amount
of communication is low compared to periodically communicating schemes.",3
"for the parallel aggre-
gation of hypotheses, the scheme requires o(rh+) messages (which can be sent in parallel) each
containing a single hypothesis of size o(r).",3
"our scheme is ideally suited for inherently distributed
data and might even mitigate privacy concerns.",3
in a lot of applications data is available in the form of potentially infinite data streams.,3
"can the
scheme be applied to distributed data streams?",3
"for each data stream, a hypotheses could be
maintained using an online learning algorithm and periodically aggregated using the radon machine,
similar to the federated learning approach proposed by mcmahan et al.",3
"in this paper, we investigated the parallelisation of machine learning algorithms.",3
"is the radon
machine more generally applicable?",3
"the parallelisation scheme could be applied to more general
randomized convex optimization algorithms with unknown and random target functions.",3
"we will
investigate its applicability for learning in non-euclidean, abstract convexity spaces.",3
"conclusion and related work
in this paper we provided a step towards answering an open problem: is parallel machine learn-
ing possible in polylogarithmic time using a polynomial number of processors only?",3
"this question
has been posed for half-spaces by long and servedio [] and called “a fundamental open prob-
lem about the abilities and limitations of efficient parallel learning algorithms”.",3
"it relates machine
learning to nick’s class of parallelisable decision problems and its variants [].",3
"early theoretical
treatments of parallel learning with respect to nc considered probably approximately correct (pac)
[, ] concept learning.",3
"vitter and lin [] introduced the notion of nc-learnable for concept
classes for which there is an algorithm that outputs a probably approximately correct hypothesis in
polylogarithmic time using a polynomial number of processors.",3
"in this setting, they proved positive
and negative learnability results for a number of concept classes that were previously known to be
pac-learnable in polynomial time.",3
"more recently, the special case of learning half spaces in par-
allel was considered by long and servedio [] who gave an algorithm for this case that runs on
polynomially many processors in time that depends polylogarithmically on the size of the instances
but is inversely proportional to a parameter of the learning problem.",3
"our paper complements these
theoretical treatments of parallel machine learning and provides a provably effective parallelisation
scheme for a broad class of regularised risk minimisation algorithms.",3
"some parallelisation schemes also train learning algorithms on small chunks of data and average the
found hypotheses.",3
"while this approach has advantages [, ], current error bounds do not allow
a derivation of polylogarithmic runtime [, , ] and it has been doubted to have any benefit
over learning on a single chunk [].",3
"another popular class of parallel learning algorithms is based
on stochastic gradient descent, targeting expected risk minimisation directly [, and",3
"supervised-learning models [] and decision-
reinforcement learning models [] can be used for perception
and planning, and conventional control theory can be used
for control, respectively.",3
"on the other hand, in order to per-
form qa on a system, it is necessary to predefine quality
standards and a qa process in advance, and strictly follow
them at development time.",3
"in this study, we identify open

published at icml workshop for
deep learning for safety-critical in engineering systems kuwajima et al.",3
"problems related to the three levels: the in-vehicle automated-
driving system, the subsystems, and the machine learning
model.",3
"thus, we use an automated-driving system as an ex-
ample of a safety-critical machine-learning system.",3
"then, we
investigate the open qa problems in terms of the three steps
of the development process: design (requirements and speci-
fications), verification (including validation), and operation
(including maintenance).",3
"the three levels and three steps
are shown in fig. . open problems that can be addressed
using conventional methods are beyond the scope of this
research study and are therefore excluded.",3
"notably, many of
the open problems considered in this paper do not occur only
in automated-driving systems, but in safety-critical systems
in general.",3
"open problems of in-vehicle
automated-driving systems
in-vehicle automated-driving systems are automated-driving
systems that are installed in vehicles.",3
"in the three layers of
the system operating on an automated vehicle: the in-vehicle
automated-driving system, the subsystems, and the machine
learning model, only the former is exposed to the physi-
cal environment.",3
"therefore, it is necessary to consider data
on the physical environment more than theoretical assump-
tions when designing and verifying an in-vehicle automated-
driving system.",3
"the open problems in this paragraph are to
capture the operational physical environments of automated-
driving systems, and address the intractableness of field op-

"requirement: qa requires limitations, orwarranty scopes.",3
"therefore, a machine-learning system must be implemented
in a predefined environment.",3
"in the automobile industry, this
is called the operational design domain (odd), and it essen-
tially corresponds to the driving conditions with which the
system is compatible [].",3
"efficiently collecting driving sce-
narios on actual roads from past field operational tests and
customer data remains a huge task and an open challenge in
qa, but it is necessary for defining assumed environments
and verifying the developed qa system against them.",3
"in
addition, the evaluation criteria (such as test coverage) must
be defined for the collected scenarios, in order to measure
whether they are sufficient to ensure safety and security.",3
"verification: the simplest approach to guaranteeing the
quality of an in-vehicle automated driving system is through
verification against actual data.",3
"accumulating a large num-
ber of safe automated-driving trips, as long distance as with
human drivers, will effectively demonstrate that automated-
driving systems are as safe as human drivers.",3
"however, ob-
taining statistically significant results would require conduct-
ing fot by driving for hundreds of thousands to hundreds
of billions of miles fot [].",3
"the purpose of this project is to clarify the expected per-
formance level and evaluation criteria of automated-driving
systems through scenario-based verification.",3
"each scenario is defined by three levels of abstraction:
the functional scenario (natural language description), the
logical scenario (parameterized model), and the concrete sce-
nario (model with specified parameters).",3
"first, in the concept
phase, natural languages are used to describe the functional
scenario without ambiguous terms, in a way that can be un-
derstood by human experts.",3
"next, in the system development
phase, we define the parameters and their distributions, and
describe the logical scenario in a specified data format.",3
"in
the test & verification phase, specific parameters are sam-
pled from the parameter distributions, and the scenario is
detailed into a concrete scenario, so that it can to be executed
(simulated) with test tools.",3
"scenarios are collected from test
drives and the market to demonstrate that systems are equal
to or better than human drivers.",3
"regular scenarios are con-
tinuously tested by simulation, and those critical are tested
through artificially configured environments on test courses.",3
"the pegasus project is an excellent example of continuous
definition of requirements for (in-vehicle) automated-driving
systems and their verification.",3
"the open problems in qa for
the in-vehicle automated-driving system level require sta-
tistics and simulation techniques to develop solutions for
scenario collection and verification, respectively.",3

manufacturers) will select the appropriate solutions and lead
the standardization process.",3

"requirement: subsystems with machine-learning mod-
els have uncertainty derived from the machine-learning mod-
els.",3
"therefore, it is necessary to develop methods for describ-
ing this uncertainty as a statistical measure.",3
"design: thus, qa must be conducted independently for
each subsystem including those incorporatingmachine-learning
models.",3
"as a result, qa of subsystems that do not usemachine-
learning models can be performed through conventional
methods, with minimal change in the development process.",3
"subsystems with different functionalities, such as percep-
tion and planning, may require different qa approaches.",3
"for
example, the same qa approach cannot be applied to per-
ception with a convolutional neural network [] and to
planning with a deep q-network [].",3
"in general, a machine-
learningmodel cannot achieve % accuracy on test data [],
and as accuracy approaches %, further performance im-
provement becomes difficult.",3
"therefore, optimizing machine-
learning models are not the only way to improve subsystem
performance.",3
"in fact, a subsystem should be subdivided and
verified based on its development process, combining the con-
ventional deductive approach with the inductive approach
that is unique to machine learning [].",3
"rigorous breakdown
of subsystem requirements into machine-learning model re-
quirements is essential for safety-critical machine-learning
systems.",3
"in this process, safety analysis methods and pro-
cesses are important, such as: black box verification; encapsu-
lation of machine-learning models by rule-based safeguard-
ing; redundant & diverse architecture that mitigates and
absorbs the uncertainty of machine learning models; system
modification patterns to cope with additional requirements
without modification of the machine-learning model, in or-
der to avoid the principle of cace as much as possible.",3

system-level technologies stamp/stpa [] and gsn []
have received attention in recent years.",3
"they are highly
promising, but they will need an extension that can express
the uncertainty related to the machine-learning models.",3
"in
addition, sotif, which is a safety standard/process concern-
ing performance limits of normal functions, is also focused
on securing functions with uncertainty even under normal
conditions [].",3
"we consider that the most relevant technical
area for qa at the subsystems level is software engineering.",3
"subsystems are the intermediate layer between the deduc-
tive (manual) development of systems and the inductive
(data driven) development of machine-learning models.",3
"the
safety-critical properties of systems should be managed at
the subsystem level and handed to the machine-learning
models.",3
"open problems of machine
learning models
a machine-learning model is acquired by executing a train-
ing algorithm (training) with a model structure and training
data sets as inputs.",3
"a machine-learning model before deter-
mining the parameters by training is called a model structure
in this paper.",3
"trained machine models are evaluated using
test datasets [].",3
"the open problems in this paragraph are to
deductively design the requirements of the machine learning
models and their test data, as the final step manual engineer-
ing in machine-learning systems.",3
"requirement: in machine learning, we consider that the
roles of training data and test data are different.",3
"while the
training data is used for improving the performance of the
machine-learning model, the test data should be used to ac-
curately reflect the environmental conditions in operation.",3
"for example, when all the data obtained at the time of de-
velopment are randomly divided, some of them are used as
training data and the others are test data.",3
"in this way, the
training data and the test data are approximately equally
distributed, but the relationship to the operational data is
unknown.",3
"particularly in a safety-critical machine-learning
system, it is necessary to design the test data distribution
considering the operational environment, in which the sys-
tem will actually be operated in the future, and to collect test
data based on the designed data distribution.",3
"in this way, by
accepting an a-priori viewpoint of the test data distribution,
we can deductively define the assumed environment, and
inductively collect data based on the requirements of the
overlaid subsystem.",3
"moreover, by assuming the distribution
of the test data, we can now discuss their distribution, and
define the operation domain with concrete design informa-
tion.",3
"even in the current development of in-vehicle automated-
driving systems, the test data would be collected assuming
the operational environment, in order to make the distri-
bution at the time of operation and the distribution of the
test data as consistent as possible.",3
"however, the methods of
describing the assumed environment of machine-learning
models are not organized.",3
"in particular, we need methods to
describe the properties of the test data.",3
"furthermore, since
the required performance may change depending on the
assumed environment, it is necessary to express the associ-
ation between the assumed environment and the required
performance.",3
"test data should have attributes such as time
and weather, and their distributions, which are based on
the assumed environment.",3
"each condition of the test data
distribution should have a confusion matrix which machine
learning models will have them as desired value (table ).",3
"in table , the confusion matrix (accuracy) is shown as a
requirement of the machine-learning model, but there are
other quality characteristics of machine-learningmodels that
should be investigated.",3
"in order to use machine-learning
models in safety-critical systems, it is necessary to define
and evaluate models by the performance indicators from
various perspectives besides accuracy.",3
"design: a machine-learning model is automatically ob-
tained by training the model structure using the training
data.",3
"thus, specifications cannot be designed a priori.",3
"this
limitation is essential, because high-performance machine-
learning models are realized by learning high-dimensional
parameters from data that engineers cannotmanually specify.",3
"to secure the reproducibility of the train-
ing process.",3
"in this way, specification is achieved indirectly.",3
"operational data tend to change with time, creating a ma-
jor problem for the operation and maintenance of machine-
learning models [].",3

large as time elapses from completion of development.",3
"it is
important to check the consistency between the operational
data and the test data (originally assumed environment), and
to make the machine-learning models follow the operational
data in a continuous maintenance process.",3
"verification: some quality characteristics cannot be eval-
uated with test data.",3
"for example, when evaluating robust-
ness against ae as fault tolerance, it is necessary to artificially
generate perturbations around the original test data points.",3
"we can generate ae near each individual test data point
and quantify robustness by maximizing the ae to which the
model can give correct answers.",3
"besides robustness, there are
also demands for measurement methods of various quality
characteristics as listed above.

robustness is a key to qa.",3
"ae occurs when the image recog-
nition model incorrectly recognizes slight noise that cannot
be recognized by humans with high confidence [].",3
"ae is
known to have model-independent versatility and is an is-
sue that threatens the safety of automated-driving systems
depending on image-recognition technology.",3
"study on ae is
important not only for defending intentional attacks such as
false traffic signs, but also for understanding the formation of
decision boundaries of machine learning model and realizing
highly robust recognition functions.",3
"inference processes of advanced machine learning models
such as neural networks (nn) are considered black boxes.",3
"in particular, safety-critical systems should exhibit inter-
pretability and transparency.",3
"in this context, a black box
refers to a situation, where, although feature activations can
be observed physically, the actual phenomenon cannot be
understood.",3
"regarding interpretability, nn visualization []
shows great promise.",3
"in nn visualization, one method in-
tentionally performs occlusion on input data, and specifies
the region where the inference result changes drastically
as a region of interest; another method back-propagates ac-
tivation values from the influencer nodes at the later fea-
ture extraction process to identify the region of interest.",3
"nn
visualization may have use in cases of debugging during
training, and validation of the training result (understand-
ing the internal behavior of the trained nn).",3
"therefore, one
open problem is obtaining concrete use cases to address the
interpretability and transparency of safety-critical machine-
learning systems, by using nn visualization, interpretation,
transparency methods.",3
"in the previous paragraphs, we presented the current
trends in machine-learning technology related to qa of
machine-learning models.",3
"furthermore, even in the field
of theoretical computer science, toward a verification of
machine-learning model, automatic coverage verification
based on formal verification technology is becoming possi-
ble (table ).",3
"the technical areas necessary for qa at the
machine-learning model level are machine learning and the-
oretical computer science.",3

with the development of rapid technology in recent years,

university have presented a major step in building a robust, controllable machine from 
dna, by demonstrating a robust sequence-dependent rotary dna device operating in a

this device cycle by inducing the interconversion between two robust topological motifs, 
paranemic crossover (px) dna and its topoisomer jx dna in which one strand end is 
rotated relative to the other by °.",4

analogous yet distinct rotary devices can be created by changing the control strands and 
the device sequences to which they bind.",4

someday build new molecules, computer circuits or fight infectious diseases (see yan et 
al, ).",4
"controlled mechanical movement in molecular-scale devices has been 
realized in a variety of systems, by exploiting conformational changes triggered by 
changes in redox potential or temperature, reversible binding of small molecules or ions, 
or irradiation.",4
"“the incorporation of such devices into arrays could in principle lead to 
complex structural states suitable for nanorobotic applications, provided that individual 
devices can be addressed separately.",4
"but because the triggers commonly used tend to act 
equally on all the devices that are present, they will need to be localized very tightly.",4
"this 
could be readily achieved with devices that are controlled individually by separate and 
device-specific reagents.",4
"a trigger mechanism that allows such specific control is the 
reversible binding of dna strands, thereby 'fuelling' conformational changes in a dna 
machine” (yan et al, ).",4
"this new robust sequence-dependent rotary dna device operating in a four-
step cycle represents an improvement upon the initial prototype system that used this 
mechanism but generated by-products.",4
"that initial prototype system was announced in 
 by prof. seeman that consisted in a machine constructed from dna molecules, 
which had two rigid arms that could rotated from fixed positions by adding a chemical to 
the solution.",4
"the problem was that this chemical affected all molecules within a structure 
uniformly.",4
"a big advance now is the fact that the movement can be manipulated within 
molecule pairs without affecting others within a larger structure, what is got by inserting 
dna set and fuel strands into individual molecule pairs.",4
"in biological research, particularly in the area of molecular biology and working 
nucleic acid molecules, many other achievements have been recently made.",4
"moreover, 
  
many progresses have been made in the area of molecular biology applications.",4
"in this 
field, many techniques have been successfully implemented in many scientific fields, 
such as in the diagnostics area or in biology, biotechnology or medical science.",4
"for 
example, “the introduction of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) resulted in improving old 
and designing new laboratory devices for pcr amplification and analysis of amplified 
dna fragments.",4
"in parallel to these efforts, the nature of dna molecules and their 
construction have attracted many researchers.",4
"in addition, some studies concerning 
mimicking living systems, as well as developing and constructing artificial nanodevices, 
such as biomolecular sensors and artificial cells, have been conducted” (kubik et al, 
).",4
"in this century, the development of ribonucleic acid (rna) and 
deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) diagnostics are being made considering a large set of 
approaches using new techniques and technologies, many of them associated to dna 
developments, being particularly supported by nanotechnology solutions, which have 
been already successfully introduced.",4
"these achievements take part in the fundamental 
development of many areas of diagnostics and science, including the health care, 
medicine or pharmaceutical industry (kubik et al, ).",4
"there are great scientific revolutions in human history and as seen before, 
nanotechnology is certainly one of them, which opens up unimaginable possibilities in 
various fields of human reality and in various fields for application in the industry.",4
"nanopanels - a success of nanotechnology in industry 
                 owing to the more and more importance of nanopanels, for instance in the 
future this technology may be applied to telemedicine with important consequence, they 
will be dominant in this section.",4
"nanotechnology will allow to manufacture products of higher quality at lower 
cost, a range of possibilities to produce new means of production and new kinds of 
resources and factors.",4
"this is a manufacturing system that can reproduce more 
  
manufacturing systems in a quick cheap and clean way.",4
"in only a few weeks, power 
would pass from a few to a huge number of nanofactories.",4
"it is a kind of revolutionary 
technology, manufacturing powerful, but also with many potential risks, in spite of the 
benefits it has (see euroresidentes, , p. ).",4
developed countries estime to allocate a sum of around usd .,4
"an important example of successful application of nanotechnology in brazil is 
empresa brasileira de agropecuária (embrapa).",4
"one of its most remarkable products is 
the ""electronic tongue"", a device that combines chemical sensors with nanometer-thick 
with a computer program that detects flavors and aromas and serve to quality control 
and certification of wines, juices, coffees among many other products.",4
"the agitation of the industrial model is directly related to the use of 
nanotechnology in the various branches of economic activities.",4
"follows an outline for the 
manufacture of electric power, which generically mckibben considered itself as a 
country's economy (see mckibben et al, , p. ).",4
"indeed, the use of nanotechnology in the industry production processes is a 
reality.",4
"it can be noted, for example, in the particular case of the production of electric 
energy through the photovoltaic panels use.",4
"the emphasis is placed on the competitive 
advantage associated to the use of nanotechnology versus the solar energy production for 
companies in this market segment.",4
"the american firm ""nanosolar"", which studies are sponsored by major 
companies like google or ibm, or resulting from the allocation of benefits offered by the 
department of energy, is leading the competition for energy production resulting from 
nanotechnology.",4
"the company has named this technology as ""nano-photovoltaic panels"".",4
"the photovoltaic solar energy is obtained converting light into electricity: the 
so-called ""photovoltaic effect"" (see becquerel, ).",4
"the photovoltaic cell works when light reaches the photovoltaic panel, 
exciting energetically electrons, making them circulate freely from atom to atom, forming 
the electric current.",4
the photovoltaic cell is a practical application of photoelectric effect.,4
"the 
photovoltaic cell that turns the light into electricity will continue to generate electric 
power according to the level of radiation received.",4
"note that the energy produced with the classic solar panels is much more 
expensive than the energy produced in either thermoelectric power plants or dams.",4
"if 
instead nano-photovoltaic panels are used, although, more expensive, the price is already 
comparable with the price of the energy produced in either thermoelectric power plants or 
dams (see ferreira et al, ).",4
"companies need to be dynamic in the development of innovations and thus 
creating competitive advantages.",4
"through their production processes, they can create 
economic value, and consequently generate their viability in the market in which they 
operate.",4
"the competition is part of a dynamic and evolutionary operation of the 
nowadays economy.",4
"conferring to mcafee and brynjolfsson (, p. ) ""the result is that an 
innovator with a better way of doing things can grow at unprecedented speeds and 
dominate the industry"".",4
"at the same time, it is interesting to note that nanotechnology is a technology 
that may use a minor quantity of natural resources than other technologies.",4
"probably, a 
  
company gets additional benefits and has a lower cost and additionally gets better results 
for operating inputs.",4
"to nogami and passos (, p. ), from the harsh reality of scarcity arises 
the necessity of choice.",4
"since it is not possible to produce everything that it is felt as 
needed, mechanisms must be created to show somehow to the societies the path to decide 
what goods are effectively to produce and what needs have to be met.",4
"all the means or methods of production indicate different combinations of 
forces and inputs.",4
production methods vary according the way such combinations occur.,4
every concrete act of production incorporates a kind of combination.,4
"a company can 
itself be considered a combination, and even may be the conditions of production of the 
whole economic system (see schumpeter, , p. ).",4
"roughly speaking, being photovoltaics already an innovation in itself, when it 
is combined with nanotechnology, its power of subversion, which can also be interpreted 
as its ability to break paradigms in the energy industry, takes the form of a powerful 
competitive weapon for the production units.",4
"given this context, nanotechnology combined with the production of solar 
energy becomes interesting for the production units, whether they are public or private.",4
"describing the way a nanopanel is manufactured, begin to note that first it is 
necessary to produce the semiconductor’s nanoparticles.",4
"then, aluminum sheets are 
placed in a press in order to extremely thick them.",4
"and a thin layer of semiconducting ink 
is painted on the aluminum substrate.",4
"in a next stage, another press put layers of 
cadmium sulfide and sulfur, and zinc oxide (cds and zno).",4
"finally, the sheet is devided 
in sheets of solar cells.",4
"these nano-panels can be produced outdoors (ferreira et al, 
).",4
"this technology is very interesting, reaching good results either in terms of 
costs when compared with other solar panels and also in terms of performance even 
considering public energy.",4
those costs have coming to be considerably reduced.,4
"in brazil a strong trend of increasing costs to the production of hydroelectric 
power is observed.",4
"the comparison of the hydroelectric energy produced in brazil and 
other countries like canada, for example, shows the importance of the development of 
alternative energies.",4
"in brazil, the behavior of the total cost of producing energy used to 
be well above inflation in the country for a long period.",4
"recently, brazil took the 
advantage of using photovoltaic energy through the use of nano-panels.",4
"it may be noted 
in fact that this is one of the reasons that qualify the use of photovoltaic energy as a 
generator of competitive advantage in the market.",4
"the company which owns such 
technology may experience a reduction on its variable costs, compared with solar 
photovoltaic panels (silicon).",4
"nano-panels allow also to perceive a competitive advantage 
in environmental conservation terms, when compared with the energy provided by public 
network (ferreira et al, ).",4
"in short: nanotechnology strongly implements the transformation of traditional 
models.",4
"this transformation may be in the way goods and services are produced, or in the 
way the production is conducted and made.",4
"also in terms of nanomedicine, it is 
expectable that nanopanels may have interesting applications, for instance, in clothing or 
skin for energy supplying.",4
"nanoelectronics-improving the life standard 
                   it is commonly accepted that electronic devices are essential in the support of 
nowadays life.",4
"and there is a great fundamental hope in nanotechnology to improve the 
capabilities of electronic components, namely in what concerns the reducing their 
dimensions, weight and power consumption.",4
"indeed, being the electronic components traditionally of very short 
dimensions and very low weight, the reducing of these quantities to the nanoscale level 
makes possible to conceive electronic devices with much more qualities, since then it is 
possible to incorporate there much more components and even so to reduce the size and 
weight of the device.",4
"as for the reducing of power consumption, only to emphasize that this is 
crucial in these times in which the energy shortage becomes an increasingly dramatic 
problem, nothing being too much in the efforts to achieve that the human activity 
happens to follow with an increasingly lower consumption of energy, attempting to reach 
a situation close to the one of no wastes 
  
                    also to refer that the nanotechnology developments may also contribute to 
the improvement of human creativity allowing to conceive new kinds of electronic 
components, to be used either in classical electronic devices or in modern ones.",4
"all this in order to improve the humanity life standard both in work and 
leisure.",4
"when speaking about the applications of nanotechnology to electronics it is usual 
to designate it as nanoelectronics, being the emergence of this word a sign of the huge 
importance of nanotechnology in electronics.",4
"nanoelectronics holds some answers for how it is possible to increase the 
capabilities of electronics devices and simultaneously reduce their weight and power 
consumption, making its operation more and more convenient and cheaper.",4
"many of the 
nanoelectronics areas under development are devoted to the following topics: 
                    -everybody is aware of the enormous and surprising properties that 
electronic device screens currently have.",4
"practically everything is remote from the touch 
of a finger, and moreover on devices as small as mobile phones.",4
"it seems that this 
situation will become overwhelmingly dominant for all electronics, and for example for 
televisions is already there.",4
and also for the medical monitors used in medicine.,4
"this will 
ensure greater speed and precision in the most varied procedures.",4
"improving display 
screens on electronics devices is precisely a nanoelectronics area under development.",4
"this involves reducing power consumption while decreasing the weight and thickness of 
the screens and above all to develop new properties for the screens that, for example, 
allow the touch command.",4
"-everyone is amazed at how much information can be stored nowadays in 
such small spaces.",4
it can even be said in microspaces.,4
"but everything indicates that much 
greater fears are to come in this matter.",4
"increasing the density of memory chips is a target 
for many scientists working in the nanoelectronics area.",4
"researchers believe that it is 
possible to develop a kind of memory chip with a projected density of at least one 
terabyte ( byte) of memory per square inch.",4
"- the development of the first transistors was an effective step in 
miniaturizing the circuits today, reducing (much more) the size of transistors used in 
integrated circuits is still an objective and a nanoelectronics objective.",4
"one researcher 
believes it may be possible to ""put the power of all of today's present computers in the 
palm of your hand"".",4
"it seems that it is an enormous exaggeration but who knows the 
future?",4
"an enumeration of applications under development, falling in the topics 
described above may be seen in reference .",4
"nanotechnology in medicine- friendly efficient 
healthcare 
                    nanotechnology is giving continuous steps towards new developments in research 
and applications.",4
"it will be expanded to many areas of life and sciences, particularly in medicine, 
  
where the diagnosis, drug deliveries’ systems in the body or the treatment of diseases are 
particularly important.",4
"applications of nanotechnology for treatment, diagnosis, monitoring, and control of 
biological systems were recently referred to as ""nanomedicine"" by the institutes of health (see 
moghimi et al, ).",4
"the origin of the concept of nanomedicine is related to the idea that nanorobots and 
related machines could be designed, manufactured, and introduced into the human body to 
execute cellular repairs at the molecular level.",4
"nowadays, nanomedicine has multiplied in many 
directions, understanding the idea that the ability to structure materials and devices at the 
molecular scale can bring enormous immediate benefits in the research and practice of medicine 
(see freitas, ).",4
"the use of instrumentation techniques inside the human body for ‘medical 
nanorobotics for diabetes control’, ‘nanorobotics for brain aneurysm’, ‘nanorobots for treatment 
of patients with artery occlusion', ‘nanorobots for laparoscopic cancer surgery’, has been 
established and now only requires further industrial implementation and commercialization.",4
"aspects such as integrating and using ‘nanorobotic architecture for medical target identification’ 
can effectively contribute to the advance of several medical issues, thus improving biomedical 
engineering.",4
"upcoming and current available technologies should be used to achieve a fully 
functional ‘medical nanorobot architecture based on nanobioelectronics’ (cavalcanti, ).",4
"according to (moghimi et al, ), the application of nanotechnology to medical 
activities, according to the idea inherent to the concept of nanomedicine, involves the 
identification of precise targets (cells and receptors) related to specific clinical conditions and the 
choice of the appropriate nanocarriers to achieve the required responses while minimizing the 
side effects.",4
"they say yet that “mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and 
cancers (tumor cells, as well as tumor neovasculature) are key targets”.",4
"in (moghimi et al, ) also it is shown how important are, nowadays, 
nanotechnology and nanoscience approaches to particle design and formulation.",4
"the authors 
highlight that they begin to expand the market for many drugs and are forming the basis for a 
highly profitable niche within the industry.",4
"their article highlight rational approaches in design 
and surface engineering of nanoscale vehicles and entities for site-specific drug delivery and 
medical imaging after parenteral administration.",4
"among the most relevant fields of nanotechnology use one is the development 
of artificial tissues, organs and cells.",4
"the implantation of encapsulated cells is being planned for 
the treatment of diabetes, liver failure and kidney failure.",4
"and also for the use of encapsulated 
genetically engineered cells for gene therapy.",4
"artificial cells uses are very relevant for drug 
delivery and other applications in biotechnology, chemical engineering and medicine (see kubik 
et al, ).",4
"new researches are being directed to discover new techniques which may contribute 
for the artificial growth of organs and tissues on nanopatterned scaffolds, aiming to obtain 
internal tissues implants.",4
"the studies on the creation of nanostructures that can interact with and 
replace natural biological materials give raise to many opportunities and hope for medical 
treatments.",4
"some of the medical areas in which nanomaterials have successful utilization 
are precisely the medical diagnosis, the proper and efficient delivery of pharmaceuticals or the 
development of artificial cells.",4
"as seen above, many advances in nanomedicine have been worked.",4
"their use in 
valuable medical diagnostics or clinical therapeutics brings significant results.",4
"particularly, it is interesting to show the case of the advances on dna 
sequencing and the consequent benefits.",4
an ultrafast dna sequencing has been made possible.,4
"branton’s team at harvard university used an electric field to drive a variety of rna and dna 
polymers through the central nanopore of an a-hemolysin protein channel mounted in a lipid 
bilayer similar to the outer membrane of a living cell.",4
"branton first showed that the nanopore 
could rapidly discriminate between pyrimidine and purine segments along a single rna molecule 
and later demonstrated discrimination between dna chains of similar length and composition 
differing only in base pair sequence (freitas, ).",4
"a colossal increase has been got recently in the understanding of the way basic 
biological processes happen at a molecular level (see for example the very particular case of the 
human genome sequence).",4
"the importance of these developments continues to grow very fast and 
so the focus on the essential molecular mechanisms underlying the normal functioning of cells, 
tissues and organisms themselves.",4
"molecular medicine, by itself, exploits molecular and cellular 
  
biology advances to characterize how normal cellular processes fail or are subverted in disease.",4
nanotechnology has an important role in this matter.,4
"according to freitas, cited by kubik (), there are three important molecular 
technologies: 
                          - nanoscale-structured materials and devices are promising for advanced 
diagnostics and biosensors, targeted drug delivery and smart drugs, and immunoisolation 
therapies.",4
"- biotechnology offers the benefits of molecular medicine via genomics, 
proteomics, and artificial engineered microbes.",4
"- molecular machine systems and medical nanorobots will allow instant pathogen 
diagnosis and extermination, chromosome replacement and individual cell surgery in vivo, and 
the efficient augmentation and improvement of natural physiological function.",4
"operating in the human body, nanorobots can monitor levels of different 
compounds and store information in an internal memory.",4
"the use of nanodevices may permit to 
reduce the intrusiveness, increasing the patient comfort and to give a greater fidelity on results, 
once the target tissue can be examined in its active state in the actual host environment.",4
"nanorobots may be used to rapidly examine a given tissue location, surveying its 
biochemistry, biomechanics, and histometric characteristics in greater detail (see kubik et al, 
).",4
"if, or when this happen, this will help in better disease diagnosing.",4
"in general, nanotechnology works the engineering of molecularly precise structures 
and molecular machines; and nanomedicine makes the application of nanotechnology to 
medicine, considering also the use of medical nanorobotics.",4
"medical nanorobots can offer 
targeted treatments to individual organs, tissues, cells and even intracellular components.",4
"they 
can get involved in biological processes at the molecular level.",4
"it is clear at this moment that nanotechnology will continue to offer very effective 
solutions in many medical areas, allowing new treatments, giving more efficiency to the classic 
treatments, with much less suffering for the patients.",4
"nanomedicine may even give answers at 
the level of the control of human aging.",4
"this world is a completely new open world, with very 
large potentialities at diverse scales and dimensions, very particularly in the area of telemedicine.",4
"it is very interesting to understand that the extent of telemedicine and telehealth success will 
depend on how well the heath care system exploits the capabilities of advanced information 
technology.",4
"this technology can extend the reach of medical facilities and resources, promoting 
efficiency, productivity, accuracy in clinical decision making, coordination and integration 
(ackerman et al, ).",4
"ethics and nanotechnology 
                      computers have brought the ability to type and made handwriting more and more 
superfluous, even obsolete.",4
"mobiles and their miniaturization brought the ability to generally 
communicate anywhere to anybody, making more and more useless the traditional phones.",4
"nanotechnology, because of its negligible dimension of devices, will spread the use of devices 
that now are nuisance.",4
"for instance, the pacemaker that now is used like a “last resource”, maybe 
soon will be used in a much larger scale if it will be possible to design one at a nanoscale.",4
however ethical questions rise with the development of nanotechnology.,4
"what are 
the borders for this kind of progress?",4
"what are the implications in a 
later phase of development of these technologies?",4
"global discussion has begun about this theme since the beginning of the 
discoveries about this subject.",4
"legal, ethical and social implications are irreversible and the 
discussion is usually asked to be hard.",4
"vanessa nurock, cited in bensaude-vincent (), questions the standard view of 
an ethics for nanotechnology.",4
"she argues that none of the current trends in the discipline of ethics 
would qualify for application to nanotechnology.",4
"then considering that neurotechnology – a 
rapidly growing field at the intersection between nano and biotechnology – can affect moral 
capacities of the brain, she suggests that ethics itself may be affected by nanotechnology.",4
"and she 
leaves open the question of a co-construction of ethics and bionanotechnology.",4
"freitas () says that the society should be “able to muster the collective 
financial and moral courage to allow such extraordinarily powerful medicine to be deployed for 
human betterment, with due regard to essential ethical considerations”.",4
"at eu, there are some important concerns and discussion about the development 
of the integration of human beings and artificial (software/hardware) entities.",4
"next generations, in the perspective of the utilization of nanomaterials, will have 
many benefits in all these chapters (health, economic, environmental, etc).",4
"by using this kind of 
advanced technology, with many more applications and much friendlier using, the conditions this 
technology offers will be very environmental friendly as well, as already seen.",4
"actually, there are irreversible and long-term impact consequences for future 
generations and for the environment.",4
"however, there are risks, as well.",4
"but in truth there are 
incredible potential advantages.",4
and the discussion is all over the place.,4
"the borders are, of 
course, evident and there has to be an achieved balance between the path found to the new 
dimension of knowledge and the contours the problem has.",4
"the rub of the question is exactly in 
what measure criticisms may have into account the potential of the technology.",4
"so, despite the high feasibility for the economy and the environment, there are 
some considerations regarding the ethical, human dignity and moral borders on nanotechnology 
that should be taken into account.",4
"it is interesting to go to the definition of human dignity and its relationship to 
moral made in the “opinion of the european group on ethics in science and new technologies to 
the european commission”, , when discussing the ethical aspects of information and 
communication technologies (ict) implants in the human body.",4
"the group makes allusion to 
the eu’s draft treaty that establishes a constitution for europe, stating that “human dignity is 
inviolable.",4
"it must be respected and protected” (article ii-), and goes on to explain that “the 
dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis 
of fundamental rights” (declaration concerning the explanations relating to the charter of 
fundamental rights).",4
"this group says yet that this explanation does not strictly define human 
dignity and that many writers have attempted to fill this gap.",4
"one such attempt
 
suggests that 
human dignity is defined as follows: “the exalted moral status which every being of human origin 
uniquely possesses.",4
"human dignity is a given reality, intrinsic to human substance, and not 
contingent upon any functional capacities which vary in degree.",4
"(…) the possession of human 
  
dignity carries certain immutable moral obligations.",4
"desires, challenges but also 
concerns are always present… what are the consequences?",4
"are 
humans creating a new being?",4
"are we prepared to get different, biologically and to become 
another thing?",4
"are humans creating further ""nano-digital devices"" between humans that have 
access to these advanced technologies and humans that have not access?",4
"this discussion is 
recognized but probably the ethical discussion has not been enough promoted.",4
"in the long term, which are the consequences that nanotechnology has in the 
environment?",4
"it is possible to predict that less damage in nature can be done if nanomaterials are 
considered instead large equipments are used.",4
"besides, once the need of inputs to produce these 
devices is lesser, probably there is an additional advantage on this perspective for nature 
preservation.",4
but what is the reverse of the medal?,4
"really, the implications and directions of nanotechnology need further 
discussion.",4
"the consequences of avoiding the discussion may be severe for public, considering 
rejection or fear of the effects.",4
is there a need for a regulatory authority?,4
"which kind of 
mechanisms are needed to interfere in the nanotechnologies developments area?",4
"in truth, it may be possible in general to consider  topics for discussion (see 
mnyusiwalla et al, ) about ethics in this subject.",4
"they are equity, privacy, security, 
environment and metaphysical when discussing the relationship human-machine.",4
"about each one 
of them some considerations may be made.",4
"so, assuming these topics, it may be said the 
following, without going until the limit of the analysis: 
                               - equity: the classical problem of developed and developing countries may 
assure a new topic for discussion.",4
"in fact, technology and development are closely related.",4
"some 
important subjects that developing countries are worried with are poverty reduction, the problems 
of energy, water and health and somehow biodiversity as well.",4
"nanotechnology would help these 
  
countries to better conditions of population health and way of life.",4
"but it is costly to implement 
any project in this area and as often there are no financial resources to do that, consequently these 
countries will be the less benefited with these advances.",4
"the main problem happens with the 
access to the benefits of technology considering the poorest and the richest people in any country.",4
who may reach the advances of science and benefit from them?,4
"anyway, it is true that poor, 
whatever they are, may benefit from these advances.",4
"it may depend on the will of politicians and 
on the investments of some of these countries, for example.",4
"a consequence would be lower needs 
for energy and a cleaner energy production as well as other environmental benefits, a safer drug 
delivery, the improvement on health through for example better prevention, diagnosis and 
treatment.",4
"- privacy: at this level, it is possible to consider the enormous innovations 
which can be reached, by improving surveillance devices or other devices that restrict human 
privacy.",4
an individual may be facing situations of “invisible” microphones and cameras.,4
"this is a 
real problem if privacy is intended to be assured.",4
"wireless monitoring provides healthcare 
providers and patients to be mobile and being able to exchange data when needed.",4
"but there is the 
reverse of the medal: privacy violation?",4
"it is true that wireless communication and new 
physiological sensors bring enormous implications in e-health.",4
"one point needed is about the 
necessary discussion about privacy and security.",4
"- security: certainly new powered weapons will be available very soon, as far 
as “invisible” microphones and cameras will be available.",4
"will this ensure new ways of security 
or will be added to a potential “arsenal of bio-terrorism and techno-terrorism or even nano-
terrorism?” (see mnyusiwalla et al, ).",4
"mnyusiwalla et al,  also ask “who will regulate 
the direction of research in defensive and offensive military nt [nanotechnology]?",4
"how much 
transparency will be necessary in government and private nt initiatives to avoid misuses?",4
"there 
are also very interesting legal questions involving monitoring, ownership, and control of invisible 
objects”.",4
"- environment: new materials (fullerenes, carbon nanotubes) are now 
available.",4
"no one knows what will be the precise effects when this kind of nanomaterials goes 
into the environment (and also the effects to health).",4
"where are they put in 
the end of their mechanical lives?",4
will some medical devices be kept inside human body?,4
or will be given another destiny to them?,4
"is possible to predict any kind of 
effects caused to the environment?",4
"jacobstein () refers that it is important to make an 
  
analysis on the risks associated to passive compounds in the less than  nanometer size range.",4
"there is the possibility, for example, of being introduced inadvertently in human bodies.",4
"there is 
in fact the concern with their ability to be inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or to pass through 
biological compartment barriers such as the blood brain barrier.",4
"this kind of dangers pose a real 
range of potential health and environmental risks that are associated to their potential toxicity or 
mutagenicity in their interactions with biological systems.",4
"while the range of effects vary, most 
of the risks may be addressed by advanced industrial hygiene and environmental health practices 
and techniques that seek to characterize the specific risks, exposure patterns, and control methods 
and enforce them through a combination of practitioner education, industry self-regulation, 
monitoring and government regulation.",4
"this is an important emerging field in the environmental 
and health sciences, since most of the existing legislation on environmental, safety, and health 
risks may cover particulates, but do not take the change in physical and biological properties at 
the nanoscale into account.",4

of proteins by interfering with stimulating factors such as 
cell-surface receptors, and altered gene expression levels in 
response to the cellular stress that the nps induce.",4

about risk as compared to, when benefits are high.",4
"research 
on public perception on nano technologies also indicates that 
there is lack of information about nano food application and 
their impact on health and environment.",4
"due to the unexpected 
outcome of the genetically modified food, public is reluctant to 
accept something which is artificially synthesised.",4
"however, 
a change in this notion can be brought through transparency, 
education, implementation and assurance of safety.

similar legal solutions (especially in respect of minimum standards) or, in general,
the introduction of ‘‘consistency”, in its broad meaning, into the systems of law.",4
"this consistency is derived from various traditions (romano-germanic,
scandinavian, and common law), which demonstrate different legal
mentalities and different approaches to law.",4
"the basic tool in the
harmonization of laws in the eu is the directive.",4
"unification, on the other

the uniform application of legal norms by courts of law.",4

legislators from the perspective of protecting individuals.",4
"regardless of any
specific public authority liability, the arguments used later in this paper show
that, in certain circumstances, public authorities should be held responsible for
acts or omissions in their regulation of nanotechnology.",4
"this paper will consider
three aspects of liability.",4
"the first aspect is liability for the improper regulation of
nanotechnology, for example, when nanoproducts harm a consumer.",4
"a
‘‘consumer” is a final user of a product containing nanoparticles, such as a
user of clothes or paints produced with the use of nanomaterials.",4
"the gist of
this liability would be, in one sense, a continuation of the liability for defective
products (product liability).",4
"however, the difference is that the cause of the
defectiveness of a product will be the lack of proper regulation, which would
otherwise have ensured the user’s safety.",4
"the second aspect is liability for the improper regulation of nanotechnology
in situations when nanomaterials can cause damage to the ‘‘operators”, such as

of community law, (the hague: kluwer law international, ) at -.",4

appropriate instrument for the approximation of laws.",4

applicable in all member states (see tfeu, supra note , art.",4

"the operators of nanomaterials during a production process or during their
application (e.g.",4
"some nanomaterials, like nanosilver,
have toxic properties, so that operators are exposed to danger in relation to the
application of nanomaterials.",4

regulation of nanotechnology where regulations cause harm to companies using
nanomaterials.",4
"the introduction of unjustified restrictions on the application of
nanotechnology may cause financial losses for the enterprises applying this
technology.",4
"what is more, overregulating nanotechnology may curb
technological development.",4
"improper regulation in given aspects could be both the lack of regulations
(legislative omission), or imperfect regulation, i.e.",4
"regulation not resulting in
proper protection or regulation that is too strict.",4
"the main problem related to nanotechnology, and expressed in the paper, is
to provide appropriate safety levels for nanotechnology’s users (consumers and
operators), while also providing a favourable environment for technological
development, which to some extent is also desirable from a societal perspective.",4
"the starting point of the paper is to present nanotechnology as an emerging
technology, and show how its characteristic features such as size, unpredictability
and the fact that it is still under development (part ii) lead to a key problem:
increased risks (part iii).",4
"the current state of research on nanotechnology does
not allow a determination of the long-term consequences of using nanoproducts
(including the impact of nanoparticles on the human body and the environment,
as well as the properties of materials reduced to nanoscale, etc.).",4
"part iv explains
the reasons why the market, social norms and ‘‘architecture” may not fully
regulate for safety measures related to the use of nanotechnology, and why hard
law regulations are necessary.",4
"as a result, legislation could play a central role in
regulating nanotechnology.",4
"part v concerns problems related to product liability
regulation.",4
"according to an organisation for economic cooperation and
development (oecd) report from , the existing legal framework is able to
cover nanoproducts.",4
"however, the report takes into account mostly regulatory
aspects (mainly the food industry perspective), not liability issues.",4
"the product
liability law that is now in force in the european union (under product liability
directive //eec) does not effectively protect the users of

a proposed solution for these problems is to draft regulations which enable
injured parties to claim compensation from public authorities in situations when
policy-makers have not imposed the necessary regulations, or have enacted
incomplete or insufficient regulations.",4
"this would establish regulation around
public authority liability (part vi).",4
"the scope of the eu’s non-contractual
liability, as a legal entity responsible for policy-making, for damage arising from
the incomplete or lack of sufficient regulations does not currently cover
nanotechnology.",4
"this paper bases the proposed regulations on certain assumptions, including:
a) the regulation will provide the aggrieved parties with compensatory damages
when the injury was caused in connection with the use of nanotechnology; b)
regulating public authority liability will create incentives for policy-makers so
that they will take more effective and more precautionary actions; c) by
regulating public authority liability tort law could regain its primary function
which is the materialization of the idea of justice; d) although any additional
regulations can result in stifling the pace of technological development,
regulating public authority liability can slow down this pace potentially to a
lesser degree than regulating the liability of companies because public authority
liability does not affect the functioning of tech companies directly and thus it
interferes less in the pace of technological development; and e) the public and
businesses expect that the policy-makers will take regulatory steps.",4
part vii will explain the elements of this type of liability.,4
"first, public
authority liability should be a secondary claim.",4
"this regulation should be based
on an objective infringement of law, informed by precautionary principles, and
not a standard of subjective fault.",4
"the burden of proof should rest on the public
authority, which means that the public authority will have to prove that it has
not infringed precautionary principles.",4
"because of the long-term consequences of
nanotechnology, the limitation period should start from the time of knowledge
about the cause of damage.",4
"apart from hard law regulation, there is a need to propose some mechanisms
that will fulfill the presented concept.",4
"first, companies should share their profits
with the government by contributing to a special ‘‘innovation fund”.",4
"public
authorities could contribute to the research process not only by paying
compensation but also by ordering additional research, subsidizing research
centers, and providing various programmes financed from public funds.",4
"the last
point is that the users of nanoproducts should be informed about nanomaterials
used in products and about the risks related to nanotechnology.",4
"nanotechnology — emerging technology
nanotechnology is the ‘‘design, characterization, production and application
of structures, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at nanometre
scale.” one nanometre (nm) is equal to one-billionth of a metre (.",4
"to put it vividly, a red blood cell is approximately nm wide, while
hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells, which carries oxygen, is
approximately  nanometers.",4

of manipulating materials at the size of atoms and molecules was described for

coming era of nanotechnology.",4
nanotechnology is a fast growing area with considerable potential.,4
"according to some authors, nanotechnology is ‘‘science’s next big thing”, or
even ‘‘the next industrial revolution”.",4
"the broad scope of the application of
nanotechnology means that users are sometimes not aware of nanoparticles’
existence in various products or of the use of nanotechnology in everyday life.",4
"nanotechnology is also an interdisciplinary field and involves expertise
knowledge from different disciplines such as physics, chemistry, engineering,

is difficult to estimate how many consumer products with nanoparticles are

"different authors indicate that the number of
nanoproducts that have already been introduced to the market could vary
from  to more than .",4
"the future and potential of nanotechnology are
difficult to predict.",4
"researchers are still working on nanodevices that could be
used in cancer diagnosis.",4
"in future, nanoparticles will probably be able to come
together on their own and be self-replicating, so that they can function like living
creatures.",4
"it seems that all discussions about nanotechnology and its attendant
problems are just beginning.",4
"nanotechnology — macro-problems
although the use of nanotechnology is growing rapidly, with more and more
products including nanoparticles, this technology poses certain threats and risks.",4
"one may claim that every new technology carries some risk, but as presented in
this paper, the risks entailed by nanotechnology and its potential negative
impacts are significant.",4
"the first and most obvious observation is that nanomaterials have reached a
size that requires highly-advanced research apparatuses such as nano-
microscopes to apply nanomaterials in products and to control them.",4
"therefore, not every laboratory or scientific centre will possess the essential
equipment to carry on research on nanomaterials.",4
"it leads to dangerous
consequences for the users of nanoproducts with regards to evidential proof
problems.",4
"for example, in the case of injuries caused by a nanoproduct, the user
will have a limited ability to prove that a particular nanomaterial used in the
product caused their injury.",4
this challenge is not restricted to nanotechnology.,4
"it
is a previously known phenomena apparent from the use of other highly
advanced technologies.",4
"nanotech project, online: <
 see bhatia, ‘‘roam your body”, supra note .",4
highly advanced equipment which can examine nanoparticles are limited.,4
"the
other difficulties refer to uncertainty concerning causality.",4
"even if the injured
party has access to the advanced equipment and thus the possibility of examining
the effects of nanoparticles, in some cases it will still be impossible to prove what
exactly caused the damage (the nanoparticle itself, the reaction with other
particles, the technique by which it has been applied in the product, the way of
using the product, etc.).",4
"this uncertainty is the result of basing production
processes on technologies with effects that are not fully understood, and which
may be uncontrolled.",4
"the second argument, which is closely related to the previous one, is that this
technology is still under development.",4
"researchers and experts are working on
new practical applications for some nanomaterials as well as new measurement
methods.",4
"it is already scientifically proven that some materials change their
features when they are minimized to nanoscale.",4
"for example, some of them
change their colors, while others can be extremely hazardous, even though the
same material when ‘‘regular” size is not.",4
"for example, nanosilver is highly
toxic.",4
"third, the long-term safety of nanomaterials is unverified and the risks
related to their application are difficult to estimate.",4
"it also means that the
consequences of nanomaterials for human health are mostly unknown.",4
"one of
the potential uses of nanotechnology in medicine is that of enabling nanodevices
such as nanotubes or nanoshells to circulate in the bloodstream.",4
"because of their
size, smaller than a human cell, nanodevices could get access to areas of the body
which are now inaccessible.",4
"owing to this ability, nanodevices could diagnose
diseases and deliver treatments in a more precise and accurate way.",4
"however, it
is still unknown how the nanodevices would interact with human cells: how the
organism would manage to eliminate them, and what the long-term
consequences of circulating nanodevices in blood vessels could be.",4
"the second
example regarding long-term safety refers to the level of protection after the
period of the use of nanomaterials has ended.",4
"there is not enough research on
how nanowaste will respond to thermal or biological treatment.",4
"deciding when and how to regulate
nanotechnology
when facing challenges caused by technological innovations, policy-
makers have in practice two possible scenarios to enact.",4
"nci, ‘‘cancer & nanotech”, supra note .",4
"for example brownsword describes new technologies as the challenge of regulatory
public authority liability & the regulation of nanotechnology 
can introduce some regulations on the emerging technology.",4
"the regulations will
usually impose limits on the application of the technology, set out requirements
for introducing the technology to market, the conditions under which the
technology can be used (e.g.",4
"safety standards) or, in the most extreme way, they
can forbid the use of the technology.",4
"in the second scenario, policy-makers can
simply wait and observe how the new technology is going to develop.",4
"even
though policy-makers do not take any steps to establish new regulations for the
technology, the technology will usually be regulated, to some extent, by existing
legal rules.",4
"in this case the concept of ‘‘translation”, developed by lawrence
lessig, is of key importance.",4
"according to lessig’s concept, in the face of
changing technological realities, ‘‘translation” protects the meaning and restores
the original values of existing legal regulations.",4
"in some cases changing an
interpretative practice and, for example, increasing the scope of the application
of existing rules will be sufficient to deal with new technologies.",4
"moreover, the lack of legal actions from public authorities does not mean
that the use of the technology is not regulated.",4
"according to lessig, there are
four modalities that could regulate it: legal norms, social norms, markets and
‘‘architecture”.",4
"if legal regulations do not provide an adequate legal response
for the new reality created by the emerging technology, other modalities will take
the primary role.",4
"lessig claims that social norms regulate the reality and are
enforced by a community.",4
markets regulate people’s behavior by price.,4
"the last
modifier that could operate in the absence of legal regulations is ‘‘architecture”.",4
"the ‘‘architecture” of the physical world has an impact on how technology is
used.",4
"for example, it can make the application of the technology more common,
encourage people to use it and build trust in it.",4
how can these modalities be relevant to the case of nanotechnology?,4
"first of
all, the market could regulate the use of nanoproducts by their price.",4
"this would
mean that if nanoproducts are cheaper than products which do not contain
nanoparticles, people are encouraged to buy more nanoproducts.",4
"on the other
hand, if the price of nanoproducts declines too far, consumers might start
thinking of nanoproducts as being cheaper, less reliable and poorer quality
replacements of regular products.",4
"connection, see r. brownsword rights, regulation and the technological revolution
(oxford: oxford university press ).",4
"see lawrence lessig, code v.. (new york: basic books, ) at - [lessig,
code].",4
"see lawerence lessig, ‘‘the law of the horse: what cyberlaw might teach” (-
)  harv l rev  at  [lessig, ‘‘law of the horse”].",4
"the crucial element of regulating nanotechnology by social norms refers to
the level of consumers’ knowledge of this technology.",4
"a society which is well-
informed about nanoproducts can make a conscious decision and generate
norms about whether, and how, it wants to use nanoproducts.",4
the most challenging task is to apply ‘‘architecture” to nanotechnology.,4
"it
should be noted that lessig’s concept of modalities refers primarily to new
technologies with relation to cyberspace.",4
"taking into account the nature of
nanotechnology, which is a highly advanced and scientific field, and that
nanoparticles are imperceptible by the regular user, the ‘‘architecture” modality
will probably have a limited application to this technology.",4
"however, it can
apply to the physical design of nanoproducts, especially their packaging.",4
"the
package informing the user that nanomaterials are used in a production process
can encourage or discourage people to buy the nanoproduct, depending on a
current consumer fad.",4
"furthermore, the amount of safety information a label
contains can result in gaining or losing consumers’ trust in a product.",4
"all the modalities expressed by lessig could have some impact on the
manner that nanotechnology is regulated.",4
"however, their importance decreases
when we take into account the need to establish a proper level of safety for
nanoproducts, and the possibility for redress when damages are caused by
nanoproducts.",4
"neither social norms, the market, nor ‘‘architecture” can fully or
effectively regulate for product safety and ensure sufficient protection from the
risks nanotechnology involves and thus they will play minor roles.",4
"precise safety
requirements are an emerging issue related to nanotechnology.",4
"the pace of technological development and its influence on legal regulations
has induced wide-ranging and in-depth discussions among legal scholars.",4
"lyria
bennett moses makes an interesting point that instead of trying to answer how
new technologies should be regulated, one should answer how the adjustment of
the legal response to socio-technical change might be institutionally managed.",4
"bennett moses indicates that policy-makers have to find an adequate response,
not because technology itself is a problem, but because innovations create a new
socio-technical landscape with many new negative characteristics such as harm,
risks, market failures, and inequality.",4
"tony prosser identifies four rationales
for regulating technologies.",4
"these are: ) economic efficiency and market choice,
() regulation to protect rights, () regulation for social solidarity, and ()
regulation as deliberation.",4
"bennett moses explains that regulation processes
 see e.g.",4
"moses, ‘‘sociotechnical change”, ibid, at .",4
"public authority liability & the regulation of nanotechnology 
have to take into account reframing regulatory design, regulatory institutions,
regulatory timing, and regulatory responsiveness, while julia black has stressed
the role of political considerations.",4
"roger brownsword, on the other hand,
points out that technological development can have both positive and negative
impacts on the liberty of individuals.",4
"the use of some technologies might result
in the loss of liberty or contribute to the creation of a surveillance system.",4
"instead of paying attention to the normative backgrounds of technological use,
brownsword highlights the role of ‘‘technological management”, which might
practically prevent users of a technology from taking certain actions.",4
"nanotechnology is a technology in which legal regulation could play a
central role.",4
"the benefits of regulating nanotechnology could include, among
other things, the protection of its users and building public trust.",4
"research
done by the woodrow wilson international center in , titled ‘‘informed
public perceptions of nanotechnology and trust in government”, shows that
there is high demand for effective government regulation of nanotechnology.",4
"the study was carried out with groups of citizens in cleveland, dallas, and
spokane, in the usa.",4
"a majority of the participants felt that government control
beyond voluntary standards is necessary with respect to nanotechnology (%).",4

"see macoubrie, ‘‘informed public”, supra note .",4
"on the other hand, policy-makers’ actions to regulate a technology can stifle
the pace of technological development and even result in blocking further
development.",4
"for example, the way genetically modified organism (gmo)
technology has been regulated in the eu (e.g.",4
"mandatory labelling) outpaced
attention to the environmental, health, and safety implications, while other
products, such as hormones, remain less tested and monitored.",4
"the role of the
policy-maker is thus to balance the necessity of ensuring an adequate level of
protection while using nanotechnology (if the benefits outweigh the risks) to
provide more advanced research and to foster innovation.",4
"the lack of knowledge
about the long-term health effects of using nano-products causes difficulties in
establishing one precise standard that can be applied to public authorities that
are seeking to craft regulations that attempt to balance both health and safety
considerations with the creation of conditions in which innovation in the
nanotechnology area can thrive.",4
"generally, it can be claimed that the standard
should correspond to the safety level that the users are entitled to expect, based
on the current state of knowledge, but also including justified predictions.",4
"those
expectations should be assessed from the normal and prudent user’s
perspective.",4
"even though nanotechnology is usually operated by a specific
group of users (e.g.",4
"scientists, researchers), the assessment of the safety of a nano-
product should be made solely based on what a final, normal user could expect.",4
"the complexity of nanotechnology and the vast scope of its application justify
taking into account the safety expectations of the final user.",4
"it means that the
standard applied by public authorities should remain flexible and correspond to
actual problems.",4
"too strict or too expanded a regulatory legal system can also lead to
overregulation.",4
"both the users of the technology and the companies working on
the technology can be overwhelmed by the number of regulations.",4
"moreover,
when the regulations are very precise and detailed, they start losing their
flexibility, and after some time, their importance.",4
"for example, if the policy-
maker draws up a list of potential dangerous materials and provides the exact
name or chemical composition, it can quickly turn out that a substance with a
similar, but not exactly the same, chemical composition will be excluded from the
application of this regulation, even though it has dangerous features.",4
"one
solution to prevent such a situation is to create principle-based regulations,
which would be more flexible and accurate.",4

"companies) have more freedom in choosing the
methods of complying with these principles.",4
"at the same time, broad principles
are less likely to be outpaced by the passage of time and fast-changing
technological realities.",4
regulation might also be a costly process.,4
"these extra costs generated by additional
regulations are usually passed on to the consumers of the final product.",4
"when
users receive a product which meets higher standards of protection, the price of a
product will usually be higher.",4
"this means that the costs of raising a product’s
standards will be covered by the users of the technology, which at the end of the
day can result in ‘‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater.” ensuring high
quality and safety standards can lead to an increase in price to a level where
buying a product is no longer cost-effective and lucrative.",4
"users can thus make a
decision not to purchase a product, but then they will be deprived of the real
possibility of taking advantages of technological development.",4
"therefore, setting
disproportionate standards of protection can adversely affect users’ decisions.",4

to invest in further innovations.",4

"v. problems with european product liability law
so far, little attention has been devoted to the issue of liability with respect to
nanotechnology.",4
"although nanotechnology generates new risks, there is no
separate liability regime, which means that the traditional rules of existing tort
law have to be applied in the case of injuries caused by nanomaterials.",4
"from the
user’s perspective, liability rules might be as important as health and safety
regulations.",4
"this is because the safety rules are addressed mainly to the
companies, and consumers are not directly identified by such regulations.",4
"the
regulation of compensation for damages caused by products which do not meet
certain safety requirements might be thus more interesting for the users of
nanoproducts.",4
"this area is regulated by tort law, more precisely by product
liability law, and its role in connection with the development of new technologies
should primarily be users’ protection.",4
"unfortunately, existing regulations in force in the eu member states
regarding liability for damage caused by defective products, implemented under
the product liability directive, is not a fully adequate legal response to the risks
connected with nanoproducts and fails to ensure appropriate levels of safety for
users of this technology.",4
"first of all, the directive limits the scope of its application to ‘‘tangible”
goods.",4
"according to article  of the directive, ‘‘product” means all movables,
with the exception of primary agricultural products and game, even when
incorporated into another movable or into an immovable.",4
"the definition of a
‘‘product” causes some problems with respect to nanotechnology.",4
"nanomaterials
can be classified as tangible, but invisible, objects which are the components of
the product.",4
"however, nanotechnology can also be used to produce products, for
example by nanolaser; as well as possibly being a part of a service, for example
medical procedures or treatment, which are not covered by the scope of the
application of the directive.",4

)  nature communications, online: <

"secondly, legal problems are related to a notion of ‘‘defectiveness”.",4
"under
article  of the directive, a product is defective when it does not provide the
safety which a person is entitled to expect, taking all circumstances into account,
including (a) the presentation of the product, (b) the use to which it could
reasonably be expected that the product would be put, and (c) the time when the
product was put into circulation.",4
"also, a product shall not be considered
defective for the sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into
circulation.",4
"the phrase, ‘‘the safety which a person is entitled to expect”, shows
that the directive regime is based on a consumer expectation model.",4
"the crucial
element of this model, however, is the necessity that consumers are well-informed
so that they can make an informed decision as to whether or not they would like
to use nanoproducts.",4
"currently, there is no legal obligation to inform consumers
about the risks associated with the use of nanoproducts, e.g.",4
labelling issues remain controversial.,4
"marchant, douglas and abbott
introduced labelling as a discriminatory action, from the point of view of
market mechanisms, because of its stigmatization effect.",4
"similarly, juni has
pointed out the difficulties of companies in relation to the communication of the
risks.",4
"introducing new technologies can cause fear and social concerns, and run
into resistance against their use.",4
"in many cases this anxiety is unsupported and
based solely on the fear of novelty.",4
"it often results from false, selective, or
misinterpreted information about a new technology, as well as conflicting reports
from the science world, ‘‘media storm”, and groups of opponents.",4
"an example of
distrust in technological development might be the example of the ‘‘anti-vax”
movement emerging in europe and north america.",4
"this movement originates
from an article of dr. andrew wakefield published in the the lancet in .",4
"according to wakefield’s research,  of  children brought by their parents to a
hospital in london exhibited symptoms of autism within  days after mmr
vaccination (measles, mumps and rubella).",4

experts and finally it turned out that in an examined group there was only one
case of autism symptoms, which appeared a few months after the vaccination.",4
"dr. wakefield was removed from the register of professional medical
practitioners and  years after it was published, his article was withdrawn
from the journal.",4

the stigmatization effect can also be seen in case of gmos.",4
"although new
technologies are usually introduced to the market under the assumption that they
will be beneficial and bring improvement to existing technologies, they are
sometimes rejected by the potential users for above mentioned reasons.",4
"in that
case, labelling can magnify the effect of distrust and resistance, which can be seen
in the social approach to gmo in the eu.",4
"the eu selectively targets products
which are made through gm processes, although there is no evidence that proves
that these processes are riskier than other methods of processing food.",4
"/ concerning the traceability and labelling of
genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products
produced from genetically modified organisms, gmo products are subject to
strict labelling and traceability, even though researchers are in agreement that
gmo food products are not more hazardous than the non-gmo food, and are
actually even safer.",4
"consumers are more aware of the existence of gmo food,
but on the other hand they are not informed about hormones for example, which
are less monitored, and at the end of the day consumers could make a biased
decision.",4
"nonetheless, to some extent, labelling can be beneficial.",4
"first, since users do
not know that the product contains nanomaterials, they have a limited ability to
benefit, for example, from the protection provided by tort law.",4
"accurate
information enables users to make an informed decision about whether they
want to use potentially dangerous technology and expose themselves to the
possibility of harm.",4
"apart from labelling, users could also be informed about risks by the media
or public campaigns.",4
"according to howells, if risks are known and users are
informed, the matter of defectiveness depends on whether the risks are socially
acceptable.",4
"greater risk will probably be more acceptable in the area of
medicine and pharmaceuticals, where the risk could bring considerable
improvement, rather than in the cosmetics or entertainment industry.",4

liable if he proves that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time
when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence
of the defect to be discovered.",4
"this defence is especially favourable to those
producers who use new technological processes, the consequences of which are
difficult to predict.",4
"the existing legal framework demands that companies make
a reasonable decision based on data and research available only when the

with nanoproducts is that currently, the risks and negative effects on the human
body and the environment are mostly unknown.",4

producers being able to easily free themselves from responsibility.",4
"the existing
regulations also create an incentive to put products on the market carelessly and
to do less research ahead of time.",4

"under article () of the
directive, the rights conferred upon the injured person to claim for compensation
shall be extinguished upon the expiry of a period of  years from the date on
which the producer put into circulation the product which caused the damage.",4
"taking into account that the detrimental effects of nanotechnology applications
might not present themselves for a long period of time, a -year limitation
period from the date on which the producer put the product into circulation
seems to be insufficient.",4
"more general problems with the existing legal framework of product liability,
related not only to nanotechnology, are concerned with how to assign
responsibility for damage, establish causal links, and define the scope of the
damage to be repaired.",4
"legal response: public authority liability
given the aforementioned problems, the constantly expanding scope of the
application of nanotechnology, and the increasing degree of risks, the discussion
on regulating liability for damage caused by nanoproducts is urgent.",4
"the
regulations presently in force for eu members under the product liability
directive fail to ensure appropriate levels of safety for users of nanoproducts.",4

a result, users are deprived of full tort law protection, and in some cases of
damage caused by nanoproducts, they will not be able to obtain compensation.",4

nanotechnology’s users in obtaining compensation.",4
"the proposal goes beyond
the traditional concept of a product liability regime and concentrates not on
product liability itself, but on a public authority liability focused on the case of
the non-regulation, or improper regulation, of nanotechnology.
. justifying regulation of public authority liability
one may ask why policy-makers should be liable for taking any regulatory
action.",4
"the decision on whether or not to regulate a new technology depends
almost entirely on the vision of a particular policy-maker.",4
"regulations are
supposed to reflect the societal interactions and needs, as well as attitudes,
existing in a society which usually expresses traditional, regional and cultural
diversity.",4
"policy-makers have the freedom to make decisions concerning the
scope and form of regulations.",4
"this can help explain why gmo technology is
regulated differently in the us and the eu.",4
"one of the concerns around regulating for public authority liability with
respect to new technologies is the excessive burden this would place on public
authorities to foresee the effects of the legislative solutions that are adopted.",4
"this leads to the more fundamental question of who should bear the risk of
regulatory policy, and why.",4
"first, it seems justifiable to assume that public
authorities should be aware of the consequences of their decisions.",4
"the policy-makers’
decision also has an impact on whether and how technology will be used by
companies, and how products will be introduced to the market.",4
"companies thus
rely on legal regulation and adjust their production processes to the existing legal
framework.",4
"on the other hand, there is a threat that the users will bear all the
costs of introducing technology to the market.",4
"it is clear that policy-makers are also the risk-taking actors when introducing
new technologies into public use.",4
"in the discussion on the role of government in
the innovation industry, one may find opinions such as the following, that:
governments have always been lousy at picking winners, and they are
likely to become more so, as legions of entrepreneurs and tinkerers
swap designs online, turn them into products at home and market them
globally from a garage.",4

netherlands: wolters kluwer, ) at - [biondi & farley].",4
"stick to the basics: better schools for a skilled workforce, clear rules and
a level playing field for enterprises of all kinds.",4
"leave the rest to the
revolutionaries.",4
"to challenge this opinion mariana mazzucato puts a simple but relevant
question: who actually funded these revolutionaries?",4
"taking as an example the
smartphone’s features such as internet connectivity, gps, touchscreen, and
microchip, one must notice that they were all funded by governments, which
often make decisions on commercialization policy.",4
"although the opinion that all
innovations flourish thanks to government action is exaggerated, one has to
notice that policy-makers can have a real impact on the technological reality.",4
"while mazzucato stops her arguments at proving why the government is an
active actor on the innovation field, thus explaining why companies should
contribute to public funds, it is possible to go a step further.",4
"the contribution of
public authorities to technological development can support the liability they
should bear for their policy decisions.",4
"the next argument for regulating public authority liability is that it can
create incentives for policy-makers to take more effective and more
precautionary actions in order to ensure adequate levels of user protection.",4
"before making a legally binding decision on a regulatory policy, policy-makers
can, for example, commission more research on the potentially detrimental
effects of the technology to be regulated.",4
"liability for damages arising from the exercise of public authority can thus
influence the effective exercise of power.",4
"although the functioning of the public
authority is not subject to basic economic assumptions, such as the assumption
of maximizing profits, public authority liability can create incentives for policy-
makers.
. legal basis for regulation
generally, to ensure an appropriate level of protection, there are other legal
concepts to be applied.",4
"however, none of them separately represent a sufficient
legal response to the challenges posed by nanotechnology.",4
"one solution is to reconsider the existing legal framework of product liability
rules based on the directive, so that it can fully cover all injuries caused by
nanotechnology.",4
"in other words, the regulation of product liability could be
tightened for producers.",4

regulation on product liability, the major one is the risk of hindering
technological development and innovation.",4
"over-regulating product liability
rules can prevent companies from investing in further progress and research in
nanotechnology.",4
"it might be more profitable for the companies to use tested
and better-known techniques rather than applying innovations which could
expose them to the risk of paying high compensation.",4
"what is more, from an
economic perspective, the higher costs of production resulting from overly strict
legal requirements, or the more serious and real possibility of paying monetary
compensation, are often passed on to consumers.",4
"at the end of the day,
consumers would have to bear the costs of ensuring an adequate level of
protection.",4
"the other solution for balancing health and environmental risks against the
commercialization of nanotechnology, which was proposed in the literature,
concerns mandatory private-public insurance schemes.",4
"so far, private-public
insurance programs are typically applied to nuclear damage, where there is on
the one hand low-probability, but on the other, high-loss.",4
"according to
maksim rakhlin, private-public insurance could cover nanotechnology if the
elements were as follows: ‘‘() mandatory participation as a precondition to
research and development, () creation of a cross-insurer pool of premiums and
deductibles to use for claimant payouts, () federal government coverage of
losses exceeding coverage provided by a cross-insurer pool, and ()
indemnification from tort liability of program participants.” in spite of the
fact that public-private insurance could possibly balance the risks posed by
nanotechnology applications and the need for commercialization of
nanomaterials and further technological development, this solution has certain
shortcomings.",4
"first, it does not create incentives for government to introduce
effective and well-balanced regulations.",4
"it also does not involve public
authorities in the innovation process.",4
"second, it affects companies directly by
increasing the price of market participation.",4
"it means that smaller companies

"could be excluded from the market and at the same time consumers may bear the
additional costs.",4
"next, existing legal regulations around public authority liability are not an
adequate solution to tackle the problems related to nanotechnology.",4
"the liability
that the eu, as an entity with a legal personality, bears for damage caused by its
institutions or by its servants in the performance of their duties, found in article
() treaty on the functioning of the eu(tfeu), gives an illustrative
example.",4
"according to article ()(f) tfeu, consumer protection is one of the
areas where the eu and the member states share their competencies, which
means that eu institutions can regulate nanotechnology from the perspective of
consumer protection.",4
"in the first place, it should be noted that article () tfeu does not
provide the specific prerequisites of liability, which are to be determined on the
basis of the general principles common to the member states.",4
"the formulation of
the conditions of non-contractual liability lies with the court of justice of the
european union (cjeu), which is the only body that is competent to adjudicate
complaints for damages.",4
there is uncertainty around this provision.,4
"both the
general formulation of article () tfeu and the diversification of liability
rules in the member states result in the cjeu having wide discretion in setting
the rules for claiming damages.",4
"to some extent, this generality could be treated
as an advantage, as it creates flexibility.",4
"however, cjeu judgments in many
cases are inconsistent, often devoid of plausible justification, and the accepted
jurisprudence is often not continued in subsequent cases.",4
"as a consequence, the
liability of the eu is not predictable and cannot fully secure consumers’ rights
with respect to nanotechnology.",4
"the cjeu formulates four conditions of liability for damages of the eu:
infringement of the rule of law intended to confer rights on individuals,
sufficiently serious breach, actual and certain damage, and direct causal link.",4
"the lack of presumptions for any of the conditions hinders fulfilling and proving
all the requirements.",4
"an interesting example with respect to the difficulties of proving causation is
the case, é.r.",4

by them as a consequence of the infection and subsequent death of members of
their families who developed a new variant of creutzfeldt-jakob disease (‘‘mad

cow disease”).",4
"the applicants brought actions for damages against the eu for
allegedly unlawful conduct in failing to adopt appropriate measures to prevent
the risks presented by ‘‘mad cow disease”.",4
"the probable origin of the disease was
a change in the preparation of cattle feed, which contained proteins derived from
sheep infected with scrapie.",4
"transmission of the disease came about mainly
through the ingestion of feed, in particular, meat-and-bone meal containing the
infectious agent that had not been eliminated.",4
"the applicants contended that
the european council and european commission persistently and deliberately
favoured the interests of traders on the market in beef and veal to the detriment
of the health of consumers when they assessed and managed the risks linked to
the disease.",4
"the applicants claimed that there were wrongful omissions on the
part of those institutions in carrying out their duties and obligations in the area
of animal and human health and that they adopted insufficient, incorrect,
inadequate or belated standards and measures to deal with the risks resulting
from ‘‘mad cow disease”.",4
"the court concluded that the allegedly unlawful
actions and omissions of the council and the commission cannot be considered
to be a definite and direct cause of the infection.",4
"in the light of the circumstances
of the case, the court stated that it had not been shown that if those institutions
had adopted, or had adopted earlier, the measures which the applicants criticized
them for not adopting, the damage in question would not have occurred.",4
"as a
result, the court concluded that there was no causal link between the damage
pleaded and the allegedly unlawful conduct by the eu institutions.",4
the next problem is related to the limitation period.,4
"according to article 
of the statute of the court of justice of the european union, proceedings
against the eu in matters arising from non-contractual liability shall be barred
after a period of five years from the occurrence of the event giving rise thereto.",4
the formula of limitation can drastically limit the possibility of claiming redress.,4
"first, the beginning of the limitation period is counted from the materialization
of the damage, not from the moment of awareness of the damage.",4
"second,
there is no detailed regulation addressing postponement, which would facilitate a
significant extension of the running of the limitation period.",4
"article  tfeu, supra note , states that the statute of the court of justice of the
european union shall be laid down in a separate protocol.",4
"see case /, stanley george adams v commission of the european communities,
[] ecr .",4
"the adams case has been widely discussed in the literature, see e.g.",4
"see p. oliver, ‘‘limitation of actions before the europeancourt” ()  eur lrev .",4
"therefore, the existing regulation on eu liability might not be a
sufficient legal response.
. regulation as the best form of action?",4
"as mentioned in part iv, the non-legal regulatory mechanisms on their own,
which are the market, social norms and ‘‘architecture”, cannot guarantee a
sufficient level of protection with respect to the nanotechnology phenomenon.",4
"the arguments discussed in part iv remain relevant while analyzing the public
authority problem.",4
"it should be noted that the liability for damage caused by acts or omissions
committed by a public authority is a common principle in european legal
systems.",4
"the lack of regulation or regulations providing an inaccurate
response to the risks created by nanotechnology results in law losing its function
as a regulatory mechanism for social relations.",4
"however, there are some
problems related to public authority liability.",4
"the uncertainty in determining the
proper standard of care is a challenge, and could cause liability to be blurred, or
create ineffective stimuli.",4
"where liability is imposed excessively, a decreased level
of activity on the part of authorities could result.",4
"conversely, if liability is
excessively tempered, an increase in the abuse of authority could result.",4
"secondly, liability will have an impact in terms of the costs of indemnification.",4
"public authorities paying compensation may also lead to a deterioration in state
budgets and increase the fiscal burden imposed on citizens.",4
"however, in the case of public authority liability, the
scope of regulation will be restricted to a defined political area.",4
"first, the
development of non-contractual liability is to a great degree different in
individual countries.",4
"second, public authority liability will refer by nature to a
particular policy-maker.",4
"it means that the central point is to define the policy-
maker that has made a legally binding decision on nanotechnology.",4
"it could
make a significant difference when the same area of law can be regulated by
different bodies.",4
"for example, consumer protection is one of the areas where the
european union and the member states share their competencies.",4
"see biondi & farley, supra note  at .",4
"public authority liability & the regulation of nanotechnology 
.",4
do the benefits of regulation justify the costs?,4
"undoubtedly, any regulation will create some costs.",4
"as noted above, in the
case of public authority liability these are mainly the costs of the compensatory
process.",4
"however, the proposed solution does not affect companies directly, so it
will probably not hinder technological development, which is always a serious
concern when regulating technologies.",4
"the government, on the other hand, will
not be left alone with the burden of the compensatory process if a general
‘‘innovation fund” is created.",4
"companies will thus contribute to the
compensatory process and public authorities will not have look for additional
funding, for example, in the form of a tax increase.",4
"owing to this regulation,
users will receive a mechanism to recover their losses, which means that they will
not bear all the costs of introducing technology to the market alone, and
therefore the benefits of regulation will justify the costs.
. transparency of the distribution of effects across society
one factor that policy-makers should take into account while drafting any
new regulation, is to assess the impact of the regulation on society, including
different social groups.",4
"this is a general and universal goal of regulatory
transparency.",4
"the riskier a technology is, the greater the effort policy-makers
should undertake to create transparent regulations related to public health and
the environment.",4
"on the one hand, transparency ensures that no groups will be
excluded from protection or be unjustifiably affected.",4
"on the other, it should
enable technology users a choice between the various possible technological
options.",4
"the necessity of transparency was also pointed out by the european
commission in , when the commission stressed that the decision of
whether or not wait for more scientific data before taking steps towards
regulating emerging technology should be based on transparency.",4
"see european commission, communication from the commission on the precautionary
principle (com//), online: <
txt/html/?uri=celex:dc&from=en> [ec precautionary princi-
ple].",4
"see european parliament, resolution on the commission communication on the
precautionary principle (com()  - c-/ - /(cos)) [european
parliament resolution].",4
"community for their expertise in the field concerned, and appointed by means of
a transparent procedure.",4
"this proposal on public authority liability promotes the position of
consumers, taking into account that consumers are directly vulnerable to the

that a new product or technology might be potentially dangerous for its users.",4
"according to the european commission, the lack of scientific proof of the
detrimental effects of using new technologies cannot be used to justify inaction.",4
"all scientific advice and views should be taken into account, even if they
represent a minor fraction of the scientific community.",4
"without a balanced decision-making process, the most convenient and
easiest solution would be either a complete ban on nanoproducts production,

regulating nanotechnology at all, because of a lack of sufficient knowledge.",4
"those solutions seem unrealistic, impractical, and would be contrary not only to
market rules but also to societal needs.",4
"to protect companies and businesses from the threat of the overregulation of
new technology, it is important to consider the right of companies to claim for
compensation if the regulations are too tight.",4

the court of justice stated that if the concept of liability without fault were

.",4
". . comparative examination of the member states’ legal systems
enabled the court to make at a very early stage the finding concerning
convergence of those legal systems in the establishment of a principle of
liability in the case of unlawful action or an unlawful omission of the
authority, including of a legislative nature, that is in no way the
position as regards the possible existence of a principle of liability in the
case of a lawful act or omission of the public authorities, in particular
where it is of a legislative nature”.",4
"the court of justice also stressed that the legislative context is characterized
by the exercise of wide discretion, which is essential for implementing
community policy.",4
"therefore, the community cannot incur liability unless the
institution concerned has manifestly and gravely disregarded the limits on the
exercise of its powers.",4
"it means that the wide scope of legislative freedom is
crucial for the making of eu policy decisions and thus the existing legal rules
would probably not cover the case of the overregulation of nanotechnology if
injured companies are limited to compensation only in the case of unlawfulness.",4
"although the court of justice rejects liability for lawful acts, there are certain
arguments in favour of this solution.",4
"such regulation will provide the aggrieved
parties with compensatory damages suffered in connection with the use of
nanotechnology, when it is not possible to obtain compensation directly from a
producer (e.g.",4

. presenting views by stakeholders
recent research shows that the public expects the government to take
regulatory steps in the area of nanotechnology, which means that the voice of
the users of nanotechnology is important in the debate on nanotechnology.",4
"at
the same time, the companies using nanomaterials might be interested in
imposing public authority liability, as legal regulatory acts influence business
decisions including the necessity of adjusting production processes in line with
established requirements.",4

should take into account the views of all stakeholders, for example, through
public debates, or by hearing from groups of experts working on
nanotechnology.",4

public and expert debate, might be socially destructive.",4

is regulated in the treaty of the functioning of the european union and by the
decisions of the cjeu.",4
"public authority liability in the case of nanotechnology would remain a part
of the tort law system.",4
"one may, however, pose the question as to whether public
authority liability should cover only nanotechnology and exclude other emerging
technologies.",4
"while it is true that nanotechnology is used widely in everyday
products and its long-term consequences are still unknown, it has to be noted
that many other products pose considerable challenges for regulatory decisions

of unknown technological processes is growing, there will probably be more and
more examples of technologies, such as genetic engineering, causing similar
problems.",4

public authority liability thus seems unjustified and impractical.",4

the producer of nanoproducts.",4
"if the infringed party does not receive

claim for compensation from the public authority.",4

"public authority liability & the regulation of nanotechnology 
compensation from the company, s/he will not have a right to sue the public
authority.",4
"the claim against the public authorities, however, could be a recourse
claim, meaning if the company provided the compensation and the injury is the
result of inadequate regulatory measures, the company could make a claim in
restitution for the public authority to return the previously paid compensation.",4
"furthermore, with regard to nanotechnology, subjectively understood fault
should be replaced with objective criteria such as the infringement of the legal
rules and/or precautionary principles, and move from fault-based liability to
strict liability.",4
"in extreme cases, when the damage is unpredictable and has
enormous scope, compensation should be granted even if the actions of public
authorities were lawful.",4
the next element is that of causal link.,4
"case, proof of a
direct causal link can be a serious obstacle when seeking compensation.",4
"furthermore, european law contains a general principle that the party which
makes a claim bears the burden of proof regarding that claim.",4
"this is also
applicable to a defence.",4
"in the case of nanotechnology, the injured party
usually does not have a real possibility of gathering all the detailed information
on the causal link or exact source of damage.",4
"creating presumptions or changing
the burden of proof will mitigate the barriers posed by the current process of
proving causality.",4
"this would mean that the policy-maker will have to prove that
it has not infringed precautionary principles.",4
"with this change in the burden of
proof, the injured party will receive a real chance of obtaining compensation.",4
"taking into account the fact that the long-term consequences of
nanotechnology are mostly unknown, the limitation period plays an important
role in regulating public authority liability.",4
"the length of the limitation period in
the case of the eu liability is now five years from the moment of the event giving
rise to liability.",4
"the court of justice’s case-law indicates that the length of that
period has been determined from the perspective of the necessary amount of time
that the aggrieved party needs in order to collect the relevant information in
order to submit a claim, and to review the facts that are to be invoked in support
of that claim.",4

nanotechnology.",4
"unknown long-term consequences justify the proposal of
starting the limitation period from the time of an injured party’s knowledge

primary objective of the limitation period concept is the more general protection
of the interests of the tortfeasor.",4
"in conjunction with the fact that claims for damages against a public
authority can involve a financial burden on the public authority and thus the
state, the limitation period in the case of public authority liability is directly
associated with the necessity of solicitude about public finances.",4

limitation period thus allows the state to protect its finances from the demands
of individuals who have not displayed the necessary diligence and failed to take
advantage of their rights in the time provided.",4

counting from the time of knowledge about the source of damage seems an
appropriate balance.",4

of indemnification procedures will be incurred by citizens, it is necessary to create
a mechanism, which will separate payment of compensation by public authorities

financial burden to the private sector.",4

appropriate, as the companies are those parties which make the most profits.",4

"the second
function performed by this fund would be the contribution to further
technological development, first by subsidizing further research and also by
ordering additional research.",4

from an insurance scheme.",4

on development (activities ‘‘close to the market”) decrease the expenditures for
development activities.",4

mechanism for supporting r&d.",4

clusters, a new technology linkage model is being proposed as an analytical framework (figure ) to 
illustrate a possible scenario of technology linkages in different scientific disciplines and technology 
domains.",4
"the proposed model assumes that the nanotechnology field is diffused among different 
scientific areas and technology domains.",4
"as such, it is to be expected that there are linkages within the 
same discipline or across disciplines with some particular patents.",4
"moreover, one can assume there 
will be diffusion in terms of patent usage in some applications as they may require multiple patents 
from different patent owners.",4
"figure  makes use of various components and sub-components to 
illustrate a possible scenario of technological development in multidisciplinary fields such as 
nanotechnology and biotechnology.",4
"accordingly, it can be assumed that fundamental research in any 
scientific field leads to an opportunity of having applied research that results in patents and 
commercial applications.",4
this new technological progress forms a technological domain (e.g.,4
"materials, electronics) that will be linked to a certain field such as chemistry.",4
"in the nanotechnology 
area, these technological advances are not unidirectional but a combination of research efforts in 
different scientific fields and technological domains.",4
"looking at patent clusters and how they are 
linked, it is possible to identify which fields and technological domains are linked to each other.",4
"analysis of prevalent patent clusters and their linkages will reveal key technologies and their linkage 
mechanisms in the nanotechnology field.",4
"[insert figure  here] 
the nanotechnology field is one of the key areas for collaboration-related studies due to its intense 
level of research participation across disciplines and sectors and its involvement of various actors.",4
"the 
complex task of integrating different disciplines and fields involves creating new business structures, 
new management models and new systems.",4
"therefore, it requires new systems to enable these 
changes and hybrid individuals that can fulfil the requirements of different fields.",4
"considering the 
research nature and characteristics of the nanotechnology field, it appears to be essential to conduct 
in-depth research in this area to throw light on the above issues.",4
"research design 
patent analyses have been used extensively in research for a number of purposes including 
identification of new technology opportunities (lee et al., ), technology networks and diffusion 
(goetze, ; cheng, ) and forecasting technologies (daim et al., ).",4
"compared with the 
majority of quantitative methods in business studies, patent data mining studies are less frequent and 
it is still a developing field.",4
"moreover, many nanotechnology-related patent studies only started 
emerging from the late s and the beginning of this millennium, so this is an important area to 
 
 
work on.",4
"this research applies a tech-mining method (porter and cunningham, ) which has had a 
significant impact on the analysis of technology dynamics.",4
"the outline of the research design is 
shown in table .",4
"the data for this study was retrieved from the thomson innovation database and 
analysed using the tech-mining software thomson data analyser (tda), which automates mining 
and clustering of terms occurring in patent abstracts and descriptors according to authors, affiliations 
or keywords that it recommends.",4
"the tda allows the analysis of patent data and their visualisation in 
many ways, such as cleaning the data of duplicates or unnecessary items, mapping, clustering, co-
occurrence, factor analysis and citation networks.",4
"after collecting the patent dataset, there are still 
certain steps which need to be taken to optimise the data, for example, eliminating duplicates by 
obtaining patent data with the dwpi (derwent patent index) and preparing categories and groups for 
analysis.",4
"for this, the tda is used as it performs 
multidimensional statistical analysis to identify clusters and relationships among nodes.",4
"each cluster 
is represented by nodes, the size of a node representing the number of patent documents that belongs 
to it, while its centrality represents how often that particular node occurs with other nodes.",4
"the 
closeness of nodes and their thicknesses are calculated on the basis of the significance and 
interrelationship level between each node, which in turn is calculated on the basis of how many of 
those documents belong to the node and how many of those documents are shared.",4
"in addition to the tda, another offering of thomson innovation called the themescape tool can be 
used.",4
"themescape extracts text terms from a set of patent records and generates a topological map 
showing the frequency of a term’s occurrence as apparent peaks on a geographical island.",4
"themescape was used to map key technologies and allowed the categorisation of documents 
containing similar content, as they were placed near each other on the map.",4
"the density of documents 
can be indicated with tall or small peaks and the distance between peaks sheds light on the 
relationship between content, as peaks that are located closer to each other have more closely related 
content than peaks that are located farther away.",4
"contour lines indicate relative document density and 
by using the tool it is possible to zoom in on a specific area whereby new contours, labels and 
documents can be revealed.",4
this research also maps the profile of the nanotechnological competencies for nations.,4
"the patent data 
were converted to calculate the relative technological advantages of regions in nanotechnology.",4
"the 
revealed technological advantage (rta) index (cantwell, ; patel and pavitt, ; oecd, 
) provides an indication of the relative specialisation of a given country in selected technological 
domains.",4
"a value above  indicates relative strength and a value less than  indicates relative 
 
 
weakness.",4
"the regions of high share and high rta can be interpreted as being countries with a 
relatively strong share in the technology pole (i.e.",4
"relative importance to competencies in 
nanotechnology) and having distinctive advantages nationally.",4
"the region of low share and low rta 
reveals countries allocating relatively fewer resources to technology or science and having less 
distinctive advantages nationally.",4
"it is to be noted that the value of the benchmark share in the x-axis 
is difficult to identify and varies depending on various dimensions such as the countries or region 
considered, innovation process analysed, national requirements etc.",4
"in this case, a break-even share 
has been chosen in order to accommodate all countries in such a way that a proper comparison of their 
technological or innovation performance can be made.",4
"therefore, in this analysis, what matters is the 
direction of movement and comparative positions rather than absolute positions.",4
"one of the biggest challenges in a patent analysis is to gather required patent data by selecting the 
appropriate search terms so that the data set includes the relevant patents and excludes unnecessary 
patents, thus increasing the validity of the research.",4
"this study offers a more effective method with an 
improved patent search query which uses a combination of both patent classifications and lexical 
queries to exclude unrelated patents.",4
"considering the limitations and drawbacks of existing patent 
data collection approaches the following search approach and terms were used: 
(aioe=(b*) or fic=(b*) or ucc=(*)) and alld=(nano* or quantum* or qdot or qubit 
or atom* or probe or epitax* or fullerene* or thin adj wire* or thin adj film* or buckyball* or

optimisation for the period of –.",4
"the optimised data were imported into the tda to validate 
the results further.",4
"duplicate results were eliminated and variations of company, inventor, institutes 
and university names were unified where they appeared as separate patent assignees.",4

"the benefit of this section is to show where 
 
 
academia’s, industry’s or inventors’ foci are in terms of technological domains.",4
"table  illustrates the 
extent to which academic, industrial and sole-inventor involvement differs by country.",4
"in the us, 
japan, germany and the uk, corporate actors have a greater involvement than academic 
organisations.",4
"this is mainly due to the presence in these regions of large corporate players with an 
interest in patenting their technologies.",4
"another reason why patenting activity is predominantly 
business driven in these countries is that they are host to the world’s largest electronics corporations 
(such as ibm in the us and nec in japan), which perceive themselves as having a significant vested 
interest in nanotechnological applications.",4
"in china, russia and taiwan, academic institutions are more heavily involved than their corporate 
counterparts, an unexpected outcome given the nature of their patenting activities.",4
"these results have 
been combined with interview analyses in order to understand why these three countries have higher 
levels of academic involvement.",4
"in china’s case, interviews with key experts in the chinese academy 
of sciences and tsinghua university were conducted and it was found that this is mainly due to state 
policy on funding: academia is allotted the largest funding share and there are relatively few sources 
of funding made available for academic-industrial collaborations.",4
"in addition, china’s patenting 
system is politically driven and gives considerable support and motivation to academia to file patents.",4
"patent filing is closely linked to promotion, the award of bonuses and further research grants, and is 
prioritised over publications.",4
"[insert table  here] 
 
in this section, patent classifications are used to examine academic, corporate and inventor 
involvement and to discover in which technologies they are highly concentrated.",4

while the significant patent share is held by industrial players, as is to be expected, academic 
involvement is still noteworthy.",4

v-aa (semiconductor laser), u-eb (semiconductor body with quantum wire, wells, super-
lattices) and u-cj (semiconductor materials and processing, strained layers and their 
 
 
manufacture).",4
"accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that nanotechnology inventions with 
semiconductor materials and applications are relatively mature compared to other nanotechnologies.",4
"looking at the emerging technologies, a-w (polymer applications with nanotechnology) appears 
to be the most rapidly developing technology area in this field, as in  there were only  patent 
records while this increased to , records in the peak year of  (see figure ).",4
"moreover,

gradually increased to  patents in its peak year of .",4
"between  and , the number of

professor fan shoushan was interviewed to help elucidate the findings of this research even further.",4
"a successful example can be given to show how an interlinked activity is turned into a commercial 
product through the efforts of both parties (a linkage between tsinghua university and foxconn).",4
"since nanotubes were first invented, tsinghua university has gained the capability of controlling the 
growth of cnts and of transferring cnts into long films in mwcnts (multi-walled carbon 
nanotubes).",4
"cnt thin films are used to produce touch screen appliances that replace formerly used 
materials like indium tin oxide (ito).",4

light emitting diodes) to make screens flexible.",4

. themescape illustration of nanotechnology linkages and clusters 
in our proposed model as shown in figure , it was assumed that there would be linkages within the 
same discipline or across disciplines, within their technological domains and their fields, and that 
there would be diffusion from one to the other.",4
"an examination of patents clusters shows which fields 
and technological domains are linked to each other.",4
"using the themescape mapping tool,  the key 
technology terms are mapped for all the nanotechnology patents available (figure ),  the density of 
technology terms is indicated topographically, and the distance between peaks throws light on the 
relationship between content as peaks that are located closer to each other have more closely related 
content than peaks that are located farther away.",4
"overall, it is possible to see which domains have 
significant relevance within the nanotechnology field.",4
"an example is the linkage between the 
nanotube-nanowire polymers and the cluster of nanowire-semiconductor-optical applications, which 
identifies a nanoelectronics domain.",4
"by using the themescape illustration, some of the dominant 
domains become very apparent and this leads to the identification of general fields such as chemical 
science (powders-nanoparticle-aqueous), optoelectronics (semiconductors-laser-quantum dots), 
biotechnology (protein-molecules-nanoparticles), and nanotools (probe-microscope-scanning).",4
"the 
themescape map (figure ) provides support for the framework proposed in figure  regarding 
technological linkages.",4
"as shown in figure , the technological linkages between patenting clusters and the volume of these 
linked patents can be seen by the contour height between each technological field.",4
"nanotube, polymer 
and semiconductor terms appear together in one of the highest peaks, which indicate the dominant 
field of a high number of content availability within each technology and the strong relationship 
between them.",4
"it can be predicted that nanotubes, semiconductors and polymers have the potential to 
be key materials under the nanotechnology umbrella in various sectors and most importantly in the 
electronics field, where they increase the efficiency of materials in many ways such as by increasing 
the mobility and reliability of electrical properties of circuits.",4
"it has been found that random arrays of 
nanotubes can form semiconducting and conducting networks.",4
"commonly, single-walled carbon 
nanotubes are used with polymer semiconductors in this kind of application.",4
"some of the applicability 
of these materials in the industry is in display technologies, storage devices, sensors and printed 
electronics.",4
"at present, the scientific endeavour is to make carbon nanotubes a practical option for 
transistors in microprocessors and other electronics.",4
"this is one of the reasons why large 
establishments in the electronics industry such as samsung, foxconn and nec are seriously investing 
in these nanomaterials, as the patents granted in this area are likely to become one of the key 
competitive advantages in the future.",4
"in relation to relative applicability of nanostructures, it can be seen that nanowires and carbon 
nanotubes have conjoint applicability.",4
"we also looked at why nanotubes, nanowires and 
semiconductors appear together on the themescape map.",4
"nanowires are wires at nanoscale and 
 
 
consequently are very thin structures.",4
"scientists hope to use them to build tiny transistors for 
computer chips and other electronic devices.",4
"by arranging semiconductor wires in 
the right configuration, it is possible to create nanotransistors which can act as switches or amplifiers.",4
"also, they can be used as logic gates (and, or and not gates) in semiconductor nanowire 
crossings.",4
"the nanostructures that can be made from nanowires can be used to build a nanocircuit 
with the help of carbon nanotubes, for example, with nanotube-based transistors (cntfet).",4
"yet 
again, this is a field in which large electronics companies are conducting research and attempting to 
gain key patents.",4
"regional nanotechnology competencies 
the data was converted to calculate regional advantages in nanotechnology as it is preferable to 
compare these on a relative rather than absolute basis.",4
"this transformation has been widely adopted in 
recent works on comparative technological developments at both country and sector level (cantwell, 
; patel and pavitt, ; islam and miyazaki, ).",4
"the dynamic changes in the comparative 
positions of different regions are identified for categorising the technological competencies of firms in 
the science and technology poles.",4
"as illustrated in figure , the x-axis represents the share of patent 
activities in the technology pole and the y-axis indicates the revealed technological advantage 
(rta) of countries, which enables the measurement of the comparative advantage of scientific and 
technological strength.",4
"the results indicate that the us maintains its high share in the technology pole and a high rta zone 
in all periods (above % patent share), revealing its strong competitiveness in the relevant 
technology field (see figure ).",4
"on the other hand, the japanese position in the technology 
competencies moved from a high share and high rta zone in the – period towards a 
significant low share and low rta zone in the – period.",4
"the japanese contribution in the 
nanotechnology field was substantial (%), comparable to the us, in the early s and then it 
slowly declined to around % in –.",4
"this indicates that relative to other regions, the 
nanotechnological competencies of japan had atrophied in the mid-s and have fallen behind in 
recent years.",4
a similar trend was observed in the case of top european players (e.g.,4
the decline in rta in this case may be due to the entry of asian rivals.,4
"by contrast, asian countries’ trajectories are moving in the opposite direction to that of japan and 
europe.",4
"the top regional players exponentially improved their position in the early s, which may 
 
 
be due to their actors’ initiatives and policies to push nanotechnology into potential sectors.",4
"countries 
such as south korea and china (and russia) gained substantial strength in nanotechnological 
competencies in the – periods.",4
"our rta analysis indicates that the asian giants’ 
nanotechnology competencies have been focused on, and directed towards, the production of 
nanomaterials and their applications in nanotechnology-based products.",4
"it seems china is the most 
likely candidate for achieving parity with advanced countries.",4
"within public infrastructures, several 
grassroots organisations are sprouting up to take advantage of nanotechnology.",4
"it is very interesting to 
see that, in their nanotechnology pole, the development of the asian players is exponential in nature.",4
"the analysis reveals learning patterns of technology and innovation structures for the technology 
pole from a comparative evolutionary perspective.",4

 discussion 
the motivation to conduct this research is the increasing pace of nanotechnology development and 
diffusion worldwide.",4
"the main output of this research is in the area of nanotechnological dynamics 
focusing on the technology clusters and their linkages, involvement of academia’s and industry’s foci 
in terms of technological domains, and a comparison of regional competence building.",4
"in this paper, a 
new linkage model is proposed which assumes that this field is diffused among different technology 
domains, which in turn reflects the linkages within the same disciplinary fields or across disciplines.",4
"as such, the study of nanotechnological linkages has presented novel and highly informative results in 
terms of interrelationships within the field in comparison to previous studies.",4
"by using the 
themescape tool, specific nanotechnology-related terms were analysed to identify the dominant 
technology clusters and to see how technology linkages are formed, their intensities and their various 
usages.",4
"it can be seen which domains have significant relevance within the nanotechnology field, for 
example, the linkage between the cluster of nanotubes-nanowires-polymers and the cluster of 
nanowire-semiconductor-optical applications identifies a nanoelectronics domain.",4
"some of the 
dominant domains become very apparent and this leads to the identification of general fields such as 
chemical science (powders-nanoparticle-aqueous), optoelectronics (semiconductors-laser-quantum 
dots), biotechnology (protein-molecules-nanoparticles), and nanotools (probe-microscope-scanning).",4
"the involvement of academia is found to be more dominant than corporate actors in china and 
russia, as academia has been given a greater funding share.",4
"with respect to the involvement of key actors 
in the nanotechnology field, the electronics industry’s ownership of patents is dominated mostly by 
 
 
large organisations.",4
also a considerable heterogeneity was found in patenting activity.,4
"there are two 
main reasons for this.",4
"firstly, large organisations have the capability to provide the large investment 
necessary for r&d activities and they are aware of the benefits of these technologies in terms of their 
efficiency and for bringing about incremental innovation characteristics.",4
"secondly, they collaborate 
with academic organisations, such as universities, to benefit from their inventions as well.",4
"the second 
point is not found in every national innovation system, but of those where there are such 
collaborations, for example, korea, the us and japan the systems appear to be the most effective.",4
the results also show the regional strengths and weaknesses in competence building processes.,4
"an 
interesting outcome of this research is that it shows that asian players over the last few years have 
had a huge involvement in this area.",4
"it appears that south korea and china are now catching up with 
japan and are close to the us in terms of the number of nanotechnology patents granted.",4
"to gain an 
understanding of comparative dynamics, we have compared the relative technological advantages of 
europe, the us and the asian regions.",4
"this indicates that the us has maintained its leading position 
in the technology pole with a high share and high rta in all periods, revealing its strong 
competitiveness in the nanotechnology field.",4
"relative to other regions, the nanotechnological 
competencies in japan started losing strength in the mid-s and have continued to fall behind in 
recent years.",4
"the decline in rta may be due to the entry of other asian countries (especially the exponential 
growth of south korean firms) into nanotechnological activities.",4
"as china has a relatively low 
percentage share in the technology pole, its distinctive advantage in nanotechnology is still low, but 
promises to be greater in the future.",4
"contribution of the study 
this study has discussed how this research, its methodological approach and its findings have reduced 
the identified gaps and improved on weaknesses in this research field.",4
"furthermore, it points out 
practical and theoretical contributions to the field and reports key findings related to research 
objectives.",4
"practical contributions consist of descriptive and analytical findings based on various 
different types of categories such as actors’ performances and regions’ strengths and competencies 
that offer specific determinants for linkage mechanisms in the nanotechnology field.",4
"the case of 
tsinghua-foxconn represents successful practice in this field, and its study has increased the depth 
and quality of the findings.",4
"the outcomes of this study were also found to be useful for other 
innovation-related collaborations.",4
"the theoretical contributions of this study are the theoretical 
frameworks that have been adapted and tested in this research.",4
"the technology linkage model allows 
the identification of technology clusters and their linkages to application or market domains.",4
"accordingly, this model could be adapted to different fields such as biotechnology or with other types 
of data such as publications.",4
"apart from the practical and theoretical contributions, there are also methodological contributions 
from this research.",4
"as explained in the research design section, this study has greater validity than 
other studies due to its large sample size and greater accuracy of its patent search query, which used a 
combination of both patent classification codes and lexical queries.",4
"using only patent codes has a 
weakness in that unrelated patents appear in the patent data due to errors in their classification, but 
this was one of the common approaches adopted by other studies.",4
"this study offers an effective 
method of patent data gathering when compared to other methods and could be considered to be 
reliable as technological links were checked with multiple sources and supported by themescape 
mapping and interview data analysis that extended the findings in the nanotechnology field.",4
"with regard to the ten model, networks and clusters within the nanotechnology innovation system 
showed that boundaries of interactions are not limited to the national level and there are interactions 
between different types of organisations, so it is not possible to limit this field into certain sectors.",4
"however, an identified weakness is that the linkage between the science pole and market pole is not 
strong enough in terms of innovation processes.",4
"there are some strong linkages, such as between 
tsinghua-foxconn, but these types of linkages are rare overall.",4
"the weakness in collaboration 
between the science and market poles may be why the nanotechnology field is not in its highly 
commercialised stage and one of the reasons can be related to its collaborative innovation process.",4
"this is because there are many radical level patented inventions that are owned by academic actors 
but the majority of these technologies have not yet transferred to industry.  
. implications and future research 
the implications of this study are the following:  
) the substantial increase in patent generation by asian organisations leading to their catching up 
major players such as the us, especially south korea and china, is having a great impact in the 
nanotechnology field.

"mapping of mature and emerging technologies within the nanotechnology field indicates future 
commercial applications.  
)",4
"even though some nations such as the us are strongly involved in the nanotechnology field in 
general, it was very apparent that the key capabilities of each country and various organisations were 
widely divergent.",4
"this implies that nations and organisations should provide and have targeted funds 
and r&d to accelerate development in this field.  
)",4
governments should encourage (i.e.,4
"by funds, special policies and targeted intermediaries) their 
active or potentially active organisations to become involved in the nanotechnology field to gain 
 
 
competitive advantage and help establish clusters or networks to adapt and develop nanotechnology 
rapidly.

"active or potentially active organisations should become involved in this field to gain competitive 
advantage.

"management in intermediaries and fund providers should focus on linking academic and industrial 
organisations together and the majority of funds for innovative activities should be targeted towards 
collaborative research.",4
"to take this study further, there are many other relationships that could be looked at within the sub-
fields of nanotechnology.",4
"future studies could look at specific technology domains, such as 
nanomaterials, nanodevices and nanofabrications.",4
"as was mentioned above, there are some 
organisations and inventors that hold a high number of patent documents, but the question is whether 
they are highly influential patents in terms of citations, commercial potential and quality.",4
"interviews 
and surveys collected from academic and non-academic organisations could be used to gain a more 
in-depth understanding of the topic.",4
"a statistical analysis of the relationships pertaining between 
commercialised patents and the latest patents granted could be carried out to examine various 
relationships between inventions and innovations.",4
"innumerable 
scientific studies in several areas of knowledge were made since nanoscale 
emergence, carrying their contribution to the nanoscience development, 
leading to a great development of technical and scientific knowledge but 
also raising numerous problems in the ethical field.",4

nanotechnology is discussed both in terms of ethics and in terms of borders

"then considering that neurotechnology – a rapidly  
 
manuel alberto m. ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
growing field in the intersection between nano and biotechnology – can 
affect moral capacities of the brain, she suggests that ethics itself may be 
affected by nanotechnology.",4
"and she leaves as open the question of a co-
construction of ethics and bionanotechnology.",4
"in short: new approaches 
must be considered, but which ones?",4
"in freitas () it is affirmed that the society should be “able to muster 
the collective financial and moral courage to allow such extraordinarily 
powerful medicine to be deployed for human betterment, with due regard to 
essential ethical considerations”.",4
"at eu, there are some important concerns and discussion about the 
development of the integration of human beings and artificial 
(software/hardware) entities.",4
"next generations, in the perspective of nanomaterials utilization, will 
obtain many benefits in all these issues: health, economic, environmental, 
etc.",4
"by using this kind of advanced technology, with many more applications 
and much welcoming using, the conditions this technology offers will be 
very environmental friendly as well as already seen.",4
"actually, there are irreversible and long-term impact consequences for 
forthcoming generations and for the environment.",4
"however, there are risks, 
as well.",4
but in truth there are incredible potential advantages.,4
"and the 
discussion is all over the place.",4
"that borders must be considered is, of 
course, evident and there has to be an achieved balance between the path 
found to the new dimension of knowledge and the contours specific for the 
problem.",4
"the rub of the question is exactly in what measure criticisms may 
have into account the technology potential.",4
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
ethical human dignity 
 
despite the high feasibility for the economy and the environment, there 
are some considerations regarding the ethical, human dignity and moral 
borders on nanotechnology that should be taken into account.",4
"it is interesting to have a look to the definition of human dignity and its 
connection to moral conveyed in the “opinion of the european group on 
ethics in science and new technologies to the european commission”, , 
when discussing the ethical aspects of information and communication 
technologies (ict) implants in the human body.",4
"the group makes allusion 
to the eu’s draft treaty that establishes a constitution for europe, stating 
that “human dignity is inviolable.",4
"it must be respected and protected” 
(article ii-), and goes on to explain that “the dignity of the human person 
is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis of 
fundamental rights” (declaration concerning the explanations relating to the 
charter of fundamental rights).",4
"this group declares yet that this 
explanation does not strictly define human dignity and that many writers 
have attempted to fill this gap.",4
"one such attempt suggests that human dignity 
is defined as follows: “the exalted moral status which every being of human 
origin uniquely possesses.",4
"human dignity is a given reality, intrinsic to 
human substance, and not contingent upon any functional capacities which 
vary in degree.",4
"(…) the possession of human dignity carries certain 
immutable moral obligations.",4
"desires, challenges but also concerns are always present… 
what are the consequences?",4
are humans creating a new being?,4
"are humans prepared to get 
different, biologically and to become another thing?",4
"are humans creating 
further “nano-digital devices” between humans that have access to these 
advanced technologies and humans that have not access?",4
"this discussion is 
recognized but probably the ethical discussion has not been enough 
promoted.",4
"and possibly no one is enough prepared to participate effectively 
and wisely on it.",4
"much reflection, study and information is still needed.",4
"nanotecnology and environment 
 
in the long term, which are the consequences that nanotechnology has 
in the environment?",4
"is it possible to predict that less damage in nature can 
be done if nanomaterials are considered instead of large equipment are used?",4
"besides, once the need of inputs to produce these devices is lesser, probably 
there is an additional advantage on this perspective for nature preservation.",4
"let’s have a look on the following situation: 
 
 there is a growing consensus today that it is considered priority 
should be given to the development of alternative energies over the 
classical energies.",4
"it turns out that the classic energies price of 
production is cheaper than that of the alternative energies.",4
"in this case, this difference in costs can be compared with 
the environmental damage caused by the construction of dams.",4
"and 
even with the damage due to the pollution produced by the operation 
of the fuel oil plants.",4
"there is here an ethical problem in which one 
balances between paying a little more and preserving the 
environment or paying less and destroying it, in which the interests 
installed with the classical energies will hardly abdicate their 
positions without struggle, see (ferreira et al., ).",4
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
really, the implications and directions of nanotechnology need 
further discussion.",4
"the consequences of avoiding the discussion 
may be severe for society, considering rejection or fear of the 
effects.",4
"so it is pertinent to ask:  
 is there a need for a regulatory authority?",4
" which kind of mechanisms are needed to regulate the 
nanotechnologies developments area?",4
"ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace 
 
a theme urgently needing study and reflection concerns the potentially 
harmful effects on workers’ health due to their exposure to nanoparticles in 
companies dealing with nanotechnology.",4
"indeed, very little, to say nothing, 
is known about these harmful effects.",4
"in similar situations the harmful effects on workers’ health were only 
identified after long periods of activity, with the occurrence of real disasters 
in sanitary terms.",4
"one has to learn from history and try to avoid situations 
such as, for example, atomic energy in which, only relatively late, the 
harmful effects of radiation have been noticed.",4
"and only then were the 
necessary preventions taken, after the damage to health occurred in the 
workers of the plants and in the neighboring populations.",4
"and today 
humanity, in general, is not very confident on those preventions.",4
"however, 
atomic energy was initially used for war purposes which helps explain, but 
by no means excuse, this late reaction.",4
"the same is not true for  
nanotechnology, so it is natural that the attitude towards the problem is 
different.",4
"thus, in the absence of scientific knowledge on the potentially negative 
health effects of workplace exposure to nanoparticles, it is necessary to 
establish guidelines for decision making regarding risks and controls.",4
"identifying the ethical issues involved certainly helps with proper 
decision-making.",4
"it is therefore imperative for the decision-makers, 
particularly the employers, the workers, the investors, and the health 
authorities, to be aware of these issues.",4
"ethical issues involve the independent and impartial determination of 
risks, implacability, autonomy, justice, preservation of privacy, and 
promotion of respect for people.",4
"their identification and implementation 
will make the options for decision-makers more evident.",4
"and company-wide 
discussions on the workplace hazards of nanotechnology can be reinforced 
by a special emphasis on small businesses and the adoption of a global 
perspective.",4
"ethical questions about nanotechnology in the workplace arise from the 
state of knowledge about the dangers of nanomaterials and the hazards and 
risks they may pose to workers’ health.",4
"as this knowledge is still incipient, 
it is imperative to carry out a provisional assessment of the hazards and risks.",4
"workers can exercise their autonomy only if the processes leading to hazard 
identification and risk assessment are transparent, comprehensible, and 
credible.",4
"framework for ethical analysis  
in nanotechnology 
 
a methodology for conducting an organized and coherent discussion 
about ethics in this subject is to subdivide it by the following topics of 
analysis (see mnyusiwalla et al., ): equity, privacy, security, 
environment, and metaphysical when discussing the relationship in the 
human-machine binary.",4
"about each one of them some considerations may 
be made.",4
"so, assuming these topics, and trying to go as far as possible in the 
analysis: 
 
 
equity 
 
the classical dichotomy of developed and developing countries raises a 
new topic for discussion.",4
"indeed, technology and development are closely 
correlated.",4
"examples of great worries for developing countries are: 
 
 people poverty reduction,  
 energy problem,  
 water problem, 
 health problem, 
 biodiversity maintenance.",4
"nanotechnology would help these countries to better conditions of 
population health and way of life.",4
"but it is costly to implement any project 
in this area and more often there are no financial resources available.",4
"developing countries will be lesser benefited with these advances than 
manuel alberto m. ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
developed countries.",4
"the main problem happens with the access to the 
benefits of technology considering the poorest and the richest people inside 
any country.",4
"who may effectively reach the advances of science and take 
benefit from them?",4
"anyway, it is true that poor people, whatever they are, 
may benefit, in some measure, from these advances.",4
"it may depend on the 
will of politicians and on the investments capacity (one way of overcoming 
countries’ lack of investment capacity is their indebtedness which, as many 
current cases show, is nevertheless a generator of future and sometimes very 
serious financial problems)of some of these countries, for example.",4
"a result 
would be lower needs for energy and a cleaner energy production as well as 
other environmental benefits: a safer drug delivery, the improvement on 
health through for example better prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",4
"privacy 
 
at this level, it is to consider the enormous innovations which can be 
reached, by improving surveillance devices or other devices that restrict 
human privacy.",4
"an individual may be facing situations of “invisible” 
microphones and cameras.",4
"this is a real problem if privacy is intended to be 
assured.",4
"wireless monitoring provides healthcare providers and patients to 
be mobile and being able to exchange data when needed.",4
"it is true that wireless 
communication and new physiological sensors bring enormous implications 
in e-health.",4
"one point needed is about the necessary discussion on privacy 
and security.",4
"security 
 
surely new powerful weapons will be available very soon, as far as 
“invisible” microphones and cameras will be available.",4
"will this ensure new 
ways of security or will be added to a potential “arsenal of bio-terrorism and 
techno-terrorism or even nano-terrorism?” (see mnyusiwalla et al., ).",4
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
mnyusiwalla et al.,  also ask “who will regulate the direction of 
research in defensive and offensive military nt [nanotechnology]?",4
"how 
much transparency will be necessary in government and private nt 
initiatives to avoid misuses?",4
"there are also very interesting legal questions 
involving monitoring, ownership, and control of invisible objects”.",4
"environment 
 
this topic was already approached above in the section 
“nanotechnology and environment” due to extreme importance of the 
subject there considered: the production of electrical energy through 
nanophotovoltaic panels versus the production through classical means.",4
obviously this does not exhaust the subject.,4
"so, going on, new materials 
(fullerenes, carbon nanotubes) are now available.",4
"no one knows what will 
be the precise effects when this kind of nanomaterials goes into the 
environment (and also the effects on health).",4
"where 
are they put in the end of their mechanical lives?",4
"will some medical devices 
be kept inside human body?",4
"or will be given 
another destiny to them?",4
"is it possible to predict any kind of effects caused 
to the environment?",4
"jacobstein () refers that it is important to make an 
analysis on the risks associated to passive compounds in the less than  
nanometer size range.",4
"there is the possibility, for example, of being 
introduced inadvertently in human bodies.",4
"there is in fact the concern with 
their ability to be inhaled,  
 
 
absorbed through the skin, or to pass through biological compartment 
barriers such as the blood brain barrier.",4
"this kind of dangers pose a real 
range of potential health and environmental risks that are associated to their 
potential toxicity or mutagenicity in their interactions with biological 
systems (note the analogy of this situation with the considered above in 
“ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace”).",4
"while the range of effects 
vary, most of the risks may be addressed by advanced industrial hygiene and 
manuel alberto m. ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
environmental health practices and techniques that seek to characterize the 
specific risks, exposure patterns, and control methods and enforce them 
through a combination of practitioner education, industry self-regulation, 
monitoring and government regulation.",4
"this is an important emerging field 
in the environmental and health sciences, since most of the existing 
legislation on environmental, safety, and health risks may cover particulates, 
but do not take the change in physical and biological properties at the 
nanoscale into account.",4
"it is reasonable to assume that passive nanoscale 
particle risks, although potentially serious if not addressed, will be 
characterized and addressed systematically under new versions or 
extensions to existing occupational, industrial hygiene, environmental, and 
medical regulations.",4
"metaphysical 
 
the incorporation of implants in human body, this is, the incorporation 
of artificial materials or machines into human systems may conduct to a 
concern around the human values and principles; will a human being be 
more than a human being?",4
"what kind of being 
and what kind of consequences.",4
"how this process may be controlled and 
accessed?",4
"one of the main issues is the “autonomy” of nano-bots, that is: 
robots whose components are at or near the scale of a nanometre 
(−meters), if they are able or not to move and to take decisions 
autonomously.",4
"are they able to communicate each other and with the 
external environment?",4
"how can human beings ensure to “retire” them at the 
end of their “missions”?",4
"the 
modification made on human bodies and living systems may create new 
realities.",4
"this is already a very real concern on the society, being in general 
the society often very skeptic about developments in this area.",4
"catherine 
larrère, see citation in bensaude-vincent (), discusses “the recent 
trends in nanoethics which anchor ethics in metaphysics or theology by 
emphasizing the emergence of new relations of men to nature and to god.",4
"it 
is defended that the moral issue raised by the project of enhancing human 
ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
performances does not really lie in going beyond the boundary of human 
knowledge and condition.",4
"it is more a question of the moral choice 
underlying this new form of hubris”.",4
"now in another although similar recording, nano-bots, or in general the 
“convergence” of bio-nano-info-neuro technologies, requires a new contract 
between science and society; society should not be seen as an afterthought 
only for making technology assessments, for social acceptability, etc.",4
"rodotà & capurro () show the limitations on ict implants in the 
human body as deriving from an analysis of the principles contained in 
various legal instruments.",4
"they say that they should be assessed further by 
having regard to general principles and rules concerning the autonomy of 
individuals, which takes the shape of freedom to choose how to use one’s 
body, “i am the ruler of my own body”, freedom of choice as regards one’s 
health, freedom from external controls and influence.",4
"manuel alberto m. ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
conclusion 
 
ethical, legal and social implications in this context show the 
importance of nanotechnology to the society and the consequences that the 
development of nanotechnology possibly will bring to mankind in the future.",4
"the irreversibility and long-term impact of these new developments enforce 
to have in mind that it is necessary to take into account also the rights of 
future generations and the planet (like hans jonas’ “principle of 
responsibility”).",4
"indeed, the future is there and came quick and loudly.",4
the innovations are going fast and sprout from everywhere.,4
"and 
although the endemic crisis, mainly economic but also social and politic, 
will bring some restrictions to the investments in health and research areas 
in many countries, new developments in this area will prevail and many 
discoveries will be made.",4
"the machine is very well assembled and perfectly 
lubricated: innovations are growing and development is there, as much as 
the will to go faster and further in many domains of scientific investigation.",4
"the research on this subject gets new results every day and new challenges 
have to be faced.",4
"some work is going on this way and it is intended, in a 
forthcoming occasion, to analyze some data in order to detect and study the 
impact of the actual crisis on nanotechnology and mainly on applications to 
medicine and industry.",4
"the crisis may bring some restrictions, but there is a 
strong will to face the challenges and a new beginning is there.",4
"ethics concerning nanodevices and the borders of human beings 
considering nanotechnology in general and applied to medicine (where these 
concerns assume usuallya more dramatical aspect) also need a new research 
to be developed next.",4
"this debate of the borders of the human being 
regarding the application of nanotechnology may be also enlarged in order 
to have a study of the impact into telemedicine and e-health.",4
"the ethical issues related with the themes “nanotechnology and 
environment” and “nanotechnology in the workplace” are extremely critical, 
difficult to approach subjects whose development is hard to predict, due to 
the lack of knowledge of the situations.",4
"it can only be filled in the future 
after observing the practical situations.",4
"however, it all requires the try to 
ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
create credible scenarios that can frame future decision-making processes.",4

"hybrid computing systems
we broadly define hybrid computing systems as a class of
abstract machine models that combine different computational
paradigms.",5
"however, we specialize our analysis to the case of
realizable architectures that integrate a conventional classical
turing machine with a quantum turing machine.",5
"research into
these different machine models has clarified that they are not
equivalent with respect to computational power [], and we
address some of the unique considerations that arise by using
the conventional model to program and control the quantum
model.",5
"fig. . a hybrid computing infrastructure that integrates classical systems of
boolean logic into the control of quantum dynamics requires an interface for
input-output (io) based on the transmission and reception of physical fields
finput(t) and foutput(t).",5
", the two-way interaction between a
classical and a quantum machine model imposes a constraint
that requires the machines to share a common understanding
of language.",5
"in practice, this language is expressed as the
physical fields that define the operations issued by the conven-
tional model and implemented within the quantum domain [].",5
"electric, magnetic, and optical fields are prominent examples
by which the current technology controls the quantum physical
systems.",5
"it is notable that this description is inherently ana-
log due to the continuity of the time-dependent schrodinger
equation.",5
"translation between the system of boolean logic
characterizing the conventional turing machine into the analog
fields is necessarily limited by the available computational
power.",5
"in practice, this amounts to constraints imposed by
the available digital-to-analog converters and the range of the
arbitrary waveform generators as well as the speed at which
the logical network can be processed and the connectivity of
the control system.",5
"the outstanding concern for programming such a hybrid
computing system is the controllability of the conventional and
quantum machines [], [].",5
"that is to say, for those scenarios
in which the quantum machine must execute a series of issued
instructions, how accurately are these instructions realized and
how precisely does the result reflects the effect of the intended
instructions?",5
"a. client-server model for hybrid computing systems
current state-of-the-art hybrid computing systems integrate
existing cpu-based clients with qpu-based servers [], [].",5
"the latter represent the online availability of a programmable
infrastructure to access the field generators that drive the
control of a quantum physical device.",5
"the applied fields
are shaped and scheduled to control the dynamics of an
addressable array of quantum physical subsystems, which for
convenience we denote generically as the quantum register.",5
"similarly, the response fields emitted by the register elements
are collected and discriminated to generate binary representa-
tions that characterize the state of the register.",5
"a qpu-based server often includes conventional cpus for
purposes of parsing the digital programming instructions that
generate the shape and timing of the control fields as well
as the detection and discrimination of the response fields.",5
"access to the qpu-based server requires an interface that may
adhere to conventional logic, for example, as found in modern
networking communication technology, to accept instructions
from and return results to a cpu-based client.",5
"currently, the
conventional client-server model shown in fig.",5
"dominates
the access method to qpu systems due in large part to the
experimental nature of these machines.",5
"within the client-server model for hybrid computing sys-
tems, the qpu represents a layer of language parsers that
translate the boolean logic of the client to the control fields
required to drive the quantum register.",5
"as detailed elsewhere
[], the qpu is partitioned into a control unit, execution
units, and the register itself.",5
"the control unit parses the client
instructions received by the server into the local instruction
set architecture for generating and applying control fields.",5
"application of the fields are carried out by the execution units,
which in practice represent waveform generators for electric,
magnetic and optical fields.",5
"a similar signal flow occurs for
detecting output fields and generating a digital response.",5
"fig. . currently, most hybrid computing systems rely on a cpu-based client
interacting with a qpu-based server over a network.",5
"the qpu-based server
presents a classical control interface to the client that can be customized to a
variety of programming styles.",5
"internally, the qpu-based server must parse
these instructions into a local representation that carries out the requested
sequence of control fields.",5
"b. programming and execution model
the client-side api for the hybrid computing system dic-
tates how users access the quantum physical devices, while
the functionality of the qpu-based server is restricted to the
local interpretation of these transmitted instructions.",5
"in this
programming model, a client may select which instructions
to send from a predefined instruction set for the qpu.",5
"the
international conference on rebooting computing, may  
instruction set architecture (isa) defines the functionality of
the qpu and the language for the control unit [].",5
"these in-
structions are generally transmitted as character strings that are
mapped by the qpu-based server into pre-compiled functions
that execute the instruction.",5
"calls to these libraries initiate
the cascade of logic required to trigger the execution units,
which subsequently apply the necessary fields to the register
elements.",5
"fig. . components in a qpu-based server include a control unit that
expresses the instruction set architecture (isa), multiple execution units that
translate instructions into applied fields, and the quantum register which stores
the computational state.",5
"this layered, hierarchical structure provides a natural
separation of concerns but introduces challenges to programming near-term,
noisy qpus.",5
", the two-way information flow within the
qpu-based server provides a natural separation of concerns
for device programming.",5
"the logic dictating computational
functionality is isolated within the control unit and determined
by programs expressed within the isa.",5
"similarly, the execution
unit hosts the translation of individual instructions into the
fields that carry out the intended logical transformations on
the register.",5
"the information unique to the implementation of
either layer is notionally not required in the opposing layer.",5
"however, as we explore in the subsequent section, this design
of the current qpu-based servers leads to several challenges
for application programming.",5
"programming challenges for noisy qpus
despite the natural separation of concerns that arises in
a hybrid computing system using a qpu-based server, this
design presents a number of challenges when programming
currently available noisy quantum processors.",5
"advances in
our understanding and engineering of qpus have enabled
demonstrations with register capacities up to  addressable
elements, yet these realizations still demonstrate a non-trivial
amount of noise relative to the underlying decoherence rates,
greatly limiting the depth of quantum circuits with even
modest reliability.",5
"this raises a need for repeated sampling of
the circuit execution, but existing client-server access models
hamper this interaction and greatly limit the overall utility and
accessibility of the qpus.",5
"code portability is also a growing concern as many qpu
vendors trend toward standalone programming frameworks
that interact with their tightly controlled and proprietary isa.",5
"these barriers to portability impede efforts to perform veri-
fication of software and benchmarking of hardware as well
as methods to validate hardware behavior using numerical
simulation.",5
"finally, the individual workflow steps required to
program, compile, and execute hybrid applications with near-
term qpus are tightly coupled.",5
"the lack of inter-operability
across available software and hardware platforms raises a
concern that the users programming hybrid computing systems
will face artificial barriers to adoption and performance.",5
"we provide a more detailed description of each of these
challenges with an analysis for how hybrid computation is
affected.",5
"because moore’s law is merely an observation, and not a physical law, this 

king: viability of quantum computing

decades will continue to slow as creating faster and more efficient technologies using current 
methods climbs in difficulty.",5
"with these problems becoming more prominent every year, the 
computer industry faces a unique challenge that it has not faced since the inception of transistors.",5
"effectively, the industry is back at square one, and must create an entirely new approach or fester 
in an era without innovation.",5

"while these startling facts suggest a bleak future for computers and 
electronics, the moore’s law hurdle can be conquered with new emerging technologies.",5
"this 
only further strengthens the argument for pursuing quantum computing.",5
"cumming and his team’s assertion on moore’s law is shared by robison, another 
prominent researcher in the field.",5

producing a single silicon chip has remained stable or decreased over time as the number of 
components per chip has exponentially increased, the cost of research and development and of 
manufacturing infrastructure has increased exponentially, in what has been dubbed moore’s 
second law” (robison , ).",5
"robison’s research demonstrates that physical limits are not 
the only thing holding innovation back.",5

"the significantly improved processing power of quantum computers 
allows it to process data at a much faster rate than even supercomputers currently available.",5

solve many issues including database searching, finding periodic functions, solving linear

further research and development of this exciting technology.",5

few minutes (or hours) by using a quantum computer, but it takes
billions of years – more than the age of universe – by using a
classical computer [].",5

to require hundreds, thousands of fault-tolerant qubits embedded in

can be realized with different technologies – electron spin, light
polarization, super-conducting circuits [] – but the principles of
quantum mechanics hold independently of the underlying technol-
ogy.",5

can be in a superposition of two states  and  simultaneously.",5
qubits can exist in a superposition of  states.,5

states become  and, with  qubits, the states become .",5
"thanks to
the superposition principle, the power of quantum computing
grows exponentially as more qubits are added.",5

ment irreversibly affects any quantum state, causing a loss of its
quantum properties in a process called decoherence.",5
"the classical
strategy – storing redundant copies of the fragile data – is not a
solution.",5
"the no-cloning theorem, in fact, prohibits to make a
copy of an arbitrary quantum state, and it turns out to be a valuable
property for securing communications.",5
"by measuring a qubit, the quantum state is irremediably al-
tered: any superposition probabilistically collapses into a single
state.",5
"the measuring principle deeply affects computing: clever
ways to manipulate quantum states without measuring are essen-
tial for quantum algorithm design.",5
"quantum internet
from the above, it is now clear that the computational power of
a quantum device is dictated by the number of qubits that can be
embedded and interconnected within.",5

quantum technologies limits this number to double digits.",5
"hence, a question spontaneously arises: how can we signifi-
cantly scale up the number of qubits to achieve the quantum
supremacy?",5
"interconnecting multiple quantum devices via a quan-
tum internet, i.e., through a network able to share quan-
tum states among remote nodes (opposed to the reductive
usage of quantum communications “just” for securing an
otherwise ordinary data transfer), is the answer.",5

two devices with a quantum internet, the resulting cluster can rep-
resent up to  states, as detailed at the end of the next section,
with an exponential computational speed-up as shown in figure .",5

data centers are the natural candidates for hosting the specialized
quantum computing equipment.",5
"and companies and users can
access to the quantum computing power as a service via cloud.",5
"indeed, the quantum cloud market is estimated nearly half of

without violating the no-copying theorem and the measuring prin-
ciple.",5
"with just local operations and an entangled pair of qubits
shared between source and destination, it is possible to “transmit”
an unknown quantum state between two remotes quantum devices.",5
this process is known as quantum teleportation.,5

minimization in january .",5

infrastructure is the quantum internet [], which relies on the
entanglement through the teleporting process.",5
"with the current
technology level, photons are considered the natural candidates for
generating entanglement between remote qubits.",5

control with standard optical components as well as high-speed
low-loss transmissions.",5

qubit, i.e., a qubit for informationprocessing/storage

the other key property of quantum computing is entanglement.",5
"qubits have the ability to 
become entangled, and this is where much of their computing power comes from.",5

simplistic and abstracted form, entanglement means that while each part of a system is acting 
randomly, the actions of the entire system are predictable.",5

predicted based on the behavior of another qubit.",5

operations are calculated and then the state is measured, smashing this information down into a

quantum systems can only be measured once, at the end of a program.",5

measurement will likely be different each time it is taken due to noise in the quantum system.",5

overcome this limitation, quantum scores are usually measured multiple times, and graphed on a 
bar plot to indicate the probability of each output [].",5

"however, shor’s algorithm can find the prime factorization in polynomial time.",5
"this speed up 
indicates  that certain types of encryption can now be broken with quantum computation, and 
because of this capability, we will have to look into alternative ways to encrypt data in the future 
[].",5
"another algorithm that takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum computers is 
grover’s algorithm​.",5
"in its most simple form, grover’s algorithm manipulates the amplitudes of 
numbers in a quantum register in order to find a number in a list of numbers.",5
"for example, if you 
 
 
have a thousand database entries, and you are looking for a single entry with a unique attribute, 
grover’s algorithm could be used.",5
"assuming that no other entry in that list has that attribute, a 
classical computer would have to go through every entry to check if it had that quality, thus 
taking linear time.",5
grover’s algorithm can find that entry in o( ) time.,5
"this speed up is very√n  
significant, and has potential to change database searching drastically.",5
"additionally, grover’s 
algorithm uses something called “amplitude amplification” in order of a specific entry.",5
"this 
amplitude amplification exploits the properties of quantum computation to create the speedup 
[].",5
currently quantum computation has a few specific applications to science and research.,5
"in , researchers found a way to simulate protein folding using a quantum computer [].",5
"quantum also has applications in machine learning as it can process large amounts of 
information better than classical computers do.",5
"one example of this capability is the 
aforementioned grover’s algorithm for finding an entry in a database.",5
"last but not least, researchers also explored generating truly random numbers using 
quantum computers.",5
"a classical computer only has the ability to generate a pseudo-random 
number.",5
"some algorithms are pure math, utilizing matrices, and large prime numbers to perform 
calculations that appear random [].",5
"another technique for random number generation is using 
an arbitrary measurement of something in the universe as the basis for computing random 
numbers.",5
"one example is measuring the time between keystrokes on a computer and using that 
as the basis for the computation.",5
"however, the closer to statistically random a number generator 
is, the more time and space it takes to compute.",5
"this makes random number generation a 
problem in the world of computation.",5
"research question 
this work aims to observe the differences between a truly random number and a 
pseudo-random number generator.",5
"​in order to make such observations, a random number 
generator is implemented on both a quantum computer and a classical computer.",5
"the goal is to 
see if quantum can create truly random numbers, and to understand some of the differences 
between quantum computing and classical computing.",5
"methodology 
in order to observe the properties of quantum computation,  a random number generator 
program is written for each computer: classical and quantum.",5
"the program for the quantum 
computer is implemented on qiskit, an open source platform for quantum computing.",5
"qiskit is 
one of the first environments designed to assist with writing quantum programs.",5
"qiskit is based 
on the python programming language and runs on ibm’s quantum computer [].",5
"the random 
number generator takes advantage of the superposition property of quantum systems.",5
"this 
property means that until the quantum system is measured, it is both  and , but once it is 
measured it is exactly  or .",5
"a screenshot of the code for the random number generator on 
qiskit is in figure .",5
figure  shows seven qubits put into superposition.,5
"the qubits are in a linear 
combination of states, i.e.",5
"they have an equal chance of being  as they do  when they are 
measured.",5
each of these seven qubits are put into a superposition using hadamard (h) gates.,5
"mathematically, each qubit is put into  , ​represented as |+⟩ ​.",5
"using seven qubits means 
that this quantum circuit can represent up to ^ states.",5
"in this case they are representing 
 
 
numbers  to .",5
"this program uses  of the  qubits available on qiskit thus reducing 
system noise and ensuring that system readings are accurate.",5

"figure  is a demonstration of how to 
run this quantum circuit on ibm’s qiskit quantum computer.",5
"the results of the quantum score 
are sent back in a python dictionary.",5
"since the quantum circuit is ran only once, the output is a 
single string of ’s and ’s.",5
"however, in order to extract the results, the output is looped through, 
and stored into a temporary variable.",5
"the variable is then converted from a binary number into a 
decimal number, which is the actual random number.",5
"figure : sample code: random number generator function on qiskit 
 
the program for the classical computer utilizes python’s built in random number 
generator function.",5
the function is based on  the ​mersenne twister algorithm​.,5
"the algorithm 
was introduced in  by makoto matsumoto and takuji nishimura, and it is based on the 
mersenne prime.",5
the algorithm simulates randomness.,5
"however, while the algorithm passes a 
fair amount of statistical random tests, its output is not truly random [].",5
"more sophisticated 
random number algorithms use measurements of the environment, like the time between key 
presses, to generate a more random number, but those too are not truly random [].",5
"results and discussion 
in the classical implementation of this problem, it is impossible to generate a truly 
random number.",5
"the python random number generator applies mathematical functions to create 
something that appears random [].",5
"however a quantum computer is able to create a truly 
random number, thus making for a better random number generator.",5
"this work demonstrates the 
differences between a basic algorithm implemented on both a quantum computer and a classical 
computer.",5
"in order to understand the quantum random number generator,  numbers are 
generated using the quantum system, and then plotted on a bar graph with respect to how many 
times they appear in the data.",5
"the less variation in the amount of times a number appears in the 
output, the more random the number is, as shown in figure .",5
"to compare,  random 
numbers are generated using the ​mersenne twister​ (mt) algorithm in python and the counts are 
shown in figure .",5
"figure : bar graph of counts of each appearance of a number in  runs of the quantum 
algorithm

the two graphs look similar with respect to the number distribution.",5
"this result  is likely 
related to the mersenne twister having an intentional distribution of numbers across its range.",5
"however, there are differences between the two as shown in figure .",5
"figure : comparison of quantum and mersenne twister random number generator counts 
 
figure  shows that the output of the quantum algorithm is much closer to being exactly 
half zero and half one.",5
"as indicated in the graph, there is a smaller difference between the two 
counts in the quantum number generator than there is in the ​mersenne twister algorithm.",5
"this 
shows that the quantum algorithm is more true to the theoretical property that every outcome is 
equally likely to be in the output.",5
"this is how quantum computing generates a truly random 
number.",5
"there are differences between a quantum random number generator and a 
pseudo-random number generator implemented on a classical computer, using python.",5
"while 
there are many creative algorithms to address this problem, it is important to note a truly random 
system cannot be simulated through mathematical functions.",5
"a quantum computer however is an 
 
 
example of a truly random system, and this property is essential in creating a quantum random 
number generator.",5
"in addition to this comparison of truly random and pseudo-random numbers, this work is 
meant to add to the collection of programs that could be completed by a quantum novice.",5
"this 
project covers the fundamental concepts of quantum computing, and aids in the understanding of 
quantum concepts by those who are trying to learn quantum on their own.",5
"this means that 
quantum computing concepts are more accessible to the general public, and computer science 
minds can work to solve problems using this technology.",5
"conclusion 
as demonstrated in the design and implementation of a quantum random number 
generator, there are differences between classical computing and quantum computing.",5
"the 
ability to generate a truly random number has numerous applications in statistics and 
cryptography.",5
"in current cryptographic systems, if a random number can be predicted, the system 
can be cracked.",5
"if cryptographic systems were built on truly random numbers, they would be 
much more secure.",5
"having truly random numbers has incredible potential in many fields, and is 
one example of the many uses of quantum computers.",5
"this thesis serves as an introduction into one of the basic uses of quantum computing, 
and is a vessel to explain the differences between quantum computing and classical computing.",5
"a  summary of quantum  concepts and a review of the literature surrounding this topic were 
provided.",5
"then, a random number generator was implemented using qiskit and ibm’s quantum 
computer.",5
"the random number generator was also implemented using classical computing and a 
 
 
pseudo-random number generator.",5
"the results of these random number generators were 
analyzed, and the differences were compared.",5
"this work adds to the fundamental understanding of quantum computation, and to the list 
of programs that have now been implemented on a quantum computer.",5
"quantum computing has 
potential to revolutionize the way we think about computation, and to impact many fields for 
years to come.",5
"moore’s law may be slowing down, but quantum computing means that moore’s 
law just might hold true for a couple more years, thus pressing researchers to envision new ways 
to manipulate information.",5
"the most important question that soft quantum
computing attempts to address is whether or not this
new paradigm shift in computing could help in a better
understanding of certain functioning of the human brain
(“quantum artificial intelligence”).",5
"thus, in this work
we propose a quantum neural network model as an
illustration of soft quantum computing.",5
"the belief
behind the proposal stems from the recent exciting
discoveries on possible quantum mechanical effects in
biological systems (for a review, see ref.",5
"if
photosynthesis [] and avian navigation [] can make
use of quantum effects in certain manner, why the
human brain—the most marvellous biological device—
cannot utilize quantum laws to enhance its computing
and reasoning power?",5
"along this line, models of
quantum cognition based on, e.g., neuronal microtubules
[] and nuclear spins [, ] were envisioned.",5
"here,
rather than focusing on physical implementations of
quantum functioning of the brain, we are interested in the
mathematical model of quantum neural network which
works as a soft quantum computer.",5
"for a summary of
existing quantum neural network models, see ref.",5
"mathematically, soft quantum computing starts with
n two-level quantum systems (qubits) coupled with their
surrounding environment, and as such the initial state of
the n qubits is a mixed state ρ...n in the computational
basis |〉 and |〉.",5
"()
here the quantum operations eˆk, which might be
time-dependent, satisfy
∑
k eˆk(t)eˆ
†
k(t) ≤ i, where the
equality holds for a trace-preserving map.",5
"important ex-
amples of the trace-preserving operations are projective
measurements, unitary evolutions and partial tracing.",5
"after the noisy evolution, quantum measurement in
the computational basis completes the soft quantum
computing process.",5
"below, we model neurons as noisy
qubits; the network of such noisy qubits under noisy
evolution and measurement is a particular model of soft
quantum computing.",5
"the human brain can be regarded as a neural network
[, ] organized in a formidably sophisticated structure
and has a huge number (∼ ) of neurons.",5
"a drastically
simplified drawing of a neuron is shown in fig.",5
"a. a real
neuron, as we now understand it, integrates hundreds
or thousands of impinging signals through its dendrites.",5
"these signals result in a change of the internal cell
potential in a complex pattern that depends on the
excitatory or inhibitory nature of the synapses where the
signals impinge on the cell body.",5
"the neuron outputs a
signal through its axon to another neuron for processing
in the form of an action potential only when its internal
potential exceeds certain threshold.",5
"note that a neuron
has only a single axon, but a set of dendrites forming a
tree-like structure.",5
"instead of modeling the neurons as in the conventional
neural network models, or using the concepts borrowed
from hard quantum computing [], we model the jth
neuron within the neural network as a basic unit of
a soft quantum computer; the network can have any
network architecture, which we do not specify below.",5
"b, in our quantum neural model
each neuron has nj inputs si (i = , , ..., nj) from
possibly nj other neurons, each of which “interacts” with
the jth neuron.",5
"the interaction is characterized by a
connection superoperator wij(t) instead of a connection
matrix (or weighted pathways) wij in the conventional
neural networks [, ].",5
"here we have shown the
time-dependence of wij(t) explicitly.",5
"then we assume
that the jth neuron is a logic qubit, consisting of nj
physical qubits.",5
"the candidate of these physical qubits
could be neuron’s ion channels whose two conducting
states (open and closed states) qualify them as the two-
state systems.",5
"the detailed microscopic justification
of physical qubits, which will be considered in future,
is of course meaningful, but irrelevant here for our
axon
dendrite
soma
.",5
": a drastically simplified drawing of a neuron (a)
and the soft quantum neuron model (b).",5
"in (a), the neuron
integrates hundreds or thousands of impinging signals through
its dendrites.",5
"after processing by the cell body, the neuron
outputs a signal through its axon to another neuron for
processing in the form of an action potential when its internal
potential exceeds certain threshold.",5
mathematical formulation of the quantum neuron model.,5
"these nj physical qubits are operated by nj inputs
via the connection superoperator wij(t).",5
"as in a real
neuron integrating impinging signals and outputing a
signal when the internal potential of the neuron exceeds
certain threshold, here the resulting collective state of the
nj physical qubits represents the integration of impinging
signals and determines the output state of the logic qubit.",5
"thus, we model the quantum neuron at each network node
simultaneously as nj physical qubits and as a logic qubit
such that it can interact with nj impinging signals and
output a single qubit state.",5
"in this way, the neuron
model proposed above mimics as much as possible the
realistic neurons and meanwhile, uses quantum laws for
processing information.",5
"the logic qubit is initially described by a density
matrix ρinj .",5
"by modeling each neuron as a logic qubit,
we only consider binary signals, namely, si =  or .",5
"whenever si = , corresponding to the case of a signal
input, a quantum operation (here, a superoperator) wij
will be acted upon ρinj , while for si =  (zero input
signal), nothing will happen to ρinj .",5
"obviously, such
a conditional operation, called the “controlled kraus
operation” hereafter, is the generalization of the two-
qubit controlled unitary operations in hard quantum
computing.",5
"meanwhile, each input neuron itself with
input si is also a logic qubit in a mixed state ρ

i . as a
result, the evolution of the whole system from the initial
state

"()
here the “superprojectors” p|s〉 are defined by p|s〉ρ =
|s〉 〈s| ρ |s〉 〈s|, iˆ is the identity operator, and t represents
the time-ordering.",5
"generally speaking, all wij(t) are
acted upon the target neuron with specific temporal
patterns and as such, the time-ordering of these actions is
important as different wij(t) might be noncommutative.",5
"note that, in addition to the conditional dynamical
evolution in eq.",5
"(), each quantum neuron can also be
subject to local noisy operations.",5
here some remarks are in order.,5
"a neuron of the hu-
man brain normally has about  synapses on average.",5
"it is this large number of input neurons that activate the
target neuron.",5
"according to modern neuroscience, the
connection matrix wij is the mathematical abstraction
of the synaptic efficacies of the inter-neuron synapses,
while impinging signals mathematically represent action
potentials.",5
"in classical neuron model, the activation of a
real neuron is then determined by the internal integrated
cell potential, or mathematically by the signal function
and the internal firing threshold.",5
"for real neurons, as
action potentials and cell potentials change much faster
than changes in synaptic efficacies, neuron activations
are a fast process, while the changes of synaptic efficacies
are a slow one.",5
"in classical neural networks, the change
of synaptic efficacies is implemented by a “learning
algorithm” [, ] during a learning process in response
to stable patterns of activity.",5
"however, in the context of our current quantum neuron
model, the above remarks should be looked from a
different angle.",5
"here a learning process is realized by
a “quantum learning algorithm” (see, e.g., ref.",5
"[] for
a review), i.e., a specific temporal pattern of quantum
operations wij(t) depending on the states of input
neurons.",5
"by using various quantum learning algorithms,
the quantum neuron model opens a door to quantum
manipulations of real neurons, artificial intelligence, and
ultimately, the human brain.",5
"by sharp contrast, the
existing quantum neural networks [] model neurons
as qubits in pure states and connection weights as
usual quantum logic gates.",5
"however, the human brain
is a highly open and decohering system.",5
"it is very
unlikely to model the human brain as a well isolated
quantum system.",5
"in our model, the human brain is
neither a classical computer (soft or hard) nor a standard
quantum computer, but something in between, namely,
a soft quantum computer.",5
"by modeling neuron nodes
as qubits in mixed states and their connections as
connection superoperators, we are left to see to what
extend our model could simulate and understand the real
functioning of the human brain.",5
we used the superprojectors p|s〉 in eq.,5
"() to
select the computational basis as the input to the jth
neuron.",5
"in doing so, we have actually implicitly assumed
certain environment-induced decoherence [] naturally
occurring in the cell body to choose the preferred basis,
namely, the computational basis.",5
"to be consistent for our
quantum neuron model, we have to determine the output
sj of the jth neuron in the same way.",5
"the final state of
the jth neuron can be obtained by tracing out all the
input states, namely, ρoutj = tr{i}ρ
out
{i}j = t
∏nj
i=[piiˆj +
( − pi)wij(t)]ρinj , where pi ≡ pi() = tr(|〉i 〈| ρini ) is
the probability of |〉i within ρini .",5
"the output state is
then
ρj = (p|〉j + p|〉j )ρoutj .",5
"()
in other words, the output signal sj of the jth neuron is
sj =
{
 with probability pj()
 with probability − pj() ()
this completes the specification of our quantum neural
network model as a soft quantum computer.",5
"in-
terestingly, the above prescriptions on the input and
output states in the preferred computational basis tacitly
assumed each neuron in our model as a quantum self-
measuring meter.",5
"this eliminates the ambiguity of
designating signal functions of various forms in classical
neural networks [].",5
"physically, one could regard each input dendrite as
a quantum channel [], which carries out a quantum
manipulation wij if and only if si = .",5
"the depolarizing
channel can be represented by wdp(ρ) =

qubit states, by applying an amplitude-damping process

process, see ref.",5
"() is
the classical-quantum state, as dubbed in ref.",5
"[]—
while for measurements on neuron- the discord is zero,
measurements on neuron- in general lead to non-zero
discord.",5
"thus, we reveal the first important feature of our
neural network (a soft quantum computer).",5
"namely,
the neural network can develop quantum correlations
although only mixed initial states and very noisy
operations are available.",5
"consequently, if soft quantum
computing does mimic the working mechanism of the
human brain, the brain is certainly quantum as there
are quantum correlations among the neurons therein.",5
now let us consider the three-neuron case.,5
"we
are interested in two particular examples, where two
controlled kraus operations o and o are performed
in different orders, namely, ρout

= oo(ρin ⊗ρin ⊗ρin )
and ρ′out = oo(ρin ⊗ ρin ⊗ ρin ).",5
"assuming ρin =

"()
meanwhile, it is easy to check that ρ′out can be obtained
from ρout

only by reversing the orders ofw andw in
the last term of eq.",5
"if (− p)(− p) = , then for
noncommutative w and w the resulting states ρout
and ρout

are different from each other.",5
"the importance
of the quantum operation orders is a quantum feature,
which remains in our quantum neural network model.",5
"using the national representative surveys (gallup polls)
and laboratory experiments, a recent result [] reported
an evidence supporting a quantum model of question
order effects for human judgments.",5
"whether or not our
quantum neural network model is a quantum mechanical
foundation for such a result is certainly an interesting
future problem.",5
"open quantum systems have been considered for
various applications in quantum information processing
by engineering environment [, ] and in particular, for
mixed-state quantum computing [–] or dissipative
quantum computing [, ].",5
"while soft quantum
computing is no more powerful than the unitary circuit
model as implied by the “dissipative quantum church-
turing theorem” [], there does exist a mixed-state
quantum computing model (with a collection of qubits
in the completely mixed state coupled to a single control
qubit with nonzero purity), proposed by knill and
laflamme [] and known as deterministic quantum
computation with one qubit (dqc), which provides
exponential speedup (for estimating the normalized-
trace of a unitary matrix) over the best known classical
algorithms.",5
"the possible role of quantum discord was
considered, e.g., in refs.",5
"[, , ], as a figure of
merit for characterizing the nonclassical resources present
in the dqc, which itself is a special soft quantum
computer.",5
"thus, it is reasonable to expect that soft
quantum computing has computational power between
classical computation and usual quantum computation.",5
"finally, we give a brief remark on the physical
implementation of soft quantum computing.",5
"above
discussions focus mainly on a special form of the
conditional dynamical evolution as in eq.",5
"(); more
general forms can of course be envisioned.",5
"a physical
realization of oij is simple: the superprojectors p|s〉
i
correspond to a von neumann measurement on neuron-
i along the computational basis; conditionally on the
measurement results, an identity operation iˆ or wij(t)
is acted upon neuron-j.",5
"such a conditional dynamical
evolution is experimentally friendly to implementation
based on any quantum computing systems under current
investigation, such as linear optics, superconducting
qubits, atoms/ions, and quantum dots.",5
"to summarize, we have proposed soft quantum
computing as nonclassical computation using real world
quantum systems with naturally occurring decoherence
and dissipation induced by environment.",5
"a mathe-
matical model of quantum neural network is suggested
to illustrate soft quantum computing.",5
"even using
very simple and noisy operations [the controlled kraus
operations in eq.",5
"()], the quantum features, such as
the presence of quantum discord and non-commutability
of quantum operations, remain in our model.",5
"as an
experimentally friendly model, the neural network as
proposed mimics as much as possible the realistic human
brain and thus, paves the way to quantum artificial
intelligence and to better understanding the working
mechanism of the human brain.",5
"if the human brain
does be a soft quantum computer, it utilizes quantum
laws in such a fundamental way that it forms certainly
a quantum correlated entity.",5
"this might be the reason
why the human brain is much more powerful for certain
tasks than classical computers, although we have to know
more consequences and applications of the model to
arrive at a conclusive result.",5

computer is much easier to build than the standard one,
we need to do more works to understand what kinds
of computational tasks it can execute and to find the
corresponding efficient algorithms.",5

ing components in terms of the practical operation.",5
"for
example, we have to prepare a quantum algorithm de-
composed into individual gates instead of only the dom-
inant part of a quantum algorithm.",5
"second, the above
components have to be properly integrated with a target
quantum computer system architecture.",5
"for example, we
have to find a path for qubit movements (or braiding) on
the target system architecture without raising any con-
flicts with other paths.",5
"by doing so, the quantity of qubit
movements which cannot be considered in the statistical
analysis can be exactly measured, and therefore we can
say that the analysis results are realistic.",5
"in this work, to perform the integrated analysis more
efficiently, we propose and develop a quantum computing
framework composed of three functional layers (compile,
system and building block), where each layer has a well-
defined role for a quantum computing as follows.",5
"• compile: decomposition of a quantum algorithm
into a sequence of quantum gates called a quantum
assembly code
• system: integration of a quantum algorithm and
building blocks under a quantum computer system
architecture
• building block: implementation of logical qubits
and gates according to a quantum error-correcting
code and a fault-tolerant scheme
with the proposed framework, we can conduct the anal-
ysis in the most fine-grained manner.",5
"for example,
we even count a qubit movement one by one, and the
quantity of physical qubits based on the provided quan-
tum computer architecture and the ancilla qubits re-
quired for error correction and magic state.",5
"further-
more, the framework examines the performance and the
resource with the criterion, % fidelity quantum com-
puting [].",5
"by doing so, we can provide full quantum
resource and compare various quantum computing con-
figurations fairly.",5
"the objective of this work is to estimate the most ac-
curate quantum computing performance and quantum
resource by the help of the framework we developed.",5
"for
that, we first need to configure a quantum computing
by choosing specific protocols and device properties.",5
"by
doing so, as mentioned above, we can see the quantum
resource and the performance of a quantum computing
based on most of quantum computing components from
algorithm to hardware.",5
"besides, it is also possible to see
which component affects a quantum computing most se-
riously by applying realistic technology from the top layer
to the bottom layer gradually.",5
"in this regards, we can see
that a theoretically optimal protocol really leads to opti-
mal quantum computing or instead works suboptimally
in composition with other components.",5
"by exploiting the accurate analysis function, we can
show numerical data for some theoretical conjectures in
the fault-tolerant quantum computing.",5
"in steane code
based quantum computing, increasing a concatenation
level makes it possible to achieve more reliable quantum
computing, but we guess that the more does not lead to
the better all the time because a higher concatenation
level requires more quantum resource and longer execu-
tion time.",5
"therefore, it is reasonable to guess that there
may exist a trade-off between the reliability and the per-
formance (resource).",5
"in this work, we show there exists
such trade-off, and in surface code based quantum com-
puting too.",5
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows.,5
section ii reviews some related works.,5
"section iii
overviews the proposed quantum computing framework
and describes how to configure and analyze a quantum
computing with the proposed framework.",5
"section iv de-
scribes each layer of the proposed framework in detail.",5
"section v describes the performance metric we evaluated
in this work, and the analysis results will be shown in sec-
tion vi.",5
"section vii discusses, by exploiting the proposed
framework, what happens in a quantum computing if an
individual component is improved.",5
"this paper concludes
with discussions in section viii.",5
"related works
we review several quantum computing frameworks dis-
cussing the performance and the quantum resource of a
quantum computing.",5
"table i briefly summarizes the re-
lated works.",5
"quipper [–, ] and scaffcc [, , ] are frame-
works for quantum compile and resource estimation of
a quantum algorithm.",5
"they basically compile a pro-
grammed quantum algorithm into a sequence of quantum
instructions of a quantum gate and target qubit(s).",5
"from
the compile results, they statistically analyze the quan-
tum resource such as the quantities of gates and qubits.",5
all the data come from a quantum algorithm only.,5
"we
believe, without considering physical implementation of
the algorithm, the analysis results cannot be used for the
reference to the feasibility of a quantum computing.",5
"[] approximated the quantum computer
size and the execution time of shor algorithm (n = )
with a surface code quantum computing.",5
"however, their
analysis is based on the dominant part of the algorithm
such as the modular exponentiation circuit only.",5
"there-
fore, the execution time completely depends on the quan-
tity of toffoli gates in the circuit, the decomposition of
toffoli gates and measurement gate execution time.",5
"the
size of a quantum computer was also calculated based on
the quantity of magic states to implement logical t gates
and the quantity of logical (algorithm) qubits.",5
"[] also estimated the performance and resource of a
quantum algorithm within their layered architecture for
a quantum computing.",5
"but, their analysis methods are
almost the same with fowler et al.",5
"on the other hand, reiher et al.",5
"[] applied a quan-
tum compile and surface code error correction to estimate
the performance and the resource for quantum simulation
of complex chemical system.",5
"since the authors did not
consider any quantum computer system architecture and
the system integration on the architecture, their analy-
sis corresponds to the statistical calculation based on the
data from compiled algorithm and fault-tolerant scheme.",5
"note that in the literature, the authors claimed that de-
spite overhead of quantum error correction and compile,
quantum computations can be performed within reason-
able time.",5
"the toolbox for estimating quantum resource
qure [, ] considers most of quantum comput-
ing components such as quantum compile, quantum
error correction, physical qubit layout and quantum
computing device.",5
"by taking quantum compile, they
prepared all quantum gates of a quantum algorithm.",5
"furthermore, they covered both of block-type quantum
codes (steane code and bacon-shor code) and surface
code and employed -dimensional qubit layout for their
logical qubits.",5
"in this regards, this toolbox performs the
analysis based on more quantum computing components
than before.",5
"however, their analysis method is still
statistical investigation.",5
"for example, their estimation
on the execution time of a quantum computing simply
depends on the quantity of quantum gates and its
running time,
∑
/gparallel × #g × gt .",5
"note that
gparallel denotes the quantity of gates g executed in
maximally parallel and gt is the execution time of the
gate.",5
"as mentioned before, it is difficult to say their
analysis results coincide with the practical situation.",5
"configuration of quantum
computing
we describe how to configure a quantum computing
with the proposed quantum computing framework.",5
"we
first overview the structure and functionality of our quan-
tum computing framework, and second describe how to
configure a quantum computing.",5
"we also describe which
schemes and protocols are currently supported by the
framework.",5

"besides, surface code basically requires that physical qubits are arranged on the
-dimensional nearest neighbor layout.",5

cal device property and the fault-tolerant quantum computing
scheme, logical operations with a specific performance will be
generated.",5
"b. configuration of quantum computing
we describe how to configure a quantum computing
with the proposed framework.",5
"as mentioned above, it is
possible to configure a quantum computing by selectively
choosing specific protocols or the properties of physical
device.",5
"for example, you can configure a steane code
based fault-tolerant quantum computing to run shor al-
gorithm.",5
"for that, through compile you generate a quan-
tum assembly code.",5
"logical building blocks are built
up based on the chosen quantum error-correcting code,
quantum device and the size of the quantum algorithm.",5
"the next task is to determine a quantum computer archi-
tecture of a certain physical and/or logical qubit layout.",5
"the architecture depends on the chosen fault-tolerant
quantum computing scheme.",5
"note that it is also possible
to choose a physical non-fault-tolerant quantum comput-
ing by assuming high-fidelity quantum computing device
(see section viib).",5
"in table ii, we show some options our framework cur-
rently supports.",5
"in the table, the compile type and the
mapping type (with qubit layout) completely depend on
the type of a quantum assembly code, a structured code
and a non-structured code.",5
"a structured quantum as-
sembly code is processed by a structured system mapping
for a structured quantum computer architecture.",5
"simi-
larly, a non-structured quantum assembly code is taken
by a non-structured system mapping based on a simple
qubit layout such as a regular - or -dimensional lattice.",5
"the details of the structured and non-structured quan-
tum assembly codes will be described in section iva.",5
"in
sections vi and vii, we configure quantum computings
with such options and analyze the performance and the
quantum resource.",5
"with the proposed framework, a quantum comput-
ing can be configured as follows.",5
"the first step is
to determine the type of a quantum computing, a
fault-tolerant quantum computing or a non-fault-tolerant
physical quantum computing.",5
"in general, such deter-
table ii.",5
list of protocols and layouts currently supported by the framework.,5
"in the compile layer, we choose a compile
type and a target gate set.",5
the compile type is the format of a quantum assembly code.,5
"the compile type is closely related
to the mapping type and qubit layout.",5
a specific qubit layout can be chosen within a selection.,5
"in the building block layer,
the scheme for a fault-tolerant quantum computing is determined.",5
"according to the scheme, the protocol of logical operations
are fixed.",5
"the larger quantum algorithm requires the more reliable
qubits and gates.",5
"if you decided a fault-tolerant quan-
tum computing, you need to choose a quantum error-
correcting code.",5
"our platform supports [[, , ]] steane
code and a surface code now.",5
"according to a quantum
algorithm and the reliability (error rate) of physical de-
vice, the concatenation level for steane code or the code
distance for a surface code will be determined.",5
"the choice of the quantum computing type affects a
succeeding quantum compile step.",5
"exactly, target quan-
tum gates for a compile completely depends on the cho-
sen quantum computing type.",5
"for example, rz(θ) gate
for a rotational angle θ is very exploited in a quantum
algorithm, but its logical version is not generally imple-
mented in a fault-tolerant manner.",5
"therefore, to realize
a fault-tolerant quantum computing, you have to decom-
pose such rz(θ) gate into a sequence of h , s and t
gates those are fault-tolerantly implementable.",5
"on the
other hand, since the physical rz(θ) gate can be easily
performed on physical qubits, there is no problem with
quantum gates including the rotational gate for a non-
fault-tolerant physical quantum computing.",5
"the second step is to make a quantum computing pro-
gram and compile it into a quantum assembly code.",5
"as
mentioned above, for the compile, you have to exploit
target quantum gates determined in the previous step.",5
"the proposed framework exploits open-source program-
ming language scaffold and compiler scaffcc.",5
"you can
see how to make a scaffold program in ref.",5
"[] and how
to use scaffcc compiler in ref.",5
"in section iva,
we show a simple example of a scaffold program and the
associated quantum assembly code.",5
"note that scaffcc
decomposes an arbitrary one-qubit gate into a sequence
of h , s and t by exploiting gridsynth [] or sqct [].",5
"the third step is to choose a quantum computing archi-
tecture, in particular a qubit array.",5
"the proposed plat-
form takes not only a simple regular - or -dimensional
lattice, but also a hierarchically structured qubit array.",5
"a
communication bus also should be considered to make an
efficient interaction over distant qubits.",5
"shows an
example of a hierarchically structured quantum comput-
ing architectures.",5
"in case of steane code quantum com-
puting, the structure of a qubit array seriously affects a
quantum computing due to the limited local qubit inter-
action.",5
"we will show such limitation raises highly non-
trivial temporal overhead in section vic.",5
"on the other
hand, surface code quantum computing scheme is fun-
damentally established based on local qubit interaction
on the -dimensional lattice.",5
"shows a quantum
computing architecture for a surface code quantum com-
puting.",5
"if the configuration is completed, we can perform the
system synthesis.",5
"during the system synthesis, the quan-
tum algorithm is reformulated for the target quantum
computer architecture.",5
"c. analysis of quantum computing
we briefly mention what performance are evaluated by
the framework, but the detailed analysis method will be
described in section v. the framework first inspects the
quantities of qubits and gates.",5
"those figures are usually
analyzed by a quantum compile without considering a
quantum computer architecture [, ].",5
"but, our frame-
work examines such quantities with the consideration for
a quantum computer system architecture.",5
"in the system
synthesis, a fault-tolerant quantum computing scheme in
particular a magic state factory is taken into considera-
tion.",5
"therefore, it is possible to estimate the temporal
and spatial overhead caused by factors those are veiled
in a quantum algorithm, and therefore we believe our es-
timation nearly coincides with the resource to perform a
real quantum computing.",5
"the framework examines the expected quantum com-
puting execution time (circuit depth, fidelity, kq and
so on) of a quantum algorithm based on quantum com-
puter architecture, fault-tolerant protocol and physical
device.",5
"by applying the properties of physical device
and fault-tolerant protocol, we deduce the performance
of logical gates and quantum error correction.",5
"besides,
by conducting a system integration, we are able to obtain
the single-round execution time of a quantum algorithm
by applying the performance of logical gates and error
correction above.",5
"our framework goes further for more
detailed analysis.",5
"during the system integration, as men-
tioned above, the fidelity of a quantum computing can
be calculated.",5
"by reflecting the fidelity, it is possible to
estimate the execution time for a quantum computing
achieving a fidelity %.",5
"in doing so, we fairly compare
fault-tolerant quantum computing and non-fault-tolerant
quantum computing.",5
"the quantity of qubits is also based
on this performance criterion.",5
"besides the above-mentioned, the framework can gen-
erate various performance data.",5
"based on the data, we
can estimate the temporal and spatial overhead of a
quantum computing.",5
"for example, as mentioned above
limited local interaction between nearest neighbor qubits
sometimes requires additional qubit movements to per-
form -qubit cnot gate.",5
"the quantity of such qubit
movements corresponds to the temporal overhead.",5
"the
platform evaluates such temporal overhead as a ration of
swap gates to total quantum gates.",5
"as will be shown
in section vic, a quantum computing requires highly
nontrivial temporal overhead.",5
"proposed quantum computing
framework
a. compile layer
a quantum compile is a process that decomposes a
quantum algorithm into a sequence of quantum gates.",5
"here a quantum algorithm is in entirely programmed
form by using a high-level abstract programming lan-
guage.",5
"it is well known that an arbitrary quantum algorithm
can be decomposed into a combination of -qubit rota-
tional gates and -qubit cnot gate [].",5
"the target
quantum gates for a compile can be varied according to
situation.",5
"for example, the set of h , t , and cnot
is de facto standard for a universal fault-tolerant quan-
tum computing.",5
"but, to reduce the complexity in com-
pile or to provide a flexibility to a programmer, one
usually add more quantum gates to target gates.",5
"fur-
thermore, according to specific quantum mechanical sys-
tem, physically implementable quantum gates slightly
differ [, ].",5
"the difference between
both is rz(θ) gate.",5
"as mentioned before, since the rota-
tional gate for an arbitrary rotational angle θ can not be
implemented in the fault-tolerant manner, the first set
is exploited for a physical quantum computing and the
second is used for a fault-tolerant quantum computing.",5
"the output of the quantum compile, the sequence of
quantum gates, is called a quantum assembly code.",5
"a
quantum assembly code is a list of quantum instructions
that is a combination of a quantum gate and its tar-
get qubit(s).",5
"it is an intermediate representation of a
quantum algorithm between a mathematical description
and a physical machine instruction description [, , ].",5
"there is not any standard for a quantum assembly code,
and therefore a specific representation and a structure of
which slightly differ according to literature.",5
"for exam-
ple, a quantum instruction to apply a hadamard gate
to a qubit q is represented as “hadamard q” or “h(q)”.",5
"besides, a certain quantum assembly code has its own
special structure.",5
"in the present work, we hire open-source quantum
compiler scaffcc [, ].",5
"it compiles a quantum com-
puting program written in quantum computing program-
ing language scaffold [].",5
"a scaffold program consists of
one main module and multiple sub-modules (see fig.",5
"a module generally seems like a function or a procedure
of conventional programming languages such as c/c++,
python and so on.",5
"the module is composed of instruc-
tions calling quantum gates and/or other modules.",5
"the
execution of a scaffold program begins with the first in-
struction of the main module, and terminates by conduct-
ing the last instruction of the same module.",5
"during the
execution of the main module, other sub-modules may
be called.",5
"previously, we mentioned that some quantum assem-
bly codes have unique feature in their structure.",5
"the compiler generates a hier-
archically structured quantum assembly code, in which
a quantum algorithm is composed of multiple modules.",5
"a module consists of performing quantum gates and/or
other modules.",5
"in the previous paragraph, we also men-
tioned that a scaffold program consists of modules.",5
"to
avoid any ambiguity, we need to distinguish both.",5
"a
module in a scaffold program is completely defined and
written by a programmer, and through a compile it is
converted to a module in a quantum assembly code.",5
"therefore, both are technically identical.",5
"shows
an example of a module in a quantum assembly code.",5
we need to say why we exploit scaffcc in this work.,5
"as mentioned above, a quantum assembly code is a list
of quantum instructions.",5
"as the size of a quantum algo-
rithm increases, the size of a quantum assembly code non-
trivially increases.",5
"it completely follows the complexity
of a quantum algorithm.",5
"obviously, the size of meaning-
ful quantum algorithm in reality is beyond the capability
of conventional super-computing.",5
"parameter qubits passed
from external modules are clearly specified at the beginning.",5
"a module is defined by the preparation of local qubits and
classical bits, calling quantum gates and other sub-modules,
and measurement of local qubits.",5
"for example, the size of a quantum assembly code
of shor algorithm to factorize  bit integer is around
 tb (see fig.",5
"therefore, we have had trouble in
generating and managing such a huge code with a clas-
sical computing system.",5
"we could not even attempt to
generate more larger-sized quantum algorithm than the
algorithm above due to the lack of classical storage and
memory.",5
"on the other hand, it is believed that the hierar-
chy provided by scaffcc can suppress the scalability.",5
"for example, to perform a composite quantum opera-
tion of n gates as much as m times, a normal (non-
structured) quantum assembly code requires mn quan-
tum instructions (#gates × #iteration).",5
"however, the
hierarchical assembly code requires only m +n instruc-
tions (#gates + #iteration) by defining the operation
as a module.",5
"by doing this, the hierarchical quantum
assembly code is much smaller than the non-structured
code as shown in fig. . to the best of our knowl-
edge, only scaffcc supports such hierarchically struc-
tured quantum assembly code.",5
"this is the main reason
whey we exploit scaffcc in the proposed platform.",5
"to conclude this section, we show a simple exam-
ple of a scaffold program to make a -qubit cat state

bly code.",5

gram in ref.",5

a -qubit cat state and a corresponding scaffold pro-

"both codes are generated by

code in the non-structured format increases over dozens tb.",5
"(a) a quantum circuit and (b) its scaffold

the module makecat makes the cat state.,5
"b. system layer
a quantum algorithm (quantum assembly code) is a
logic of how to solve a given problem.",5
"it is based on ideal
physical situation where noiseless physical gates and arbi-
trary long qubit interaction are allowed.",5
"in other words,
a quantum algorithm is developed without considering
any physical implementation.",5
"on the other hand, a quantum computer where a quan-
tum algorithm is executed has a certain logical and phys-
ical architecture such as a qubit layout.",5
"therefore, to
run a quantum algorithm on such quantum computer,
we need to reformulate the algorithm to be compatible
with the given quantum computer architecture.",5
"for ex-

tum experience [] have very limited qubit layout and

"a node
indicates a qubit, and an edge with a direction implies that
the application of a controlled-cnot gate is possible, where
the control qubit and the target qubit are the root and end
of the arrow.",5
"therefore, as you see no bi-directional cnot
is allowed on the ibm qx.",5
"(b) the recasted assembly code

tecture and ) recast a quantum assembly code for the

computer architecture, and then show how to actualize a
quantum algorithm on the target architecture.
. quantum computer architecture
we discuss a hierarchically structured quantum com-
puter architecture for the proposed framework.",5
"in (a), the qubits a and even are
parameter qubits passed from other modules, and the qubit
scratch is a local qubit locally used within the module.",5
"in (b),
the dark grey cells are for the parameter qubits, the white cells
are for the local qubits and the light grey cells are just empty
space or null qubits not working anything.",5
"while the size
of the parameter qubits a and even are not specified in the
module definition, it can be determined by tracing all modules
that calls the module.",5
"eral, there is no restriction to the architecture.",5
"in other
literature, a regular - or -dimensional lattice is usually
exploited.",5
"but, in this work we assume that it is hier-
archically structured.",5
"a quantum computer is composed
of several computing regions called a module and a com-
munication bus connecting to the modules.",5
"by assuming
such structured architecture, the system mapping with a
hierarchically structured quantum assembly code can be
done efficiently.",5
"a computing region is completely associated with a
module in a quantum assembly code.",5
"it consists of mul-
tiple cells for logical (or physical) qubits described in the
module.",5
"some cells are allocated for parameter qubits
passed from other modules, and others are allocated for
local qubits which are temporarily used within a module.",5
"additional space may be sometimes required to form the
rectangular shape of a module.",5
"shows an ex-
ample of a module in a quantum assembly code and its
associated computing region.",5
"shows examples of the above-mentioned quan-
tum computer architecture.",5
"the box labelled mi,j (mi)
indicates a module (computing region).",5
"we call the ar-
rangement of modules a global layout and the arrange-
ment of qubits within a module a local layout.",5
"all mod-
ules communicate with each other via a communication
bus.",5
"in the figure, the bus is depicted as a white space
outside of modules.",5
"we will discuss the bandwidth of the
communication bus in section v.
qubit that resides inside a module supports universal
quantum operation.",5
"the logical qubit is composed of
data qubits for holding data and ancilla qubits for error
correction and logical operations.",5
"on the other hand,
qubits for a communication bus only perform error cor-
rection and logical clifford operations.",5
(a) d global layout and d local layout.,5
"(b) d
global layout and d local layout.",5
"tlogical qubits of different
color play different role in a module; parameter qubits (dark
grey), local qubits (white) and dummy qubits (light grey).",5
"composition of logical qubits for a communication bus
can be differ from that for modules according to a quan-
tum error-correcting code and a fault-tolerant quantum
computing scheme.
. system mapping
fig.",5
"shows that all data are collected in the sys-
tem layer and the performance of a quantum computing
is evaluated there.",5
"in this section, we will describe the
system mapping in terms of the gate reformulation for
the target quantum computer structure and the perfor-
mance evaluation.",5
"a specific mapping process definitely
depends on the type of quantum instructions.",5
"quantum
instructions in the hierarchically structured quantum as-
sembly code are classified into three types: -, -qubit
gate and module.",5
"the set of -qubit gates includes x , z, h , s (s†), t
(t †), rz(θ) and a preparation and a measurement in the
z basis.",5
"the mapping process for such gates is straight-
forward and can be done independently.",5
"suppose that a
hadamard gate is applied to a qubit q. if the application
of a certain quantum operation to the qubit was sched-
uled previously, the application of hadamard gate will be
performed after the previous operation.",5
"if the previous
operation was over at time t(q), then hadamard opera-
tion will start at t(q) and finish at t(q) +ht, where ht
is the execution time of the gate.",5
"this is everything for
the mapping of an -qubit gate.",5
"note that the execution
time and fidelity of a quantum gate is provided from the
building block layer.",5
"the present work deals with a cnot gate only for a
-qubit gate.",5
"even though there is a case when a swap
gate is required, it is possible to implement a swap gate
with three cnot gates.",5
"we deal with a cnot gate as a
local gate acting on two qubits located in nearest neigh-
bor.",5
"suppose that a cnot gate is applied to qubits qa
and qb.",5
"then, to execute the gate, both qubits have to
be in temporary and spatially ready status.",5
"if the are
apart, we have to move both qubits to be in neighbor
via swap operations.",5
"if one qubit is being manipu-
lated by other operation, we have to delay the cnot
operation until both qubits are in idle status.",5
"then, the
cnot operation definitely begins at max{t(qa), t(qb)},
and finishes at time max{t(qa), t(qb)} + cnott.",5
"note
that max{t(qa), t(qb} is the time both qubits become idle
status, and cnott is the execution time of a cnot
gate.",5
"the third type quantum instruction, a module, seems
like a multi-qubit composite quantum operation.",5
"there-
fore, on the surface, it seems that the mapping of a mod-
ule is very similar with the mapping of a -qubit cnot
gate.",5
"for the mapping of a module, argument qubits for
a module should be temporally and spatially ready.",5
"the
critical difference from the case of a cnot gate is that
a distinguished physical space is allocated for a module.",5
"therefore, to perform the mapping of a module, we have
to consider qubit movements between a present module
and a target module.",5
"suppose that a module a is being mapped now, and
we have to treat a quantum instruction “m (qa, qb, qc)”
that calls a module m with argument qubits qa, qb and
qc.",5
"then, we have to move the argument qubits to the
designated area of the module m . the qubit movements
are achieved by swap operations through a communica-
tion bus.",5
we call this movement a forward qubit passing.,5
"after the forward qubit passing, the qubits will be placed
at the parameter qubit section of the module m . please
see fig.",5
"quantum instructions of the module
m will then be executed.",5
"if it is faced with a quantum
instruction calling other module, then some qubits in the
module m will be passed to the designated space of the
newly called module and manipulated there by following
the quantum instructions of the module.",5
"after executing
all quantum instructions of the module m , the passed
qubits have to be back to the original module a. we
call this returning movement a backward qubit passing.",5
"shows the module operation including the for-
ward and backward qubit passings.",5
"the physical space for a module is the computing region we de-
scribed before.",5

"we perform the mapping for all modules sequentially
as they appear in a quantum assembly code.",5
"for that,
we have to keep two lookup tables, a global lookup ta-
ble and a local lookup table.",5
"for each module, we first
initialize a local lookup table for all qubits, and update
the manipulation time of each qubit as we process each
quantum instruction.",5
"after processing all instruction of
a module, we determine the execution time of the mod-
ule by picking up the maximum time among all qubits.",5
"the performance of a module is recorded in the global
lookup table.",5
"during the mapping of a module, if a mod-
ule which was already mapped is called then we can refer
the performance information of the called module from
the global lookup table.",5
"after mapping all modules, we can determine the ex-
ecution time of a quantum algorithm as the maximum
time among the qubits in the main module.",5
"(a), the execution time of the algorithm
is prepzt + fpmain→makecat + bpmain←makecat +
makecatt, where makecatt = ht + cnott.",5
"note
that fpmain→makecat (bpmain←makecat ) is the time
for the forward (backward) qubit passing.",5
"the execu-
tion time of the qubit passing depends on the distance
between modules.",5
"so far, we have described a system mapping algorithm
for a hierarchically structured quantum assembly code.",5
"by the way, the presented algorithm can be applied to
a non-structured quantum assembly code.",5
"in such code,
there are two types of quantum instructions: - and -
qubit gate.",5
"regardless of the type of a quantum assembly
code, as mentioned before the heart of the system map-
ping is ) set up a quantum computer architecture and
) recast quantum algorithm for the architecture.",5
"to be
compatible with the quantum assembly code, a simple
qubit array such as a regular -dimensional lattice may
be enough.",5

mapping on an arbitrary qubit layout as shown in fig.",5

"in this work, we set both

[[, , ]] steane code encodes logical quantum informa-
tion in a qubit into seven physical qubits, and protects
it from an arbitrary -qubit quantum noise.",5
"since the
transversal implementations for a logical hadamard and
a logical cnot gate are supported, many studies on the
fault-tolerant quantum computing based on the steane
code have been conducted.",5

of a logical qubit for steane code under the -dimensional
nearest neighbor qubit interaction was proposed.",5

and modified quantum error correction.",5
"in this work, we have redesigned a logical qubit with
 physical qubits.",5
"seven among them are used for hold-
ing data, and the others are temporarily used for log-
ical operations and error correction.",5
"in particular, we
applied the shor quantum error correction [] that ex-
ploits -qubit shor state for the syndrome measurement.",5
"for that, we prepare and verify the shor state [].",5
"we
implemented the preparation of a logical state by follow-
ing ref.",5
"most of logical gates are implemented as
transversal gates, and the non-clifford t gate is imple-
mented by exploiting a magic state.",5
"we generate magic
states by employing a -qubit shor state without magic
state distillation [].",5
"accuracy threshold theorem [, ] says that if we have
a quantum device of physical error rate below a code
threshold, it is possible to achieve an arbitrarily reliable
quantum computing.",5
"but, for a very large-sized quan-
tum algorithm, encoding only once may not be enough.",5
"fortunately, by encoding a qubit recursively [], we can
lower the effective error rate to the degree where a reli-
able quantum computing is possible.",5

for factoring a -bit integer.",5

shows .",5

when the physical error rate is −.",5
"the algorithm exe-
cution time, as shown in section vii b, is reduced as the
physical error rate decreases.",5
"we believe the reasons for such enormous gap between
both estimations are as follows.",5
"first, our analysis is
based on all quantum gates included in shor algorithm
but their analysis focuses on the toffoli gates only.",5
"in
our estimation, the proportion of transversal gates takes
about  % (# transversal gates/# total gates), in other

cnot gates can be performed in parallel without any
path conflicts, but we applied a braiding operation at
a time to avoid conflicts between other braiding paths.",5

gates can be performed in parallel in ideal case.",5

passing over distant modules, but they do not.",5

we have applied d round quantum error correction where
the code distance d is determined based on the physical
error rate, but they did not.",5

"in
what follows, we simply compare the steane code and
surface code in light of quantum resource without con-
sidering their theoretical foundation.",5

parison, we assumed the error rate of physical device is

quantum computing completely depends on a quantum
computer architecture.",5

ence in quantum resource only by a fault-tolerant quan-
tum computing, we also compare the situation where a
non-local qubit interaction is allowed.",5
"as shown in the
figure, in the small input size, the steane code quantum
computing requires less time and qubits than the surface
code quantum computing.",5
"this is because of the non-
locality of multi-qubit operation.",5

increases, the surface code quantum computing shows
the better performance than the steane code quantum
computing even non-local qubit interaction is allowed.",5

within three measurement operations.",5

ing methods with realistic quantum computer.",5

they achieved that the total number of quantum gates

show how the proposed decomposition affects the execu-

compile algorithm itself requires more qubits, by reduc-
ing the algorithm execution time and increasing the fi-
delity of a quantum computing simultaneously, in total
less qubits are required.",5

efficient compile in the steane code quantum computing.",5

ficient compile in the surface code quantum computing.",5

work.",5

cause there always exists the difference in the code dis-
tance.",5

distance lowers to , ,  from , ,  respectively.",5
"b. accurate quantum gates
previously, we basically assumed that physical error
rate is − for steane code quantum computing and
− for surface code quantum computing.",5
"in this sec-
tion, we show what happens in a quantum computing if
we have more accurate quantum device.",5
"for that we show
the performance evaluations based on the physical error
rates − ∼ − for steane code quantum computing
and based on the physical error rates over − ∼ −.",5
"shows the steane code quantum computing
performance over physical error rates − ∼ −.",5
"we
also compare a physical quantum computing to those
fault-tolerant quantum computings at the physical er-
ror rate −.",5
"the performance improvement by low-
ering the error rate from − to − is highly non-
trivial because the required concatenation level is re-
duced from  and  to  in both case respectively.",5
"but,
lowering the error rate more does not lead to the bet-
ter fault-tolerant quantum computing performance.",5
"in
other words, the fault-tolerant quantum computing in
the physical error rate − does not show any advan-
tage against the quantum computing in the physical er-
ror rate −.",5
"this is because as the physical error
rate lowers the fault-tolerant quantum computings with
the same concatenation level achieves very high fidelity
(> .).",5
"if both quantum computings are performed with
the same concatenation level, both have the same single
round quantum computing time.",5
"in that case, if there is
no big difference between fidelities, the average quantum
computing tavg will be very similar.",5

"physical quantum computing shows the better perfor-
mance than a fault-tolerant quantum computing because
the physical quantum computing already achieves high
fidelity.",5

puting in the error rate − is .",5

"in the figure, we also compare the
required code distance.",5
"as shown in the figure, as the
physical error rates lowers, the required code distance
decreases and therefore the performance increases.",5
"but,
since the code distance is already too low,  or , there
is not enough room for the performance improvement as
the gate is improved more.",5
"c. degree of fault tolerance
accuracy threshold theorem [, ] says that if we have
quantum device of physical error rates below a threshold,
it is possible to achieve an arbitrary long quantum com-
putation is possible.",5
"by applying a recursive concate-
nated coding [], we can lower the effective error rate to
where a reliable quantum computing is possible.",5
"as we
increase the concatenation level, the fidelity of a quan-
tum computing also definitely improves.",5
"but, the dura-
tion of a quantum computing is also increased by raising
a concatenation level.",5
"therefore, the higher concatena-
tion level does not always make the better quantum com-
puting possible.",5
"shows that there exists a rec-
ommendation for the concatenation level in the steane
code quantum computing, in particular for a quantum
computing time.",5
"the number of qubits unconditionally
becomes larger as the concatenation level increases.",5
"in case of a surface code quantum computing, the per-
formance completely depends on the code distance.",5
"the
code distance is determined to satisfy the objective fi-
delity of a quantum computing, but in most case the
accuracy of the quantum computing by the chosen code
distance exceeds than the target fidelity.",5
"in this regards,
on considering the averaged quantum computing time
tavg, the chosen code distance may not bring the best
quantum computing performance as shown in the steane
code case.",5
"shows that the surface code quantum comput-
ing has the best performance with a code distance ,
but the code distance determined by the equation is .",5
"even though the code distance determined from the tar-
get fidelity .",5
"is , the goal of a quantum computing is
to find an exact answer, not a probable answer.",5
"by ap-
plying the code distance , we can reduce the quantum
computing time as much as  days than the case of
the code distance  at the cost of qubits.",5
"discussion
we have proposed an integrated method for analyzing
the performance and the resource of a quantum comput-
ing.",5
"in particular, by considering practically running a
quantum algorithm on a quantum computer hardware
of a specific system architecture, we have obtained the
most realistic performance and resource where the ef-
fects by all of fully decomposed algorithm, fault-tolerant
scheme and system architecture are involved.",5
"for that,
we have proposed and developed a quantum comput-
ing framework composed of three functional layers where
each layer plays a definite role of a quantum comput-
ing.",5
"by exploiting the framework, we can configure a
quantum computing model by selecting specific proto-
col and/or properties.",5
"by doing so, we can analyze not
only the performance and resource of a quantum com-
puting, but also the impact of specific components on
the entire quantum computing.",5
"at the error rate −, as shown in this figure, a fault-tolerant
quantum computing is not required.",5
"discussed optimal concatenation level and code distance
of fault-tolerant quantum computing.",5
"we believe such
discussion was possible due to the proposed framework.",5
"the analysis results completely depend on the proto-
cols and properties of physical device we employed.",5
"as
shown in the figures, the quantity of the required qubits
is too enormous and the execution time is too long.",5
"the
feasibility of a quantum computing seems too bad from
our analysis results.",5
"however, we need to emphasize that
the very those figures are not so important now.",5
"readers
need to see the tendency of the analysis results as the in-
put size of a quantum algorithm increases.",5
"as quantum
computing components are being improved, the analysis
results will be better than the shown in this work, but
the tendency may be stayed.",5
"as mentioned above, the objective of the present work
is to provide the most realistic performance and resource
of a quantum computing.",5
"on the other hand, we believe
the proposed software framework can play a significant
role in practically running a quantum computing with a
real quantum computing hardware later if some compo-
nents are added (see fig.",5
"for example, components
to control a real quantum device have to be added in the
building block layer.",5
"the system layer also requires func-
tions that execute a quantum algorithm and a quantum
error correction efficiently.",5
"besides, the existing compo-
nents have to be improved as much as possible.",5

"considering the pace of development happening in the domain of qcps
it is pertinent to investigate how will the large scale professional development
of quantum software be different (or similar) to building software for classical
computing platforms.",5
"some of the important questions in this context could be:
.",5
"what are the key characteristics of qcps which are efficacious for software
development?
.",5
"in what way does a qcp affect the quality attributes (and non-functional
requirements) of quantum software applications?
.",5
"what type of software architectures are suitable for quantum software?
.",5
"how to assess the suitability of a qcp for a given computing problem/task?
.",5
how do qcps affect sdlc activities?,5
"for instance, do the classical ap-
proaches apply as-is for testing and verification of quantum software?
.",5
"what type of software development processes and methods would be suited
for building quantum software?",5
"in this paper we address the first two question via in-depth examination of
the qcps available today.
. method of research
the central idea underlying our approach for finding answers for these ques-
tions is as follows: in order to build various qas into a software application
a software architect (in)directly leverages (or mitigates) the characteristics of
the target computing platform for which the software application is being built.",5
"consider this example: building the performance qa into an application often
demands exploiting parallelism present in a problem/task.",5
"however, if the tar-
get computing platform does not offer multiprocessing (e.g.",5
"if it has only one
single-core cpu) then the application will not be able to truly realize the qa
of performance.",5
"a proficient software architect must know: i) which all charac-
teristics of a computing platform affect different qas for an application, and ii)
how are the qas affected.",5
"which characteristics) is relatively straight for-
ward – one mainly needs to examine in detail the available literature and software
artifacts of a computing platform for identifying its key characteristics.",5
"however,
the point-ii is not as straight forward to address.",5
"we take the following two-step
approach for addressing point-ii (i.e.",5
"determining how a qa is affected by plat-
form characteristics):
.",5
"examine the definition and general scenario[, part-ii] for a qa to identify
the cause-and-effect relationships[], if any, between platform characteris-
tics and the qa.
. examine[,] the design tactics prescribed[, part-ii] for realizing a qa
to identify the above relationships.",5
application of this approach is demonstrated in §.,5
"where we determine the
impact of qcp characteristics on various qas.",5
"the structure of our paper broadly reflects how we carried out this study:
in § we present the quantum computing basics that are relevant from the per-
spective of developing quantum software, and bring out the general architecture
of a qcp.",5
"we discuss the techniques which are exploited by currently known
quantum algorithms, and present the quantum programming model in §.",5
"char-
acteristics of qcps have been determined in §.",5
the effect of these characteristics on qas.,5
"quantum computing platforms
determining software architectural aspects of quantum software development re-
quires deeper comprehension of important differences between the classical and
the quantum computers.",5
"though a detailed treatment of theoretical underpin-
ning of quantum phenomenon and computing is available in standard quantum
computing texts such as [], we present quantum computing concepts that are
necessary for our discussion.
. what makes quantum computing different
a classical computer stores and processes information in the form of binary
bits ( and ).",5
"at a physical level a bit is realized using suitable properties
(e.g.",5
"an n bit memory cell in
a classical computer can potentially represent n different symbols, but at any
moment it can represent only one of these n possibilities.",5
"information on a
quantum computer is represented/stored using quantum bits (or qubits).",5
"these
qubits are physically realized via suitable physical phenomena that obey the
laws of quantum mechanics.",5
"examples of such phenomena can be: the spin of a
single electron or the configuration of an individual ion.",5
"a qubit can be observed
in one of the two basis states which are labeled as |〉 or a |〉.",5
"normally, the
qubit state |〉 corresponds to classical bit , and |〉 to classical  bit.",5
"one of the
remarkable properties of qubits, which makes quantum computers much faster
than classical computers, is the number of possible states in which the qubit
can exist (different from its observable state, which can be only one of the basis
states).",5
"at any instant one qubit can be in a |〉, a |〉 state, or any quantum
superposition[] of the two.",5
"in other words, the basis states |〉 and |〉 and their
linear combinations x |〉+ y |〉 describe the possible states of a single qubit.",5
"in
contrast, one classical bit at one time can be only in one of the two possible
states: a  or .",5
"another quantum property that is exploited by quantum computing is en-
tanglement of qubits.",5
"two or more individually independent quantum objects
are said to be entangled when: a) their individual behavior is random, but at the
same time b) it is too strongly correlated despite each object being independent
from the other.",5
"a multi-qubit state that cannot be expressed as a list of the
individual constituent qubits is an entangled state.",5
"consider the bell state[]
qq := (|〉+ |〉)/
√
.",5
it is an example of an entangled two-qubit state.,5
"there
is no way of expressing it as a list of one-qubit states.",5
"suppose you measure
(along some axis) one of the qubits, say q, that comprise this entangled state.",5
it will behave randomly: in this case q can be |〉 or |〉 with equal probability.,5
suppose you measured q to be |〉 then value of q will certainly be |〉.,5
"that is,
you can predict exactly how the other qubit, q, would behave if measured along
the same axis.",5
"no unentangled state exhibits this type of perfect correlation with
perfect individual randomness.",5
"the above two properties – quantum superposition and quantum entangle-
ment – are thus very useful resources in quantum computing.
. general architecture
physical quantum computing machinery of today (reminiscent of early classical
computers of s) are big in size[].",5
"it requires special physical environment
and conditions for operating correctly.",5
"the general architecture of a qcp can
be depicted as shown in fig. . it comprises of five layers three of which contain
purely quantum hardware and circuitry and two consist of classical hardware
and software:
.",5
"quantum layers[,,] one can think of these layers as comprising the
quantum processing unit (qpu).",5
"(a) physical building blocks – includes quantum hardware which typically
makes use of superconducting loops for physical realization of qubits.",5
"in addition, it also contains the physical qubit coupler/interconnect cir-
cuitry among other elements which are needed for qubit addressing and
control operations.",5
"(b) quantum logic gates – physical circuitry[, §.]",5
"that makes up quan-
tum logic gates[].",5
"(c) quantum-classical interface – it includes the hardware and software
which provides interfacing between classical computers and a qpu.
. classical layers[,,,]
(a) quantum programming environment – it provides items such as: i) quan-
tum assembly language necessary for instructing a qpu, ii) the program-
ming abstractions needed for writing quantum programs in a high-level
programming language and iii) simulator support as well as ides etc.",5
"(b) business applications – quantum software applications written to cater
for business requirements.",5
fig. . architecture of quantum computing platform.,5
"developing quantum software applications
in preceding section we introduced the two fundamental properties – quantum
superposition and quantum entanglement – which make a quantum computer
much faster than classical computers at solving certain types of problems.",5
"nature
of these two properties inherently make quantum computation to be mostly
probabilistic in nature.",5
"thus, implying that quantum programs are likely to be
probabilistic or randomized in nature.",5
"as such, expressing the logic or algorithm
which is to be executed on a quantum computer requires special techniques and
programming model.
. quantum algorithms – the key to harnessing power of qcps
usefulness of quantum programs lies in their ability to exploit the fundamental
characteristics (superposition and entanglement of qubits) of a quantum com-
puter.",5
"over the past few decades quantum computing researchers have developed
a handful of techniques[] that exploit the characteristics of quantum computers
for quickly solving certain problems that take much longer to solve on a classical
computer.",5
"some of these techniques and example algorithms that exploit them
are shown in table-.",5
"there are several algorithms available today which exploit these techniques
to solve variety of computing problems much faster than a classical computer.",5
"in order to derive benefit from the capabilities of quantum computer one must
map the problem at hand to one of the problems for which a quantum algorithm
is known.",5
"techniques used by quantum algorithms

torization problem in polynomial time (shor’s al-

"quantum circuits[] is one of the common models for representing quan-
tum computation.",5
"similar to digital logic gates which are employed by classical
computers, quantum gates are used to compose a quantum circuit.",5
"in this model
the steps of a quantum algorithm can be expressed as a sequence of quantum
logic gates.",5
"each quantum logic gate transforms the input qubits in a well de-
fined manner, typically expressed a operations on matrices and vectors.",5
"ibm
q-experience[] takes this approach to expressing quantum computations.",5
"we observe that a quantum program typically comprises of parts some of
which execute on a classical cpu and some on a quantum processing unit
(qpu).",5
"creating such quantum programs mainly involved the following tasks:
.",5
"the steps are repeated suitable number of
times to get a reliable measurement of the outcomes.
. measure the output qubits state (measuring a qubit forces it to collapse into
a classical bit) and transfer it to the classical bits.",5
"a suitable high-level programming api or instructions[,,] are typically
used for composing the quantum programs.",5
"based on these observation a quan-
tum programming model as shown in fig.",5
"we also checked
the adherence to this programming model by manually examining the sample
quantum programs that are supplied by different qcps we considered.",5
"quantum software architecture
.",5
"characteristics of a quantum computing platform
in order to understand the effect of qcps on software architecture it is necessary
to identify all those characteristics of a qcp which can affect the development,
deployment, operation and management of quantum software.",5
"some such characteristics of the qcps of today are:
.",5
"platform heterogeneity – the published technical details of different
qcps[,,,] that are available today show the heterogeneous nature of
the qcps.",5
"considering certain limitations such as various no-go theorems[,]
that quantum phenomenon obey, dependency on classical hardware/software
is inevitable.",5
"thus, the qpus are expected to be inherently heterogeneous
in nature.",5
"that is, both classical as well as quantum hardware and software
are involved.
. physical environment – the quantum hardware requires a completely dif-
ferent type of physical environment.",5
"most of the existing implementations[,,,]
of quantum hardware circuitry make use of superconducting loops requiring
ultra-low temperatures.",5
"achieving and maintaining such physical conditions
necessitates very specialized environment for reliable operation of a qcp.
. large form factor – due to requirement of special physical environment,
quantum computers of today are very large in size.",5
"for instance, the main
box of d-wavetmq system measures[] roughly ’x’x’.
. energy efficiency – energy consumption can be looked at from two main
aspects: energy consumed by the qpu itself, and secondly the energy re-
quirements for cooling and other ancillary circuitry which make up a quan-
tum computer.",5
"it has been observed that a quantum computer spends[]
most of its energy on cooling.",5
"a qpu by itself, however, consumes much less
energy[].",5
as the computation speeds grow to exascale (i.e.,5
"petaflops),
the energy consumption of a qpu is not expected to increase as fast as that
of a cpu/gpu.",5
"experiments conducted with d-wave’s -qubit system
showed[] overall energy efficiency improvements of the order of x in
comparison to state-of-the-art classical computing servers when considering
pure computation time for running specialized algorithms.
. lower level of the programming abstractions – the programming
abstractions offered by qcps of today[,,,] are of a low level.",5
"that is,
a programmer has to work at the level of quantum logic gates (usually via
a high-level language representation of it) when expressing computational
steps that he/she wants to execute via a qpu.
. remote software development and deployment – programming tools
such as ides, debuggers, simulators etc.",5
"that a software developer can use to
create quantum software are invariably cloud based[,].",5
"only a very limited
portion[,] of the quantum programming tools stack can be deployed
and used on a programmer’s local machine.",5
"for development and testing of
production-ready quantum software a programmer typically requires access
to a remote qcp environment.
. dependency on quantum algorithms – to exploit the real potential
of quantum computers a programmer has to express the logic of his/her
software using quantum algorithms.",5
"a computing task where one is looking
to gain speedup by running it on a qcp is typically mapped to or broken
into another task(s) for which a quantum algorithm(s) is known.
. limited portability of software – quantum computing platforms are
themselves in their infancy, though under rapid growth.",5
"as such there is lack
of standards that are necessary for developing quantum programs which can
be executed transparently on different qpus.",5
"as such practical quantum
software which depends on availability of a reliable quantum network would
be hard to achieve.
. lack of native quantum operating system – the quantum processors
are still controlled via classical computing operating systems[].",5
"we do not
yet have mature multitasking and multiprocessing capabilities available for
quantum processors.",5
"most existing qcps[,,,] expose the quantum
gates and qubits for direct manipulation by programmers.",5
"mature protocols
and apis that implement, for example, practical timesharing of a quantum
processing unit (qpu) are not available yet[].",5
"similarly, quantum algo-
rithms which may exploit multiple qpus in parallel is yet to be explored.
. limited multitasking and multiprocessing – this follows from the lack
of native quantum operating systems.",5
"a programmer has to rely on classical
computer’s os for achieving any type of multitasking and multiprocessing
on a given set of qpus.
. fundamentally different programming model – as discussed in §,
quantum programs are inherently probabilistic.",5
"a programmer looking to
harness power of a qcp must identify or design suitable quantum algorithms
which are can solve the problem at hand.
. dependency on classical storage – though limited time storage of entan-
gled qubits is feasible[,], long term persistence of qubits in passive media
is still not possible.",5
"besides, it is not feasible to store arbitrary non-entangled
qubits due to different no-go theorems such as no-teleportation[, page ],
no-cloning[] and no-deleting[] theorems.",5
"thus, permanent persistence of
critical data in quantum programs still requires classical storage devices.
. effect on quality attributes
quality attributes (qa) may be described as the factors which have system-wide
impact on an application’s architecture, implementation as well as operation[].",5
"the qas that are of concern for a majority of applications may be categorized
depending on whether they affect design-, runtime-, system- or user- qualities of
the application[,].",5
"the overall design and quality of a large majority of software applications can
be considered good when the applications possess a reasonable level of at least
the following qas[,,]: performance, reliability, scalability, security and
usability.",5
"however, based on our experience, we considered a slightly expanded
list of qas when examining how they are affected on a qcp:
.",5
"usability
in subsequent paragraphs we discuss only those aspects of a qa that are rel-
evant for identifying how the qa is affected by various characteristics of qcps.",5
we take each of the qcp characteristics identified in §.,5
"in turn and discuss how
it affects various qas under consideration.",5
"a characteristic may be considered
favorable, unfavorable or neutral for building a qa into an application.",5
"summary
of the qa impact of various characteristics of qcps is shown in table-.",5
"platform heterogeneity: heterogeneity makes it difficult to implement
high cohesion in software.",5
"therefore, qas such as maintainability, reliabil-
ity, robustness, reusability, and understandability get adversely affected due
to low cohesion.",5
"heterogeneous environment also means more number of dis-
parate elements (software and hardware) to managed thus adversely affecting
manageability and testability of the system.
. special physical environment: a highly specialized physical environment
needed by a qcp is difficult to create, maintain and operate.",5
"effect of am-
bient noise/interference is more pronounced in case of qpus than it is on
cpus.",5
"such properties have adversely affect on the qas such as availability
 a detailed description and properties of individual qas is readily available in stan-
dard software architecture literature such as [,,] etc.",5

"due to “brittle” nature of physical qubits), manageability, scalability

"due to difficulties in quickly launching additional qpu instances) and
testability of the system.
. large form factor: most of the qas, except scalability, remain unaffected
by this property of qcps.",5
"working at such low levels of abstractions is not easy and increases complex-
ity of the code.",5
"moreover, there are not many (as of today at least) expert
quantum programmers.",5
"this in turn adversely affects qas such as maintainability, testability, relia-
bility and availability.
. remote software development and deployment: a major implication
of qcps on testing and debugging arises due to the non-local nature of
a real quantum computer.",5
"the development tools/environment used for a
qcp are sort of distributed.",5
"the decentralized (typically, offered via a cloud
based ide) and heterogeneous nature of the development environment will
make programing, testing and debugging of quantum programs slower and
tedious[].",5
"this adversely affects maintainability and testability.
. dependency on quantum algorithms: probabilistic nature of quan-
tum computations and the results they produce adversely affect testability
and interoperability (with classical software).",5
"synthesizing realistic pairs of
〈input, expected output〉 for test case scenarios as well as reproducing the
defects that one wants to debug requires special approaches.",5
"moreover, there are very few[] – only about a dozen – quantum algorithms
known for different types of problems.",5
"software engineers have to map their
problems to one of the existing few quantum algorithms.",5
"this adversely
affects the ability to perform enhancement and corrective maintenance.
. limited portability of software: quantum computing, though rapidly
evolving, is still in its infancy.",5
"it lacks standardization in several areas rang-
ing from high-level programming apis to low-level hardware.",5
"for example,
a quantum program written using rigetti’s quantum isa[] may not be ex-
ecutable on open qasm[] supported by ibm.",5
"as such the portability of
software is adversely affected on qcps.",5
"lack of portability in turn adversely
affects availability, interoperability, maintainability and scalability.
. limited quantum networking: a reliable quantum network is necessary
for building reliable and high-performance quantum software.",5
"quantum net-
works not yet production ready [,].",5
"thus, the performance, scalability,
reliability and, in turn, availability will be adversely affected.
. lack of native quantum operating system: a native operating sys-
tem helps in harnessing full potential of a hardware in a secure and effective
manner.",5
this is lacking[] in case of qcps.,5
"it prohibits, for instance, practi-
cal timesharing of a qpu.",5
"thus, the performance, manageability, reliability,
scalability and security will be adversely affected.
. fundamentally different programming model: quantum programs are
inherently probabilistic and requires a fundamentally different approach to
programming (please see §.",5
"this affects the ease of use of the underly-
ing technology and in turn the code complexity both of which are important
factors that influence[] development and maintenance of dependable soft-
ware.",5
"as such a qcp adversely affects maintainability, interoperability, security
and testability qas.
. dependency on classical storage: for durably persisting critical data
the quantum programs depend on classical storage devices due to different
no-go theorems such as no-teleportation[, page ], no-cloning[] and
no-deleting[] theorems.",5
"on a qcp this adversely affects manageability,
performance and scalability.
. threats to validity
quantum computing is a fast evolving area of technology.",5
"the characteristics of
qcps that we have identified are based on the study of currently available state-
of-the-art quantum hardware and software.",5
"we expect advances in quantum
computing will invalidate at least few of these characteristics in coming years.",5
"for example, the production-ready native quantum operating systems are likely
to be feasible in the years to come.",5
"further, the list of characteristics that we have given is not an exhaustive list.",5
"it is quite likely that there are additional qcp characteristics which, taken to-
gether, may be of significance in specific software development scenarios.",5
"another
point that we would like to highlight is that our findings are derived from: a) pub-
lished information about qcps and b) experimental programming on the qcps
accessible to us.",5
"it is likely that there are unpublished features/information about
those qcps which can affect the software architecture of quantum software ap-
plications.",5
"next, we have not covered every qa which is relevant for a wider
set of application types.",5
"there may be qas such as auditability, distributability,
extensibility etc.",5
which are relevant and may be affected by the qcps.,5
"lastly,
our own experience and know-how as software architects has influenced to some
extent what we identified as the effect of different qcps on various qas.",5
"conclusions
programmers’ interest in applying quantum computing has surged in the recent
past.",5
"leveraging this technology in solving general purpose business problems
requires deeper understanding of important characteristics of qcps, particularly
those which are relevant for software development.",5
"we have shown that the key characteristics of a qcp make it different from
a classical computing platform.",5
"for instance, availability and know-how of quan-
tum algorithm(s) for solving a task at hand are a hard requirement for devel-
oping quantum programs.",5
"such characteristics of a qcp affect various quality
attributes (qas) of the quantum application software.",5
"the qcp characteristics
such as limited portability of quantum programs, lack of native quantum oper-
ating system services, dependency on quantum algorithms and so on, adversely
affect the ability to realize various qas such as scalability, portability, testability
and maintainability etc.",5
of the quantum application software.,5
"the qas that are
favorably impacted by qcp characteristics include performance and scalability.",5
"overall, the specialized nature of qcps appears to have a significant impli-
cation: it limits the use of qcps for very specialized application areas where
performance qa is of chief importance.",5
"however, because the quantum com-
puting is undergoing rapid development we expect that the evolution of this
technology will likely introduce additional concerns and factors which may af-
fect the architecture of quantum software applications.",5
"to make blind quantum computing protocols verifi-
able, mainly two different types of techniques have been
used.",5
"the first type is so called the trap technique [, ].",5
"alice hides some isolated qubits, which are called “trap
qubits”, in the register, and later checks that trap qubits
are not disturbed by bob.",5
"since bob does not know the
place of each trap qubit, he will disturb a trap qubit
with high probability if he deviates from the correct pro-
cedure.",5
"if the quantum computation is encoded with
a quantum error correcting code, the probability that
bob can change a logical state without changing any trap
qubit becomes exponentially small [].",5
"(if bob wants to
change the state of a logical qubit, he has to change more
than d qubits, where d is the code distance.",5
"it increases
the probability of he touching a trap qubit.)",5
"the second type of the technique is called the stabilizer
test [, , , ].",5
"in the mf protocol, bob generates
graph states and sends each qubit one by one to alice.",5
"al-
ice randomly choses some of graph states and checks the
correctness of them by measuring stabilizer operators of
the graph state.",5
"such tests can be done with only single-
qubit measurements of pauli operators [, , , ].",5
"[, , , ] that if alice passes
the stabilizer test, a remaining state is close to the ideal
graph state on which she can do universal measurement-
based quantum computing.",5
"in this way, delegated quantum computing has two
important properties, the blindness and the verifiability.",5

the blindness was believed to be necessary to achieve the
verifiability, but recently the belief has turned out to be
wrong, since a protocol that is verifiable but not neces-
sarily blind has been found [].",5

the solution of a problem, and the feynman-kitaev his-
tory state [] corresponding to the quantum circuit that
solves the problem or its complement circuit [].",5

verifier can verify the correctness of the solution by mea-
suring the energy of a local hamiltonian on the history
state.",5

done with only single qubit measurements of pauli op-
erators [].",5

history states corresponding to the solving circuit and
the complement circuit by using the given universal blind
quantum computing protocol, and asks bob to send them
to alice.",5

rectness at the same time by measuring their energies.",5

learning motivation during collaborative projects may vary depending upon the group and its collaborative success.,6

the introduction of robots alone cannot influence students’ minds or directly influence their learning; therefore, 
changes have to be made in the learning environment to support the collaborative robotics projects.",6
"while motivation is a complex construct, for the purpose of this study, 
learning motivation was defined as motivation for students to take an active role in and a responsibility for their own

learning motivation in robotics 
 
the hands-on nature and materials in the elementary engineering lab seem to provide sufficient motivation to some 
students (petre & price, ).",6
"however, researchers continually turn to instructional methods that involve a problem, 
meaningful units, and are cross-curricular in order to motivate and engage other students (blumenfeld et al., ).",6
"the role of facilitator becomes critical in robotics projects to 
help sustain student motivation and promote the desired higher level learning (blumenfeld et al., ).",6
"when students 
have the necessary collaborative provisions in order to create a supportive classroom environment during robotics 
projects, the results can positively impact student learning motivation (yuen et al., ).",6
"student motivation 
contributes to successfully learning and retaining the content (mohr-schroeder et al., ).",6
"the use of robotics in the 
classroom has the potential to motivate students to learn, however, it must be noted that the introduction of robotics 
alone does not guarantee positive student impacts (eguchi, ).",6
"indeed, the teacher must shift to a new role and 
implement appropriate instructional practices in order to support the learning process, collaboration, and to promote 
the benefits of student learning and motivation (blumenfeld et al., ; yuen et al., ).",6
"with teachers taking on new roles as facilitators in the shifting learning environment, students are also asked to take 
on new roles as collaborators.",6
"the new roles allow students to take a more active role in their own knowledge 
development when participating in constructivist and problem-based learning, which increases motivation (barker & 
this is an author-produced, peer-reviewed version of this article.",6
"not only do students have the opportunity to be active learners, they also have the potential to positively impact student 
learning and motivation through peer collaboration (blumenfeld et al., ; eguchi, ; robinson, ).",6
"small 
group settings for robotics necessitates social and peer interaction.",6
"with scaffolding and direction for students on 
successful collaboration, robotics has the potential to promote quality social interactions which support successful 
collaboration and increase motivation (denis & hubert, ; hwang & wu, ).",6
"if the nature of robotics is not 
motivating enough for students, the collaborative nature of robotics projects, constructivist learning, and problem-
based learning may offer social interactions that support and maintain student motivation (slangen et al., ; yuen 
et al., ).",6
"the collaborative robotics projects in the elementary engineering lab integrate characteristics of 
constructivist and problem-based learning that have been shown to motivate student learning and engage students in 
the learning process.",6
"collaborative problem solving in robotics 
 
while there are opportunities in the elementary engineering lab to practice problem solving individually, the fourth 
and fifth grade robotics projects rely heavily on collaborative problem solving.",6
"collaborative problem solving is 
defined by mills et al.",6
"() as a process where peers construct new knowledge together that neither of them had 
prior knowledge of before working together.",6
"by practicing collaborative problem solving in real world applications 
with peer and teacher support, students may improve their problem solving skills and possibly transfer learning across 
content areas (jordan & mcdaniel, ; mills et al., ; petre & price, ).",6
"utilizing 
the design process for identifying a problem and developing a robotic solution can increase students’ use of critical 
thinking and problem solving skills (barak & zadok, ; barker & ansorge, ; castledine & chalmers, ; 
jordan & mcdaniel, ).",6
"in addition, researchers argue that acquiring problem solving and critical thinking skills 
is essential for students’ futures (castledine & chalmers, ).",6
"nelson () emphasized there is more than content 
preparation needed to implement robotics projects, some of which are less tangible.",6
"if these less tangible preparations 
are addressed through the implementation of effective strategies, additional student benefits can be achieved with 
skills-transfer (nelson, ).",6
"understanding the characteristics of collaborative problem solving will assist in determining what scaffolds, less 
tangible preparations, would best support student learning.",6
"since collaborative problem solving is a form of problem 
solving requiring peer interactions (mills et al., ) students need to ask questions, gather information, and reflect 
on what they have learned in order to solve a problem (somyürek, ).",6
"though the process may seem simple 
enough, it requires complex skills (somyürek, ).",6
"in fact, problem solving is a complex phenomenon that utilizes 
both conscious and unconscious processes as well as combinations of explicit knowledge and intuition (barak & 
zadok, ).",6
"however, the process can be simplified for students by breaking problem solving into a series of steps 
(mills et al., ).",6
"another potential support for collaborative problem solving is the use of language to promote the 
collaboration and the development of newly co-constructed knowledge (mills et al., ).",6
"the potential benefits for 
collaborative robotics projects to facilitate groupwork, problem solving, and critical thinking may be supported 
through language scaffolds (hwang & wu, ; mills et al., ).",6
"while collaborative problem solving may prove 
to be a challenge for students because of the complexities, experiences with collaborative problem solving allow 
students to develop group solutions to meet the common group goal (denis & hubert, ; jordan & mcdaniel, 
; mills et al., ).",6
"however, the uncertainties of collaborative problem solving may also create barriers to 
students’ development of solutions (jordan & mcdaniels, ).",6
"jordan and mcdaniels () determine that teacher 
and peer support is critical for managing the uncertainties of collaborative problem solving.",6
"students’ ability to reflect 
on and relate problem solving strategies in relation to real world contexts could boost confidence levels in the subject 
area (castledine & chalmers, ).",6
"students may need the boost in confidence to feel comfortable sharing ideas and 
assisting with the project.",6
"the collaborative problem solving and the group work required with robotics projects may also make it more difficult 
to identify individual student progress.",6
"teachers must closely monitor individual students, their understanding, and 
their performance in order to support successful projects (eguchi, ).",6
"papert () identifies ways in which to 
guide student thinking, but cautions that problem solving cannot be as simple as memorizing a procedure, such as a 
math algorithm, because the variety of problems are always changing.",6
"in addition, papert () reminds us that 
students do not have to give up old methods to learn new ones.",6
"furthermore, structured thinking is powerful thinking 
this is an author-produced, peer-reviewed version of this article.",6
"doi: ./ 
  
and is not a skill that all students develop when left to construct their own knowledge (papert, ).",6
"the role of the 
teacher, as facilitator, then, is to develop the proper balance as well as organize the instructional plan to support the 
learning process.",6
"providing students with the means to comfortably share and participate within the group can make 
collaborative problem solving a better experience for all involved.",6
"science process skills in robotics 
 
while instruction in the elementary engineering lab focuses on engineering, the use of cross-curricular instruction is 
also a priority in order to develop connections for the students between the general classroom and the engineering lab.",6
"nelson () identified the scientific method and engineering as primary rationales for stem education and robotics 
integration.",6
"fortunately, integration of science skills fits easily within engineering and robotics instruction (eguchi, 
; papert, ).",6
"for instance, robotics helps students master various concept areas, depending upon how the 
robotic instruction is developed.",6
"as a result, multiple student benefits are possible by using robotics as cross-curricular 
activities (eguchi, ).",6
"the structure of collaborative robotics projects and robotic materials provide an opportunity 
to focus student learning on engineering (bers, ; jordan & mcdaniel, ; petre & price, ; ringwood et 
al., ; yuen et al., ).",6
"with the cross-curricular potential of robotics, the use of a collaborative robotics project 
can easily combine science and engineering in addition to creating connections between the elementary engineering 
lab and the general classroom.",6
"these skills are applicable and valuable for 
engineering, science, and the general classroom setting.",6
"in addition to the identified three main skills, benitti () 
noted robotics activities required the use of thinking skills and scientific reasoning.",6
"furthermore, sullivan () 
maintained that an appropriate open-ended instructional approach, in conjunction with the use of robotics promotes 
the use of thinking and science process skills, as well as increased systems understanding.",6
"science requires students to use language as a component of critical thinking and is necessary in order to understand 
and identify solutions for problems (mills et al., ).",6
"sullivan () suggests that the process of debugging a 
program is an ideal format for teaching science process skills.",6
"students generate hypotheses about what would work 
in the program, test it, and receive immediate feedback.",6
"the feedback starts as an iterative cycle of observation, 
hypothesis generation, testing of the hypothesis, and evaluation of the solution (sullivan, ).",6
"this is not only an 
appropriate format for teaching science process skills, but also emphasizes the real-world process scientists engage, 
while offering a different exposure to science, since typical classroom lessons do not have the iterative feedback loops 
(sullivan, ).",6
"sullivan () makes clear connections between the scientific process and the engineering design 
process by arguing that students must control variables and change only one variable at a time.",6
"this is key in the use 
of the scientific method and science process skills.",6
"a study by somyürek () indicates that during robotics 
instruction, students learn by designing and programming robots to solve problems.",6
"they use scientific skills such as 
making predictions, generating a hypothesis, conducting experiments or tests, and presenting their results.",6
"though the learning objectives for the 
collaborative robotics project may not connect specifically with science standards, implementation scaffolds and 
problem-based learning could assist the students in achieving similar beneficial learning outcomes.",6
"prior experience in robotics 
 
barak and zadok’s () comparison between expert and novice robotics problem solvers highlights the importance 
of experience level in effective design and problem solving.",6
"while this is a factor that is out of the teacher’s control, 
it is an important factor to consider for structure of the instruction.",6
"although some differentiation was provided in the 
past in the elementary engineering lab, based upon experience level, it may not have been sufficient to promote student 
success in collaborative robotics projects.",6
"eguchi () contends that it is very important to provide inexperienced 
students with supports, and in fact, emphasized the essential teacher’s role as facilitator to support inexperienced

"the roles were 
developed for educational purposes to develop a wide range of skills in each student.",6
"students were required to work 
on all areas of the collaborative robotics project rather than focusing solely on one area or on any areas of strength 
they may have had.",6
while this use of group roles is contrary to yuen et al.,6
"() recommendations of focusing on 
students’ areas of strength, the roles are used to promote new skills, as well as, developing existing areas of strength.",6
"() addressed collaborative robotics in an informal educational setting and had different instructional 
purposes for group roles.",6
"furthermore, the rotation of the roles may have increased motivation because students did 
not become complacent in one role and created a stronger support for collaborative problem solving.",6

results indicate that structure of the roles provided the necessary support and scaffold to meet the needs of the 
classroom setting while developing motivation and collaborative problem solving.",6
"the novice experience level was associated with a clear positive effect on motivation and collaborative problem 
solving.",6
"interestingly, research with experience levels in robotics suggests that the novice students would have needed 
more supports than more experienced robotics students in order to recognize the same benefits (eguchi, ), and 
yet, the novice demonstrated more positive effects.",6
"though the positive effects for the novice was less significant, 
the experienced had a decrease.",6
"perhaps the novelty of the collaborative robotics project could be responsible for 
higher post mean motivation scores.",6
"however, it is difficult to identify potential reasons for the differences in post 
mean collaborative problem solving scores.",6
"post mean scores for collaborative problem solving should have been 
higher for the experienced, and yet the experienced students showed a decrease in post mean scores while the novice 
students had a slight increase.",6

"in addition, students had to self-evaluate on the robotics expo

"while some middle schools include fifth grade students, the instrument may not have been the most appropriate 
measure for students in fourth and fifth grades.",6
"the potential issue with the instrument appropriateness may have 
made it difficult to identify effects of the interventions or experience levels.",6
"conclusion 
 
while the general method of instruction for collaborative robotics projects had promoted student benefits, there was 
a need to evaluate the general method of instruction and determine if collaborative interventions could improve student 
outcomes.",6
"additionally, with students using a form of robotics as early as first grade and the mindstorms as early as 
third grade, understanding how to support the developing experience levels is critical for on-going robotics instruction 
and development of an appropriate scope and sequence.",6
"the results indicate that the assigned group roles had a positive effect on student motivation and collaborative 
problem solving.",6
"while assigned group roles had not been previously used in the elementary engineering classroom 
for previous projects, it will be used in future instruction and adapted for use with other collaborative projects.",6
"not 
all groups used the roles as effectively, and some still struggled with the challenge of sharing the work and staying on 
task.",6
"however, the structure offered with the assigned group roles seemed to provide students with appropriate 
guidance to stay on task if desired.",6
"furthermore, the structure provided the teacher with appropriate guidance to assist 
students who may have been off task with a simple means of redirection.",6
"in the present study, assigned group roles 
was the only intervention that had printed guidelines for students to keep in their engineering notebooks.",6
"perhaps a 
printed guideline for classroom discussions could be included in the intervention to offer appropriate sentence starters, 
questions, and reminders about classroom interaction expectations in order to better support that collaboration strategy.",6

"the 
status of novice was associated with positive effects and consistently outperformed the status of experienced.",6
"understanding the supports needed for the varying experience levels is important in order to implement the appropriate 
instructional practices.",6
"it appears that additional supports are necessary for the experienced students in order for them 
to continue to make gains in learning motivation and collaborative problem solving.",6
"post mean motivations scores 
only showed an increase in the experienced for assigned group roles, and the increase was minimal.",6
"only classroom 
discussion from the experienced had increased post mean scores for collaborative problem solving; however, not at 
a significant level.",6
overall additional investigation into supports for experienced students is warranted.,6
"the identification of successful collaboration intervention for collaborative robotics projects fills a practical and 
growing need for robotics integration into the educational setting.",6
"in fact, the relevance of the study to student learning 
also added to the rigor (reeves, ).",6

insights for various problem-based collaborative environments.",6

projects.",6
"additional studies could be conducted to determine how to develop classroom discussions to produce a more 
consistent benefit to students.",6
"using claims, evidence, and reasoning in discussions to construct explanations may 
support the collaborative nature of the robotics project by reducing the potential for personal opinion to enter the 
discussions.",6
"furthermore, the claims, evidence, and reasoning discussion format supports the systematic scientific 
approach desired for scientific process skills.",6
"further research could also be conducted to improve upon the assigned 
group roles.",6

discussions and information gathering .,6
"in recent years, many educational institutions
have begun to realize the importance robotics has in the world today and have started
to integrate robotics programs into their curriculum.",6
"in  our university, worcester
polytechnic institute, was the first ever to offer a bachelor of science in robotics engineering
[].",6
"through robotics programs and industry, the field continues to grow and develop, but
these are not the only ways the field has advanced.",6
another way the field has advanced over the years is through robotics competitions.,6
"competitions cultivate a competitive and challenging environment that drive the innovation
and creativity necessary to develop new technologies.",6
"while most robotics competitions have
the intention of fostering creativity and innovation, particularly at the collegiate level, not
all of them are successful and sustainable.",6
"many collegiate robotics competitions have faced
problems that have led to renewal delays or even cancellation.",6
"these problems in part come
as a result of the rapid pace of technological advancement where challenges quickly become
obsolete.",6
"this interactive qualifying project delivers a proposal for a successful and sustainable
collegiate robotics competition hosted by worcester polytechnic institute (wpi).",6
"we have
studied the successes and failures of other competitions and have gathered information from
potential participants, sponsors, and wpi stakeholders.",6
"we have developed this competition
to increase opportunity for undergraduate involvement in cutting-edge innovation and to
elevate wpi’s peer-to-peer recognition amongst other institutions.",6
"in the pursuit of our goals, we have researched and discussed a broad range of general
questions and considerations.",6
"each of these hurdles have been addressed during the course
of our iqp:
• what do we define as a ‘successful’ collegiate robotics competition?",6
• what causes some collegiate robotics competitions to fail while others succeed?,6
• what do successful collegiate robotics competitions have in common?,6
• what do failed collegiate robotics competitions have in common?,6
"• what do events outside of the academic world, or even outside of the world of tech-
nology, do to be successful?",6
"are any of these design aspects transferable to the kind
of event we are planning?",6
"• how can we grow the scale of interest in this competition beyond people already active
in similar ones?",6
• how do we get potential sponsors interested in our competition?,6
• what can we do to encourage concrete undergraduate involvement in this competition?,6
• how will our competition interest peer institutions?,6
• what resources will be required to host our competition at wpi?,6
"by comprehensively answering these questions using effective methodology, and by learn-
ing from the triumphs and failures of others, we have created a presentable roadmap for a
realistic, implementable, and impactful collegiate robotics competition hosted by wpi.",6
"background
in order to develop a successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competition at worcester
polytechnic institute (wpi) it is important to understand the background of the school,
its robotics engineering program, and other collegiate robotics competitions.",6
"it is also
important to understand why a collegiate robotics competition hosted by wpi is relevant to
the interests of the school, and the benefits that a collegiate robotics competition hosted by
wpi can provide.
. about worcester polytechnic institute
worcester polytechnic institute, founded in , was established to provide the masses with
an exceptional science and engineering education.",6
"it was not until the late ’s that wpi
adapted its signature “plan,” combining both theory and practice.",6
"doing this arms each
student with the ability to carry a wide range of theoretical knowledge mixed with industry
experience [].",6
"wpi’s curriculum structure is designed to foster teamwork rather than
harbor competition.",6
"part of this is wpi’s innovative robotics engineering program which
began in  and was the first of its kind [].
. about wpi’s robotics engineering program
the robotics engineering program began in , offering just two courses.",6
"now it has grown
to include more than twenty courses, combining the disciplines of computer science, electrical
and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering.",6
"it awarded its four bachelor’s degrees
in  to students who had switched majors into the program.",6
"in  the program awarded
 undergraduate degrees in robotics engineering, adding to the total  bachelor’s degrees
awarded to date.",6
"in recent years the program has also expanded to the graduate level and
awarded  master’s degrees and  phds this past academic year [].
. previous and existing collegiate robotics competitions
the following section conveys research into the most relevant collegiate robotics competitions
today, providing insights into the resources needed for a collegiate robotics competition, the
potential impacts of such an event, and the potential benefits.",6
"this section also discusses
the factors that can attribute to a collegiate robotics competition’s success and provides the
groundwork for later sections where we use this information to present a solution to the
problems asserted in the introduction.",6
".. first
the first robotics competition (frc) began in  when  teams from around new
england came together for the first frc season.",6
"since then frc has seen tremendous
growth and today has , teams in  countries with over , students [].",6
"although
it is a high school competition, it is worth mentioning as it is the largest robotics competition
in the world [].",6
"frc tasks high school teams to design and build robots in six and a half weeks to play
a field game.",6
"the rules and game change every year but still fall within certain parameters,
allowing teams to reuse base robots each year and only requiring designing and building
specific components.",6
".. vexu
the vex robotics competition started in  by innovation first international to help
promote their stem education product line [].",6
"compared to the already existing first
robotics competition that was also available to high school students, the robots were much
smaller and the rules varied considerably.",6
"for example, for the first robotics competition
robots could be a maximum of  lb and individual parts could be sourced from multiple
suppliers as long as each individual part did not exceed $ in cost [, ].",6
"this differed
from the vex competition rules where there was not a weight limit and robots could not
be a larger than an xx inch cube at the start of the match only using vex brand
parts.",6
"this new competition found a home with many high school students as it was far less
expensive than first but more sophisticated than first lego league.",6
"unlike first,
the participants in vex were not limited to a six-week build season, allowing them to spend
more time working on their robot designs and going to competitions.",6
after the vex robotics competition’s first year the program continued to grow.,6
"a new
non-profit organization, recf or the robotics education and competition foundation, was
created in order to help organize competitive events.",6
"this allowed for the competition to
expand to middle school and internationally, with more than , teams from more than
 countries competing in the various programs.",6
"starting in , the vexu division was formed out of the existing vex competition.",6
"this new division was created specifically for college and university students with rules nearly
identical to the high school and middle-school level vex competitions, but with greater
customization and flexibility.",6
"additionally, this competition offered teams the ability to
work on real-world problems and engineer robotic solutions.",6
"through our research, we have identified these factors that contribute to the success of
the vexu competition:
• compared to most competitions the vexu competition is less expensive to participate
in since most teams spend a maximum of $ per robot their first year.",6
– since the parts can be reused the cost of participating each year can decrease.,6
"• the competition grows every year with more teams and qualifying events from around
the world.",6
"for example in the upcoming - there will be a new vexu quali-
fying event in singapore.",6
• the field is small (xft) and easy to set up it makes running events simple.,6
"through our research we have also identified the following drawbacks to the vexu compe-
tition:

• unlike the high school and middle school vex competitions, vexu allows for sensors
supplied by outside vendors and d printed parts which allow for some creativity, but
teams are still limited to vex brand parts for mechanical and structural components
which puts a cap on what is possible by teams.",6
"• the dynamics of the vexu competition are generally similar to that of a sports match
and have less relation to solving real-world problems.",6
".. robomasters
the robomasters competition is one of the newest competitions we have researched, having
only started in  by dji, a worldwide quadcopter company based out of china.",6
"for the
first two years of the competition only chinese universities could compete, but it was still a
huge success, drawing in over  teams from more than  universities in its first year.",6
"its
rapid growth is largely due to dji, who gave each team two kit-bots which was the minimum
required to compete in the competition, lowering the barrier to entry [].",6
"the field is much
larger (x meters) than other robotics competitions and each team is able to field up
to four robots and one quadcopter at a time.",6
"another major difference with robomasters
compared to most competitions is that each robot has a health bar and armor plates.",6
"if
these armor plates are hit by the opposing teams pellets then the health of the robot can
decrease and even disable it if the health of the robot is depleted.",6
"the structure of the
competition makes its dynamic similar to that of an esports event and brings in fairly large
online audiences in the tens of thousands.",6
"its international popularity has even produced a
japanese anime based on the competition.",6
"although the robomasters competition is the newest we have researched, we consider
it as one of the most successful for the following reasons:
• in its short run it has expanded from a chinese national competition to an interna-
tional competition with more than  teams from more than than  countries.",6
"this
shows the competition only continues to grow.",6
"• dji assistance through two free kit-bots and other various parts makes it easy for new
teams to join robomasters.",6
"• its interesting competition structure and dynamic brings elements popularized in es-
ports to attract media attention.",6
"through our research we have also identified the following drawbacks to the robomasters
competition:
• robomasters competition events only occur in china which can make participation
difficult for international teams.",6
"• besides the fully autonomous base-bot, the competition does not heavily focus on
autonomous robots or real-world applications as part of the competition.",6
"• although dji supports teams by supplying two kit-bots, most teams still spend up-
wards of $, which can make participation in robomasters difficult for some or-
ganizations.",6
".. robocup
robocup is a non-profit organization led by a board of trustees, a president and vice
presidents as well as a combination of committees designed to fill specific organizational
needs.",6
"robocup has hosted international robotics competitions annually since it was founded
in  [].",6
"robocup started as a competition for robots to play soccer against each other as
a demonstration of artificial intelligence capabilities and to inspire innovation in the industry.",6
"since then, it has evolved to include more advanced challenges such as search and rescue,
open industrial challenges and humanoid assistant competitions.",6
"it is clear that robocup aims to promote innovation and research in artificial intelli-
gence through five different levels of the competition: robocupsoccer, robocuprescue,
robocup@home, robocupindustrial and robocupjunior.",6
"each league has a different tar-
get demographic allowing for robocup to draw in a larger audience from primary school
students making dancing robots in the robocupjunior league to college students tackling
research and industrial challenges.",6
"within the robocupsoccer division there are further
divisions: small, middle size, standard platform, humanoid, and simulation.",6
"this allows
organizations that choose to compete in robocup divisions that fit with their resources and
goals.",6
"robocup also promotes innovation and research by providing a database of publications,
presentations and research from leading scientific journals and conferences in artificial intel-
ligence.",6
robocup currently indexes  research articles from  authors.,6
"this provides
participants with accredited sources of information and research on which to base their de-
signs and strategy.",6
"on their website they state that their database is “constantly updated
and [they] estimate to reach about , papers” [].",6
"robocup also takes into consideration their public image via a “news” section on their
website for the press.",6
"they hold databases of promotional newsletters, announcements,
images and videos for public and press use in order to promote their brand.",6
"robocup also
live-streams their events with commentary for international viewers that earn, on average, a
few thousand views per stream [].",6
"through our research we have identified the following factors for robocup’s success:
• robocup has developed many divisions of multiple levels and interests in order to
make the competition available and appealing to a wide range of organizations.",6
"• robocup events have been held annually since its inception in  showing that
the competition has been sustainable.",6
"it is also the longest running competition we
researched.",6
"• the competition has consistently had around  teams from over  countries over
the course of the last decade.",6
"through our research we have identified the following the following drawbacks to the robocup
competition:
• the robocupsoccer competition does not change its rules often, making it possible
for teams with successful designs to continue to achieve, while newer teams struggle to
compete on the same level.",6
"• even robocupsoccer small league requires a significant amount of resources to par-
ticipate in.",6
"many teams spend upwards of $, for this division alone.",6
".. robonation
robonation is a robotics community founded by the association for unmanned vehicle
systems international (auvsi) that offers multiple educational competitions and programs
[].",6
"their mission is to allow middle school to graduate students to apply their stem and
robotics knowledge outside of the classroom through the various competitions they have to
offer such as:
• robosub - autonomous robotic submarines fully built by students must complete
a difficult series of visual and acoustic-based tasks.",6
"these tasks simulate the work
required of robotic subs in many facets of underwater activity [].",6
"in  robosub
saw significant participation at  registered teams [].",6
"• roboboat - student teams design autonomous, robotic boats to navigate and race
through an aquatic obstacle course.",6
"the behaviors demonstrated by these boats mimic
tasks that are being developed for coastal surveillance, port security and other types
of oceanographic operations [].",6
"• maritime robotx challenge - this international competition is designed to evolve
into a multi-platform competition that will include maritime, aerial and submersible
tasks.",6
"currently the competition is primarily focused on autonomous surface vehicle
platforms and sensors [].",6
"• the national seaperch challenge - a high school and middle school competition
geared towards the construction and operation of remotely operated underwater vehi-
cles to complete certain tasks.",6
"most of these vehicles are actually constructed from
kits as part of the educational program associated with the challenge [].",6
"• igvc (intelligent ground vehicle competition) - for this competition under-
graduate and graduate students compete to design, power,and construct an intelligent
ground vehicle that can follow lanes, detect obstacles, and follow waypoint navigation
[].",6
"• suas (student unmanned air systems) - students research, design, integrate,
and demonstrate an unmanned aerial system that is capable of autonomous flight and
navigation, remote imaging and communication, and execution of a specific set of tasks.",6
"these tasks can include sensing, detecting, and avoiding obstacles [].",6
"• iarc (international aerial robotics competition) - the longest-running colle-
giate aerial robotics challenge in the world, iarc advances autonomous aerial robotic
behavior through competition.",6
"for iarc international teams must create fully au-
tonomous flying robots that demonstrate behaviors never before demonstrated while
completing missions with real world applications [].",6
"each competition is held annually with the same technological focus, however they are
given different objectives which allow teams to maintain similar designs from year to year.",6
"each of the challenges mentioned have real world applications which holds relevance to the
competitors and companies in the industry of that respective competition.",6
"based on our research we have identified feel the following reasons attribute to the success
of robonation:
• robonation consists of multiple competitions which allow organizations to participate
in the competitions that suit their interests.",6
"• since only the tasks/objectives change from year to year teams can use the same
design for their robot every year.",6
"this also allows newer teams to draw inspiration
from previous participating teams.",6
• all competitions have real world applications and are research based.,6
"through our research we have identified the following the following drawbacks to the robon-
ation competitions:
• robonation as a whole has not grown as the number of teams competing in challenges
has not increased in the last five years.",6
"• because of the scale and nature of the maritime robotx challenge it happens every
 years which is not ideal for many college organizations.",6
".. nasa robotic mining competition
the nasa robotic mining challenge began in  as competition for undergraduate and
graduate students to develop a mining robot designed to navigate and operate on the martian
surface [].",6
"since then the competition has been held annually at the kennedy science center
and has consistently hosted - teams.",6
"through our research we have found that the following factors can be attributed to the
nasa robotics mining competition’s (rmc) success:
• the robotics mining competition features both undergraduate and graduate level
competitions.",6
"• in its first year, rmc offered teams $, need-based grants for travel expenses and
supplies.",6
"• teams can win judge’s awards based on innovation and efficiency within their team
and design [].",6
"• rmc maintains event-specific social media pages to promote their competition and
draw in viewers.",6
"• rmc live streams the events in order to reach a wide audience and potentially inspire
other students to join.",6
"through our research we have also discovered the following drawbacks to the nasa robotics
mining challenge:
• the competition does not seem to have grown in size from year to year.",6
"• travel and material costs are high as teams are coming from around the country,
making it difficult for lower budget colleges to enter.",6
".. sae collegiate design series
the sae collegiate design series is a set of college competitions held by the society of
automotive engineers.",6
"the competition is designed to provide participants with an oppor-
tunity to improve their engineering and project management skills outside of the classroom
[].",6
"students who participate have a chance to show their engineering skills to companies
in the automotive industry, land internships and even earn scholarships.",6
"the most popular
of these competitions are formula sae and baja sae.",6
"• formula sae - for this competition, students are contracted by a fictional manu-
facturing company to develop a formula-style race car.",6
"the cars are evaluated as a
potential production item.",6
"the cars are targeted at non-professional weekend autocross
racers.",6
"each team is expected to design, build and test a prototype.",6
"within the for-
mula division, teams can choose to build various types of cars for different events.",6
"for
example, teams have the option to build combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles,
or hybrids and compete in the respective events for those divisions.",6
"the nature of
the events can change from year to year, but the most consistent events include timed
races and endurance races to test how long the vehicles can last [].",6
"• baja sae - students are expected to build a single-seat off-road vehicle that will
survive the harshness of rough terrain.",6
"all vehicles are powered by the same  hp
engine from briggs stratton.",6
"the baja competition is not as large as the formula
sae competition, but it is able to draw a different crowd to sae competitive events
[].",6
"through our research we have found that the following factors can be attributed to the
success of the sae collegiate design series:
• baja sae gives each team an engine, allowing students to focus on the durability of
the car as well as lowering the cost of entry.",6
"• event locations on both the east and west coast of the us as well as international
events allow for more colleges to participate.",6
"through our research we have also discovered the following drawbacks to the sae collegiate
design series:
• due to the nature of automotive engineering, the cost of entry is very high, making it
difficult for colleges with lower budgets to join.",6
"• the space required for this event makes it one of the hardest logistically to hold of the
competitions we have researched.",6
"• since teams work with car sized vehicles it can also be difficult to travel to competitive
events with all of the ideal equipment needed to maintain their vehicles.",6
"methodology
this sections outlines the methodology used to complete this iqp.",6
"each of these steps cover
a specific area in the development of a robot competition to be hosted at wpi.
. background research
as part of our development process we spent much of our time researching previous and
existing collegiate robotics competitions.",6
"this research allowed us to better understand
several key topics:
• the resources necessary to execute a collegiate robotics competition.",6
• what makes collegiate robotics competitions appealing to participants and sponsors.,6
• the benefits of a collegiate robotics competition for the host.,6
• the potential impact a collegiate robotics robotics competition hosted by wpi.,6
"• the factors that attribute to successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competi-
tions.",6
"the background research on various collegiate robotics competitions can be found in
section .",6
"of this report.
. interview and discussions
in order to develop a successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competition at wpi it is
important to have discussions with parties that would be involved in the event.",6
"these par-
ties include wpi stakeholders, potential participants from other universities, and potential
sponsors.",6
".. wpi stakeholders
before work began on designing a robotics competition to be held at wpi, interviews were
conducted of key stakeholders at the school who would be instrumental in making it a reality.",6
"the main stakeholders would be those who would have direct involvement in running the
competition and those who would benefit from the exposure.",6
"these stakeholders would be
directly involved in the execution of the event:
• the robotics engineering program
• the robotics resource center
• corporate engagement
• touchtomorrow
the stakeholders that would potentially benefit from the event would be:

• admissions
• marketing
• pre-collegiate outreach
• touchtomorrow
... wpi robotics engineering program
the robotics engineering program is the most obvious benefactor and stakeholder of a colle-
giate robotics competition at wpi.",6
"the robotics engineering program faculty had valuable
insight on hosting such a collegiate robotics competition and on which key individuals we
should be speaking with.",6
"... wpi robotics resource center
the robotics resource center at wpi is responsible for running every competitive robotics
event on campus such as first robotics competitions and formerly the nasa centen-
nial challenge.",6
"their relevance to such events makes them a primary stakeholders for our
proposed event, so it was critical for us to have discussions with them.",6
"the robotics engineering program would also have direct involvement in the event as
they could serve as a source of funding and volunteers in the form of students and professors.",6
"the robotics resource center and touchtomorrow would be the primary organizer of the
event and as such is a primary stakeholder.",6
"... wpi admissions office
the nature of the wpi admissions office is to review students and admit them into wpi, so
we decided to meet with them as we felt they had relevant information pertaining to student
statistics and interests.",6
"... wpi office of pre-collegiate outreach
another benefactor of a robotics competition held at wpi would be pre-collegiate out-
reach.",6
"pre-collegiate outreach designs programs for middle school and high school students
designed to help them explore the stem field and to ultimately get them inspired to choose
wpi when it’s time to apply to colleges.",6
"... wpi office of corporate engagement
it was very important to have a discussion with the office of corporate relations as they
are the point of contact for many wpi benefactors and they should have a relevant opinion
on the subject of our iqp.",6
".. potential participants
a competition is not a competition without participants, which is why we conducted inter-
views with representatives from  universities in order to better understand their interests.",6
"we wanted to find out what they would want to get out of a robotics competition as well
as how to make the competition as inclusive as possible.",6
"when finding interviewees from
each university we made sure they were representatives of a relevant stem organization
or involved in stem related activities on campus.",6
"because of this, the representatives we
interviewed had a deep understanding of the resources available to students at their univer-
sity and a relevant opinion on the kind of robotics competition their university would be
interested in participating in.",6
"while developing our competition we wanted to both make it interesting to peer insti-
tutions with a reputation in robotics as well as universities that are new to the field.",6
"in
order to gain diverse range of opinions on the subject we planned to contact and interview
representatives from the following universities in relevant stem organizations:
table .",6
• what is the annual budget of your organization?,6
• does your organization have membership fees?,6
• is competition travel covered by your school?,6
• do students have access to fabrication resources?,6
• what is your ideal frequency for the competition?,6
• how often do you feel the rules should change?,6
• what is your ideal date for a competition to take place?,6
• do you prefer an indoor or outdoor challenge?,6
• should there be robot to robot interaction?,6
• should there be a multi-robot aspect to the competition?,6
"• if you answered yes, how many robots should there be?",6
• if you answered yes to a multi-robot competition then should those robots be different?,6
• should there be any legged robots?,6
• should there be any underwater robots?,6
"• should robots be fully autonomous or should there be an autonomous portion to the
challenge?",6
"• if you answered yes to a multi-robot competition then how many robots should be
fully autonomous?",6
".. potential sponsors
another important aspect of developing a collegiate robotics competition at wpi is con-
tacting potential sponsors for the event.",6
"through discussions with sponsors we gained an
understanding of how to make our competition appealing to potential sponsors, how to form
relationships, and eventually partnerships with them.",6
"throughout the course of the iqp we contacted the following companies in order to
understand what should be included in our event to properly incentivize sponsors:
• irobot
• uber atg
• symbotic
• massrobotics
• new stone soup, llc

.",6
"development and drafting
through our research, we developed a proposal and plan of action for a collegiate robotics
competition hosted by wpi.",6
"we have developed severial documents for this iqp: this report,
which contains our findings as well as conclusions on them, a rules handbook, targeted
towards potential participants and includes details on each competition and a tentative
schedule, and a logistics document, which contains details on the resources necessary to host
this event.",6
"in developing a proposal for this event we have identified several main decision and
development points:
• potential event dates
• potential competition locations
• proposed event schedule
• logistics plan
• sponsorship packages
• proposed competitions
• selected competitions
as part of this report we provide details for each of these points.",6
"findings
the following section describes the results of executing the methodology outlined in section
three of this report.",6
"it begins with an overview of our discussions with wpi, potential
participants, and potential sponsors.",6
"it then concludes with our work on a proposal for a
collegiate robotics competition to be hosted by wpi.
. discussions and information gathering
this section summarizes the information gathered over the course of the iqp.",6
"it begins with
details on discussions with wpi stakeholders, continues with details on discussions with
potential participants, and concludes with details on discussions with potential sponsors.",6
".. discussions with wpi stakeholders
before work began on designing a robotics competition to be held at wpi, interviews and
discussions with key stakeholders at the school were conducted to identify event requirements.",6
"these stakeholders are the people and offices who would be directly involved in running the
event and those who would need to give approval for it.",6
"... robotics engineering program
over the course of this iqp we had many discussions with key figures of wpi’s robotics
engineering program.",6
"many of these discussions were with two of our advisors for this iqp,
professors nicholas bertozzi and brad miller during weekly meetings and outside discus-
sions.",6
"they consistently provided valuable insight due to their knowledge of the industry
and experience with mentoring competitive robotics teams.",6
"the competitive robotics teams
they have mentored have participated in competitions such as the first robotics com-
petition and the vex robotics competition.",6
"because of their experience and position as
robotics faculty, our frequent discussions with them were extremely helpful in drafting the
competition.",6
"these discussions also kept the project on track by ensuring that the vision of
the competition stayed in the best interest of all parties involved.",6
"we also had several productive and insightful discussions with professor david cyganski,
the interim director of wpi’s robotics engineering program.",6
"professor cyganski had been
involved with the program since its inception and had a good understanding of how to
represent the wpi robotics program well.",6
"professor cyganski advised that cost would be
a huge consideration when attempting to execute our event and that it would be best to
couple the event with a large existing wpi event such as touchtomorrow.",6
"this would
prove advantageous as both events could enhance each other in a variety of ways if hosted in
conjunction.",6
"he added that with since the nasa sample return challenge has ended and
is no longer a part of touchtomorrow, adding a new competitive robotics event could be of
benefit for all parties involved.",6
"professor cyganski received the idea of having a collegiate robotics olympics with multiple
events positively.",6
"of his major opinions on the dynamic of the event was that he felt that
we should stray from having events such as combat robotics if we wanted all events to be

academic, but he did admit having those as one of the events had the potential of bringing
a maker and hobbyist type of crowd.",6
"professor cyganski felt that having events that were
directly related to real world applications would represent wpi well.",6
"some examples of
these events would include a legged robotics challenge, an underwater robotics challenge,
and an item sorting challenge.",6
"he made it clear that if we were to have events like that
there proper planning was necessary in order to make it feasible for an event like that to
be executed successfully.",6
"the events would also have to be designed to be as accessible to
other universities as possible, but should also remain fair to all potential participants.",6
"his
concern was that if undergraduate, graduate, and phd students were allowed to compete in
this competition then undergraduate students might be at a disadvantage.",6
"this is because
some graduate or phd students may have developed technology associated with a certain
event over the course of several years.",6
"his last major point in these discussions was that it
would be of high interest to wpi to market this sort of event to peer u.s institutions in
order to draw more domestic students into wpi’s graduate programs.",6
"... robotics resource center
over the course of our iqp we had many discussions with colleen shaver, the associate
director of the robotics resource center and one of the advisors for our iqp.",6
"as the as-
sociate director of the robotics resource center, colleen is in charge of the planning and
execution of many large robotics competitions hosted on wpi campus.",6
"such robotics com-
petitions include one of the first lego league championships, an annual first robotics
district event, battlecry, and the nasa sample return challenge.",6
"throughout the iqp
her knowledge and experience on running robotics events on wpi campus proved to be ex-
tremely valuable in reaching our goals for this iqp.",6
"she consistently gave valuable insights
and feedback on the information we gathered and the competition proposal could not have
been drafted without her.",6
"... wpi admissions office
as a benefactor of the potential outreach, admissions materials created in the form of pic-
tures and videos, and the increased attention given to wpi from any robotics competition
held, admissions was an important stakeholder in the event.",6
"we met with ashley johnson
and katie phung, both assistant directors of admissions.",6
"ashley specializes in robotics
applicants and katie specializes in minority outreach.",6
"during the meeting, various strategies were discussed on what what interests potential
high school applicants when it comes to robotics.",6
"due to the complicated and visual nature
of the subject, videos were brought up as being an important tool.",6
"they allow high schoolers
to get excited when they see it for themselves.",6
"they saw a robotics competition held at wpi
as a great way of generating content for these videos as well as a mechanism for outreach to
potential domestic graduate students.",6
"they mentioned that the admissions office in general
would love a spectator element combined with interactive parts for potential high school
applicants.",6
"... wpi office of corporate engagement
our main discussions with the office of corporate relations were with rachel leblanc, the
vice president of corporate engagement.",6
"as mentioned in section ..., we thought it
was very important to meet with this office as they are the point of contact to many of
the companies and organizations associated with wpi.",6
"rachel leblanc also sits on the new
england board of the association for unmanned vehicle systems international (auvsi).",6
"auvsi is an entity that heavily supports the advancement of robotic technologies and hosts
several robotics competitions and conferences.",6
"similar to david cyganski, rachel felt that
auvsi and other potential sponsors would be heavily interested in a robotics competition
hosted at wpi.",6
"a robotics competition with different focused events would have the potential
of drawing in specific sponsors for each event.",6
"for example bluefin robotics, an underwater
drone company, may be interested in sponsoring an underwater drone challenge.",6
"hosting
challenges with real world applications would provide wpi with a good amount of peer to
peer recognition with similar universities.",6
"overall, our discussions with rachel proved productive in connecting with potential spon-
sors for our event and she felt that at a high level our proposed event was executable and
would provide many benefits for all parties involved.",6
"... wpi office of pre-collegiate outreach
discussions primarily took place with sue sontgerath who guided us through the three main
avenues in place to direct middle school and high school students towards the school:
• through parents
• through educators
• direct contact with students
in general the first two were far more effective than the third for off-campus outreach.",6
"she stressed that using “multiple touchpoints” is important because it brings pre-collegiate
students to the campus and wpi-hosted events as often as possible so that they associate
the the school with college when it comes time for them to apply.",6
"the event touchtomorrow
is one of the largest examples of this.",6
"the event brings thousands of students, as young as
, from around new england to the campus and gets them introduced to the school and
the types of things undergraduates get to do.",6
"discussions also circulated around female inclusion in the event and the types of things
that work for that.",6
"sue mentioned that most of the research surrounding this says that
women have heavy interest in helping and improving people’s lives.",6
"the following universities were interviewed:

• massachusetts institute of technology
• harvard university
• olin college
• stanford university
• duke university
• rice university
• university of pennsylvania
• pennsylvania state university
• purdue university
• california state polytechnic university
• colorado school of mines
• southern methodist university
• university of texas at austin
• university of texas at dallas
• texas am
• university of houston
• university of alabama
• university of auckland

what is the member size of your
organization?",6
the average membership size was .,6
"what is the annual budget of
your organization?",6
"the average annual budget was $,.",6
"does your organization have
membership fees?",6
"only two of the  universities interviewed had
membership fees.",6
"these were both for vexu and at
ut austin and ut dallas.",6
"is competition travel covered by
your school?",6
"responses ranged from “no” to “sometimes” with %
of the answers being the latter.",6
"do students have access to
fabrication resources?",6
most universities have access to fabrication resources.,6
"these range from small makerspaces to full-fledged
machine shops.",6
"only % of the universities
interviewed do not have access.",6
"since these representatives would be potential participants of our competitive event we
felt it was important to ask their opinions on how the competition should be structured.",6
"the questions we asked every representative and a summary of those question responses can
be found in the table below:
table .",6
": potential participant opinions
question response summary
what is your ideal frequency for
the competition?",6
"all interviewed representatives preferred annual
frequency.",6
"this is because students are only in college
program for four years so an annual competition would
keep students engaged in the competition.",6
"how often do you feel the rules
should change?",6
"every representative felt that the rules of the
competition should change annually in order to keep
the competition interesting and engaging.",6
"what is your ideal date for a
competition to take place?",6
"all representatives felt a date during the summer
would be the best timing.",6
"most had a preference for
the beginning of the summer(late may/early june)
do you prefer an indoor or
outdoor challenge?",6
"all representatives felt that an indoor competition was
preferable.",6
"some felt that an outdoor competition is
interesting, but did not like that it would be reliant on
the weather.",6
"should there be robot to robot
interaction?",6
"with the exception of a few representatives, most felt
that robot to robot interaction should be a part of the
competition.",6
"should there be a multi-robot
aspect to the competition?",6
"about % of representatives felt that there should be
a multi-robot aspect to the competition.",6
"if you answered yes, how many
robots should there be?",6
"about % of representatives felt that  robots would
be a good number to a multi-robot competitions.",6
"the
other % felt fewer or more robots was ideal.",6
"if you answered yes to a
multi-robot competition then
should those robots be different?",6
"all representatives that felt there should be a
multi-robot competition said that the robots should be
different types.",6
"should there be any legged
robots?",6
"about % of representatives were interested in seeing
a legged robot competition.",6
"should there be any underwater
robots?",6
"all representatives were interested in an underwater
robotics challenge.",6
"should robots be fully
autonomous or should there be
an autonomous portion to the
challenge?",6
"about % of representatives felt that there should be
an autonomous portion of the challenge rather than
fully autonomous robots.",6
"if you answered yes to a
multi-robot competition then
how many robots should be fully
autonomous?",6
"about % of representatives who were interested in a
fully autonomous robot thought all robots should be
autonomous while % felt only at least one robot
should be autonomous.",6
"only about % of representatives were interested in a
competition with alliances.",6
"most felt that if there were
alliances in the competitions it should not be
multi-robot.",6
"the full interviews of each representative(including representative details) can be found
in the appendix section of this report.",6
"based on the interviews we have made several conclusions that are fully outlined in
the section .",6
"these representative interviews were extremely helpful in
understanding the capabilities of most universities and how to design the competition in a
way that will attract competitors and satisfy their interests.",6
"... uber atg
one of the potential sponsors we were able to contact was the uber advanced technologies
group.",6
"uber atg is the autonomous vehicle development division of uber, based out of
pittsburgh, pennsylvania.",6
"because of their mission to advance autonomous vehicle tech-
nology we felt it was important to contact them about potentially sponsoring our event.",6
"we were able to contact alan nuttle, a senior engineer at uber atg.",6
"allan had previous
experience partnering with the first robotics competition and was heavily interested in
the prospect of sponsoring a collegiate robotics event.",6
"we felt that it would be best if uber
was a title sponsor for an autonomous navigation challenge and alan agreed.",6
"uber would
be interested in sponsoring a specific event and providing volunteers support in the form of
judges.",6
"... irobot
we were able to reach out to lisa freed, a public relations representative from irobot.",6
"through our communications with lisa we discovered that irobot does not sponsor com-
petitive events monetarily.",6
"according to lisa, irobot is focused more on participants rather

than the actual competition.",6
"if they were to assist in a competition at wpi they would
provide volunteers that would mentor or judge competitors of the competition.",6
"irobot feels
that as long as the competition is giving students the opportunity to find their passion, be
it building, coding, team leadership or some other area of the stem fields, it would be of
value to them.",6
"one last way irobot might participate in our event that lisa mentioned
would be by having a booth in an exhibition area for recruiting purposes.",6
"... massrobotics
massrobotics is a robotics startup accelerator in the boston seaport district that was
founded less than two years ago.",6
"despite being so young, massrobotics has made a large
impact in the robotics community and has more than a dozen different robotics companies
residing in their offices.",6
"because of their nature we felt that it was important to talk with
them and the companies they house as these parties could be potential sponsors of our
event.",6
"most of our communications were with joyce sidopoulos, one of the directors of
massrobotics, mainly in charge of their community programs.",6
"as a parent, joyce was
interested in the prospect of a competition that would be in collaboration of touchtomorrow
and felt that the timing of the competition would be ideal for many.",6
"as an organization
massrobotics would be interested in having exhibition space for their multiple companies
and providing judges for the event.",6
"joyce also gave helpful competition design suggestions
such as gearing an underwater robotics challenge towards aquaculture, a challenge their
company hydroswarm is trying to tackle.",6
"one of massrobotics’s residents is american
robotics, an agriculture robotics company that utilizes drones to actively track crops.",6
"joyce
brought up the idea of this event to them and they were interested in seeing an outdoor
autonomous drone challenge that utilized computer vision to actively track some sort of
target.",6
"... rita vasquez torres
over the course of this iqp, we had several discussions with rita vasquez torres, ceo
of engineering consulting company, new stone soup.",6
"rita’s background and experience
provided a lot of insight while developing our competition.",6
"since rita had partnered with
the army and research institutions such as natick labs on many occasions she was confident
that our intent to have competitive events with real world applications was the best approach.",6
"overall she was satisfied with the initial proposal for our event and felt it would be successful,
but she wanted our event to emphasize more than the technical aspect of things.",6
"in her
experience she felt that many bright engineers she had worked with lacked fundamental non-
technical skills that are just as important as technical ones.",6
"she felt that it was important
to foster a business and entrepreneurial mindset in engineers so she suggested adding an
entrepreneurial aspect to our event.",6
"this event should emphasize real technology rules and
regulations currently set in place so that students will understand how to properly bring
technology to market and how to commercialize it.",6
"... symbotic, llc
symbotic, llc is a warehouse robotics company based in wilmington, ma.",6
"as of fall ,
this company started a small collegiate competition of their own.",6
"this competition is struc-
tured to be more like an engineering project, but has increased their interest in working
with universities for future competitions.",6
"to discuss this topic we met with maggie weeks,
symbotic’s marketing communications specialist, and taylor smith, one of symbotic’s cor-
porate recruiters.",6
"through this discussion, we learned that symbotic would be interested in
sponsoring a robotics competition of any kind and that they would most likely be available
to provide both monetary and volunteer support, but more specific details about the final
event will be required.",6
"if symbotic were to sponsor an event they would like for the event
to focus on engineering undergraduate students and for students to have opportunities to
develop mechanical engineering, hardware engineering, and software engineering skills.",6
"from
a recruiting standpoint they see it as an opportunity to groom potential employees and see
what those potential employees have to offer.",6
"from a marketing standpoint they simply feel
that by being involved it would be a good opportunity, especially since symbotic is starting
to become more public.
. competition development
through our information gathering and discussions with stakeholders at the school, potential
sponsors, and participants we developed a proposal for a robotics competition to be held at
wpi.",6
"this section outlines this proposal and includes:
• potential dates
• potential locations
• a proposed schedule
• general logistics requirements
• sponsorship
• initially proposed challenges
this section ends with a decision matrix to determine which proposed challenges should
be hosted in the first year of the event.",6
".. potential dates
choosing a potential date for a robotics competition hosted at wpi was challenging as there
are a lot of factors to take into account.",6
"first, the school year for wpi goes from april th to
may st, with commencement on the th.",6
"any event in the summer would need to happen
after this date as the whole campus is reserved to that event.",6
"additional factors include
the dates that participating colleges adjourn for the summer and students start internships.",6
internships typically start at the beginning of june and go until mid august.,6
"through talking with potential participants and wpi stakeholders we concluded that the
ideal date for the competition would be late may to early june with the event starting friday
morning and ending saturday evening.",6
"this would make the event accessible to participants
with internships, even by those traveling from outside of new england, as it would allow
them to take thursday and friday off and return on sunday.",6
"late may to early june is also ideal for wpi as it would be after commencement and the
quad would no longer be in use.",6
"after we determined this time frame was the ideal date,
we realized that having an event in conjunction would touchtomorrow would be ideal as it
typically takes place in early june and was originally created to be hosted in collaboration
with nasa’s centennial challenge in  and still has a strong theme of robotics even now
that the challenge is over.",6
".. potential locations
if this competition were to be in collaboration with touchtomorrow then the following
locations that would be available for use:
• harrington auditorium
• recreation center robot pits
• recreation center swimming pool
• riley commons
• wpi football field
• wpi rooftop field
• institute park
we had discussions with meredith merchant, the assistant recreation director and fa-
cilities director, to determine if use of facilities, such as the swimming pool in the recreation
center, for a competitive robotics event would be possible.",6
"meredith was open to the idea
as long as the varsity swimming coach approved as well.",6
institute park would also be available for the event.,6
"for example, the nasa centennial
challenge was held there and the entire park was fenced off.",6
"in order to organize this, the
worcester parks and recreation center would need to be contacted in order to make sure
that the park was available for our desired event dates.",6
"the fees associated with renting the
park were fairly low and the it would be possible to fence it off.",6
".. proposed competition schedule
through discussions with potential sponsors, participants, and wpi stakeholders we gath-
ered information on what should be included in a robotics competition schedule.",6
"we also
determined that this event would be executed best if it occurred over the course of two days
to provide enough time to execute everything that should occur in such an event.in this

schedule there are several important parts that differ from most collegiate robotics compe-
titions.",6
"first, we decided it was important to include networking events for participants.",6
"these events would be an opportunity for college students studying engineering with experi-
ence in robotics to gain connections within industry.",6
"these connections would be especially
helpful for rising seniors when seeking out jobs during the coming school year.",6
"second,
there will be keynote speakers at the provided lunches.",6
"these speakers will be experts from
industry discussing a relevant topic in the field of robotics.",6

.. general logistics requirements
behind every successful event lies extensive organizational planning.",6
"we decided to create a
logistical plan to outline where, when and how the events would be run in conjunction with
touchtomorrow.",6
"we first identified the required resources to run this competition:
• volunteers
• event space
• event materials
• audio and video

the competition will require a wide variety of volunteers to operate smoothly.",6
"each
challenge will follow the same volunteer structure.",6
"the volunteer structure outlines the
expected tasks for each position and is as follows:
• standard volunteers
– misc.",6
- volunteer positions that are to be determined to help with event flow.,6
"– a/v crew - in charge of lighting and audio/video for challenge venues and
would be provided by lnl (wpi’s a/v club).",6
– challenge reset - assists in challenge venue maintenance.,6
"– queuing - maintains time flow of each challenge by directing teams to necessary
destinations.",6
– referee - assists in upholding event challenge rules.,6
"– challenge admin - who teams check-in to and an informational guide for the
event.",6
"• judges
– robot/safety inspector - inspects robots and confirms if they comply to
event/challenge standards, makes sure that event is up to safety standards, and
able to restrict teams from competing if they are in violation of safety standards.",6
"– technical judge - scores posters and the designs of team’s robots and evaluates
robot performance.",6
– scoring judge - maintains scoring of challenges.,6
"• key volunteers
– head referee - oversees all the referees for all challenges.",6
– head inspector - oversees all the inspectors for all challenges.,6
– head judge - oversees all technical judging for all challenges.,6
– emcee - master of ceremonies and narrator of challenges.,6
– field supervisor - in charge of field maintenance.,6
– volunteer coordinator - organizes and oversees volunteers for a challenge.,6
– challenge coordinator - also organizes and oversees volunteers for a challenge.,6
"the majority of the potential sponsors we contacted expressed intent to provide vol-
unteers to help run the event.",6
"between our sponsors as well as volunteers from the wpi
volunteers we anticipate to have enough sponsors to staff our selected challenges.",6
one of the most important resources required would be funding.,6
"the main costs for
running the event would be materials for field construction as well as audio and video pro-
duction for the event.",6
"all of the fields will be constructed out of basic materials such as
cardboard and plywood.",6
"below are the materials costs for the selected challenges:

• indoor drone challenge - $,
• warehouse swarm challenge - $,
• miniature fire fighting challenge - $,
audio and video production will be provided by the student run club, lens and lights
(lnl).",6
"they have provided price estimates for each challenge location:
• harrington auditorium - $,
• riley commons - $
• robot pits - $
based on our positive feedback from potential sponsors, we believe that we can generate
the funds needed solely through sponsorship.",6
"this would allow the event to be cost neutral
to the school.",6
".. sponsorship
in order to host a successful event it is vital to recruit sponsors that can provide resources
that will enhance the event.",6
"sponsors can provide support in the form of both monetary and
volunteer capacities.",6
"therefore, in order to entice sponsors of different sizes we developed
sponsorship tiers based on what a sponsor provides for the event.",6
"these tiers were developed
in collaboration with colleen shaver, one of our iqp advisors.",6
"a sponsor is considered within
a sponsorship tier if they provide at least one of the bullets under the following sponsorship
tiers:
• standard
– donation of $,
–  standard volunteers provided
–  judges provided
–  key volunteers provided
• bronze
– donation of $,

–  judges provided
–  key volunteers provided
• silver
– donation of $,
–  standard volunteers provided

–  judges provided
–  key volunteers provided
• gold
– donation of $,
• platinum
– donation of $,
in order to incentivize potential sponsors we developed a benefits matrix based on the
sponsorship tiers.",6

.. proposed challenges
through discussions with potential participants we learned several key things about what
types of competitions they were interested in.",6
"first, we learned that different schools with
were interested in different types of competitions of varying sizes.",6
"because of this, we decided
that instead of designing one specific robotics competition we would propose designing and
hosting multiple.",6
"that way, universities with different interests and resources could choose
which events they would want to compete in and still participate in the event as a whole.",6
"this would also allow us to ask potential contributors to sponsor a specific event relevant
to them.",6
"for example, symbotic, a warehouse automation company, could sponsor an item
sorting challenge and could be entitled the “symbotic item sorting challenge”.",6
"another
important item we learned was that both potential participants and sponsors were interested
in competitions based on real-world problems.",6
"they felt that working on solutions to these
would provide students with relevant experience and make it easier to get sponsors.",6
"taking all of what we learned into consideration we went back to potential participants
and sponsors with numerous ideas for competitions and asked for their opinions.",6
"the fol-
lowing is list of the competitions that stood out:
• underwater robotics challenge
• all-terrain robotics challenge
• item-sorting challenge
• indoor drone challenge
• fire fighting challenge
• autonomous vehicle challenge
• warehouse swarm robotics challenge
each of these competitions are based on current real-world problems that sponsors we
have been in contact with are currently working on.",6
"... underwater robotics challenge
with the increasing demand for fish and the reduction of fish populations around the world,
the aquaculture industry has grown to account for half of the world’s seafood.",6
"despite its
large success, the aquaculture industry still face many problems today.",6
"for coastal aquaculture farms, nets require constant inspection as they have a tendency
to break, causing thousands of fish, often non-indigenous, to escape into local waters.",6
"this

causes both substantial losses to the farm and untold ecological problems.",6
"every aquaculture
farm also faces the problem of diseased fish.",6
"since there are no current systems to identify
and separate diseased populations, farms have suffered heavy losses.",6
"this challenge was created in order to foster the development of technologies that solve
these problems as well as create a competition for universities interested in underwater
robotics.",6
"teams are tasked with building a robot to autonomously find and identify items
underwater.",6
these items could be waste or escaped fish.,6
"robots could also be tasked with
finding tears in a fish farm net.",6
"specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules
handbook.",6
"... all-terrain robotics challenge
for this challenge, teams must build robots that are capable of traversing a variety of terrain.",6
"this is meant to simulate real life exploration and navigation problems as well as foster
technology geared for disaster relief.",6
"points will be rewarded based on how far each robot
travels.",6
"robots will not be required to complete each terrain track, but an additional bonus
will be awarded.",6
there will also be an additional assessment task conducted by each robot.,6
specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules handbook.,6
"... item sorting challenge
to accommodate the growth of ecommerce and demand for more efficient sorting and dis-
tribution, warehouse automation has grown to be one of the largest industries in the world.",6
with the advancement of automated technologies it only continues to grow.,6
"for this chal-
lenge teams must build and design robots that will be able to pick and sort different objects
that might be found in a typical warehouse such as boxes and containers.",6
"specific details on
this challenge can be found in the rules handbook.",6
"... miniature fire fighting challenge
fire fighting is one one of the most dangerous professions today.",6
"in order to foster the
development of technology that can complete fire-fighting tasks without a human individual,
this challenge was created.",6
"for this challenge teams must construct robots that autonomously
navigate an “indoor maze” and extinguish a candle that is somewhere in the arena.",6
"the
rules for this challenge drew inspiration from the trinity firefighting challenge and specific
details on these rules can be found in the rules handbook.",6
"... autonomous vehicle challenge
due to recent advancements, the autonomous vehicle industry is currently experiencing rapid
growth and as such the demand for engineers in this field is growing.",6
"for this challenge,
teams will build vehicles that will autonomously complete a small track and avoid obstacles.",6
"... warehouse swarm challenge
swarm robotics is an active area of research in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence.",6
"it is based on the principle of emergent behavior seen in social insects, such as ants and bees,
were the actions of each individual are heavily influenced by those around them.",6
"swarms in
nature make use of many redundant separate entities to accomplish tasks that would have
been difficult to complete alone.",6
"this challenge will give college students the opportunity
to develop multi-robot systems on a hardware and software level as well as specific software
skills such as computer vision and environment navigation.",6
"details on the competition are
in the rules handbook.",6
"... indoor drone challenge
the market for unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) is rapidly growing.",6
"companies like ama-
zon, who is working on uavs to deliver packages from warehouses directly to consumers
in minutes, and uber, who is working on uavs to transport people from place to place
on demand, are spending millions of dollars on development [, ].",6
"this challenge tasks
teams to build a miniature autonomous drone to navigate within a mock city and transport
packages from a pickup location to a destination.",6
"specific details on the competition can be
found in the rules handbook.",6
"... existing competitions
based on feedback, to augment the new robotics competitions we are proposing, we decided
to add an already existing competition.",6
"this would allow participants of these competitions
to enter their already-built robot a second time for another chance to compete.",6
"the following
are competitions we have considered:
• trinity fire fighting robotics challenge
• sparkfun autonomous vehicle challenge
• drone racing
• vex robotics competition
• smart mouse maze competition
.. engineering design judging
for each event we decided there should be a judging section to augment the performance
of the robot in the competition.",6
"for this, teams will have the opportunity to present their
engineering design process and their overall approach to the challenge they competed in.",6
"we
outlined the following topics for teams to demonstrate for this judging:
• understanding - define the problem
• define - determine solution specifications

• ideas - generate concept solutions

 conclusions and recommendations
this section outlines the conclusions and findings of this iqp.",6
"it begins with an overview of
our conclusions based off the background research on other collegiate robotics competitions,
discussions with potential participants and sponsors, and interviews with key stakeholders
at wpi.",6
"next we will give an overview of our selected competitions based off feedback from
interviews and survey results on drafted competitions.",6
"we conclude by explaining how this
proposal fits within the greater wpi ecosystem and recommendations for future work.
. what we discovered
through background research on popular collegiate robotics competitions, discussions with
potential participants and corporate sponsors, and stakeholders at wpi we discovered several
key points about hosting a robotics competition:
• based on our research we identified that successful competitions typically have been
around for many years, are audience friendly, and are based on real-world problems.",6
"• our initial interviews showed that potential participants had a wide range of interests
prompting us to develop proposals for several competitions in the context of hosting
them at wpi.",6
"• after developing these proposals and discussions with wpi stakeholders, such as the
robotics resource center, we decided it was unrealistic to host all seven of the chal-
lenges we initially proposed.",6
"• surveying potential participants on each of these proposed events helped to determine
which were both the most popular and feasible, for both the competing university,
students, and sponsors.",6
"as
such, three of the seven proposed challenges in section .. were selected:
• indoor drone challenge
• warehouse swarm challenge
• miniature fire fighting challenge
these challenges provide a good balance between feasibility and the resources required
for wpi to host, potential participant interest, and the resources required to enter.",6
"they
also help develop skills that are highly relevant in the robotics industry, and experience with
them would put participants at an advantage when seeking a job.",6
".. indoor drone challenge
the first of the selected challenges is the indoor drone challenge.",6
"this challenge would task
participating teams to build a miniature autonomous drone to transport packages from a
pickup location to a destination.",6
"this is designed to simulate tasks that companies like uber
and amazon are building full-sized drones for.",6
"this miniature scale of this competition is
important because it means that:
• low cost to host - one of the largest benefits of an indoor drone challenge is the
low cost to host.",6
"the resources required to host this competition are as follows: a 
by  by  foot indoor netted space, cardboard boxes to be used as obstacles, and a
grid on the floor made from tape and plywood.",6
"• low cost of entry - for those looking to enter this challenge, the cost to entry is
relatively low due to the high availability of parts.",6
"it is estimated that teams would
have to spend between $ and $, on hardware, depending on the size of the
drone, the compute modules chosen, and selected sensors.",6
"• marketable skills - for this challenge, the skills developed are mostly software-based.",6
"these skills include computer vision, obstacle avoidance, and advanced autonomous
navigation.",6
"mechanical skills are also developed, such as designing impact-resistant
systems and with general computer aided design.",6
"• spectator value - highest among all selected challenges is the spectator value of
drones.",6
"for example, drone racing has grown to become highly popular in the last
few years with it expected to keep growing as companies such as espn beginning to
broadcast it [].",6
".. warehouse swarm challenge
the warehouse swarm challenge would task participating teams to create both a hardware
and software platform for five robots to interact with a miniature warehouse and pick up
and deliver packages from and to specified locations.",6
"this challenge was chosen because:
• low cost to host - as with the indoor drone challenge, the warehouse swarm challenge
also has a low cost to host.",6
"the resources need are as follows: up to  by  foot
indoor space and several boards with miniature packages and shelves to simulate the
warehouse.",6
"• low cost of entry - again like the indoor drone challenge, this challenge has a low
cost of entry for participating teams.",6
"the hardware required are all fairly simple, with
components readily available.",6
"it is estimated that teams would have to spend between
$, and $, on hardware, depending on the complexity of mechanisms, sensors,
and compute modules.",6
"• multi-robot challenge - this challenge satisfies the interest we had for a multi-robot
competition with the potential of collaboration with other teams possible.",6
"• marketable skills - skills developed through participation in this challenge are both
mechanical and software based.",6
".. miniature fire fighting challenge
the miniature fire fighting challenge would task participating teams with creating robots to
seek out and extinguish a flame on a small table-top field.",6
"it was primarily chosen because it
would allow existing participants of the trinity fire fighting competition have their robots
compete for a second time.",6
"this challenge would also have the following benefits:
• low cost to host - as with the other two proposed challenges, the miniature fire
fighting challenge has a low cost to host.",6
"the resources required to host this competi-
tion are as follows: a  by  foot indoor space and several boards with the layouts
described in the rules handbook.",6
• low cost of entry - this challenge has a low cost of entry for participating teams.,6
"the hardware required are all fairly simple, with components readily available.",6
"it
is estimated that teams would have to spend between $ and $, on hardware,
depending on the complexity of mechanisms, sensors, and compute modules.",6
"• low difficulty - this challenge was originally targeted at high school students, so the
expected technical difficulty is low.",6
"the actual execution of our proposed competition was not in the scope of
this iqp so an actual committee should be formed to execute the event for the first time.",6
"this
committee would ideally include key members from offices of touchtomorrow, corporate
engagement, the events office, and the robotics resource center as well as professors from
the robotics program who are experts in the technical and educational aspects robotics.",6
"the earliest this event could happen would be during touchtomorrow , with the rules
and competition being announced no later than june of .",6
"this would give universities
enough time to form teams, get funding, and build a competing robot.",6
"i have always strived to complete all tasks in my life by embracing the 
firm promise from god that “i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me” 
(philippians :, king james version).",6
"having faith in my divine creator and heavenly father 
has made this process come to fruition and may he receive all the praise and glory for giving me 
the strength to be successful.",6
"next, i would like to recognize my father and mother (farley wayne and linda caroline 
neece) for always being a pillar of continual encouragement and support in my life.",6
"i cannot put 
into words my sincere appreciativeness for them always being there to meet my every need and 
influencing me to strive to work hard to reach my full potential.",6
"i would like to extend my thanks to dr. kurt michael, the chair of my dissertation 
committee, for seeing my potential and guiding me to completion of my doctoral journey.",6
"i have 
been blessed by his upbeat and enthusiastic personality as he has motivated me to do my very 
best work and continually stay encouraged until the very end.",6
"i also thank dr. travis bradshaw, 
my committee member, for his encouragement and support throughout this process.",6
"also, i thank the 
staff of the svcc upward bound program (i.e.",6
"karen hudson, terri mosley, stephanie 
breeding, mark england, jeff vanhoozier, and george and jane rasnake) for believing in me to 
attain my educational potential.",6
i would also recognize dr. sexton burkett for his assistance.,6
"the scenarios highlighted in this work 
illustrated how costs play a role in protection using knowledge as a countermeasure and 
found the most cost-effective solutions using the same model used by ponemon().",7
"v 
 
this analysis may help companies develop efficient ways to protect themselves from 
social engineering attacks while efficiently managing resources in the social engineering 
realm.",7
"this arises from the impact of such operations, 
whether it has improved or worsened the life of the people in the community.",7
"but sadly, this is less practised in the delivery of construction projects.",7
"pavez 
and alarcon () observed that most construction management methods 
focus more on the contract and project with little or no concern on the social 
elements that relate to the people and the community.",7
"globally, there are now laws and regulations encouraging the built 
environment sector to move towards social value creation.",7
"for instance, in the 
usa, we have the energy policy act of  and the energy independent and 
security act of ; in the uk, the inequality and diversity act of  and the 
public services (social value) act ; within the eu, there is the sustainable 
procurement directive  among others.",7
"even with these, the current 
understanding and conceptualisation of social value, especially in the context of 
delivering a construction project, still remains unclear.",7
"for instance, the term 
corporate social responsibility (csr) and shared value are sometimes used to 
mean social value.",7
"although georgeson, () criticised such narrow 
perception on social value, it shows the concept is not yet well understood in the 
construction industry sector.",7
"it has been reported in the uk, australia and the usa that construction is 
the sector showing the least commitment to social value creation (villeneuve-
simth and chung, ; kernot and mcneill ; barraket et al., ; clark 
and ucak, ).",7
"however, loosemore () argues that the construction 
industry is well positioned for delivering social value objectives from its 
operations.",7
"for example, the construction industry is the world’s largest 
employer; largest employer of youths and it has the capacity to create local jobs 
in the communities of operation (loosemore, a).",7
"despite these 
opportunities, the concept of social value is yet to receive attention from 
construction management researchers (loosemore, a).",7
"according to 
dreveland and lohne (), lack of clear understanding of value (and its 
associated concepts such as social value) could make detailed discussion on it 
difficult, and invariably, its application and practice would be limited.",7
"in recent times, the lean construction approach has shown to be a viable 
means of creating value and minimising waste on construction projects 
(bertelsen, ; koskela, ).",7
"previous studies have also explored and 
shown links between lean construction and sustainable practices (johnsen and 
dreveland, ; fuenzalida et al., ; maris and parrish, ; wu and 
wang, ; huovila and koskela ).",7
"however, very limited studies have 
explored the role of lean construction approach as a means to creating ‘social 
value’ in the built environment.",7
"also, there is generally less discussion on social 
value in construction management literature (loosemore, ), and recent 
reports indicate that social value awareness is still low (burke and king; ; 
social value act, review, ).",7
"this study was therefore undertaken to unravel the current knowledge 
surrounding social value through a critical literature review.",7
"the study presents

ent
findings from a review of the literature on the current knowledge surrounding 
‘social value' and its drivers.",7
"it discusses the relationship between social value, 
csr and shared value.",7
"additionally, this study aims to show how the lean 
production concept of ""customer"" could be used to support social value 
realisation in the delivery of construction projects.",7
"the key research questions 
addressed are:  
() what is the current understanding surrounding social value delivery?",7
"() how can lean approach support the realisation of social value delivery 
on construction projects?",7
"this paper extends the on-going debate around social value from construction 
management and lean construction perspectives and contributes to the literature 
on social value in construction management.",7
"more importantly, it creates a new 
insight into how social value can be realised in construction project delivery 
using lean production philosophy.",7
"the paper is structured thus; the first section 
discusses the current knowledge surrounding social value.",7
"the section examines 
the concept of social value, the need for social value, its current drivers and the 
relationship between social value, shared value and csr.",7
"the second section 
examines the role of lean approaches in delivering social value on construction 
projects.",7
"research method 
the use of literature review in understanding current knowledge and creating 
new insight for future research agenda is growing in medical sciences, 
management sciences and more importantly in construction management 
research (naoum and egbu, ; tranfield et al., ; gant and booth, 
).",7
"in order to explore the current knowledge around social value and 
provide an insight into the on-going debate from construction management and 
lean construction perspectives, a critical literature review approach was adopted.",7
"grant and booth, () confirmed that critical literature review allows for the 
synthesis of materials from different sources, allows for a degree of analysis and 
conceptual innovations, provides a conceptual contribution to existing body of 
knowledge and serves as a launch pad for new research.",7
"these attributes of 
critical review align with the focus of the current study.",7
"however, critical review approach has been viewed to be unsystematic 
(grant and booth, ).",7
"to overcome this in the current study, a review 
strategy was developed.",7
"purposive and snowballing sampling approach was 
adopted in selecting studies included in the review (bryman, ; sanders, 
).",7
"purposive sampling approach enables the researcher to select the 
population (articles or studies) that are relevant in answering the research 
questions.",7
"the goal here is not in the quantitative or statistical analysis of the 
studies, rather it is in the interpretative analysis of the study included.",7
"this 
means the focus of the literature search would not be rigid as in systematic 
reviews (tranfield et al., ).",7
"this approach allows a search of as many 
sources as possible and to identify relevant materials that answer the research 
question.",7
"grant and booths, () argued that the essence of a critical review 
is not in quality assessment of the studies, but to interpretively analyse the 
studies included and provide a conceptual contribution.",7
"the focus of the current 
study is to make a conceptual contribution to the current knowledge around

social value from construction management and lean construction perspectives 
through interpretive analysis of the studies included in the review in order to 
answer the research questions.",7
"additionally, sanders et al., () show that 
the snowballing approach is used when it is difficult to identify the members of 
the proposed population for the study from the onset.",7
"in this study, snowballing 
approach was used to identify other relevant articles and materials through a 
close examination of the reference lists and bibliographies of already identified 
relevant studies.",7
"the population for the study was literature that focuses on social value and 
lean in mainstream management science, construction management and lean 
construction.",7
"in achieving this, a robust literature search protocol that selects 
publications based on source and its relationship to the study research question 
was developed.",7
"this includes combining key terms from the study and 
subsequently searching on databases, perusing of the identified paper abstract 
and snowballing of relevant study reference lists and bibliographies.",7
"through this 
process, relevant materials that align with the research question were identified 
and critically reviewed.",7
"a search of the literature was done using online databases; emerald, 
elsevier, scopus, google scholar, willey online, taylor and francis online.",7
"in 
addition, peer review articles from the international group for lean group for 
lean construction (iglc) publications and relevant materials that answer the 
research questions were identified.",7
"the search was conducted between january 
and december .",7
"a number of terms and combination of terms that align 
with the topics were used in the search.",7
"the articles reviewed were those published in 
english language and that align with the topic.",7
"however, it emerged from the search that not much had been documented 
on the social value on some of these databases and journals especially in 
relation to construction project delivery.",7
"for instance, a purposive search on the 
term ""social value"" in the journal of construction management and economics 
revealed only  papers.",7
"again, this confirms that the concept of social value is 
still at an infant stage in construction management literature (loosemore, 
a; ).",7
"as a consequence, the search was extended to include 
government reports, technical reports and website materials on social value.",7
"this was done to gain an in-depth understanding of the current debate around 
social value and to ensure no available relevant materials were omitted.",7
"a total 
of  studies were critically reviewed.",7
"current knowledge surrounding social value 
the concept of social value 
there is a lack of absoluteness in the definition of ‘social value’.",7
"according to 
choi et al., () social value is complex to define due to its intricate and 
subjective nature.",7
"nevertheless, various reports and research publications have 
page  of 

engineering, construction and architectural management




























































engineering, construction and architectural m

ent
attempted to offer definitions and explanations on the concept of “social value” 
as presented in table .",7
"the table presents the definitions of social value and 
the emerging themes found from the several definitions.",7
"the publications in 
table  are categorised into two; government publications (non-research 
publications) and research publications.",7
"analysis of the definitions and emerging 
themes from both government and research publications show that in order to 
create social value, every business should consider how its operation would 
improve the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the communities 
where they execute their business.",7
"applying this to construction, loosemore and 
hoggin, () reiterate that the goal of construction firms, therefore, should 
not only be to make profits and improve productivity for its stakeholders, but it 
should include engaging and improving the communities where they build.",7
"notwithstanding, table  confirms the previous assertions that there is no 
absolute definition of social value (loosemore, ; choi et al, ).",7
"for 
instance, from the government publications, it can be seen that social enterprise 
uk (seuk) views social value as ‘thinking' on how scarce resource should be 
used, which is too broad.",7
"on the other hand, the social value definition provided 
by hmrc was definite on three elements (social, economic and the environment) 
as the focus of creating social value.",7
"it is worth remarking that the need for sv 
measurement was highlighted in most of the research publications' definitions.",7
"but this was not clearly mentioned in government publications' definitions of 
social value.",7
"this could be due to the empirical nature of the research 
publication studies and the increasing understanding of the need for measuring 
the social impact of an organisation's operations.",7
"in addition to social value 
measurement, some authors argued in their definitions that social value is 
beyond compliance with csr by organisations (loosemore, ; a).",7
"the 
emphasis on the need for measuring social value from the research publications 
shows that it is not sufficient to just include the social value in a contract; 
strategies for measuring it should also be put in place.",7
"furthermore, table  reveals that, despite the current understanding on 
social value, there is still no clear or single criterion for measuring social value 
(retolaza et al; ; loosemore and hoggin, ; choi et al, ).",7
"this 
means the criteria to be used in measuring or identifying social value and the 
additional benefits to be created as stated in some of the definitions of social 
value in table  could differ for different context and audience.",7
"it is no surprise 
choi et al., () assert that social value is very elusive compared to economic 
value as there is lack of objective approach to measuring its outcomes.",7
"according to burke and king, (), subjectivity in social outcome could limit 
objective measurement in social value, as situations and events could change in 
the process.",7
"this implies that there should be no prescriptive approach in defining the 
supposed additional benefits mentioned in the definition of social value above, 
rather, the nature of the stakeholders in the community, context, and situations 
should define the additional benefits expected from the process.",7
"the implication 
of this for construction organisations in the delivery of its project is that; the 
page  of

social values to be created on a project should not be pre-determined outside 
the project environment, rather they should be identified through direct 
engagement with the stakeholders in the community.",7
"however, this is less 
practised by construction organisations.",7
"georgeson, () observed that 
traditionally, organisations use a top-down approach to decide what to provide 
for a community as part of their csr.",7
"however, this is contrary to the bottom-up 
approach advocated in social value practice.",7
"the need for delivering social value 
the need for delivering products and services with regard to the impact on the 
economy, the environment and social well-being of the community is increasing 
in every sector (choi et al., ; fernandes et al., ).",7
"according to ghazali, 
() organisations that do not care for the environment or contribute to the 
wellbeing of the community could have their services and products boycotted 
and image degraded.",7
"this suggests that companies can engage in the creation 
of social value to increase or improve their social image in the eyes of 
stakeholders.",7
"however, it has been observed that the commercial sector is 
reluctant to practice social value, as it is usually seen as a separate entity from 
an economic value (choi et al., ).",7
"this view is also supported by the 
separation theory (friedma , ), where companies are seen only as a 
contributing engine to the economic function with less attention to their social 
roles.",7
"however, charities, social enterprises, ngos and the public service are 
calling for the consideration and inclusion of social value practice in businesses 
(choi et al., ; croydon council, ).",7
"these demands for creating social 
value alongside economic value are increasing.",7
"it has been observed that social 
value is now a growing organisational issue with five different groups identified 
by the g to be interested in social value (the social impact investment 
taskforce, ).",7
"the groups include government, foundations, social sector 
organisations, impact-driven businesses, and impact investors.",7
"tomlins () 
further described the impact-driven businesses and impact investor groups to be 
customers and users.",7
"in construction project delivery, ""the impact-driven 
business group"" can be those the construction operations directly or indirectly 
affect.",7
"these groups would expect commitment and contribution to the delivery 
of social value to the community and the environment from construction 
companies operating in their vicinity.",7
"according to ofori et al., () 
consideration for the environment by construction organisations would certainly 
change the way construction projects are executed.",7
"however, studies have 
shown that the construction industry is reluctant about this and more concerned 
about the short-term cost benefit from projects (choi et al., ; ofori et al., 
).",7
"current drivers for delivering social value 
from the comprehensive literature review, five core drivers for delivering social 
value were identified as presented in figure  and discussed subsequently 
(tomlins, ).",7
"these include; 
• the business imperatives for an organisation  
• business sense of social value

• global interest in the social value 
• opportunities in the social value sector

business imperative for social value  
there is growing understanding of the measurement of the impact of businesses 
in rece t times with attention being given to business delivery and accounting 
for social value (tomlins, ; scot, ).",7
"the ""triple bottom line accounting"" 
that considers social, environmental and financial impacts have been used since 
the 's to measure business influence (tomlins, ).",7
"this approach is also 
known as the ps: that is profit, planet, and people.",7
"traditionally, construction 
project management operation seems to focus more on profit rather than on the 
planet and people (pavez and alarcon, ).",7
"however, burke and king, () 
observe that commitment to social value objectives make organisations 
competitive.",7
"this shows that investment in social value creation by construction 
organisations is not a waste, but rather positions an organisation to perform 
better in its businesses.",7
"global interest in social value impact 
the need to deliver social value has been echoed by world leaders.",7
"at the g 
meeting held in the uk in , david cameron, the then uk prime minister 
stated that:  
“i want to use our g presidency to push this agenda forward.",7
"we will work 
with other g nations to grow the social investment market and increase 
investment, allowing the best social innovations to spread and help tackle 
our shared social and economic challenges”.",7
"david cameron prime minister, 
uk world economic forum (the social impact investment taskforce, , 
p.).",7
the above statement shows the global interest in social value.,7
"however, the 
commitment was beyond the statement above as structures were put in place to 
support the achievement of the proposal at the end of the g meeting in .",7
"the three main structures put in place as indicated in the report (the social 
impact investment taskforce , ) are; () the social impact 
investment taskforce to drive the process () the working group on impact 
measurement and () the global learning exchange.",7
"the commitment of the g 
to this shows their view on social investment as having a potential to support 
growth, innovation, and to address social problems in the society (tomlins, 
).",7
"also, the eu is committed to supporting social investment.",7
"since , 
 million euros has been given out to social enterprises that are able to 
demonstrate measurable social impact (brussels, ).",7
"opportunities in social investment market  
tomlins, () observed that in the uk, the social investment market 
comprises of the private, the public and voluntary sectors.",7

social investment market.",7

participating in the social investment market and there are numerous 
opportunities in the social investment market.",7
"for example, a current report 
indicates that the desire for social investment market in the uk was about £ 
billion in  (uk national advisory board, ).",7
"the very few construction 
organisations that focus on delivering social value are benefiting from these 
opportunities.",7

construction (loosemore, ).",7

reported that the chartered association of building engineers has made creating 
social value a core point in their service delivery (raiden et al., ).",7

above statement shows that businesses within the private sector are realising 
the likely impact of lack of commitment to social value in the delivery of their 
operations.",7
"legislation and regulation driving social value delivery  
in addition to the business imperatives, evidence from literature reveals that 
various legislation and regulations are now in place from across the world to 
drive the consideration for social value in businesses (tomlins, ;

it is believed that the goal of every organisation should be to create value, and 
this should include the creation of social and economic value for the society.",7

between the functions as shown in figure .",7
"according to retolaza, et al., () 
there is lack of clear integration between the economic and social views in the 
separation theory.",7
"this view has made companies/organisations believe that the 
foundation of the company’s operation only lies in the economic gain rather than 
in value creation (retolaza et al., ).",7
"it could be argued that less 
commitment to the creation of social value could have been influenced by this 
so-called ""separation theory"".",7
"however, this narrow view on the function of firms 
has been heavily criticised.",7
"freeman, () called for a shift in the previous 
practice and advocated the need for complete integration of economic and social 
values in the operations of an organisation.",7
"this implies companies should not view the creation of social value as a 
separate operation from the economic value it hopes to deliver to its 
shareholders, rather, both should be incorporated and delivered as a system 
with a goal of influencing the society at large.",7
"man-fong ho (), argues that 
business organisations cannot function in a social vacuum, but must definitely 
interact with the communities and the environment where they operate.",7
"according to freeman, () a company's sustainability in business and 
creation of value is not only for the company's shareholders but also to the 
society and the environment.",7
"this position has great implication for construction 
clients, main contracting companies and supply chain companies in their 
operations.",7
"clearly, it requires a defined strategy by these companies and their 
supply chains to specify how each of their operations would fulfil the economic, 
social, and environmental needs in the delivery of their activities right from the 
economic value proposition stage.",7
"this means the economic value proposition 
should not be separated from the social value in the business case.",7
"however, 
companies are mainly seen as economic generating blocks (groth et al., ).",7
"notwithstanding, man-fong ho, () reiterates that for construction 
organisations to survive in the present day reality, they must pay attention to 
ethical issues (social value) in the delivery of projects.",7
"this could be demonstrated in new build, maintenance, infrastructure 
projects, and other operations in construction project delivery.",7
"in practice, the 
theory requires that generation of economic value should be clearly linked with 
the social elements.",7
"it means that social value should not be viewed as an 
extension of economic value as advocated in the separation theory (friedman, 
).",7
"furthermore, what the new theory (theory of integration freeman, ) 
means for main contractors and construction clients is that the assessments of 
supply chains' performance should not be limited to the four project key 
performance indicators (time, cost, quality and safety) alone.",7
"it should also 
include their commitment to integrating economic and social value for the 
benefit of the society at large.",7

responsibility and shared value 
while these three concepts show a strong relationship with each other, they are 
not exactly the same.",7

by business to contribute to economic development while improving the quality 
of life of the workforce and their families as well as the community and the 
society at large"" (wbscsd , p.).",7
"shared value is defined as ""policies and 
operati g practice that enhances the competitiveness of a company while 
simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities 
in which it operates"" (porter and kramer, ).",7
"both definitions show the 
intention to contribute to the economic and social conditions of the communities 
of their operations.",7
"however, in csr practice, contributing to the economic and social condition 
may not occur simultaneously as expected in shared value practice.",7
"shared 
value has been viewed as an extension of csr (georgeson, ).",7
"social value, 
on the other hand, has been referred to ""as a wider non-financial impact of 
programmes, organisations, and interventions including the wellbeing of 
individuals and communities, social capital and the environment"" (wood and 
leighton ).",7
"the key difference between the two earlier definitions and social 
value is that social value is not directly tied to the financial gain that would 
accrue from the process.",7
"this implies that even when there is no obvious financial benefit, a social 
value could still be delivered, although this does not mean that social value does 
not result into financial benefits (pasquire and salvatierra-garrido, ).",7
"for 
instance, an organisation or corporation could reduce or abandon their 
commitment to csr and shared value practice if it is observed that the final 
outcome does not align with the company’s business model.",7
"also, csr and 
shared value have been criticised as a top-bottom approach to delivering 
community good (georgeson, ).",7
"this implies that the community has little 
say in the decision process.",7
"however, delivering social value is a bottom-up 
approach.",7
"that is, the community has a major say in determining or identifying 
the social value to be created.",7
"all this suggests that social value is beyond csr 
and shared value practices.",7
"the key difference therefore between social value, 
csr and shared value is that, while csr and shared value use a top-bottom 
approach in delivering the community good, social value uses the bottom-up 
approach.",7

the wider society and to integrate social value delivery into the delivery process 
of a construction project.",7
"however, porter and kramer () found that sv is 
considered to be a philanthropic activity rather than an activity that must be 
engaged with for successful delivery of a construction project.",7
"this means there 
may still be some reluctance by construction project organisations in considering 
sv delivery as part of their core function in the project execution process.",7
"this 
shows the need to consider sv in the delivery of construction project is gaining 
attention.",7

industry needs to show more commitment to improving the wider society where 
they operate because of the impact of their activities on the society.",7
"social value in construction procurement

construction industry cannot be overemphasised.",7
"recent studies have shown 
social procurement has the approach used in creating social value in construction 
project delivery (denny-smith and loosemore, ; pertersen and kadofors, 
; reid and loosemore, ).",7
"this could be so since the procurement process drives 
how the project is delivered.",7
"in the uk, croydon council reported some case 
studies on how sv was incorporated into evaluation criteria, tender stage and 
tender documentation in the delivery of its construction projects.",7
"however, this must be viewed with caution, as reid and loosemore, 
() found from their australian study that the social procurement is done 
mostly by organisations to comply with the regulation.",7
"the danger with this is 
that, if organisations view it as a tick box exercise rather than improving the 
local economy, the local community and environment where they operate, the 
goal of the entire process would be defeated.",7

inclusion of contractual clauses that support sv delivery, a personal relationship 
built on trust should also be developed.",7

that a mixture of contractual and interpersonal approach is the sure panacea to 
secure social procurement in the delivery of construction projects.",7

"bridgeman et al., () found from their study that providing training and 
placement opportunities for students influences their future career choice and

examining the role of lean approach in social 
value delivery on construction projects.",7
"search in lean production approach 
 
various authors have described extensively the evolution of lean production and 
the tps in the manufacturing industry (shah and ward, ; womack and 
jones, ).",7
"the goal of lean production is to add value and eliminate waste 
from the product right from design through to the manufacturing or production 
stage.",7
"however, shah and ward, () cautioned that lean production should 
not be viewed as waste elimination alone, but, rather as an integrated process 
that considers both the product and the processes involved in developing the 
product.",7
"this implies that the focus of lean production is not just on the final 
product, but also on the processes that culminate in the development of the final 
product.",7
"sadly, this view is less upheld in the delivery of construction projects.",7
"according to kagioglou et al, () construction project delivery focuses more 
on the final product than on the processes involved in delivering it.",7
"the social 
value, on the other hand, emphasises the need for every construction project to 
critically consider the processes involved in the delivery of its final product with 
the goal of creating a positive influence on stakeholders in the community, the 
local economy and on the physical environment.",7
"in the toyota production 
system (tps), this entails recognising the problem that would impede flow in the 
production and incorporate it as a task in the production process (spear, ).",7
"this implies understanding the impact of a construction project on the local 
community, the local economy and the environment, and integrating them into 
the project execution process would support better value delivery from the 
construction project.",7
"from the foregoing, it could be argued that the lean production approach or 
view has more potential to support the achievement of social value delivery on 
construction project compared to the current traditional view that dominates 
construction project delivery.",7
"this is because the latter focuses more on the 
product than the process involved in delivering it (farag et al, ; ballard and 
howell; ; kagioglou et al, ).",7
"however, the view of likening the 
manufacturing industry (lean production) to the construction industry projects is 
not accepted by all.",7
"for example, gann, () opined that construction 
products are usually large and immobile; this implies that construction products 
are created at the point of consumption, unlike manufacturing where materials 
are fully produced in the factory before sending it to the market.",7
"although, 
salem et al., (), agreed that there are clear differences between the 
manufacturing and the construction industry; they conceded that both 
operations involve ‘production' and ‘services' with the aim of meeting customer 
demands and requirements.",7
"tommelein et al., () also argued that both the 
manufacturing and the construction industries can be seen as production 
systems that use processing points and hand over partially completed work to 
the next customer.",7
"this means in both manufacturing and construction projects, 
the goal is to satisfy the next customer.",7
"however, the current understanding of a 
“customer” in construction project delivery focuses more on the paying client

and this view is too narrow.",7
"but in lean production, the customer also includes 
people who are on the production line.",7
"with this understanding, the concept of a customer in construction project 
delivery could be widened to include the local communities, the local economy 
and the physical environment where the project is undertaken.",7
"for instance, 
salvatierra-garrido and pasquire, () challenged the construction industry to 
move away from the project based context to a more global context that 
adequately considers the impact of construction operations on the wider 
customer or community.",7
"furthermore, spear and bowen, () from their 
study that explores the dna of the tps show the importance of identifying the 
customers on the production line so as to design the production system to suit 
them.",7
"this helps in the maintenance of a smooth flow in the production system 
and also shows the essence of considering the wider customer a construction 
project could impact.",7
"this view is also supported by an earlier call by ofori 
() that the construction industry should include consideration for the 
environment as the fourth objective of measuring project performance in 
addition to cost, quali y, and time.",7
"this entails embedding the culture of caring 
for the environment and people living in the environment.",7
"similarly, close and 
loosemore, () called on the construction industry to view the communities 
where they operate as an asset rather than a liability.",7
"this means, in delivering 
social value from a lean production perspective, the community and physical 
environment should be viewed as customers.",7
"despite this call, the construction 
industry has not really changed its approach to project performance 
measurement indicators.",7
"it could be argued that the non-consideration of social 
value as an activity that contributes to the achievement of project goals, could 
have contributed to lack of sv delivery on construction projects (porter and 
kramer, ).",7
"however, arroyo and gonzalez, (); johnsen and dreveland, () 
argued that to deliver viable value in the built environment, effort should be 
extended to improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of the 
inhabitants during the design and delivery process.",7
"the importance of paying 
attention to the above-mentioned factors in construction project delivery cannot 
be over-emphasised as its absence usually leads to what awakul and ogunlana, 
() call interface conflicts.",7
"interface conflict is a conflict that occurs between 
the internal project group and those outside the project such as the 
communities, and ngos situated around the project.",7
"kishor and ogunlana 
() identified the consequence of such conflicts to include delays, cost and 
time overruns and even suspension of the project.",7
"again, this shows the 
importance of viewing the communities and environment as customers as 
advocated in lean production.",7
"bae and kim, () observe that lean production approaches have a 
positive impact on community wellbeing, the loyalty of stakeholders, resource 
saving, and reduces resource depletion among others.",7
"however, to achieve this 
in practice requires having conversations and consideration for each customer in 
the production process.",7
"for the purpose of delivering social value, this must 
include the community.",7
"from a construction project perspective, community 
refers to people, places or things that could be directly or indirectly affected by 
the construction project (close and loosemore, ; thomson et al., ).",7
"the conversations and considerations (for the community) should include

elements such as people, plants and animals, settlements, and local economies 
among others.",7
"this places the onus on construction organisations to consider the 
local communities and physical environment as ""customers' in the delivery of 
their services so as to create value.",7
"but this is less practised in the traditional 
approach of construction project management (paz and alarcon, ; ballard 
and howell, ), which in no doubt limits social value creation.",7
"search in lean construction: the tfv model 
koskela (), argued that traditionally, most construction operations focus on 
transformation activities (input and output), with little or no attention on flow 
and value generating activities.",7
"following these observations, koskela, () 
introduced the transformation, flow and value view (tfv) model in lean 
construction.",7
"while the flow (f) view focuses on material flow, the value (v) 
view focuses on the customer (koskela and howell, ).",7
"the tfv model 
provides a unique approach to support social value delivery on construction 
projects.",7
"the flow (f) in the tfv model means consideration for the flow in the 
production or construction process.",7
"according to koskela and ballard, () proper management of the 
relationships between these “process flows” is essential for the smooth running 
of the production system on site.",7
"in the delivery of social value on a construction 
project, various activities are interlinked and the relationships between these 
activities must be identified and managed for smooth flow.",7
"for instance, external 
condition and people are among “the process flow” conditions identified in the 
“flow view” for smooth workflow on construction projects.",7
"using the “flow view” 
lens for sv delivery, the “external condition” and “the people” could mean the 
physical environment and the people living in the community where the project 
is undertaken.",7
"studies have shown that construction activities have an impact on the 
external environment and people and as such, they should be adequately 
considered for successful project delivery (salvatierra-garrido and pasquire, 
; ofori et al., ).",7
"this means to support the smooth flow of activities on 
the project, engagement and consideration for (this process flow conditions- 
external conditions and people) are essentials.",7
"this could entail identification 
with the stakeholders in the community to better understand where the project 
would best contribute to their social, economic and environmental needs.",7
"there 
is evidence that early engagement of the project team with the communities 
around the project to identify with their social, economic and environmental 
needs prevents disputes and conflicts from the communities around the project 
(daniel and pasquire, ; ofori et al., ).",7
"awakul and ogunlana, () 
also observed that lack of engagement with the local communities around the 
project contributes to the interference of construction project.",7
"furthermore, in the construction phase, maintaining a smooth flow in the 
delivery of materials and execution of tasks would prevent “push” and support 
“pull” approach as observed in koskela et al., ().",7
"the push approach 
supports the delivery of materials and commencement task as shown on the 
master programme, even when the space for work and the work is not ready.",7
"the lack of consideration for “the process flow conditions” lead to “push” on 
construction projects which contributes to the non-achievement of tasks as

"in practice the 
“push” approach could lead to site congestion, accident and pollution of the 
environment, thus reducing the achievement of social value delivery on the 
project.",7
"however, the “pull” approach which is the focus of “the process flows”, 
allows delivery of materials and commencement of tasks based on the real-time 
situation on site.",7
"this supports just-in-time delivery, thus reducing congestion 
on site.",7
"this means the ""pull"" approach has the potential to support sv delivery 
on a construction project as it helps in reducing congestions on site and 
environmental pollutions.",7
"the focus of the (v) “value generation view” in the tfv model is to create 
value from the customer’s perspective (koskela, ).",7
"it must be noted that 
the term customer as used here is not limited to the paying client alone who is 
seen as the internal customer, rather, it includes both the internal customers 
(client) and external customers (local community and the environment).",7
"although, the concept of value generation from the customer perspective has 
been in production for many decades (shewhart, ); the construction 
industry is yet to embrace this concept in its practices.",7
"one of the key principles 
in the “value generation view” is to ensure customer requirements are satisfied 
(koskela, ).",7
"according to koskela and howell, (), the decision-making 
process that supports value generation view should be decentralised and all the 
stakeholders in the development process should be given a clear say.",7
"this 
means, in adopting the “value generation view” to support social value delivery 
on construction projects, the management of the construction process should 
include consideration both for the internal and external customers by engaging 
them in some of the decision making process.",7
"georgson, () asserted that 
social value is built on ""bottom-top"" approach so as to allow the customers make 
an input in the decision process.",7
"this clearly aligns with the “value generation 
view” in the tfv model.",7
"this means the value generation view in the tfv model 
could empower the local communities where construction projects are 
undertaken to make an input by identifying activities that would improve the life 
of the people around the project.",7
"in reality “the bottom top approach” requires 
construction organisations to consult with the community (customer) in the 
design and delivery of its operations so as to create high impact social value.",7
"however, koskela and vrijhoef, () found that the ""bottom-top"" approach is 
absent in construction project management and this hinders innovation in 
construction project delivery.",7
"also, the “value generation view” empowers those doing the work to 
contribute to the production process on site as advocated in the last planner 
system (lps) (ballard, ).",7
"in the lps, each trade in the construction process 
is viewed as a customer and allowed to make an input to the production process 
on site (ballard and tommelein, ).",7
"according to ballard, (); ballard and 
tommelein, () the lps process contributes to the development of a reliable 
and predictable plan.",7
"however, its implementation is still fragmented and recent 
studies tend to report that its crucial elements are not fully implemented on 
construction projects (daniel et al., ).",7
"nevertheless, the use of the lps in 
managing project production on construction projects is on the increase due to 
its capacity to manage complex relationships and develop a predictable plan 
through collaborative planning (lci, ; daniel et al., ; ballard and

"it could be argued that the on-time delivery of construction projects through the 
use of lps will not only benefit the client and main contractor, but also the local 
community around the project, the environment, and the local and national 
economy.",7
"for example, the environmental pollution, noise pollution, road 
congestion etc.",7
"that could arise from such construction activities would be 
eliminated quickly.",7
"this shows that the application of lps; a lean construction 
approach, would support the achievement of sv delivery on a construction 
project.",7
"search in lean principles 
womack and jones, () found that in delivering products and services based 
on lean principles, identification of value from the customer perspective should 
be among the core principles to be observed.",7

delivering value identified in womack and jones, () include: () identify 
customers and specify the value () identify and map the value stream () 
create flow by eliminating waste () respond to customer pull () pursue 
perfection.",7
"from the lean principles above, to identify customers in the context 
of construction project delivery could mean to identify the elements that make 
up the communities with a view to specifying the value from their perspective.",7
"delivering value from lean project production perspective supports the reduction 
of non-value adding activities; improves transparency and collaboration 
(johnsen and dreveland, ; fuenzalida et al., ; maris and parrish, ; 
wu and wang, ; huovila and koskela ).",7
"additionally, responding to customer “pull” as advocated in lean production 
could mean the customer/communities receive what they require at the right 
time, in the right quality and quantity.",7
"this would certainly curtail the 
emergence of interface conflict on projects (awakul and ogunlana, ); thus, 
supporting the social value delivery of projects.",7
"the pull principle that supports continuous improvements, offers opportunities 
for construction organisations to reflect on the feedback received from the 
communities on the social value delivered.",7

value created can be improved upon in the future.",7

the aim of this paper is to explore the existing knowledge around social 
value and to evaluate how lean production philosophy could support the 
realisation of social value in construction project delivery.",7
"the study found that: 
 social value emphasises the need to critically consider and create a 
positive influence on the individual stakeholders in the community and on 
the physical environment.",7
"it connotes a shift from the traditional goal of 
getting the lowest cost or price to the goal of delivering satisfactory 
service/product to both the individual in the community and the physical 
environment in the community-especially in executing construction 
projects.",7
" freeman’s () integration theory shows that creation of social value 
should not be a separate operation from the economic value, rather, both 
should be incorporated and delivered as a system with the goal of 
influencing the society at large.",7
" the low commitment to the creation of social value by construction firms 
could have been influenced by the so-called ""separation theory"" 
postulated by friedman .",7
" the case for delivering social value is not with the legislation and 
regulation alone, rather, it includes other elements such as the business 
sense of it, global interest, and social value market opportunities among 
others that could support both private and public sectors (construction 
organisations) in delivering businesses in a more efficient way.",7
" the key difference between social value, csr and shared value is that, 
while csr and shared value use a top-bottom approach in delivering 
community good, social value uses a bottom-up approach.",7
" lean production philosophy supports the achievement of social value 
objectives in construction project delivery, as it helps construction 
organisations to conceptualise the communities and physical environment 
where they operate as their customers, rather than mere people and 
place.",7
"  the ""flow"" and ""value"" in the tfv support smooth workflow in the 
construction process and development of reliable construction programme

approach.",7
"conclusions 
the purpose of this study was to determine the current knowledge surrounding 
social value and to evaluate the role of lean production philosophy in achieving 
social value objectives in construction project delivery.",7
"the study establishes 
that the current level of awareness on social value is still low and there is a 
dearth of scholarly publications on social value, especially in construction 
management literature.",7
"the study found that there is still no clear or single 
criterion for measuring social value delivered.",7
"this means the criteria to be used 
in measuring or identifying social value could differ for different contexts and 
audiences.",7

potential to support the delivery of social value objectives on construction

projects.",7
"the lean production approach enables construction organisations to 
conceptualise the community and the physical environment where they operate 
as their customers, rather than mere people, places and things.",7
"this further 
encourages their commitment to the delivery of social value to the local 
community and physical environment around their construction projects.",7
"additionally, the “flow” and “value” views in the tfv model support smooth 
workflow in the construction process and in the development of reliable 
construction programme.",7
"this contributes to the on-time delivery of construction 
projects through the application of the lps principles, thus, enhancing the 
positive contribution of a project to the society, the environment and economy.",7
"the tudy reveals that the separation theory propagated by friedman, 
(), tends to separate social value from economic value, thus making 
organisations care less about delivering social value.",7
"however, this view was 
challenged by freeman, () in his integrated theory.",7
"this implies that 
construction organisations should not view the creation of social value as a 
separate operation from the economic value, rather, both should be incorporated 
and delivered as a system with a goal of influencing the society at large.",7
"the 
results of this investigation show that the current driver for social value delivery 
is not only the legislation but also, its business imperative, the global interest in 
social value, the opportunities for social investment and the business sense in 
delivering social value.",7
"this implies the commitment to the delivery of social 
value on construction projects or organisations should not be seen as a tick box 
exercise that is compliance driven since there are other benefits such as the 
business sense of doing it.",7
"the investigation confirms that there is a relationship between csr, shared 
value and social value.",7
"however, csr and shared value are not the same as 
social value.",7
"the study found that while csr and shared value use a top-down 
approach in making decisions on the nature of support to be provided for the 
community, social value decisions are made based on the customers' perspective 
(the communities) through an all-inclusive conversation and engagement with 
stakeholders.",7
"the study concludes that conceptualising the community and 
physical environment around the construction project using the lean concept of 
customer and tfv model would support social value realisations in the delivery 
of construction projects.",7
"this study is based on literature review evidence and 
the findings serve as a foundation on which future studies can be built upon.",7
"obtaining empirical evidence on social value practice with the aim of developing 
an approach for evidencing social value in construction project delivery will form 
the next stage of the research by the authors.",7
"while hackers target loop holes in 
technology, social engineers manipulate humans to access information that cannot be easily accessed.",7
"social 
engineers exploit human feelings and thoughts through fear, curiosity, greed and sympathy (alexander, ).",7
"they capitalize on the psychology of people’s expect and tendency to help others (jones, , p. ).",7
"se attacks 
come in various forms ranging from telephone calls and email requesting personal information from what appears 
to be a legitimate source or text message (parrish jr, bailey, & courtney, , p. ).",7
"there are two main types 
of se attacks, the targeted and target of opportunity (bullée, montoya, pieters, junger & hartel, ).",7
"a targeted 
attack is the one in which the attacker is very specific in terms of the victim while a target of opportunity attack is 
the one in which the attacker distributes to a lot of people hoping to get response from as many victims as possible.",7
"se usually involves two stages, the location, and the psychological method used.",7
"the location is where the attack 
takes place.",7
"this could be online, at work place or over the telephone.",7
"the second phase involves using different 
psychological methods to manipulate a victim.",7
"it includes exploitation of asserted authority, people’s commitments 
and strong relationships.",7
"the exploitation can come in form of manipulating people’s tendency to help, 
reciprocation, liking and similarity (jones, , p. ).",7
"irrespective of the method used, the goal of a social engineer 
is to gain access to desired information by manipulating the victim without the victim’s awareness.",7
information is of great importance to governments and organizations.,7
"there has been a rise in information security 
violations with attempts to get sensitive information by illegal access.",7
"organizations invest a lot in technical 
solutions to prevent information theft.",7
"humans often react to emotions which makes them more 
vulnerable than machines (mouton, et al., , p. ).",7
"mouton also noted that an organization’s biggest threat 
is not technical protection but the people working in the organization.",7
"attackers find it easier to gain unauthorized 
access through people rather than penetrating the security system (mouton, leenen, et al., , p. ).",7
"several 
organizations tend to use training solutions and raising awareness through warnings about social engineering 
attacks.",7
"these methods have generally been proven to be ineffective (junger, montoya, & overink, , p. ).",7
"proceedings of the th australian information security management conference () 
this is likely because most training around social engineering are based on detecting electronic threats such as the 
phishing attack and avoiding malware downloads which can be easy to manage.",7
"however, the human-based social 
engineering attack which has been neglected poses more threats to the organization (hadnagy, ).",7
"in this paper 
we report exploratory pilot study research into personality type as an antecedent for human behaviour and adopt 
the research question “what individual’s personality traits is more susceptibility to social engineering attacks?” 
the following propositions were developed from the literature reviewed.",7
"p: each personality trait of the big five model are susceptible to different types of social 
engineering attack.",7
p: a user’s personality trait will increase the user’s susceptibility to social engineering attack.,7
"background literature 
orgill et al.",7
"investigated user’s susceptibility to se attacks by posing as a computer support engin eer 
from the organization asking for personal information such as username and passwords with the disguise 
of performing vulnerability auditing on the network.",7
"it was discovered that % of the people gave their 
username and % provided their password (orgill, romney, bailey, & orgill, , p. ).",7
"also, the  
result showed that isolated users were easier to manipulate than those in groups.",7
"furthermore, the effect 
of peer pressure and authority had significant influence on the likelihood of user’s suscepti bility to se.",7
"conducted an e-mail based social engineering attack study to raise awareness and assess 
the threat of social engineering attacks on it systems (bakhshi, papadaki, & furnel l, , p. ).",7
"an 
experimental website was created and email with embedded link to website was sent out to employees.",7
the result indicated that about  percent of the employees followed the link.,7
"a similar study by jagatic 
et al.",7
focused on phishing on social networks.,7
"the research was done on university students and the 
result indicated that the students were highly susceptible to fishing attack.",7
the result of these studies shows how vulnerable an organization can be to social engineering attacks.,7
"one of the ways to deal with social engineering attacks is to understand why individuals fall for this 
attack and then to provide training as a countermeasure.",7
"a successful se attack can be determined by 
the extent to which the victim is able to resist manipulation or be able to detect the attack (uebelacker 
& quiel, , p. ).",7
"one of the ways of understanding what qualities makes people more susceptible 
to se attacks more than others is in using behavioural or personality models.",7
"personality models help 
to understand what makes people think and respond the way they do.",7
"personality from a psychological 
perspective is defined as a state when a person’s thoughts, feelings and behavioural patterns are 
relatively stable (uebelacker & quiel, , p. ).",7
"understanding the relationship between individuals 
and information security is particularly useful in forecasting an individual’s ability to maintain 
information security standards and policies (shropshire, warkentin, johnston, & schmidt, , p. 
).",7
there are multiple approaches to personality dimensions.,7
"several models have been developed 
to identify different types of personality traits such as the five factor model (the big five).",7
"the big five is 
coherent and scientific as it defines personalities along a continuum rather that in categories or types.",7
"it 
gives room for different types of behaviour in different circumstance.",7
"table  briefly 
describes the big five traits.",7
"test set up 
a researcher’s perspective and assumptions of what constitutes truth and knowledge constructs the way we see 
ourselves, other people and the society around us.",7
"these views and beliefs are referred to as a paradigm (cypress, 
).",7
"schwandt defined paradigm as a shared world view that represents the beliefs and values in a discipline 
and that guides how problems are solved.",7
"a paradigm can help clarify research questions and help in research 
design.",7
this research will employ a qualitative non-experimental method to answer the research question.,7
"the 
methods fit context-based research that will provide insight into and allow capturing other people’s perspective of 
real-life situations.",7
"a qualitative research approach is best suited for a study that serves the purpose of description, 
interpretation, verification, and evaluation of behaviour (peshkin, ).",7
"also, qualitative research generally seeks 
to answer the what, how and why question rather than how much or how many (cypress, ).",7
"this best suits 
this study where a constructivism approach has been chosen with the underlying view that there is no single reality 
to be found, and knowledge is gained interactively (chilisa & kawulich, , p. ).",7
"data is collected through a purposive, semi-structured, expert interview.",7
"interview methods give voice to people, 
which allows them to freely present their life situations in their own words, and provide personal interaction 
between the researchers and their subjects (kvale, , p. ).",7
"also, interview research methods are more 
powerful tools for obtaining narrative data that allows researchers to investigate people's views in greater depth 
compared to questionnaires and surveys.",7
"in particular, expert interview is concerned about the participant’s 
knowledge and experiences as a result of their actions, roles, responsibilities or obligations within a specific 
organization or institution (littig & vienna, ).",7
"expert interviews are more efficient and concentrated way of 
gathering quick quality data than using observation and surveys (bogner, littig, & wolfgang, , p. ).",7
"an 
expert in this sense is a person with insight in aggregated or specific knowledge (albladi & weir, ).",7
"also an 
important consideration in qualitative research is determining the sample size.",7
"the determination of qualitative 
sample size is challenging one that is based on different study designs and contextual considerations (turner-
bowker et al., , p. ).",7
"contrary to a quantitative research approach where the sample size can be calculated 
using statistical techniques, qualitative sample size is calculated by the number of participants that will be needed 
to attain saturation (glaser, strauss, & strutzel, , p. ).",7
"the concept of saturation emerges when no more 
data are being found.",7
"in this study the number five was chosen from participants who had experienced on social 
engineering attack, and hence were classed knowledgeable of the phenomena and hence a quicker saturation point 
was reached for the pilot study.",7
the thematic analysis was conducted using the nvivo software.,7
"results 
the interview and trait data was thematically analysed in nivo and is presented in the following two tables.",7
"table 
 presents an overview of the factors identified by participants that made them susceptible to se attacks based on 
their experience as a victim.",7
table  shows their personality traits.,7
"participant one 
believed the attack was successful because of a trusting relationship, love, or humour as a motivating factor.",7
"these 
findings are indications of extraversion and agreeableness traits which agrees with the participants personality 
result.",7
"participant two believed it was desperation of finding a job and trust in other people’s feedback that made 
the se attack successful.",7
these traits are indications of conscientiousness and agreeableness.,7
"however, the 
participant’s personality test result does not indicate that.",7
"the third participant believed it was the fear of being 
locked out of personal account and not having access to money as well as lack of training and proper education as 
at that time that made the se attack successful.",7
these traits are indications of agreeableness and neuroticism.,7
"the 
participant believes in compliance and being loyal as well as fearful of losing personal money.",7
"this does not totally 
agree with the personality result.",7
"the fourth participant believed it was pressure from authority, the ease and 
comfort as well as cost savings that made the se attack successful.",7
"these are indications of agreeableness and 
proceedings of the th australian information security management conference () 
conscientiousness.",7
this is also contrary to the result from the participant’s personality test.,7
"the last participants 
indicated that money, curiosity and trusting positive feedback from others that led to the successful se attack.",7
"these traits are indications of openness, extroversion and agreeableness which are in line with participant’s result.",7
"from this study and the scenarios examined, the findings indicate that personality traits can determine the 
likelihood of se attack and users with some type of personality are more susceptible than others.",7
"while people 
with high score in agreeableness and extroversion trait are likely to be more susceptible to se attack, the likelihood 
of a successful se attack is not only dependent on the personality trait, it depends on the user’s circumstance and 
the attack technique of the attacker.",7
"though some types of personality traits have the tendency to be easily 
manipulated, if the attacker does not motivate them, the chances of a successful attack is low.",7
"also, the result 
indicated that people that are more trusting will likely be more susceptible because once your trust level increases, 
your guard falls.",7
"overall, it is believed that se attack is usually a targeted attack, and people who score high in 
agreeableness and extroversion are likely to fall victims more than other personality traits.",7

in answer to proposition : one of the participants suggested that lack of training and education is the main factor 
enhancing user’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks.",7
"it was believed that if users understand the traits to 
look out for irrespective of the technique used, the likelihood of susceptibility to se attack will be reduced.",7
"two 
of the participants believed it’s the user’s motivating factor that matters irrespective of technique that is been used 
if the user is not motivated the trick will not work on them.",7
"two other participants supported that it’s a synergy of 
the user’s motivating factor, attacker’s technique and chance.",7
"all the participants believed that personality is one 
of the reasons why people fall victim of social engineering attack.",7
"considering social engineering attack is a 
targeted attack which means the social engineers knows the class of people they want which are likely to fall 
victim.",7
this brings in personality profile.,7
"drawing from the data analysis, it was stated that the factors which 
serves as the motivation can vary from time to time depending on the user’s situation, however, the user’s 
personality is expected to be relatively constant.",7
"as this study is focused on examining the personality trait that is 
more susceptible to se attack the personality test followed the interviews.",7
"after the participants each explained 
the scenarios where they’ve been a victim of a social engineering attack and why they think things made them 
susceptible.",7
then they were asked to take the big five personality test.,7
"social engineers build their attack scenarios 
based on personality profiles.",7
"several attempts have been made to prevent these attacks with the use of technical 
solutions and raising awareness through warnings about social engineering attacks.",7
"however, these methods have 
generally been proven to be ineffective (junger et al., , p. ).",7
"this purpose of this study was therefore to 
examine what personality trait makes users more susceptible to se attack.",7
"these data were gathered from 
experiences of participants who understand how social engineering works and have once been a victim of a se 
attack.",7
"several user’s motivating factors were identified and the personality traits with the likelihood of increased 
susceptibility determined.",7
"the result is intended to contribute to the body of knowledge by informing individuals 
and organizations the kind of personality trait that are more prone to se attacks, this in turn provides a basis for 
identifying possible se techniques and initiating effective solutions through the decision making of user’s who are 
more susceptible to social engineering attack.",7
"conclusion 
the field of social engineering clearly needs further research especially in identifying the user’s susceptibility and 
to aid effective countermeasures.",7
"as the social engineering techniques become more sophisticated and the incident 
rate increases, it is important to provide effective measures.",7
"one of the potential measures is in examining a user’s 
susceptibility.",7
"when the users are aware of their se vulnerability, organizations will be able to measure their risk 
to social engineering and employ effective measures to counter these attacks according to the distinct identified 
user’s weakness.",7
"several studies have focused on testing the rate of the user’s susceptibility through phishing 
techniques.",7
"however, most of these studies have not focused on what attributes makes the user act the way they 
act.",7
"while there is literature focusing on the relationship between the user’s personality traits and their 
susceptibility rate to se attack, there is a discrepancy in existing literature on what individual personality traits 
make users susceptible to attack.",7
"the results reported in this paper suggest that users with high scores in 
agreeableness and extroversion traits are likely to be more susceptible to social engineering attack than others.",7
"we 
also identified moderating variables that included emotional state, the environment and motivations.",7
"these results 
are a useful start for further research into the impact of different social engineering attacks on different personality 
types.",7

exploration of the issue.",7

foundations for future research in studying generations susceptibility to social

"develops their feelings toward their professional social responsibilities as engineers, and how 
these values change over time, have been examined.",7
"this chapter will highlight the array of 
opinions and recent research into these areas.
. social responsibilities of the engineering profession
the engineering profession has a variety of ethical responsibilities to society and the environ-
ment.",7
this field of inquiry has recently been termed macroethics [].,7
"but these professional 
social responsibilities may be in tension with the business side of engineering [].",7
"the major-
ity of engineers work for businesses, whose primary motivation is often profit and corporate 
stockholders, rather than societal impacts.",7
"luckily, this has begun to change based on move-
ment toward corporate social responsibility (csr) and realizations that companies can thrive 
economically while considering social and environmental impacts (the triple bottom line).",7
"csr means that companies commit to principles of accountability to community stakehold-
ers, customers, suppliers, employees, and investors.",7
"csr often embraces ideas of sustainabil-
ity, including human rights and environmental issues, as well as a chain of responsibility and 
duty of care.",7
"engineering-focused companies often make their commitments to csr publicly 
available (e.g., bechtel []).",7
the characterization of engineering as a profession is also somewhat in tension.,7
"individual 
licensing of engineers promotes the notion of profession, but industrial exemptions in the 
licensing laws somewhat erode this independence from employers [].",7
"zhu and jesiek [] also 
question whether engineering is a profession in china, based on the lack of an explicit ethical 
code.",7
"it becomes clear when exploring the engineering profession that it should not be viewed 
as homogeneous, but rather consider that there are distinct cultures in this regard among dif-
ferent sub-disciplines and among countries.",7
"this section presents a few sub-topics related to social responsibility in engineering: human 
safety, environmental protection and sustainability, pro bono work, social justice, and diver-
sity.",7
"the extent to which these elements are included in professional codes of ethics, bodies 
of knowledge, and requirements for educating engineers are considered to reflect commonly 
held beliefs related to the social responsibilities of the engineering profession.",7
"further, what 
a professor chooses to teach engineering students in regards to professional social respon-
sibility has been interpreted as endorsement of the relevance of the topic to the engineering 
profession.",7
"for some topics there is general agreement across engineering sub-disciplines and 
individuals, while other social responsibilities are being actively debated.",7
".. human safety
public trust in engineering requires that the profession considers its impacts on human safety.",7
"there is widespread consensus in the codes of ethics of engineering professional societies 
worldwide that engineering has a primary duty to protect public safety, health, and wel-
fare [].",7
"engineering-related failures or problems that result in injuries or death are often 
social responsibility
front-page news (e.g., levee failures in new orleans, interstate bridge collapse in minnesota, 
ignition switches in cars) [, ].",7
"it is of concern that the accumulated impact of frequent news-
worthy incidents may over time erode public trust in engineering.",7
"although generally “bundled,” health, safety, and welfare each have particular nuances.",7
"vesilind [] notes that there may be instances when these three elements differ, both in fact 
and among the perceptions of various groups within the public.",7
"further, the public should 
not be viewed as a monolith, but rather engineers need to be aware of “diverse publics” with 
different needs and goals [, ].",7
"health is generally characterized as being able to function physically without pain, and may 
also include mental soundness.",7
"promoting health is a direct goal of biomedical engineer-
ing.",7
"environmental and civil engineers are tasked with providing clean drinking water and 
preventing the spread of toxic chemicals via air, water, and soil.",7
"chemical engineering is 
involved in manufacturing medicines, as well as pesticides and other chemicals that may 
have toxic effects.",7
"thinking specifically about health-related issues is perhaps less prevalent 
in other engineering disciplines.",7
"one challenge is the uncertainty that surrounds what is in 
fact protective of human health, given incomplete toxicological information and difficulties 
evaluating chronic effects (e.g., cancer).",7
"different countries have different paradigms regulat-
ing the development, distribution, and use of new chemicals with regards to the information 
that is required on human health effects, with some taking a more precautionary approach 
[].",7
"further, us drinking water regulations take into account both human health and treat-
ment costs.",7
"overall, engineers may disagree on what conditions sufficiently protect human 
health.",7
"safety is associated being protected from physical injuries or death, again considering risks.",7
"thus, civil engineering infrastructure that will be safe in the face of hurricanes or earthquakes, 
construction engineering to protect on-site workers, mechanical engineering of cars to pro-
tect occupants during crashes, etc.",7
"other engineering disciplines are also critically impor-
tant to safety but as sub-systems may garner less attention (such as software engineering 
for computer controls or electrical engineering).",7
"however, public safety broadly applies to 
all engineering disciplines.",7
"the international education association knowledge profile for a 
washington accord program includes “comprehension of… the professional responsibility 
of an engineer to public safety” [].",7
"disciplinary differences within engineering in the extent 
that students are taught about safety in their courses were found in a study of engineering 
educators; among ~ survey respondents (% from institutions in the us), % taught 
engineering/computing students about safety in their courses.",7
"however, this varied from % 
in chemical engineering to % in computing [].",7
"safety is included explicitly as a cognitive 
“cross-functional” outcome within the chemical engineering body of knowledge [].",7
"welfare relates to overall well-being, potentially inclusive of happiness, health, material 
wealth, and feelings of security.",7
"thus, welfare is more subjective than health or safety, and is 
correspondingly harder to measure.",7
"while protection of human or public welfare is a com-
mon statement in us codes of engineering ethics [, ], this term is not included in some 
international ethics codes [–].",7
"the australia code uses the term “wellbeing” in place of 
professional social responsibility in engineering


welfare [].",7
"the royal academy of engineering’s (rae) statement of ethical principles 
[] includes “public good,” separate from the “health and safety” paramountcy clause.",7
"the 
chemical engineering body of knowledge [] lists “concern for public welfare” among its 
affective domain outcomes.",7
"it is clear that engineers may have different notions of welfare 
than individuals within the public.",7
"vesilind [] gives the examples of engineers reducing 
speed limits on highways to  miles per hour to provide increased safety, but having the 
majority of the public believe their overall welfare was better served by higher limits that 
enabled them to reach their destinations more efficiently.",7
"there has been a recent debate about how engineers can best serve this most basic mandate to 
protect human health and safety.",7
"one environmental scientist/engineer, sedlak, accused oth-
ers of “crossing the line” from dispassionate researcher to being activists [].",7
"sedlak (trained 
as an environmental scientist, but a professor of civil and environmental engineering for over 
 years) called into question prof. marc edwards (ms/phd civil engineering) and his involve-
ment in the flint, michigan, lead crisis, and daniel carder (bs/ms mechanical engineering) 
who helped expose the volkswagen emission problem.",7
"edwards and carder likely perceived 
it as their social responsibility as engineers to uphold the preeminent requirement to pro-
tect human health and safety [, ], and acted in compliance with the engineering codes 
of ethics to expose ethical wrong-doing (e.g., asce canon d []).",7
"in response to sedlak’s 
editorial, a number of individuals shared differing views on the professional responsibilities 
of environmental engineering and science as related to the public [–].",7
"an individual’s personal identity with respect to 
their profession may be significant in how they perceive their social responsibilities.",7
".. environment and sustainability
engineering codes of ethics include environmental protection among professional social 
responsibilities (table ), with the exception of some specialized sub-disciplines (biomedi-
cal and aerospace engineering).",7
"“comprehension of the impacts of engineering activity: … 
environmental” is one of the knowledge outcomes of a washington accord program [].",7
"environmental considerations in the engineering design process have also been explicitly 
required for accredited engineering degrees under abet (criterion , outcome  []).",7
"despite 
widespread inclusion in codes of ethics and professional education requirements, environ-
mental protection issues do not appear to be an equally prevalent focus of different disciplines 
within engineering.",7
"in a study of engineering educators, an average of % of the ~ sur-
vey respondents taught engineering/computing students about environmental issues, ranging 
from a high of % in environmental engineering to a low of % in computing [].",7
"among  
engineering educators in the study by romkey [], the average implementation of “i encour-
age students to consider the potential environmental impact of technology” was .",7
"(where 
 = sometimes and  = often on a – scale).",7
"internationally, commitments to environmental 
protection are generally considered to be somewhat stronger in the eu versus the us.",7
"social responsibility
engineers’ social responsibility for environmental protection may originate from different eth-
ical frameworks [].",7
"from an anthropocentric framework, one may simply understand that 
preservation of the environment is ultimately self-preservation for human life.",7
"alternatively, 
from a biocentric perspective one may recognize the intrinsic right to life of all organisms on 
the planet.",7
"the environment and ecology may be viewed to have distinct value, beyond that 
of maintaining human existence.",7
"a more limited sub-group of countries and engineering disciplines include sustainability 
and/or sustainable development within their code of ethics (table ).",7
"australia’s code shows 
a commitment to sustainability in the first sentence of the preamble statement, “use of knowl-
edge and skills for the benefit of the community to create engineering solutions for a sustain-
able future,” and “promote sustainability” is one of the four key statements of ethical practice 
[].",7
"in fact, the mandate to protect the “health, safety and wellbeing of the community” is 
placed under the heading of promoting sustainability.",7
"sustainability knowledge or abili-
ties are included as stand-alone outcomes within the bodies of knowledge for us chemical, 
civil, environmental, and professional engineers [, –].",7
"sustainable design and develop-
ment as a social responsibility of engineers has been endorsed by many scholars around the 
globe [–].",7
"one issue may be the lack of consensus on the meaning of the term sustainability or sustainable 
development.",7
"in general, sustainability includes considerations of both current conditions and 
future generations, crossing environmental, societal, and economic elements.",7

"inclusion of environmental protection and sustainability responsibilities in the code of ethics from different 
disciplines and countries.",7
"professional social responsibility in engineering


is included in the educational requirements for engineers under the washington accord 
outcomes [].",7
"in contrast, sustainability is not explicitly required in engineering education 
under abet, which accredits the majority of the programs in the us and additional pro-
grams across  countries.",7
"sustainability is mentioned as a potential consideration in the engi-
neering design process under both the old abet ec criteria and the new requirements 
[, ].",7
"the new requirements do include considerations of “global, economic, environmental, 
and societal contexts” within the ethics outcome, but these considerations might be primarily 
immediate versus long term.",7
"interestingly, more faculty indicated that they teach engineer-
ing/computing students about sustainability (%) as compared to environmental impacts 
(%), ranging from % in environmental engineering to % in biomedical engineering [].",7
".. pro bono
the idea of pro bono work is that professions should donate some of their technical expertise 
to individuals or organizations unable to pay for those services.",7
"this can be providing services 
for free or at a reduced rate.",7
"while this is commonplace in professions such a law and medi-
cine [], the idea just seems to be starting to grow in engineering and is by no means uni-
versal [].",7
"the american society of civil engineers (asce) first approved a policy statement 
on pro bono services in  [], encouraging engineers as individuals to provide services to 
charitable causes and in emergency situations; however, its real purpose appears directed at 
liability issues and indemnification.",7
"the national society of professional engineers (nspe) 
has a policy statement pertaining to liability of “good samaritans” who volunteer their engi-
neering services upon request in times of crisis [].",7
"within the codes of ethics for engineering, hints of commitment to pro bono service can be 
found.",7
"the nspe code [] states that “engineers are encouraged to participate in civic affairs; 
career guidance for youths; and work for the advancement of the safety, health, and well-
being of their community”; a similar statement is found in [].",7
"the asce code [] states that 
“engineers should seek opportunities to be of constructive service in civic affairs and work 
for…their communities.” however, the mandate for pro bono activity is unclear.",7
"riley and lambrinidou [] suggest that pro bono service should comprise at least % of the 
employed hours of engineers.",7
"interviews with working engineers found that some engineer-
ing companies allow donating standard work hours to engineering service, such as to groups 
like engineers without borders (ewb)-usa [].",7
"moulton [] asserts, “an enormous amount 
of software development/support is done at low or no cost, for example, public help forums 
and much of the work toward open source/linux/gnu etc.” (p. ).",7
"in a study of pro bono engineering in australia in  [], a high demand for pro bono 
engineering, reasons for engaging in pro bono activities, benefits from pro bono activities, and 
challenges were documented.",7
"a sense of professional responsibility was identified among 
the motivations for participating in pro bono activities in engineering.",7
"while providing rich 
information and detailed case studies, the research left unanswered questions such as what 
percentage of engineering companies or individuals engage in pro bono activities, and to 
what extent (hours per year).",7
"social responsibility
in a small study (methods described in []), working engineers were asked in a survey to rate 
their agreement with the statement “engineering firms should take on some pro bono work.” 
among the  respondents, % disagreed, % were neutral, and % agreed; % of the 
survey respondents had recently graduated (within  to  years) with an engineering degree 
from a us institution and % of the respondents were members of ewb-usa.",7
"differences in 
opinions were found based on gender (females higher average agreement), discipline (environ-
mental higher agreement than mechanical), and years since earned bachelor’s degree (higher 
agreement for those who earned degree  or more years prior).",7
"thus, among both engineering students and 
professionals the majority agreed to some extent that engineering firms should take on pro 
bono work.",7
"in australia, the university of technology sydney studied the attitudes of their students 
toward pro bono engineering.",7
engineering service groups comprised of volunteers are becoming more popular.,7
"a prime 
example is ewb-usa which works to help meet the basic needs of global communities.",7
"in 
, ewb-usa reported , members in  chapters [].",7
"these chapters include both 
student chapters (typically affiliated with a university or college) and professional chapters.",7
"this is a large number of engineering students/ professionals engaged in donating their 
time to help others through engineering.",7
"ewb international (ewb-i) has  organizations 
that are part of its network [].",7
"ewb-australia is particularly active; in – they 
reported  members/friends, plus  university partners with  students engaged in 
an ewb challenge activity, and , students engaged via their school outreach program 
[].",7
"they state, “our ewb connect initiative has been pioneering the creation of a pro bono 
engineering culture across the profession.” [, p. ].",7
"other examples of pro bono focused 
engineering service groups include bridges to prosperity, engineering world health, and 
the community engineering corps (an alliance of asce, ewb-usa, and the american water 
works association).",7
"in engineering education, pro bono work can take the form of service-learning or learning 
through service, also termed community engagement [, ].",7
"[] dis-
cussed humanitarian service-learning projects locally (in canada) and abroad (ghana); both 
appeared to have impacted students’ views of socially responsible engineering.",7
"linkages 
between community engagement activities among us engineering students and professional 
social responsibility attitudes were found in a large study [].",7
"as well, engineering faculty 
believe that students learn about ethics and societal impact issues via community engagement 
activities [].",7
"professional social responsibility in engineering


.. social justice
social justice relates to the distribution of wealth and privileges in society, as well as issues 
related to poverty and development.",7
"there are a growing number of advocates that engineer-
ing social responsibility encompasses social justice issues, including engineering faculty in 
the us [, ], australia [], finland [], and colombia [].",7
"a group devoted to this issue, 
engineering, social justice, and peace (esjp), routinely hosts a conference.",7
"but there are also 
naysayers [–], and the majority of the public comments posted with these articles were 
against social justice education for engineers.",7
"for example, one commenter noted “employers 
will shun engineers who they suspect may have been indoctrinated with social justice ideas.",7
"in short, sjw ideology is a highly destructive virus” [].",7
"the robust number of comments 
posted with these essays speaks to their controversial nature; for example,  comments on 
the washington times article [].",7
"many have asserted that the majority of engineering activities are devoted to benefitting the 
wealthiest on the planet, versus devoting attention to the large percentage of the global popu-
lation that survives at a near subsistence level.",7
"engineering education programs to address 
these concerns in the us include the d center at michigan technological university [], 
the engineering for developing communities program at the university of colorado boulder 
[], and a number of other programs [].",7
"there are also similar programs in spain [] and 
canada [].",7
"there does not appear to be widespread formal education of engineering students about 
social justice and/or poverty issues; only % and % of engineering faculty taught these 
topics in courses, respectively [].",7
"however, these topics are reasonably pervasive in co-
curricular engineering service groups (such as ewb-usa).",7
"among faculty mentors of engi-
neering service groups, % felt students learned about engineering and poverty and % felt 
students learned about social justice.",7
".. diversity
there are a number of diversity-related issues in engineering.",7
"a primary issue is the persistent 
lack of diversity within the engineering workforce in the united states and many other parts 
of the world, which is predominated by men and generally lacks racial/ethnic diversity.",7
"other 
“non-visible” diversity issues relate to socio-economic status (low income individuals under-
represented), cognitive and personality types, etc.",7
"the lack of diversity in the engineering 
profession is also found in engineering education.",7
"implicit bias and a chilly climate are often 
cited as potential reasons for the lack of diversity within the engineering profession.",7
"it has 
been argued that this lack of diversity is detrimental to engineering and limits the ability of 
engineering to best fulfill its mandate to benefit society [, ].",7
"it is unclear if one of the social 
responsibilities of the engineering profession relates to employing the diversity of individuals 
in society.",7
"statements related to diversity in engineering codes of ethics are summarized in 
table .",7
"generally, these relate to avoiding discriminatory treatment, but the australia [] 
and the uk [] codes also include language to promote/support diversity.",7
"most recently 
in the summer of , the asce updated its code of ethics to include  provisions related to 
diversity [].",7
"the ability to work effectively in diverse teams is an explicitly acknowledged 
social responsibility
requirement for engineering graduates [, ].",7
"however, diversity concerns, like social jus-
tice, are not universally embraced as being relevant to engineering [].",7
"another important issue with respect to diversity is the extent to which the profession fairly 
compensates workers, without regard to gender, race/ethnicity, etc.",7
"in india, female engineer-
ing/computing workers generally earn less than male counterparts [].",7
"cech [] found that 
wage differences by gender in engineering within the us might be partially accounted for 
based on the nature of the work being done with respect to a technical:social dualism hypoth-
esis.",7
"it was found that women were more represented among less “technical” sub-disciplines 
in engineering and among more social tasks in engineering.
. individual social responsibility development
an individual’s perceptions of their social responsibilities as engineers will develop over time 
via the process of professional socialization.",7
"the professional socialization process begins with 
novice views of the engineering profession.",7
"some students’ pro-social motivations are a driver for their 
decision to major in engineering [, ].",7
"this aligns with efforts to market the social benefits

of engineering, in line with recommendations from the us national academy of engineers 
“changing the conversation” report [].",7
"a higher percentage of female engineering students 
included helping people, helping the environment, and positively impacting society as reasons 
they chose their engineering major, based on open-ended responses [].",7
"differences were also 
found among disciplines; a greater percentage of students majoring in environmental and civil 
engineering described helping goals as compared to students majoring in mechanical engineer-
ing [].",7
"among uk students given  options as to why they decided to study engineering, only 
.% selected a desire to ‘make a difference’ to the world; there was no difference between 
female and male students, and this aspiration was the lowest among th year students [].",7
"there is also some evidence that students who enter engineering with the strongest pro-social 
motivations leave engineering majors during college at a higher rate than their peers [, ].",7
"professional socialization processes for engineers are more explicitly occurring during higher 
education and in the engineering workforce.",7
"the continuum of the development of professional 
civil engineers is outlined explicitly in the civil engineering body of knowledge (bok) [].",7
"here, the acquisition of various knowledge, skills, and attitudes is mapped from the bachelor’s 
degree in engineering, through a master’s degree or additional formal education, and dur-
ing mentored experience working under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer.",7
"in regards to professional and ethical responsibility, the civil engineering bok includes pro-
posed affective domain outcomes such as “commit to the standards of professional and ethical 
responsibility for engineering practice” [, p. ].",7
"within the “attitudes” outcome elements 
such as honesty, integrity, consideration of others, respect, and tolerance are included [].",7
"during higher education, in addition to learning important knowledge and skills, students 
are developing attitudes and affective outcomes associated with engineering.",7
"professional 
socialization during higher education includes courses and a variety of informal education 
experiences outside the classroom, such as professional societies or internships in engineer-
ing.",7
"a number of studies have explored student perceptions related to elements of social 
responsibility.",7
"despite bringing students with aspirations toward positive social benefits into 
engineering, there is evidence that these goals may diminish over time [, ].",7
professional socialization continues into the engineering workforce.,7
"while cech [] found 
continuing evidence of decline in the public service beliefs of alumni from engineering pro-
grams after .",7
"years in the workforce, counter-evidence suggests that working engineers 
may become more committed to their professional social responsibilities over time.",7
"a sur-
vey of working engineers (bielefeldt unpublished, from the study described in []) found 
that the majority (% of n = ) agreed with the statement “since earning my bachelor’s 
degree, i have become more motivated to help people and society through my work”; only 
% disagreed and % were neutral.",7
"responses did not differ by gender but did differ 
based on years since earning bachelor’s degree ( or fewer years lower than  or more years) 
and engineering discipline (mechanical lower than environmental).",7
"similarly, the majority 
(%) disagreed with the statement, “since earning my bachelor’s degree, i have become less 
confident of my ability to make positive impacts on people and society through engineering.” 
responses differed by gender (female stronger agreement than males), years since earning 
bachelor’s degree ( or fewer years more agreement versus  or more years), and discipline 
(environmental stronger agreement than civil).",7
"social responsibility
models have been proposed to explain the development of professional responsibility atti-
tudes in individual engineers.",7
"the professional social responsibility development model 
(psrdm) [] was based on an ethic of care framework, and drew from schwartz’s [] altru-
istic helping behavior model, ramsey’s [] model for integrating social responsibility into 
the decision process of scientists, and the delve [] service learning model.",7
"the psrdm 
includes three realms: personal social awareness, professional development, and professional 
connectedness.",7
"the personal social awareness realm describes one’s personal feelings of a 
desire to help others, which is inclusive of the dimensions of awareness that needs exist, feel-
ings that one possesses the ability to help, and a connectedness that motivates one to action.",7
"separate from these personal feelings, an engineer should develop professionally.",7
"the three 
dimensions of this realm include one’s belief that a variety of base skills are needed for engi-
neers, feelings that engineering has the capacity to help address societal issues (professional 
ability), and an awareness that one should analyze the societal impacts of engineering and 
include stakeholders from the community in the engineering process.",7
"finally, it is anticipated 
that a person’s individual motivations to help will come together with their engineering pro-
fessional development, to inform their sense of professional connectedness.",7
"a personal moti-
vation to help others through application of one’s engineering skills can be fostered through 
a cycle of engaging in this helping behavior.",7
"it will also increase one’s sophistication in their 
awareness of both the costs and benefits of helping and serving others through engineering.",7
"an input-environment-output type of model derived from wiedman [] was used by 
rulifson [] to describe the development of professional social responsibility ideas in 
engineering students.",7
"as inputs, individuals bring pre-dispositions toward personal social 
responsibility and attitudes toward engineering into college.",7
"these are developed from fam-
ily influences and high school, etc.",7
"within higher education, a number of factors have been 
determined to influence ideas of professional social responsibility.",7
"however, cech [] nota-
bly found that attitudes toward public service decreased among  engineering students 
attending four us institutions.",7
"this concerning trend was termed a “culture of disengage-
ment.” it is perhaps not surprising given that the majority of engineering studies focus on 
technical issues, and preference technical issues over the interactions of technology with soci-
ety.",7
"this technical:social dualism may reduce students’ focus on the impacts of their work as 
engineers.",7
"however, experiences during engineering studies may counter this decrease in 
engineering students’ ideas of socially responsible engineering.",7
"some engineering students 
cited courses as impactful to their views of social responsibility [].",7
"brodeur [] suggested a 
number of ways to integrate social responsibility ideas into engineering education, including 
the use of the cdio syllabus, cooperative learning, constructive controversy, and design-
implement projects.",7
"service-learning may advance students’ ideas of social justice [] and 
social responsibility [, ].
. conclusions
there are some elements of engineers’ professional social responsibilities that are widely 
agreed upon.",7
"these include protection of human health and safety, and protection of the envi-
ronment.",7
"other engineering social responsibilities have less consensus across countries and 
professional social responsibility in engineering


disciplines, including the mandate to participate in pro bono work, strive for social justice, and 
embrace diversity.",7
"corporations focused on engineering activities and for which engineers 
work typically have corporate social responsibility statements which document their com-
mitments and contributions to sustainability in the form of their working conditions, the local 
community, and environmental impacts.",7
"finally, studies are documenting how engineers’ 
develop their sense of professional social responsibility, including their upbringing, college 
experiences in and out of the classroom, and socialization in the engineering workforce.",7
"some 
troubling findings are that an individual’s commitment to socially responsible engineering 
may actually decline over time, perhaps as they begin to separate their technical expertise from 
social commitments or feel that business interests outweigh broader social responsibilities.",7
"there are still a number of unanswered questions in regards to engineers’ beliefs of their 
professional social responsibilities, and factors that contribute to shaping these beliefs.",7
"more 
research that involves working engineers is needed.",7
"this should include longitudinal stud-
ies.",7
"it is unclear how the job roles of an engineer – from a freshly graduated junior engi-
neer, to a more senior engineer with supervisory responsibilities – may impact their views 
of professional social responsibility.",7
"it is also unclear how the work setting – public entity, 
private consultant, working for industry – might be impactful.",7
"job roles should also be 
explored – research, design, project management, sales, etc.",7
"these studies are needed in dif-
ferent countries and cultural settings, as well as in different engineering disciplines.",7
"due to 
the widespread impacts that engineers have on society and our planet, it is imperative to 
understand how to better foster social responsibility commitments among engineers.",7

"in what ways, if any, do the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary 
librarians differ from those of the past, or from the contemporary general population?",7
"we conclude with a discussion of potential implications for the field of american librarianship, 
with special consideration paid to the needs of the field going forward in the st century.",7
"literature review 
 
many studies in the course of contemporary american librarianship have sought to profile the 
educational and disciplinary backgrounds of various types of library practitioners.",7
"during the 
first half of the th century, education for librarianship was often provided through training 
courses at functioning libraries.",7
"but as librarianship became increasingly established as a 
profession, more formalized approaches to education emerged.",7
"in  the american library 
association passed a resolution calling for library education to only be offered at the graduate 
level (bobinski, ) and by , the american library association had limited accreditation 
to programs offering master's (i.e., graduate level) degrees (quinn, ).",7
"at this time, the 
earliest reported data on librarians’ education backgrounds showed that only % of public 
librarians in america held college degrees; of those who did, one-third majored in english and 
one-sixth in social science (bryan, , p. -).",7
"while one-third of % does not represent a 
majority of librarians in the field at the time, this sample does reflect a starting point for a 
persistent pattern, where english and social science majors are consistently represented at higher 
rates in studies dealing with general populations of librarians.",7
"a few years later, douglass () 
found english to, again, represent at a much higher rate as a major area of undergraduate study, 
with .% of  contemporary library school students focusing on it in their undergraduate 
education (p. ).",7
"based on available data, it seems 
that most librarians hailed from humanistic backgrounds despite the post-world war ii rise of 
information science, the space race, and other contemporary national interests in science and 
technology.",7
"morrison () found that % of academic librarians in the united states pursued humanities 
as an undergraduate course of study; this included those who majored in a foreign language but 
not history, which comprised an additional % (p. ) [per morrison, some subjects reported 
two or more majors; thus, percentages total more than .]",7
"% studied social sciences; % 
natural sciences, and % education.",7
the next decade reflected much of the same.,7
"in a survey of 
, students across  ala-accredited library education programs, white and macklin () 
found “the large majority are from liberal arts backgrounds, with english and history being the 
two largest concentrations” (p. ).",7
"% of students had undergraduate majors in english; % 
history and government; % education; % behavioral sciences; % foreign languages; % 
  
physical sciences and math; and % biological sciences (p. ).",7
"“however,” they claim, “there is 
also a small, but growing, number who are coming from the sciences and this is likely to increase 
as information science gets more emphasis in the library school” (p. ).",7
"although white and 
macklin were correct about the increasing influence of information science on library schools, 
their optimism seems to have been misplaced.",7
"it is also unclear how white and macklin could 
lay claim to any changes since they only collected and analyzed one year of data.",7
"denis () 
reported similar findings for public and academic librarians in canada at the time, with no 
significant differences between the two types of librarians: “the educational background of the 
vast majority of respondents is in the humanities and to a lesser extent the social sciences” (p. , 
).",7
"by the s, it was well-established that librarians across the board came from predominantly 
liberal arts educational backgrounds.",7
"studies began to 
focus on narrower slices of librarianship, such as one’s role or position in the library, or 
librarians in subject-based libraries, but little changed in librarians’ educational backgrounds.",7
"no information for any other 
major areas of study was mentioned (p. ).",7
"karr () profiled average public and academic 
library directors in  as a -year-old male from the northeastern united states who had 
majored in the liberal arts.",7
"cain () was one of 
the first to also look at trends in further graduate education in addition to undergraduate area of 
study.",7
"using demographic data sourced from the vita bank, cain found that % of librarians 
(with or without mls or equivalent degrees) have at least one graduate degree other than the 
mls.",7
"after coding the degrees by discipline, humanities again stands out.",7
"the highest 
percentage of undergraduate degrees (.%) and non-mls master’s degrees (.%) were 
coded as humanities subjects (p. ).",7
"these are significant percentages on their own, but cain 
categorizes history as a “humanities social science,” meaning that history is not included in the 
numbers for humanities.",7
"when broken out by specific subject, history leads both undergraduate 
and non-mls master’s degrees, followed, predictably, by english and education (p. ).",7
"cain 
finds the fact that nearly % of undergraduate degrees are in the same four fields “disturbing” 
and laments the poor representation in the hard sciences: “they indicate that we have a fairly 
narrow educational perspective from which to examine issues or approach problems” (p. ).",7
"this concern seemed to lead into investigation of academic and education backgrounds of 
librarians specializing in science and related fields (what today we might call stem, or science, 
  
technology, engineering and mathematics).",7
"responses from  academic science librarians 
engaged in bibliographic instruction showed that nearly two-fifths (%) had a degree at any 
level—undergraduate, master’s, or doctoral—in a scientific discipline (thomas, , p. ).",7
"another survey of “sci-tech librarians” asked whether or not they “had either an undergraduate 
degree or extensive coursework in a field of science or technology.”  respondents (%) said 
they did (sandy, lembo, & manasco, , p. ).",7
"winston acknowledges the propensity toward humanities backgrounds and the 
difference from this in his population, yet acknowledges that issues of representation still exist: 
“in a profession in which english and history majors are the most predominant, the academic 
science and engineering specialty includes more science majors, as well as those with more 
traditional backgrounds.",7
"however, there were very few reported engineering majors” (p. ).",7
"a 
subsequent study showed the continuing trend for science librarians to have science 
backgrounds.",7
"of  physical science librarians, % majored in a science field as 
undergraduates and % earned a master’s degree in a science.",7
"“the data collected suggest that a 
greater number of physical science librarians have an undergraduate science degree than do 
science librarians in general” (ortega & brown, , p. ).",7
the pattern of educational backgrounds of stem librarians seems to be anomalous.,7
"other 
studies focusing on specific types of librarians follow the general overall trend of favoring the 
humanities.",7
"a survey of  academic business librarians found .% majored in history; % 
in english; % in education, and less than % for all other identifiable majors.",7
"in terms of 
additional master’s degrees, .% of the respondents had an mba, followed by % history and 
% english (kendrick, , p. -).",7
".% reported having “double 
majors,” but no data was included about what subjects those might entail.",7
"of business librarians, 
only % hold a bachelor’s degree in a business field (perret, , p. ).",7
"and out of  art librarians, % had 
a degree in art history and % in art/studio art (tewell, , p. ).",7
"% of respondents had a 
second masters; of those, the most frequent areas were art history (%), fine arts (%) 
architecture (%) and history (%) (p. ).",7
"interestingly, with the exception of denis, this is the 
only study of the ones discussed that addresses an international audience; all other studies were 
focused on librarians in the united states.",7
"in recent years, some librarians have found their way to the profession after completing doctoral 
education in another field.",7
"of academic librarians with subject doctorates (other than lis) earned 
between -, % chose to pursue librarianship either during or after their phd studies 
(lindquist & gilman, , p. ).",7
"while we acknowledge that differences exist across various library settings making the data from 
these previous studies seem disparate, all librarians are required to complete the same master’s 
level degree as professional qualification regardless of what type of library (academic, public, 
school, etc.)",7
they find themselves working in.,7
"while some librarians have specific goals 
regarding organizational placement, other librarians may change from one library type to another 
(e.g.",7
academic to public) in the course of their career.,7
"the data reviewed here from these 
historical studies offers a broad picture of librarianship at large.",7
"methods 
 
studies throughout the past  years clearly show librarians skewing heavily toward 
backgrounds in english, the humanities, and social sciences.",7
"outreach and other instructional endeavors, such as the “big 
orange stem saturday” at the university of knoxville (tn) have increased in popularity and 
offerings (flash et.",7
"scientific-focused information literacy instruction is increasingly 
incorporated into academic curricula and requires the support of academic librarians 
(scaramozzino, ; ).",7
"laherty () emphasizes the need for librarians incorporating 
information literacy into science education programs to be competent in the theories, pedagogies, 
and standards of scientific fields.",7
"but academic libraries are not the only libraries emphasizing 
stem learning.",7
"school libraries support stem curriculum through similar 
techniques (duff, ; lamb, ).",7
"as contemporary librarianship increases support for 
stem fields, one might think that the backgrounds of librarians might also be shifting in this 
direction.",7
"what actually comprises the educational and disciplinary 
backgrounds of contemporary librarians?",7
"in what ways, if any, do contemporary librarians’ 
educational and disciplinary backgrounds differ from those of the past, or from the general 
population at large?",7
"to ensure the most current and up-to-date information for this study, contemporary librarians 
were considered those on the cusp of their library careers—i.e., current and recent master’s level 
students in librarianship over the previous  years (-).",7
"although previously the alise 
annual report included data about prior areas of study, they discontinued collecting 
undergraduate major data in  (saye & lan, , p. ).",7
"instead, anonymous de-identified 
data about matriculated students’ year of enrollment, previous undergraduate and graduate 
degrees and the areas of study for those degrees was solicited from every ala-accredited 
master’s programs in the united states, canada, and puerto rico.",7
"(see appendix a for the letter 
soliciting participation.)",7
"although many of the previous studies reviewed above solicited data via 
survey questionnaires, this form of data collection was chosen over a survey in an attempt to 
  
collect a more thorough and representative set of data, not reliant on individual personal 
responses.",7
"requests for data were sent in january  to the  institutions with ala-accredited master’s 
degree programs.",7
"of these,  u.s.-based institutions (%) agreed to provide program data for 
the study.",7
thirty additional institutions (%) responded but opted not to participate.,7
"while 
reasons for non-participation varied, most reflected the unavailability of the data in a readily 
sharable format and/or the labor-intensive nature of data collection and the program’s inability to 
devote staff time or resources to the task.",7
"the requests stated a preference for de-identified data 
but also stated that special arrangements could be made to collect identifiable data while still 
protecting students’ information, an offer extended after consultation with syracuse university’s 
institutional review board.",7
"despite the assurance of irb compliance several institutions 
declined to participate because of concerns over student privacy, with one institution going so far 
as to seek counsel on the matter from their legal department before declining to participate.",7
"to 
encourage participation in the study, data was collected in whatever format was most convenient 
for the institution, resulting in a variety of formats from spreadsheets to simple lists.",7
"the data 
were standardized and aggregated, and then coded based on a scheme developed during a pilot 
study with admission data from the university of washington information school (clarke, 
).",7
"the coding scheme was revised and expanded to accommodate the data from additional 
schools (see appendix b for the full coding scheme).",7
"every degree subject was normalized; for example, degrees listed with subjects in classics, 
classical studies, and classical civilization were all synonymized to classics.",7
"in addition, every 
normalized subject was hierarchically classified under a broader discipline code (e.g., history 
was classified as a humanities discipline).",7
"although many subjects are well-recognized as falling 
into certain disciplinary categories some classifications, especially for new and emerging 
subjects, proved challenging.",7
"whenever possible, we investigated the subjects and degrees and 
attempted to represent their actual nature.",7
"if the degree-granting institution was known, we 
examined web pages and other information about the degree to determine which discipline might 
be appropriate.",7
"we consulted established classifications and definitions, such as the national 
endowment for the humanities, to guide our classification.",7
"when subject and disciplinary 
classification was complete, descriptive statistics were used to understand the landscape of 
educational backgrounds in contemporary librarianship, as well as to compare with historical 
data.",7
"after presenting preliminary results at the american library association’s annual 
conference (clarke, ), we also coded every undergraduate degree a second time based on the 
ipeds classification of instructional programs taxonomic scheme, based on external feedback 
and suggestions.",7
"this allowed us to compare the distribution of subjects among librarians’ 
undergraduate degrees with that of undergraduate degrees in the american population at large.",7
"results and discussion 
 
current overall educational and disciplinary profile of contemporary american librarians 
 
based on the data from  institutions with ala-accredited master’s programs, contemporary 
librarians predominantly hail from disciplinary backgrounds in the humanities, with % of 
previous degrees having been awarded in this discipline.",7
"this is followed by social sciences 
  
(%), professions (%), then stem (%), the arts (%), and miscellaneous/interdisciplinary 
studies (%) (see figure ).",7
disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary librarians.,7
"in addition to overarching disciplines, we also tabulated counts for specific areas of study (e.g., 
the “major” or topic of study of each degree).",7
"the predominant areas of study reflected in 
previous degrees held by matriculating mlis students also emphasizes subjects in the 
humanities, with english and history topping the list (see table ).",7
"these subjects rose to the top 
even without including counts for more specific topics in those areas, such as english literature 
(th most common), art history (th), or creative writing (nd).",7
"degrees in education were the 
third most common, but they represent a very distant third place compared to the top two 
subjects.",7
top  degree subjects across all lis programs.,7
"some students entered into a master’s 
level library education program with only a single undergraduate degree, while others entered 
with an undergraduate degree as well as a master’s degree, or some other combination of degrees 
(e.g., multiple bachelor’s and/or master’s degrees; associate degrees; law degrees, doctoral 
degrees, etc.).",7
"no attempt was made to distinguish the level of education a student received 
based on the level of degree; that is, no assumption was made that a graduate degree conferred 
more expertise or education in a particular subject than an undergraduate degree.",7
", students recorded , degrees, giving an average of .",7
"current undergraduate educational and disciplinary backgrounds  
 
while all entering mlis students are required to have earned an undergraduate degree, not all 
have earned additional graduate or other degrees.",7
"including all degrees, as we did above, offers a 
holistic picture of focus of study by discipline, but it also may skew the results toward subjects in 
which additional degrees were earned.",7
"it also makes comparisons with other data sets, both 
historical and contemporary, more difficult.",7
"for instance, based on the above data, librarians seem to over-represent humanistic disciplines.",7
"but perhaps humanistic courses of study are popular across the board, not just in librarianship.",7
"to determine whether or not the undergraduate degree subjects of librarians differ from the 
population at large, we compared the subjects of the undergraduate degrees in our data set to 
national data from the u.s. department of education’s integrated postsecondary education data 
  
system (ipeds).",7
"ipeds is a system of annual surveys conducted by the national center for 
educational statistics.",7
we took several steps to prepare our study data for comparison with national data from ipeds.,7
"first, all non-undergraduate degrees were removed from our data set as ipeds only collects data 
relating to post-secondary, non-graduate studies.",7
"next, each degree from our original coding 
scheme was checked against ipeds’ classification of instructional programs (cip) searchable 
site (nces, n.d.-b) in order to crosswalk our data.",7
"cip is the taxonomic scheme utilized by 
ipeds, a scheme that organizes degrees into fields of study and sub-fields.",7
"our data was 
crosswalked at the higher field level in order to compare it to national numbers reported in the 
digest of education statistics, an annual compilation of american educational statistical 
information with data drawn from many sources, including ipeds.",7
"our data set was then re-
coded to match the cip scheme.",7
"(nces, ) from the digest contains data for 
bachelor’s degrees conferred by all reporting institutions between - and -, the 
latter being the most recent year for which complete ipeds data is available.",7
"numbers for the 
-, -, and - academic years were aggregated across our data set and ipeds 
data for comparison purposes.",7
"these academic years were selected because complete data for 
these years was available across both data sets [it should be noted that data from one program 
was dropped for this particular comparison, since their data was provided to us in aggregate form 
and we were unable to isolate the years in question].",7
"our comparison shows a number of stark differences in patterns of undergraduate study (see 
table ).",7
"however, 
english language, literature and letters is also a large percentage (.%), and would likely be 
the highest percentage were history not conjoined with social sciences.",7
"in librarianship, .% and .% 
of mlis students earned undergraduate degrees in these subjects, respectively.",7
"there is 
obviously a significant disconnect in librarians’ representation of the population at large.",7
"although ipeds does not present a unified category for stem as an overall discipline, we can 
identify individual subjects representing the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
to present a more holistic picture.",7
"we identified the following ipeds-designated fields as 
stem-relevant fields (see table ): 
 
table .",7
"in contrast, 
the percentage of mlis students holding undergraduate degrees in computer & information 
science (.%) is twice as high as the overall rate (.%).",7
"this may be due to the inclusion of 
information science alongside computer science in the ipeds classification; mlis students 
often have undergraduate degrees in library and information science (lis).",7
"this could also be 
due to data from programs offering a broader graduate level degree in information with tracks or 
specializations for lis, computer science, information management, user experience (ux) and 
other cognate fields.",7
"ipeds does offer a separate category specifically for library science, and 
that is where we classified undergraduate lis degrees from our dataset.",7
"however, other non-
library information-related degrees, such as information administration and management were 
assigned to the ipeds category of computer & information sciences.",7
"computer science degrees 
may also be more highly represented due to the types of mlis programs that responded: several 
contemporary degree programs now admit students to a general information-based course of 
study, where students subsequently may select to pursue a specialization or track in library 
science and librarianship.",7
"therefore, some degrees in our dataset surely represent matriculated 
students who went on to pursue information degrees exclusive of the mlis.",7
a similar issue arises in the area of law.,7
"at least one of the mlis programs that contributed data 
offered a specialization in law librarianship, thus attracting people with previous experience in 
that area.",7
"although this may not be evident in the undergraduate data (.% in librarianship 
compared with .% overall), .% of all previous degrees (undergraduate, graduate, and 
post-grad) earned by incoming mlis students were in law.",7
"this likely reflects the fact that the 
juris doctor (jd), a degree earned only after already earning an undergraduate degree, is 
considered the first degree in law in the united states (law school admission council, n.d.).",7
"surprisingly, the percentage of mlis students with undergraduate degrees in mathematics and 
statistics is nearly identical to the overall rate (.% in librarianship vs. .% overall).",7
"the 
  
only other categories with similar distributions were architecture, communications/journalism, 
and multi/interdisciplinary studies.",7
"the ways in which this profile compares to previous studies 
 
librarianship clearly reflects a different distribution of undergraduate degrees than the u.s. 
population at large.",7
"to investigate whether this distribution is a new trend reflecting 
contemporary needs, or has remained constant over time, we compared undergraduate degree 
data from our dataset to similar data reported on in previous studies (see figure ).",7
"data from 
douglass (), white & macklin () and cain () were used for this comparison as 
they all offered a similar level of specificity to the ipeds classification of undergraduate majors.",7
"two of the studies gleaned data from questionnaire responses of undergraduate students 
(douglass and white & macklin) while cain relied on data from vita bank, an attempted census 
of practicing librarians.",7
"not all subject designations were reflected in each study; notably white 
and macklin did not specifically report library science, business, or arts undergraduate degrees as 
individual categories.",7
"totals do not add up to % due to additional subject area designations 
not consistently reported across all four studies, as well as accounting for other/miscellaneous 
degrees.",7
"it should be noted, as per the previous discussion of ipeds classification, history is 
categorized as a social science rather than with the humanities subjects.",7
undergraduate degrees across four studies.,7
"despite still comprising a near-majority, earning an undergraduate humanities degree prior to 
librarianship appears to be on the decline.",7
"social sciences are represented in higher numbers in 
more recent years, however this could possibly be attributed to a number of reason.",7
"the 
  
classification of history as a social science certainly affects these results in a significant way.",7
"but 
a higher number of social science undergraduates pursuing librarianship could also correspond 
with the evolutionary alignment of librarianship to information science, which is often positioned 
as a social science.",7
"or perhaps more options for social science degrees have become available in 
recent years.",7
"some professions, such as education, library science, and business, were called out individually 
in most of the studies, while other professions determined by our own original inductive coding 
were not.",7
"again, this may be an artifact of an evolving education space, which now includes 
degrees in subjects that were previously not offered in the academy.",7
"of the specific professions 
highlighted in three of the four studies compared here, education seems to have peaked in the 
s and declined since then.",7
"although librarianship is still often affiliated with an educational 
bent, especially when considering its historical foundations and core values, a decline in this 
focus has been noted as a result of the field’s alignment with information science (dali, ).",7
"when compared with the contemporary ipeds data, librarianship actually slightly lags the 
nation in undergraduate education degrees (.% nationally vs. .% in librarianship).",7
"business, on the other hand, has seen slight rise, from .% of undergraduate degrees in  to 
.% today, but as previously noted, this is starkly out of proportion from the national figure of 
.%.",7
"interestingly enough, degrees in the visual and performing arts appear to be on the rise, perhaps 
due to graduates of those degrees facing increased challenges in securing jobs in fields directly 
related to their studies.",7
"implications and conclusions 
 
this work set out to investigate the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary 
librarians, as well as to understand how these backgrounds compared to librarians of the past as 
well as the general population.",7
"unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary librarians, 
represented by mlis students on the cusp of their career so as to reflect the future landscape as 
much as possible, still hail predominantly from humanities backgrounds, especially english.",7
history is also a strongly represented area of study.,7
"the large number of people with humanities 
backgrounds may have made sense when libraries were focused on books, literature, and reading.",7
"however, by the time library education shifted to the graduate level in the united states, 
librarianship itself had also already begun the shift toward becoming the social science field it is 
considered today.",7
"yet the undergraduate backgrounds of people pursuing librarianship do not 
seem to have shifted at the same rate.",7
"this leaves library educators with the difficult task of 
training people with humanities backgrounds to do social science work--a fundamentally 
different approach that risks mismatches in disciplinary norms.",7
"while most students with 
humanities backgrounds are more than capable writers, their unfamiliarity with the research 
methodologies and genre conventions often found in mlis curricula, which is more closely 
aligned with the social sciences, leaves many of these students struggling to understand 
expectations.",7
"mandel () reports that this same skill set is especially valuable in post-mlis 
employment, where “the ability of library and information professionals to responsibly consume 
and competently produce research is critical to the growth of the field and to the way other 
disciplines view lis” (p. ).",7
"this is true for academic librarians who may be required to 
  
engage in primary research as part of their tenure obligations, and for librarians in the field in 
general, who are increasingly called upon to demonstrate the value and impact of their work 
through evidence-based practice (oakleaf, , p. ).",7
"the backgrounds of librarians are quite different from those of the college-educated american 
populace at large, where % of adults  years and older by age have bachelor’s degrees or 
more (united states census bureau, ), with especially noticeable differences in business 
and health fields, as evidenced in the most recently available ipeds data.",7
"additional emphases 
on stem in american society calling for increased research, resources, and education in these 
fields implies the needs for librarians to support these services.",7
"but the small number of people 
with stem backgrounds going into librarianship leaves a disconnect.",7
"for future librarians to 
serve patrons in these areas, mlis programs must recruit more people with undergraduate 
education in these areas, and/or integrate education regarding services for these populations in 
graduate level library education curricula.",7
"we are not claiming that stem librarians who have 
an undergraduate background in the humanities or social sciences are unqualified and unable to 
fulfill their professional duties, only positing that an increase of librarians with stem 
undergraduate education can help serve the profession’s increased need for stem support and 
contribute to more diverse perspectives in mlis education.",7
"although they are still a small percentage overall, librarians with undergraduate education in the 
arts are on the rise.",7
"undergraduate art education, especially the studio arts, explicitly offers instruction that fosters 
creativity (clarke & cripps ).",7
"undergraduate studio art education includes learning how to 
take risks, view topics from multiple and flexible points of view and appreciate various 
perspectives (salazar ).",7
"innovation--even in scientific fields--has long been linked with 
creative pursuits like the arts.",7
"for example, gurnon, voss-andrae and stanley () show how 
including visual arts in undergraduate science curriculum can help develop scientific 
imagination.",7
"such integration underlies the revision of stem to steam (science, technology, 
engineering, arts and mathematics), a movement encouraging the inclusion of art and design as 
integral aspects of stem (rhode island school of design, ).",7
"although skills derived from 
art and design are certainly used by librarians, clarke’s () historical research shows that 
they have been implicit and underdeveloped in american librarianship and have yet to be 
explicitly taught in library education.",7
"given the argument that library work is actually more 
aligned with the discipline of design than social sciences (clarke, , ), people with art 
and design backgrounds may be better equipped with the creative skills necessary for st 
century library careers.",7
"yet until mlis education embraces a design approach, these students 
may find themselves trapped in similar patterns as those mentioned for humanities students 
above, and risk the inability to apply the skills learned in their design educations to librarianship.",7
"these findings may be useful, but like all studies of this nature, they are not without flaws.",7
"despite our attempt to collect census data from all  ala-accredited degree programs, only 
seven cooperated.",7
"the schools from which we collected data varied in program structure, size, 
ranking, and other characteristics.",7
"some schools offered multiple degrees (both ala-accredited 
and not); some offered specific focus areas or concentrations that surely affected our findings.",7
hence our attempt to collect census population data.,7
"while we understand and respect the 
reasons why programs did not share their data, we remain unsatisfied.",7
"data on undergraduate 
degrees was systematically collected in the past for the alise statistical report until .",7
"we 
could find no reason for this decision and the motivation for no longer collecting such data 
remains a mystery, when it could surely assist with recruitment and outreach for a more 
educationally diverse profession.",7
"perhaps given some of the challenges faced by library 
programs in the late th century, such data became a kind of “competitive intelligence,” making 
sharing prohibitive and reflecting a change from the traditions of cooperation so commonly seen 
in librarianship to a more competitive landscape where mlis program sought various means of 
staying afloat.",7
"despite these limitations, this study still illustrates trends in librarians’ educational 
backgrounds in the st century, which can help shape mlis education in this contemporary 
evolving space.",7
several approaches to organize exploration can be considered.,8
"first, imitation learning can be used
to take advantage of observations of another agent acting on the environment [].",8
"while observing
the environment changing as a consequence of other agent’s actions can often be leveraged, there
are many cases where it is either impossible for other agents to demonstrate how to act, or for the
learner to observe the motor program used by the other agent.",8
"for these reasons, various forms of
autonomous curiosity-driven learning approaches have been proposed [], often inspired by forms of
spontaneous exploration displayed by human children [].",8
"some of these approaches have used the
framework of (deep) reinforcement learning, considering intrinsic rewards valuing states or actions
in terms of novelty, information gain, or prediction errors, e.g.",8
"however, many of
these approaches are not directly applicable to high-dimensional redundant continuous action spaces
[, ], or face complexity challenges to be applicable to real world robots [, ].",8
"another approach to curiosity-driven exploration is known as intrinsically motivated goal exploration
processes (imgeps) [, ], an architecture closely related to goal babbling [].",8
"the general idea
of imgeps is to equip the agent with a goal space, where each point is a vector of (target) features of
behavioural outcomes.",8
"during exploration, the agent samples goals in this goal space according to a
certain strategy.",8
"a powerful strategy for selecting goals is to maximize empirical competence progress
using multi-armed bandits [].",8
"this enables to automate the formation of a learning curriculum where
goals are progressively explored from simple to more complex, avoiding goals that are either too
simple or too complex.",8
"for each sampled goal the agent dedicates a budget of experiments to improve
its performance regarding this particular goal.",8
"imgeps are often implemented using a population
approach, where the agent stores an archive of all the policy parameters and the corresponding
outcomes.",8
"this makes the approach powerful since the agent is able to leverage each encountered
past experience when facing a new goal.",8
"this approach has been shown to enable high-dimensional
robots to learn very efficiently locomotion skills [], manipulation of soft objects [, ] or tool use
[].",8
"related approaches were recently experimented in the context of deep reinforcement learning,
such as in hindsight experience replay [] and reverse curriculum learning [] (however using
monolithic goal parameterized policies), and within the power play framework [].",8
learning disentangled representations of goal spaces.,8
"even if imgep approaches have been
shown to be very powerful, one limit has been to rely on engineered representations of goal spaces.",8
"a major challenge is how to
learn goal spaces in cases where only low-level perceptual measures are available to the learner (e.g.",8
"a first step in this direction was presented in [], using deep networks and algorithms such
as variational autoencoders (vaes) to learn goal spaces as a latent representation of the environment.",8
"in simple simulated scenes where a robot arm learned to interact with a single controllable object,
this approach was shown to be as efficient as using handcrafted goal features.",8
"but [] did not study
what was the impact of the quality of the learned representation.",8
"moreover, when the environment
contains several objects including a distractor object, an efficient exploration of the environment is
possible only if the structure of the goal space reflects the one of the environment.",8
"for example,
when objects are represented as abstract distinct entities, modular curiosity-driven goal exploration
processes can be leveraged for efficient exploration, by focusing on objects that provide maximal
learning progress, and avoiding distractor objects that are either trivial or not controllable [].",8
"an
open question is thus whether it is possible to learn goal spaces with adequate disentanglement
properties and develop exploration algorithms that can leverage those learned disentangled properties
from low-level perceptual measures.",8
discovering high-level controllable features of the environment.,8
"although methods to learn
disentangled representation of the world exist [, , ], they do not allow to distinguish features
that are controllable by the learner from features describing external phenomena that are outside
the control of the agent.",8
"however, identifying such independantly controllable features [] is of
paramount importance for agents to develop compact world models that generalize well, as well as
to grow efficiently their repertoire of skills.",8
"one idea to address this challenge, initially explored
in [], is that learners may identify and characterize controllable sets of features as sensorimotor
space manifolds where it is possible to learn how to control perceptual values with actions, i.e.",8
"where
learning progress is possible.",8
"unsupervised learning approaches could then build coarse categories
distinguishing the body, controllable objects, other animate agents, and uncontrollable objects as

figure : the imgep-mugl approach.",8
entities with different learning progress profiles [].,8
"however, this work only considered identifying
learnable and controllable manifolds among sets of engineered features.",8
"in this paper, we explore the idea that a useful learned representation for efficient exploration would
be a factorized representation where each latent variable would be sensitive to changes made in a
single true dregree of freedom of the environment, while being invariant to changes in other degrees of
freedom [].",8
"further on, we investigate how independently controllable features of the environment
can be identified among these disentangled variables through interactions with the environement.",8
"we study this question using β-vaes [, ] which is a natural extension of vaes and have been
shown to provide good disentanglement properties.",8
"we extend the experimental framework of [],
simulating a robot arm learning how it can produce outcomes in a scene with two objects, including a
distractor.",8
"in order to assess the role of the representation we use a two-stage process, which first
learns to see and then learns to act.",8
"the first stage consists of a representation learning phase where
the agent builds a representation of the world by passively observing it (events in the environment are
assumed to be produced by another agent in this phase, see [].",8
"in the second phase the agent uses
this representation to interact with the world, by sampling goals that provide high learning progress,
and where goals are target values of one or several latent variables to be reached through action.",8
this procedure was adopted for two reasons.,8
"for one, it is similar to the developmental progression
in infant development, where the infant first spends most of his time observing the world due to
limitations in motor exploration.",8
"secondly, it helps in understanding the impact of disentanglement
given the multiple components of the architecture.",8
"the first contribution we make in this paper is to study the impact of using a learned disentangled
goal space representations on the efficiency of exploration and discovery of a diversity of outcomes in
imgeps.",8
"to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the role of disentanglement is studied
in the context of exploration.",8
"precisely, we show that:
• using a disentangled state representation is beneficial to exploration: using imgeps, the
agents explores more states in fewer experiments than when the representation is entangled.",8
"• disentangled representations learned by β-vaes can be further leveraged by modular
curiosity-driven imgeps to explore as efficiently as using handcrafted low-dimensional
scene features, in experiments that include both controllable and distractor objects.",8
"on the
contrary, we show that representations learned by vaes are not sufficiently structured to
enable a similarly efficient exploration.",8
"the second contribution of this article is to show that identifying abstract independently controllable
features from low-level perception can emerge from a representation learning pipeline where learning
disentangled features from passive observations (β-vaes) is followed by curiosity-driven active
exploration driven by the maximization of learning progress.",8
"this second phase allows in particular to

figure : intrinsically motivated goal exploration process examplified.",8
"distinguish features related to controllable objects (disentangled features with high learning progress)
from features related to distractors (disentangled features with low learning progress).",8
"modular goal exploration with learned goal spaces
this section introduces intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes with modular goal spaces
as they are typically used in environments with handcrafted goal spaces.",8
"it then describes the
architecture used in this article where the handcrafted goal space is replaced by a representation of
the space that is learned before exploration and then used as a goal space for imgeps.",8
"the overall
architecture is summarized in figure .
. intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes with modular goal spaces
to fully understand the imgep approach, one must imagine the agent as performing a sequence
of contextualized and parameterized experiments.",8
"the problem of exploration is defined using the
following elements:
• a context space c. the context c represents the initial state of the environment.",8
"it corre-
sponds to parameters of the experiment that are not chosen by the agent.",8
"• a parameterization space θ. the parameterization θ corresponds to the parameters of the
experiment that the agent can control at will (e.g.",8
"• an observation space o. here we consider an observation o to be a vector representing all
the signals captured by the agent sensors during an experiment (e.g.",8
"• an environment dynamic d : c,θ → o which maps parameters performed in a certain
context, to observations (or outcomes).",8
this dynamic is considered unknown.,8
"for instance, as presented in figure , a parameterization could be the weights of a closed-loop neural
network controller for a robot manipulating a ball.",8
"a context could be the initial position of the ball
and an observation could be the position of the ball at the end of a fixed duration experiment.",8
"this algorithmic architecture uses the following elements:
• a goal space t . the elements τ ∈ t represent the goals that the agent can set for himself.",8
"we also use the term task to refer to an element of t .

• a goal sampling policy γ : t → [, ].",8
"this distribution allows the agent to choose a goal in
the goal space.",8
"depending on the exploration strategy being active or fixed, this distribution
can evolve during exploration.",8
"• a meta-policy mechanism (or internal predictive model) π : t , c → θ, which given a
goal and a context, outputs a parameterization that is most likely to produce an observation
fulfilling the goal, under the current knowledge.",8
"• a cost function c : t ,o → r, internally used by the meta-policy.",8
"this cost function
outputs the fitness of an observation for a given task τ .
when the environment is simple, such as for experiments presented in [] where a robotic arm
explore its possible interactions with a single object, the structure of the goal space is not critical.",8
"however, in more complex scenes with multiple objects (e.g.",8
"including tools or objects that cannot be
controlled), it was shown in [] that it is important to have a goal space which reflects the structure
of the environment.",8
"in particular, having a modular goal space, i.e.",8
"of the form t = ⊕ni= ti,
where the ti are different modules representing the properties of various objects, leads to much better
exploration performances.",8
"in that case a goal can correspond to achieving an observation where a
given object is in a given position.",8
"the algorithmic architecture works as follows: at each step, the exploration process samples a module,
then samples a a goal in this module, observes the context, executes a meta-policy mechanism to guess
the best policy parameters for this goal, which it then uses to perform the experiment.",8
"the observation
is then compared to the goal, and used to update the meta-policy (leveraging the information for
other goals) as well as the module sampling policy.",8
"the general idea of imgeps is depicted in
figure .",8
"depending on the algorithmic instantiation of this architecture, different meta-policy
mechanisms can be used [, ].",8
"in any case, the meta-policy must be initialized using a buffer
of experiments {ci, θi, oi} containing at least two different oi.",8
"as such, a bootstrap of several
random parameterization exploration iterations is always performed at the beginning.",8
"this leads to
algorithmic architecture .",8
the reader can refer to appendix .,8
"for a detailed explanation of the
meta-policy implementation.",8
"()

γ(τ) = γ(τ |i)p(i), ()
where p(i) is the probability to sample the ti module, and γ(τ |i) is the probability to sample the goal

"the strength of the modular architecture is that modules can

where υi(t) is an interest measure based on the estimation of the average improvement of the
precision of the meta-policy for fulfilling goals in ti, which is a form of learning progress called
competence progress (see [] and appendix .",8
for further details on the interest measure).,8
"the
second term of equation () forces the agent to explore a random module % of the time.",8
"the
general idea is that monitoring the learning progress allows the agent to concentrate on objects which
can be learned to control while ignoring objects that cannot.
. modular unsupervised goal-space learning for imgep
in [], an algorithm for unsupervised goal-space learning (ugl) was proposed.",8
"the principle
is to let the agent observe another agent producing a diversity of observations {oi}.",8
"this set of
observations is used to learn a low-dimensional representation which is then employed as a goal-space.",8
"in these experiments, there is always a single goal space corresponding to the learned representation
of the environment.",8
"however, if one wishes to use the algorithm presented in the previous section, it
is necessary to have different goal spaces: one for each module.",8
"in order to use a modular goal exploration strategy with a learned goal space, we propose algorithm
, which performs modular unsupervised goal-space learning (mugl) and is represented in
figure .",8
the idea is to learn a representation of the observations in the same way as ugl.,8
"the
modules are then defined as subsets of latent variables.",8
"for example, a module could be made of the
first and second latent variables.",8
"accordingly, goals sampled by this module are defined as achieving
a certain value for the first and second latent variables of the representation of an observation.",8
"the
underlying rationale is that, if we manage to learn a disentangled representation of the observations,
each latent variable would correspond to a single property of a single object.",8
"thus, by forming
modules containing only latent variables corresponding to the same object, the exploration algorithm
may be able to explore the different objects separately.",8
"after learning the representation, a specific criterion is used to decide how the latent variables should
be grouped to form modules.",8
"in the particular case of vaes and βvaes, the grouping is made by
projecting latent variables which have similar kullback-leibler on their respective subspace (see
appendix .).",8
"since representations learned with vaes and βvaes come with a prior over the
latent variables, instead of estimating the modular goal-policies γ(τ |k), we used the gaussian prior

figure : a roll-out of experiment in the arm--balls environment.,8
"the blue ball can be grasped and
moved, while the orange one is a distractor that can not be handled, and follows a random walk.",8
"finally, the cost function ck(τ, o) is defined, using the distance between
the goal and the k-th projection of the latent representation of the observation.",8
the overall approach combining imgeps with learned modular goal spaces is summarized in figure .,8
"note that the algorithm proposed in [] is a particular instance of this architecture with only one
module containing all the latent variables.",8
"in this case there is no module sampling strategy, and only
a goal sampling strategy.",8
this specific case is here referred to as random goal exploration (rge).,8
"experiments
we carried out experiments in a simulated environment to address the following questions:
• to what extent is the structure of the learned representation important for the performance
of imgep-ugl in terms of efficiently discovering a diversity of observations?",8
"• is it possible to leverage the structure of the representation with modular curiosity-driven
goal exploration algorithms?",8
"• can the learning progress measure of goal exploration be used to identify controllable
abstract features of the environment?",8
"environment we experimented on the arm--balls environment, where a rotating -joints robotic
arm evolves in an environment containing two balls of different sizes, as represented in figure .",8
one ball can be grasped and moved around in the scene by the robotic arm.,8
"the other ball acts
as a distractor: it cannot be grasped nor moved by the robotic arm but follows a random walk.",8
the agent perceives the scene as a  ×  pixels image.,8
"for the representation learning phase,
we generated a set of images where the positions of the two balls were uniformly distributed over
[−, ].",8
these images were then used to learn a representation using a vae or a βvae.,8
"in order to
assess the importance of the disentangled representation, we used the same disentangled/entangled
representation for all the instantiations of the exploration algorithms.",8
"this allowed us to study the
effect of disentangled representations by eliminating the variance due to the inherent difficulty of
learning such representations.",8
"baselines results obtained using imgeps with learned goal spaces are compared to two baselines:

(a) small exploration noise (σ = .)",8
(b) large exploration noise (σ = .),8
figure : exploration ratio during exploration for different exploration noises.,8
"• the first baseline is the naive approach of random parameter exploration (rpe), where
exploration is performed by uniformly sampling parameterizations θ. in the case of hard
exploration problems, this strategy is regarded as a low performing one, since no previous
information is leveraged to choose the next parameterization.",8
"this strategy gives a lower
bound on the expected performances of exploration algorithms.",8
"• the second baseline is modular goal exploration with engineered features repre-
sentation (mge-efr): it corresponds to a modular imgep in which the goal space is
handcrafted and corresponds to the true degrees of freedom of the environment.",8
"in the
arm--balls environment it corresponds to the positions of the two balls, given as a point
in [−, ].",8
"since essentially all the information is available to the agent under a highly
semantic form, it is expected to give an upper bound on the performances of the exploration
algorithms.",8
"we performed experiments with both one module (rge-efr) and two modules
(one for the ball and one for the distractor) (mge-efr).",8
"results
to assess the performances of the mge algorithm on learned goal spaces, we experimented with
two different representations coming from two learning algorithms: β-vae (disentangled) and vae
(entangled).",8
"in each case, we ran  trials of , episodes each, for both the rge and mge
exploration algorithms.",8
"one episode is defined as one experimentation/roll-out of a parameter θ.
exploration performances the exploration performance of all the algorithms was measured
according to the number of cells reached by the ball in a discretized grid of  cells ( cells for
each dimension of the ball that can be moved; the distractor is not accounted for in the exploration
evaluation).",8
"not all cells can be reached given that the arm is rotating and is of unit length: the
maximum ratio between the number of reached cells and all the cells is approximately pi/ ≈ ..
in figure , we can see the evolution of the ratio of the number of cells visited with respect to all the
cells through exploration.",8
"first, one can see that all the algorithms have much better performances
than the naive rpe, both in term of speed of exploration and final performance.",8
"secondly, for both
rge and mge with learned goal spaces, using a disentangled representation is beneficial.",8
"one can
also see that when the representation used as a goal space is disentangled, the modular architecture
(mge-βvae) performs much better than the flat architecture (rge-βvae), with performances
that match the modular architecture with engineered features (mge-efr).",8
"however, when the
representation is entangled, using a modular architecture is actually detrimental to the performances
since each module encodes then only partially for the ball position.",8
"figure  also shows that the mge
architectures with a disentangled representation performs particularly well even if the exploration
noise is low whereas the rge architectures or mge architectures with an entangled representation
relies on a large exploration noise to produce a large variety of observations.",8
for examples of exploration curves together with exploration scatters.,8
"benefits of disentanglement and modules
the evolution of the interest of the different modules through exploration is represented in figure a.
first, in the disentangled case, one can see that the interest is high only for the modules corresponding

(a) disentangled representation (βvae) (b) entangled representation (vae)
figure : interest evolution for each module through epochs.",8
"in the case of a disentangled representa-
tion the algorithm shows interest only for the module which correspond to latent variables encoding
for the position of the ball (which is unknown by the agent, which does not distinguish between the
ball and the distractor).",8
to the latent variables encoding for the ball position.,8
"this is natural since these latent variables are
the only ones that can be learned to control with motor commands.",8
"in the entangled case, the interest
of each module follows a random trajectory, with no module standing out with a particular interest.",8
"this effect can be understood as follows: the entanglement introduces spurious correlations between
the observations and the tasks in every module, which bring the interest measures to follow random
fluctuations based on the collected observations.",8
"these correlations, in turn, lead the agent to sample
more frequently policies that in fact did not have any impact on the observation, making the overall
performance worse (see appendix .",8
"when the representation used as a goal space is disentangled, the modular approach is particularly well
suited in the presence of distractors.",8
"indeed, thanks to the projection operator, the noise introduced in
the latent variables by the random walk of the distractor is completely ignored by the module which
contains the latent variables of the ball.",8
"this allows to learn a better inverse model for modules which
ignore the distractor, which in turn yields a better exploration (see appendix .",8
"independently controllable features
as explained above and illustrated in figure a, when the representation is disentangled, the mge
algorithm is able to monitor the learnability of certain modules (possibly individual latent features,
see .",8
"), and leverage it to focus exploration on goals with high learning progress.",8
"this is illustrated
on the interest curves by the clear difference in interest between modules where learning progress
happens and those where it does not.",8
"it happens that modules that produce high learning progress
correspond precisely to modules that can be controlled.",8
"as such, as a side benefit of using modular
goal exploration algorithms, the agent discovers in an unsupervised manner which are the features
of the environment that can be controlled (and in turn explores them more).",8
"this knowledge could
then be used by another algorithm whose performance depends on its ability to know which are the
independantly controllable features of the environment.",8
"conclusion
in this paper we studied the role of the structure of learned goal space representations in imgeps.",8
"more specifically, we have shown that when the representation possesses good disentanglement
properties, they can be leveraged by a curiosity-driven modular goal exploration architecture and
lead to highly efficient exploration.",8
"in particular, this enables exploration performances as good as
when using engineered features.",8
"in addition, the monitoring of learning progress enables the agent to
discover which latent features can be controlled by its actions, and focus its exploration by setting
goals in their corresponding subspace.",8
the semantic mapping between latent variables and external objects is made by the experimenter.,8
the perspectives of this work are twofold.,8
"first it would be interesting to show how the initial
representation learning step could be performed online.",8
"secondly, beyond using learning progress to
discover controllable features during exploration, it would be interesting to re-use this knowledge to
acquire more abstract representations and skills.",8
"finally, as mentioned in the introduction, another advantage of using a disentangled representation
is that, as was shown in [], it evinces superior performances in a transfer learning scenario.",8
"both approaches are not incompatible and one could envision a scheme where one would learn
a disentangled representation in a simulated environment and use this representation to perform
exploration in a real world environment.",8

"however, using this approach in continuous state-action is difficult.",8
"exploration in continuous state-action space is conducted using some heuris-
tics.",8
intrinsic motivation is one of the approaches.,8
"this method activates ex-
ploration by adding another reward signal (exploration bonus) to the original
task reward.",8
the exploration bonus has various formats.,8
"one is the prediction
error of the state or action [].",8
"an agent learns a predictor of the forwarding or
inverse transition model in parallel with the policy.",8
"another method considers a
novelty of the state using a pseudo-count of visitation with a probability density

the information gain of the transition model [].",8
"additionally, there is a style
that automatically generates the simplest tasks that are not achievable by a
current policy to support learning [].",8
"the intrinsic motivation approach can
perform structured exploration even in continuous state-action space.",8
"however,
as mentioned in [], adding an exploration bonus to the original reward can alter
the optimal solution to which the agent aims.",8
injecting noise is another exploration method.,8
"noise can be classified into
three types: -greedy, action space noise and parameter space noise.",8
"-greedy
performs exploration by taking a random action with probability .",8
"this method
is feasible in discrete state-action space, but infeasible in continuous state-action
space.",8
"action space noise is the most common method in recent deep rein-
forcement learning.",8

"action
space noise can be implemented straightforwardly for most reinforcement learn-
ing methods.",8
"additionally, it is used to implement a stochastic policy.",8
"however,
action space noise is less suited to tasks in which subtle positioning is essential be-
cause noise is injected at each step.",8
"parameter space noise performs exploration
by perturbing parameters of the policy.",8
"this noise enables agent consistent ex-
ploration because noise is injected at each episode and outputs the same action
in the same state, unlike action space noise.",8
"additionally, the perturbation of
policy parameters leads to a complex change of exploratory behavior.",8

searchers have experimentally shown that parameter space noise performs better
exploration than action space noise [,].",8

robust policy.",8

broad range of problems for which the markov decision process (mdp) is less
suited.",8
"however, they are less sample efficient than the conventional rl algo-
rithm.",8
"these methods use only the final result, whereas the conventional rl
algorithm uses all step information in each episode.",8
"to summarize, parameter space noise has the benefit that it can manage con-
tinuous state-action space, does not alter the optimal policy, has the same sample
efficiency as the conventional rl approach and performs better exploration than
action space noise.",8

"dividing by jmax − jmin enables the use of the same
hyper-parameter h in various environments with different scales of the reward

"this
process makes a weight pk sensitive to the difference between the returns.",8
the scale and correlation of the noise is managed by ().,8
"weighting by pk
creates a covariance matrix, which generates more noise with the scale and corre-
lation, which led to higher returns in previous episodes.",8
"this feature can perturb
large parameter space efficiently.",8
"additionally, it updates the covariance matrix
instantly because it does not use a gradient method.",8
"we use small interval k
to update σ quickly.",8
"the frequent update of σ can reflect the current policy
parameter on current noise.
. exploration problem of σ for sparse reward environments
the update manner ()–() can deform σ adaptively in standard environments.",8
"by contrast, it disables exploration in a sparse reward environment.",8
"a sparse
reward environment is a type of environment in which an agent cannot obtain any
rewards until it has achieved or almost achieves a task.",8
"in such an environment,
exploration is more critical.",8
"an agent with only σ cannot explore a sparse reward
environment because the variance of the noise distribution decreases rapidly.",8
"in
a sparse reward environment, an agent generally receives zero returns in the
environment.",8
"returns with the same value cause the same weights pk according
to ().",8
"the probability of generating a small noise is high because the noise
is generated from a zero-mean gaussian distribution.",8
"σ is updated by a large
population of small noises and the same weights using ().",8
"this process causes
a small variance of the next distribution and generates a small noise with higher
probability.",8
"by repeating this, the variance of the distribution of parameter space
noise decreases sharply.",8
"as a result, the policy is barely perturbed by the noise
and the agent cannot explore the environment.",8
"additionally, when all weights pk
have the same value and a bias emerges in the generated noise, the correlation
is accumulated per update, and then an agent can only perturb the policy in a
particular direction.
. isotropic exploration by σi
to solve the variance reduction and fixed correlation of the noise distribution
described in ., isotropic and certain scale exploration is required until an agent
obtains rewards.",8
"a part of the covariance matrix σi performs this type of
exploration.",8
"σ is updated by plappert et al.’s method []:
d(pi, p˜i) =
√√√√

where |a| is the dimension of actions, δ is a desirable standard deviation of
actions caused by perturbing policy, distance d between the policy and perturbed
policy is calculated as an averaged expected standard deviation and σ is modified
to achieve certain degree of change δ in action space (d ≈ δ).",8
"this method can calculate the variance of noise in parameter space that
causes a certain degree of change in action space.",8
"therefore, an agent can con-
duct a certain amount of exploration despite the current policy parameters.",8
"ad-
ditionally, this part of the covariance matrix is not biased because it considers
no correlation, and all of its diagonal values are the same.
. switching the two types of exploration using α
finally, we describe how to switch the two types of exploration.",8
"we propose
switching the types using the difference between the acquired returns as a key
to overcome problem ():
α = exp
(
−h
jmax − jmin
jmax
)
, ()
where h is a hyper parameter, j is the return, and jmax and jmin are the maxi-
mum and minimum returns in certain episodes, respectively.",8
"if jmax is negative,
then α is calculated after jmin is subtracted from jmax and jmin.",8
"σ becomes dominant in () when the difference is large and
α becomes close to zero.",8
"directional and scalable exploration by σ is expected
to be effective when the direction and scale can be inferred by the difference
between the acquired returns.",8
"equation () makes σi dominant by setting α close to one when the dif-
ference between the returns is small.",8
"the isotropic and a certain amount of
exploration by σi are expected to be effective to determine a good direction
of exploration when returns have not been improved.",8
"this part of covariance
matrix also seems to be effective in a sparse reward environment to prevent the
variance reduction of σ.
moreover, isotropic exploration is useful when a policy converges to local
optima.",8
"in this case, returns tend to be the same.",8
"with further exploration, an
agent can escape from local optima.",8
"additionally, even if the variance of σ has
reduced, then the variance of σ recovers because the next σ is calculated with
the current σi dominant noise.",8
"in this approach, the agent activates exploration using the difference between
the returns as a trigger.",8
"unlike intrinsic motivation, this approach does not alter
the optimal solution of the policy because no exploration bonus is directly added
to the reward function.",8

though the previous method also acquired a reward with a small probability,

where n is the number of policy parameters.",8
"this parameter switches exploration types by
modifying the dominance between σi and σ. α= corresponds to an isotropic

α= corresponds to directional and scaled exploration.,8
"the results are shown in fig.. in sparsecartpoleswingup, isotropic explo-
ration was dominant in the first stage of learning.",8
"the scale of noise was large at
the same stage.",8
"we believe the reason is that the policy parameters were still far
from the optimal policy, and more perturbation led to better performance.",8
"after
the middle stage of the learning process, σ became small.",8
"it is expected that the
policy matured, and a smaller perturbation led to a higher return.",8
"in sprsedou-
blependulum, σ had a tiny value and α= , except for the first few iterations.",8
"this environment did not seem to require exploration because it was shown in
[] that agents without exploration can learn the policy.",8
"in the sparsehalfchee-
tah environment, agents performed more exploratory behaviors.",8
"this environment may have required exploration because it had
larger state-action space than the other two environments.",8
"in some phases, α
had a small value and exploited the adaptivity of σ. this may have enabled an
agent to efficiently gather information that contained a high return and learn
faster.",8
"discussion
we experimentally demonstrated competitiveness in a dense reward environment
and an advantage in a sparse reward environment by comparing the proposed
method with a previous method.",8
"the proposed method managed the correlation
of parameter space noise, which was not used in previous works [,].",8
"our ap-
proach continuously switched isotropic exploration and directional exploration.",8
"our switching method can be a solution to the problem that remained in the
previous work [].",8
to investigate the performance at convergence is important.,8
"in this paper, we
do not show that our approach acquired a better final policy than the previous
method because we terminated learning halfway because of time constraints.",8
"our approach can be trapped in local optima because it perturbs the policy
along the axis, where locally higher rewards are observed.",8
"however, it is possible
that our approach can eventually escape local optima.",8
"equation () activates
exploration when the return has converged in addition to when an agent cannot
obtain any return.",8
the limitation of our approach is a deceptive reward environment.,8
"the maze
task with a rat guard is one of the examples.",8
"the proposed method cannot escape
from such a trap because it uses a reward signal directly to determine the ex-
ploration strategy.",8
"in this environment, intrinsic motivation with an exploration
bonus performs better.",8
the computational complexity is another problem.,8
"the larger the network,
the faster the increase in the amount of noise to sample because noise is needed
for all weights and biases.",8
"in this case, the local reparameterization trick [] is
one of the solutions.",8
"this method can reduce the amount of noise to the number
of all neurons.",8
"conclusions
in this paper, we presented a new parameter space noise method for efficient
exploration in reinforcement learning.",8
"the proposed method switched isotropic
exploration and directional exploration using the differences of accumulated re-
turns as a key.",8
"the direction is determined by the correlations and scales of
noises which have led to higher returns in previous episodes.",8
"experiments in sparse rewards environments verified that our method could
learn better policy in those environments than plappert et al.’s method [].",8
"the
proposed method could proceed stable learning in the sparsecartpoleswingup
and sparsehalfcheetah environment which the previous method was difficult
to learn.",8
"our experiments also demonstrated that the proposed method did
not improve the performance in the dense reward environment, though it could
acquire competitive performance with the prior method.",8
"our analysis of exploration showed that our approach first executed explo-
ration with isotropic and large-scale noise and then switched exploration type
to directional and small-scale noise in sparsecartpoleswingup and sparsedou-
blependulum.",8
"in sparsehalfcheetah, although the noise had large values, an
agent used directional exploration in some phases.",8
"these results suggest that
biasing exploration is important especially in sparse reward environment to con-
tinuously obtain rewards and learn policy.",8
"our proposed method is one of the approaches to modify the strategy of
exploration automatically.",8
"although we switched exploration just using return,
more structured exploration like using bayesian, which is closely related to pa-
rameter space noise, is future work.",8

nasa “won” by successfully landing the first humans on the moon in .,8
an unipolar world can explain the u.s. decision to privatize outer space exploration.,8
"kenneth waltz considers the impact of domestic practices and behaviors of international 
neighbors in foreign policy decisions, arguing that “each state arrives at policies and 
decides upon actions according to its own internal processes, but its decisions are shaped 
by the very presence of other states as well as by interactions with them.” realists 
maintain that state actors are rational agents acting within an anarchic international 
system.",8
"they calibrate their domestic priorities or decisions in function of the 
international power structure.",8
"thus in attempting to explain state actions with regards to 
space politics, realists would argue that the u.s. is acting to defend its own hegemonic 
status and the decision to privatize its space exploration is a function of how it 
rationalizes its ability to do so without endangering its hegemonic power globally.",8
"marxism, on there other hand, is far more interested in how the capitalist structure 
impacts state and international relations.",8
"marxist’s argue that state behavior is purposeful, 
adding that economic interests, rather than assumed natural prerogatives of budget 
deficits, explain state decision.",8

interest.",8
"a powerful state, under the anarchic system, cannot be compelled to act in the 
name of a common good, such as the common heritage, if it is not in its interests to do so.",8
this is because it fears that other countries will not adhere to such a principle.,8
"waltz 
argues “american [foreign] policy was generated not by external security interests, but 
by internal political pressure and national ambition.” in short, the american 
government acts rationally to meet the national interest.",8

the united states was free to act as it desired.",8
"in an anarchic system “without central 
governance, the influence of the units of greater capability is disproportionately large 
because there are no effective laws and institutions to direct and constrain them.” the 
united states was free to interpret the treaties as it saw fit, choosing which parts applied 
and which parts did not.",8
"the stated desire to privatize the international space station by 
the current american administration is one example of that.",8
"the united states is 
relatively independent of other powers and states, due it its political and economic 
supremacy.",8
"the realist explanation for the choice of privatization and the switch away 
from the moral argument lies in the global shift from a bipolar world to a unipolar world.",8
"the international structure changed practically overnight when the berlin wall 
fell and the soviet union collapsed, “upon the demise of the soviet union, the

strength or they ally with others to bring the international distribution of power into 
balance.’ in the realm of outer space this can be seen with the rise of both the indian 
and chinese space programs, attempting to build a challenge to the dominance of the 
american space program and activities.",8
"however, waltz points out that “american 
leaders seem to believe that america's preeminent position will last indefinitely.",8
"the 
united states would remain the dominant power without rivals rising to challenge it - a 
position without precedence in modern history.” american confidence in its 
preeminent position in outer space partially explains the decision to privatize access to it.",8
"without a competitor for dominance, the united states could afford to limit and withdraw 
government support and create space for private development, it could afford to take a 
wild move.",8
"realism, however does not examine 
motivations beyond traditional notions of security such as military strength nor term 
definitions or domestic context (beyond its relation to foreign policy).",8

examination of other domestic and international structures such as dominate economic 
policy within the u.s. congress.",8

it is a series of choices and actions.",8

result of neoliberalism which began to dominate the american zeitgeist in the s.

a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can 
best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills

free markets, and free trade.",8
"the institution of neoliberalism was elevated to the level of ‘common sense’ (on par with

for any way of thought to become dominant, a conceptual apparatus has to be 
advanced that appeals to our intuitions and instincts, to our values and our desires, 
as well as to the possibilities inherent in the social world we inhabit.",8
"if successful, 
this conceptual apparatus becomes so embedded in common sense as to be taken 
for granted and not open to question.",8
"neoliberalism as an institution and theoretical approach became the dominant form of 
thought through joining with existing approaches, namely the promotion and protection 
of the ambiguous “freedom.” freedom, as an abstract and ever-changing  concept is a 
long piece of “u.s.",8
"tradition” that aligned closely with founding scholars of 
neoliberalism: “the founding figures of neoliberal thought took political ideals of human 
dignity and individual freedom as fundamental…” beginning with reagan and

 harvey, a brief history, .",8
"tsing’s description of the frontier is significant to the neoliberal expansion into 
outer space in two ways.",8
"first, frontiers are crafted and created, a result of a deliberate 
decision by the actors involved (namely, the state).",8
"declaring outer space as a “frontier” 
comes from a purposeful process of deregulation with the goal to enclose the ‘common’ 
land.",8
"outer space is not a part of the global commons, nor is its potential wealth.",8
"and 
second, the allure of claiming a piece of the frontier is a powerful motivator, especially 
under the “freedom” of private exploitation.",8
private property is key to market development.,8
"the united states argues such a maneuver does not 
extend state sovereignty, merely that it is creating a “free” market for its own companies 
to exploit unclaimed territory (a frontier).",8
"the united states is extending, at a minimum, its sphere of influence.",8
"american 
actors are legally authorized (under american law) to extract any outer space resource 
they can obtain.",8
"the american government has declared through national space security 
policies that the american government will act to defend its interests and citizens (aka 
commercial actors) in outer space.",8
"the american state is acting to protect private 
property claims, to keep outer space deregulated, and to extend “free” market principles 
into low-earth orbit.",8
"the american state is making deliberate choices to further neoliberal 
practices.",8
"deregulated markets become the focus, after all “the assumption that individual 
freedoms are guaranteed by freedom of the market and of trade is a cardinal feature of 
neoliberal thinking, and it has long dominated the us stance towards the rest of the 
world.” and, should a market not exist, then it must be created by the state.",8
"post-
, the american government is actively seeking to create a market in outer space.",8
"this is seen through the legislative requirement that the presidency consults the 
commercial outer space industry on favorable regulation and the desire to turn the 
international space station over to commercial enterprises - under the principles of a 
‘free’ market.",8
"a marxist examination of outer space privatization counters the realist claim of a 
natural, rational approach to international power politics.",8

series of decisions made by individuals, communities, and organizations, which in turn 
influence the international system.",8

the foreign policy of the united states.",8
"david harvey traces the rise of neoliberalism 
through the crisis of capital, showing how deregulation and market expansion subsumed 
the language of freedom.",8
"anna tsing argues how the declaration of a frontier plays into 
capital expansion.",8
the delineation of private property becomes key.,8
"private property is at the heart of the tension in the international outer space 
treaties and the common heritage principles.",8
"the united states, as a signatory to four of 
the five treaties and reiterated through congressional legislation, has agreed to the ban on 
unilateral sovereignty claims.",8
"however, allowing private entities to extract resources, 
claim them, and profit off of them raises questions of de facto sovereignty in light of 
declared american protection of its citizens (including its corporations).",8
"the realist 
theoretical approach can provide insight into surface reasons of why the american state 
signed and ratified the first four outer space treaties, cooperated with and depended on a 
former rival (russia) in outer space exploration following the cold war, and even why 
american private enterprises are allowed to launch their own equipment.",8
"but, the 
answers are surface and unsatisfying.",8
marxism fills the gap left by realism.,8
"marxism 
shows how the rise of neoliberalism directly influenced american domestic and foreign 
policy.",8
"the privatization shift in american outer space exploration was not a simple 
regulatory change to allow commercial actors to launch into outer space.",8
"the shift was a 
 
 
 
 
retreat of the state from the realm of outer space.",8
"it was the near complete deregulation of 
outer space in the specific interest of market expansion.",8
"the common territory of outer 
space was made open for private claim by american actors; the american state had 
become a neoliberal state.",8
"the american state has opened outer space to capitalist 
conquest (at the expense of human ownership) through privatization outer space 
exploration.",8
"chapter  
conclusion: privatization is a tool 
 
the story of american outer space exploration begins with the cold war and runs 
through the rise of the neoliberal practice of capitalism.",8
"the rhetoric of privatization 
emerged in the s under ronald reagan, as merely the next step in the retraction of 
the american state in favor of deregulation and corporate expansion.",8
"beginning in , 
us congressional legislation caught up with the presidential rhetoric, creating the 
necessary legal pathway for direct commercial entry into outer space.",8
"subsequent nasa 
authorization acts in addition to various acts such as the national space council act of 
, and the space act of  authorized private companies to launch their own 
equipment into outer space, required the federal executive to seek out commercial 
opportunities, and grants the legal ability to individual american citizens (including 
corporations) to extract thus own any resource in outer space.",8
"the story is incomplete without considering the international treaty system and 
the recent historical context.",8
"american efforts in outer space, reflected through the 
presidential rhetoric and congressional legislation, were focused on extending and 
protecting american hegemonic presence in outer space.",8
"prior to the privatization shift in 
the outer space rhetoric (that occurs in the s), the presidential rhetoric and related 
legislation spoke of scientific advancement and peaceful exploration for the betterment of 
all humanity, through the leadership of “free men” (the united states).",8
"this sentiment is 
more in line with the ethos of the five international outer space tries (including the failed 
 
 
 
 
moon treaty): the common heritage principles of humankind.",8
"the key aspects of the 
common heritage principles (as it relates to outer space law and discussed in the treaties) 
are: a ban on unilateral sovereignty claims, peaceful (demilitarized) exploration of outer 
space, and redistribution of the economic and scientific benefit.",8
"in short, the whole of the 
planet must benefit.",8
"the common heritage principles were initially proposed and long 
supported by member states of the non-aligned movement (nam).",8
"nam’s strong 
support for the common heritage principles was a response to the both cold war conflict 
and political decolonization.",8
"nam worked to represent and protect the interests of the 
third world (most of which were recently independent).",8
"within the bipolar balance of 
power struggles of the cold war, nam was a third voice.",8
"the common heritage 
principles (which were also applied to the deep see and antarctica, in their own forms) 
are part of an effort to constrain the two warring super powers (demilitarization) and 
protect out of reach resources for future generations (an attempt to slow the development 
gap).",8
"reagan’s introduction of commercialization into the outer space rhetoric began 
the movement further away from the common heritage principles in the treaty.",8
"the new 
paradigm focused on cost cutting, budget efficiency, deregulation, and the expansion of 
“free” markets (at the expense of discussing scientific, peaceful exploration for the 
betterment of humanity).",8
"by , congress declared that free market capitalism was the 
only route to successfully develop outer space.",8
"reagan and his successors’ language 
differed from that of their predecessors.",8
"eisenhower and kennedy established a 
framework dedicated to american leadership as the beacon of “free men.” eisenhower 
 
 
 
 
began with a warning of threats to such moral leadership while kennedy presented a 
grand vision of propelling american leadership literally to the moon.",8
"johnson presented a 
hope that the new international outer space treaties would contain the ravages of war to 
the planet, keeping outer space a realm of peaceful exploration, stating his hope that 
astronauts and cosmonauts would interact peacefully on missions of scientific discovery.",8
"reagan introduced privatization and the need for commercial development while 
highlighting the american space “victories” particularly focusing on being the first and 
only state to reach the moon.",8
"bush continued to emphasize this exception 
noting the only flag on the surface is the american flag.",8
"his son, george w. bush, and 
obama continued the privatization rhetoric.",8
"both of the bush’s followed a precedent 
established by previous presidents (such as kennedy) in connecting outer space 
exploration to the colonization of the american west.",8
"obama added legislative and policy 
strength to that endeavor by signing the space act of  and releasing the  
national outer space policy security document.",8
"the  policy document recommitted 
outer space to the national security of the us (which includes commercializing outer 
space through expanding the “free” market into orbit and beyond).",8
"the policy further 
stipulated that the american government will defend its national security interests in 
outer space including its own citizens and actors working to develop it (private 
companies).",8
"this steady progress of commercialization has led to the current 
administration announcement to sell the international space station to private operators.",8
"nearly thirty years after reagan introduced privatization into the outer space rhetoric, the 
 
 
 
 
goal is well on its way to completion: low earth orbit is being developed under free 
market principles.",8
"the marxist theoretical approach to international relations provided a more 
complete understanding of the causes of privatization of american outer space 
exploration.",8
"realist approaches explain the motivations only within the context of rigidly 
defined national security interests, the natural result of states operating in an anarchic 
international system.",8
"the united states chose to privatize its successful outer space 
endeavors because it no longer faced a geo-political rival for dominance; the cold war 
ended with the dissolution of the soviet union.",8
"the ratification of the outer space treaties 
was part of a balancing act with the soviet union while peddling influence with the non-
aligned movement.",8
"however, approaching privatization of outer space exploration as a 
simple matter of national security misses significant shifts in american foreign policy 
and domestic rhetoric.",8
"for example, reagan and his presidential predecessors added 
“free” and “open” markets (re: deregulation) to the definition of american freedom.",8
"the 
national security definition has been expanded to include liberal market extension and 
protection.",8
"this contrasts with the realist approach which presents a narrow definition of 
national security, focusing on hard power definitions: such as military and political 
strength.",8
"marxism, in the context of american outer space exploration, critiques the rise 
and dominance of neoliberal principles within the united states.",8
"neoliberal thought 
gained influence during the crisis of capitalism during the s and s (inflation, 
rising unemployment, opec embargo, etc..) and found political support in the reagan 
 
 
 
 
administration.",8
"reagan began and his predecessor’s continued deregulation of the 
american economy, opening of free trade routes, limits on government spending, and the 
promotion of neoliberal market practices.",8
"since the beginning of the neoliberal practice, 
the american federal government has reduced the nasa budget, shuttered the shuttle 
program, allowed commercial actors to directly launch into outer space, and transferred 
government obligations (such as the iss resupply missions) to commercial actors.",8
"further, american market practices have been extended beyond earth’s orbit with the 
space act of .",8
"neoliberal proponents seek to expand markets into new territory, 
creating new ones if necessary (under the marxist interpretation).",8

the enclosure of common land, is necessary for market expansion.",8

question has to be opened to private enclosure.",8

is: a label applied to a time and a place, that exists beyond regulation, though it is created 
by governments.",8
"under treaty, outer space is available to all humanity but free from 
unilateral sovereignty claims.",8
"the legal interpretation of the ban on sovereignty claims is 
in dispute with one side arguing the ban prevents any piece of outer space from being 
claimed.",8
"the united states supports the interpretation that resources removed from a 
celestial body can be claimed as private.",8
this interpretation is codified into us law.,8

american government has provided a domestic legal pathway for its citizens to claims 
resources in outer space.",8

external interference.",8

there are several possible goals for mining space

understanding.",8
" the reasons, results, and social effects of the space
race between the us and ussr decades ago.",8

example, there was a burst of early space
exploration activity early on known as the “space
race.” the degree of activity was higher than
expected given the longer term trajectory of more
gradual progress in space exploration.",8
"that level of
activity was not sustained, because once people
landed on the moon the race seemed to have been
“won,” as though space exploration was akin to a
sports contest, and having been “won” it lost some
of its attraction and thus us government funding
decreased.",8

activities, satellites have a lot of commercial and
other practical applications.",8

interests on large national science and engineering
efforts.",8
"this is evidenced by the differences in
efforts made to travel to extraterrestrial bodies with
historically strong ties to popular consciousness and
imagination like mars (crossley ), compared
with efforts to travel to bodies with weaker such
ties.",8
" the experimental testing of laws that govern and
describe trends in technological performance.",8
exponential and similar trends are examples.,8
"less
quantitative examples include effects of population,
societal wealth, and previous technologies on
technological advancement.",8
"historical data can be

"in contrast to understanding the past, goals related
to understanding the future use data about the past for
predictive purposes.",8
"these purposes include the
following.",8
 technology forecasting of future space exploration.,8
"if a trend can be quantified based on historical data,
it could be extrapolated to make predictions about
future levels of space exploration activity.",8
" technology foresight of likely scenarios of future
space exploration.",8
"the future will always be fraught
with uncertainty.",8
"the concept of foresight is
distinguished from forecasting in that it is about
determining future possibilities rather than
predicting which one will occur.",8
"because of the
inherent uncertainty about the future, foresight is a
reasonable approach to understanding the future of
space exploration.",8
" insight into effective national or corporate policy
options for future space exploration efforts.",8
"interest
in the future of space exploration (or other
technologies) is not just about what will eventually
happen.",8
"there is instead the possibility of affecting
that future.",8
"there are always reasons to pursue
certain futures over others.",8
"understanding and
evaluating different scenarios leads naturally to
efforts to make the most desirable ones happen.",8
"conclusions and future work
we have collected data and performed exploratory
analyses.",8
"the ultimate goal, however, is to see if we can
extract an overarching trend that will permit
understanding of likely future levels of space
exploration.",8
"such a trend would be analogous to
moore’s law for computer chips and other exponential
curves describing technical performance over time for
various technologies.",8
"a trend curve, by definition, can be extrapolated to
make predictions about the future because it shows a
trend.",8
"such predictions are testable by checking if the
predictions hold when the data finally becomes
available.",8

basis for projection and thus does not support
technology forecasting.",8
"thus for forecasting purposes a
curve that shows a trend is better.",8
how can a trend curve be found?,8
"first, there must
be an underlying trend in order for a valid trend curve to
exist and be found.",8
"satellite
launches and visits to extraterrestrial bodies, which we
analyzed herein, are obvious candidates for model
components.",8
"it is not clear however if those components
are sufficient.",8
"other components that might need to be
accounted for are the following.",8
 the international space station.,8
"the space station
is not an astronautical body and, while a satellite, is
a much bigger part of the whole space exploration
picture than an ordinary satellite.",8
"most astronauts
currently go there, for example.",8
"if it were not for the
existence of the international space station (iss),
perhaps other exploration activity would be done
instead.",8
"activities related to the iss have
constituted a significant portion of space
exploration during the period of existence of the
iss.",8
 the us space shuttle program.,8
"like the iss, the us
space shuttle program made up a significant
fraction of the overall space exploration effort, but
is not represented adequately when focusing on
satellites or interplanetary missions.",8
"catlett ) exists that may support including the
space shuttle program in a model of space
exploration.",8
"to properly model space exploration activity,
various parameters must be defined.",8
"for example, does
a trip to the moon count less than a trip to mars?",8
"also different types of contact with the
destination need to be distinguished.",8
"for example, a soft
landing with a rover and a return trip should presumably
count more than a flyby.",8
"we have done this in an ad hoc
manner as described earlier.",8
"a principled approach to
inferring these numbers would be better, but it is not
clear what is the best way to do it.",8
"one approach to the parameter tuning problem
posed by the foregoing paragraph is to seek parameter
values that result in a space exploration trend curve that
is relatively smooth and extrapolatable.",8
"but is
determining parameter values that way fair?",8
"here, in a
nutshell, are the “no” and “yes” arguments.",8
"the counterargument to choosing
parameters that result in an extrapolatable curve is
simply that it looks too much like an attempt to force
fit the data to a curve.",8
"it appears to be the dual of the
overfitting problem in machine learning: instead of
finding an overly complicated curve that fits data
that might in fact be more noise than signal, this
approach involves finding a complicated
transformation of the data values to fit a simple
curve.",8
"a set of parameter values that results
in an extrapolatable curve is not, in itself, a claim
that the curve is a valid model for space exploration
activity over time.",8
"as just discussed it might be no
more than a force fit of the data with no predictive
value for future years.",8
"on the other hand, it might
turn out to have the desired predictive ability, and
thus be part of a useful model.",8
"only time can tell
which possibility applies, but one thing that can be
known immediately is that the parameter values
form a hypothesis.",8
"this hypothesis will be tested by
future events.",8
"if future events follow the resulting
curve’s extrapolation, that is corroborating evidence
for the hypothesis (i.e., the model and its parameter
values).",8
"if future events do not comply with the
extrapolation, that is evidence against the
hypothesis.",8
"different sets of parameter weights would provide
different hypotheses, and these each can be tested
against future events.",8
"if a set of parameter weights can
be justified by domain facts and historical context, the
hypothesis embodied by that set of weights gains
explanatory heft as well.",8
"ultimately a model of
advancement in space exploration over time may be
derived that, like the exponential and other laws shown
to be useful with various other technologies, will be
shown to predict future levels of space exploration
activity.",8

as a smartphone, that can be placed within the headset.",9
"however, it should be noted that 
standalone headsets are being developed.",9
"for a smartphone to operate, the user will need to 
download software to the smartphone.",9
"presently users can download the google cardboard app 
for free.",9
"however, it is important to note that not all smartphones are compatible with the google 
cardboard app.",9
"concerning standalone virtual devices, it should be noted that several manufacturers have 
released virtual reality headsets that are built from a variety of low-cost materials.",9
"the cost 
ranges anywhere from single digit dollars to three digits or more depending on the quality of the 
unit.",9
"the software varies, but most use an app that essentially splits the smartphone screen into 
two images.",9
the smartphone is then attached to the virtual reality headset.,9
"if the virtual reality 
experience includes sound, then headphones can be used as well.",9
"as with most technologies, lower cost means limited capability when compared to high-cost 
systems.",9
"even so, the low-cost experience can provide great benefits to students when added to 
learning experiences.",9
there are also minimum technical requirements that should be considered.,9
current compatibility is congruent with most of the upper level mobile operating systems.,9
"however, there are phone size requirements, and some of the older mobile operating systems can 
cause the experience to be problematic or altogether inoperative.",9
"furthermore, if one hopes to 
use a pc for less limited experience, only % of pcs meet the technical requirements for running 
basic virtual reality programs (ces ).",9

the future of virtual reality systems will offer enormous opportunities for teaching and learning.",9
virtual reality has expanded to now include movement within a space.,9
"the recent development 
of a virtual environment called the void provides a look into the virtual reality pathway of the 
future.",9
"the experience within the void is virtually immersive and also allows users to physically 
walk around while virtually navigating the environment.",9
"differentiating from previous 
experiences, physical movement interacts with virtual movement to create a more complete 
immersive experience (ted ).",9
"while the void offers an enhanced immersive experience, 
we have other experiences that are targeted for personal use.",9
"for example, one company vrse 
has offered storytelling when using a d virtual reality experience.",9
"these stories are culturally 
and socially relevant and have dominant themes that address contemporary global issues.",9
"one 
particular story, the displace, highlights the story of four children who are located in different 
parts of the world.",9
these children have been affected by war or persecution.,9
"the story allows 
viewers to have a face-to-face experience with the characters in the film.",9
"as viewers view the 
film, they are surrounded by moving images which give them an immersive experience.",9
"the 
viewers are also given the opportunity to hear the audio of the surroundings which enhances the 
presentation.",9
"viewers of these stories have indicated that this experience provides such realism 
that they believed that they were at the actual location.",9
"additionally, 
another virtual experience worth mentioning is called, wave of grace.",9
"this d virtual reality 
experience focuses on the ebola outbreak which began in west africa in .",9
"the rich 
narrative, by grace, the main character, gives the view a close encounter within an ebola 
outbreak zone.",9
"viewers of wave of grace can get a front-row view of what it was like in west 
africa during the ebola outbreak.",9
"these and other virtual experiences allow viewers to: have a 
greater connection to global events; engage in a multi-sensory learning experience; develop 
literacy skills; explore the issue of social justice, and critically evaluate their position about the 
characters in these environments.",9
"as companies continue to develop similar virtual engagements, 
it will be essential that k- teachers explore teaching opportunities within their restrictive 
curriculum.",9

in summary, the latest and future technological advances in virtual reality systems show a 
prosperous future for designing scalable virtual reality encounters in k- education.",9
"also, 
resources for planning and implementing virtual reality encounters at the k- level and current 
literature show that virtual reality is the next learning modality.",9
"therefore educators must begin 
to consider appropriate ways for the inclusion of this modality in their classrooms.",9
"the strength 
of this implementation to take place will rely on the fusion of pedagogy and technology within a 
balanced framework.",9
"while the authors tried to articulate the affordances of virtual reality 
systems within k- education, it should be noted that virtual reality should not be seen as a 
replacement for physical face-to-face interaction but as an enhancement.",9
"while the literature on 
virtual reality is emerging, additional research needs to be undertaken.",9
"also, there is a need to 
explore lower-cost devices to allow wider use of this modality in k- education.",9
"the inclusion 
of virtual reality systems will revolutionize teaching and learning within the next two decades.",9
"second, it lays the foundation of inverse
augmented reality applications which do not treat the human as
the system center, increasing the diversity of augmented reality
systems.",9
"for these reasons, the proposed iar is expected to make a
breakthrough in both theory and practice.",9

in this paper, our main contributions are listed as follows.",9
"• propose the concept of inverse augmented reality and elaborate
the formulations according to physical properties.",9
"• show the typical structure of inverse augmented reality systems
and present the proof of concept for iar.",9
"framework of inverse augmented reality
.",9
"dual-world structure
the proposed inverse augmented reality and the traditional aug-
mented reality, as shown in fig.",9
", are under the unified dual-world
structure.",9
"the traditional augmented reality (human-centered obser-
vation) is to augment the physical world with virtual objects, while
the inverse augmented reality (virtual agent-centered observation) is
to augment the virtual world with real objects.",9
"there might be a misconception between the proposed “inverse
augmented reality” and another well-known concept called “aug-
mented virtuality”.",9
"even though the two concepts are all describing
using real elements in the physical world to augment virtual ele-
ments in the virtual world, their positions are definitely different.",9
"the augmented virtuality means that it is the human who can see a
scene where the virtual elements are augmented by real elements,
and the human himself is located in the real world.",9
"conversely,
the inverse augmented reality means that it is the virtual agent who
can see a scene where the virtual elements are augmented by real
elements, and the virtual agent itself is located in the virtual world.
. mathematical model
take the visual ar and iar as the example, the formulation for ar
and iar can be as follows.",9
"physical perspective of inverse augmented re-
ality
in this work, we emphasize the equivalence of the virtual world and
the physical world regarding the structure in physics.",9
"the referred
physics here contains both the physical world and the virtual world,
i.e., the virtual world is treated as a kind of existence in physics,
which possesses the same structure with the physical world.",9
"in this
way, iar has the same important role as the traditional ar.",9
"we use
a definition called physical equivalence to elaborate the equivalence
of the physical world and the virtual world.",9
"as a correspondence, the same structure applies
to inverse augmented reality.",9
"concretely, inverse augmented reality
also contains three key components, i.e., the virtual character, the
programmable virtual world and the physical contents added to the
virtual world.",9
"we emphasize the spatial structure rather than the
appearance, because the difference regarding appearance is obvious.",9
"for example, all objects in the virtual world are data that are first
created by human and then develop independently.",9
"though the
appearance is different, the spatial structure can be similar, especially
the physical roles and interaction ways.
. self development
as a common knowledge, the physical world we live in is keeping
developing all the time.",9
"it seems to be driven by a kind of energy
with the form of physical roles.",9
"meanwhile, humans are born with
intelligence, so they can actively interact with the physical world.",9
"since the virtual world is expected to be developing by itself, it
should have two kinds of agents, i.e., the character agent and the
environment agent [].",9
"the character agent can be treated as a
virtual human in the virtual world, while the environment agent
determines how the virtual environment can develop automatically.",9
"the two agents are created by our physical world, then they construct
the virtual world and develop independently without being directly
controlled by the physical world.",9
"the agents can not only learn from
physical world but also evolve by themselves.",9
"notice that only the
character agents can observe things in the proposed framework of
inverse augmented reality.
. equal-status interaction
considering the traditional ar and the proposed iar, the physical
world and the virtual world are equal to each other regarding inter-
action.",9
"as we often see in the traditional ar, a human can interact
with both real and virtual objects that have been observed by him.",9
"similarly, the character agent in the virtual world can interact with
both virtual and real objects that have been observed by the agent.",9
"and the
physical way to realize this physical effect is expected to be con-
trolled by the virtual agent.",9
"this is surely very hard for the current
technology, but it is an essential part for iar to support an equal
interaction process compared with the traditional ar.",9
"therefore, the
equal-status interaction may need to be further studied and realized
in the future.",9

. framework representation
since the basic framework has been illustrated above, we present a
typical demonstration of iar using an office environment.",9
"we add
a virtual cube floating above the table, which is located by a small
photo.",9
"the small photo is fixed on the top of a table, which serves as
a bridge connecting the physical world and the virtual world.",9
"after
the environment is constructed, two views from the different worlds
are shown in fig. . in the traditional augmented reality, the user
can see the physical environment and the virtual element (a cube
with the checkerboard pattern), and she can also interact with the
virtual element.",9
"in the inverse augmented reality, a virtual agent
is constructed, and it can behave like a physical human.",9
"though
what can be “seen” by the agent is absolutely some data, we can still
figure out the meaning of these data.",9
"usually, these data include the
virtual cube that is connected with the physical world, the virtual
table that corresponds to the real table in the physical world, and
some other virtual objects that do not exist in the physical world.",9
"discussion and conclusion
the equivalence between the virtual world and the real world is
proposed regarding the structure.",9
"as for the structure, it is already
illustrated by introducing all essential parts of the traditional aug-
mented reality and the inverse augmented reality.",9
"though the spe-
cific expression forms are different, the two paradigms possess the
same structure with each other.",9
"our demonstration is about the
concept verification, and all the results are shown directly by images
observing from different worlds.",9
"this is a clear way to show the
concept of iar.",9
"in this paper, we propose the big framework of the traditional aug-
mented reality and the inverse augmented reality.",9
"then we illustrate
the main properties of this framework.",9
"under this framework, we
emphasize that the self-intelligence would play an important role in
the virtual world, which contributes greatly to building an inverse
augmented reality system.",9
"we also present a typical implementation
of an inverse augmented reality system, which shows the inverse
augmented reality can be realized with most current techniques.",9
"the remaining challenges in the field of inverse augmented reality
mainly include three aspects:
() physical construction of virtual objects in the physical world.",9
() specific design of virtual-to-physical bridges.,9
() intelligence and knowledge for the self-driven virtual world.,9
"future work will be unifying the proposed iar and the previous
ivr into a more general framework in order to represent the reality
at a higher level than what we have done currently.",9
"in this way, what
the virtual agent could experience in both the virtual and the real
world can be well illustrated.",9

the purposes of this study, the focus will be on the use of virtual reality devices (virtual reality 
head mounted display, virtual immersive environment) with autistic students in high school to 
teach social communication skills.",9
"definition of terms  
for the purpose of this study, the following terms are defined: 
autism spectrum disorder-a broad continuum of cognitive and neurobehavioral  
conditions that typically include impairments in socialization and communication coupled 
with repetitive patterns of behavior (salend, ).",9
"peer based strategies-a type of cooperative learning arrangement where one student 
assists another in learning a new skill (salend, ).",9

student accurate information about the situation, including (a) what to expect from the 
situation, (b) what may be expected of the student, and (c) how the student can respond to the 
situation in the socially appropriate way (pankaskie & chandler, ).",9

there have been many studies done showing the effects of various different 
instructional strategies when working with students with autism.",9
"there are three common 
interventions that have been used to teach the social skills that asd students may lack.",9
"these 
three are the most well-known interventions, and they include video modeling, social stories, 
and peer modeling.",9
a more recent addition to the intervention tool box is virtual reality.,9
instructional strategies-video modeling.,9
"video modeling consists of students 
watching videos that show positive examples of people engaging in the behavior that is 
attempting to be taught.",9
"one study stated that video modeling was a promising intervention 
for improving social skills.",9
"there are many advantages to using video modeling, including the 
modeling of targeted skills (clinton, ).",9
"this study was done to review other existing 
literature on video modeling and its use in social skills training.",9
"results from the studies 
reviewed showed that when using video modeling, moderate to strong effects were seen in 
over half the studies (clinton, ).",9
"delano (), examined various studies that used video modeling as interventions.",9
the research paper reviewed studies that used two different methods of video modeling.,9
"one 
type used other people as video models (adults or peers), and the second type used video self-
modeling.",9
there were also some comparison studies reviewed as well.,9
"nineteen studies were 
identified and used for review and inclusion in this study.",9
"using virtual reality devices 
 
 
 delano () tells us that after reviewing the nineteen studies, the overall data 
suggests that video modeling interventions created positive gains in not only social-
communicative skills but also functional skills, perspective-taking skills, and problem 
behavior.",9
"another study done by parsons () used videotaped role-play with asd students at 
the secondary level.",9
there were eight asd participants ranging in age from  to .,9
"these 
students participated in an after-school program, where they participated in a social skills 
class, physical education, game time, and computer time.",9
"arguments that occurred or conflicts 
that arose during the physical education, game time, or computer time were used to teach 
those social skills during role-play.",9
"parent, peer, and student surveys were used to collect 
data.",9
"parent surveys gave information on students’ behaviors at home, which included self-
isolation, attitudes toward socialization, anxiety over change, conversation skills, and attitudes 
toward the social skills class.",9
"peer surveys gathered information regarding classmate 
evaluations and if students were learning from the actions of others.",9
"finally, the self-reflective 
survey had asd students examine themselves and provide information about their attitudes 
and their feelings.",9
"the study was done in three phases: phase ) student descriptions, phase ) job 
interview practice, and phase ) student interviews.",9
"during the first phase, each student’s 
needs were evaluated and addressed using video role-play.",9
"during the second phase, students 
practiced job interview skills, which included requesting a job application, selecting a job, and 
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
going through a mock interview.",9
"during the third phase, students were interviewed by 
teachers on autism.",9
"there were many observed positive changes seen as a result of the 
videotaped role-plays.",9
"some of the changes in behavior that were seen were fewer conflicts 
during game time, students holding the doors for others after they had passed through, and 
students apologizing when making negative comments to others.",9
"results indicated many 
positive strides that were made on social skills through the use of video modeling.",9
instructional strategies-social stories.,9
"the use of social stories can be done in 
classrooms to describe a social situation or social events.",9
"it uses social cues and defines the 
responses that are appropriate for the social situation (gray & garand, ).",9
"a social story is 
usually made up of different kinds of sentences, either descriptive, directive, or perspective 
and each has a purpose (gray & garand, ).",9
"they should be written from the perspective 
of the student and also written at the comprehension level of the student so vocabulary is at 
their ability level (gray & garand, ).",9
"and social stories are most effective when written 
for specific students and with specific situations in mind (pankaskie & chandler, ).",9
"a study done in  used social stories with three elementary students with a goal of 
increasing verbal initiations (delano & snell).",9
"the three students were given informal 
assessments prior to the study to determine their preferred activities and their academic 
comprehension and social skills.",9
"the students were also observed during classroom activities 
and play activities.",9
"each student’s reading comprehension level was evaluated to identify the 
appropriate level for presenting social stories.",9
"then based on their reading level, two 
participants were given the picture symbol story and the third was given text + read aloud.",9
"generalization probes were used to assess the student’s ability to transfer skills they 
learned to a general education classroom.",9
"results showed that all participants had made 
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
improvements in the resource setting.",9
"after the interventions, social engagement also 
increased during play sessions, showing a higher rate of target social skills.",9
"probes showed 
that only two students generalized their social behaviors to the general education classroom.",9
"the findings suggest that using social stories can be an effective intervention for increasing 
social engagement.",9
instructional strategies-peer based strategies.,9
"a third area of intervention that 
may be used are peer based strategies, which can include peer mentoring, buddy systems, and 
partner systems (salend, ).",9
"this involves the increasing of social and/or academic 
interactions between students with and without disabilities.",9
"it can be done in many different 
ways and in combination with other instructional strategies.",9
"pankaskie and chandler tell us 
that “peer support has been used successfully to assist students with autism develop social 
skills” (p. ).",9
"a study done in england showed that peer mentoring has led to enhanced social and 
communication skills (bradley, ).",9
"to be included in the study, the participants needed to 
have a diagnosis of autism made by a psychiatrist or pediatrician and be attending a 
mainstream secondary school.",9
"a total of  students participated in the study with twelve 
students diagnosed with autism and  students without autism.",9
"all students ranged in age 
from -, with  of the students being female (four with a diagnosis of autism) and  of 
the students being male (eight with a diagnosis of autism).",9
"students came from five different 
secondary schools that were located in the south-east of england.",9
"students were divided into peer mentoring groups, each of which had four students 
from the same class and one student with autism.",9
"mentors were given an induction session to 
learn their roles, learn about confidentiality, learn when to withdraw from mentoring, and the 
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
focus of the program.",9
"the students established the focus and content of the sessions with the 
help of the coordinator.",9
"issues such as friendships, work skills, bullying, interests, and 
behavior were discussed.",9
"students individually completed a self-report questionnaire both 
prior to and after their involvement in the peer mentoring program.",9
"the study was designed to investigate a new peer mentoring program and see what 
impact it would have on students with autism who attended mainstream secondary schools.",9
results of the study show several key points.,9
"first, results showed a positive impact on self-
esteem levels, decreases in bullying, and increases in social satisfaction for the students with 
autism.",9
"second, the peer mentors also had a positive impact on student’s social life and the 
feeling of being included.",9
"third, there was an increase in the fact that students saw their peers 
as being a source of support.",9
"and fourth, being a peer mentor increased the likelihood that 
students with autism recognized that they could be a source of support for their peers.",9
"this research study established that the peer mentoring program can be a way to 
enable both cooperation and social support in a school setting.",9
"their approach of creating an 
equitable and inclusive environment for every student led to more understanding and 
acceptance between students with autism and students without autism.",9
combining instructional strategies.,9
"all of these strategies have proven to be very 
effective for educators.",9
"the reduction of inappropriate behavior, the acquisition of skills 
and/or the increase of appropriate social interactions have been the goals for many of the 
studies using social stories.",9
"an early study was done by thiemann and goldstein () 
which studied and evaluated the effect of using written text in the form of social stories and 
picture cues along with video feedback on the social skills of five students with autism.",9
"two 
of the student’s peers were also included and grouped with the autistic students.",9
"a multiple-
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
baseline design across two or three skills was used.",9
"the study used the targeted skills of 
securing attention, initiating comments, initiating responses and making contingent responses.",9
"after starting the intervention, the students showed improved rates of appropriate social 
behavior.",9
"the study also stated that two students also showed increases in initiation for 
requests and responses in the general education classroom.",9
"the study stated that there were 
some generalized results within the classroom.",9
"results were shown when using a combination 
of visual cues but did not clarify the effects of using the social stories alone.",9
"an article by christine ogilvie () discussed the idea of using video models and 
peer mentors in social skills instruction.",9
"again, the idea of combining the methods was 
addressed and the article stated that when using video modeling with peer mentoring, one can 
provide a “greater impact” (oglivie, ).",9
"this article addressed different types of video 
modeling including video prompting, in-vivo modeling, video modeling and video self-
modeling.",9
it also listed the ten steps to video modeling.,9
"a key first step for teachers to create 
effective videos is making sure that the behavior that is being introduced or modified is 
identified.",9
"the next step would then be to find out where the student’s skill level is for that 
behavior.",9
"the third step would be to choose student peers who can help in creating the video 
models.",9
then the task of creating the video is next.,9
"once the video model is created, it is time 
to start the intervention.",9
this is another time where peer mentors can be used.,9
"together the 
students can review the video model and practice the skill.",9
"this combination can be a very 
effective tool to use with asd students.",9
one method is the use of virtual reality.,9
"the merriam-
webster’s online dictionary defines virtual reality as an artificial environment which is 
experienced through sensory stimuli (such as sights and sounds) provided by a computer and 
in which one’s actions partially determine what happens in the environment.",9
"in this computer-
generated environment, the user can be exposed to many situations in a real-world 
environment.",9
"there have been many studies done regarding the use of virtual reality since its 
creation.",9
"one of the earliest studies was done to identify new trends in technology and also 
identify the potential these technological finds may have.",9
"this study done by john woodward 
() stated that while the use of virtual reality is “seductive”, the reality is that the success 
of virtual reality in learning depends on many factors, most importantly that the systems used 
are based in instruction methods that are supported (woodward, ).",9
"another study done in 
 used virtual reality with asd students as a tool for learning.",9
"this study was done to test 
the tolerance of the vr equipment and also to see how asd students would respond to the 
computer-generated environments (strickland, marcus, mesibov, & hogan, ).",9
"the study 
involved two students and the goal was to have the students accept and wear the helmets, 
which would help them identify safety signs in the virtual reality environment.",9
"the goal was 
for this skill to generalize into the real world so that these students would be able to recognize 
real world safety signs.",9
"the introduction of this technology showed that virtual reality can 
lead to success as a teaching tool.",9
"using virtual reality devices 
 
 
 a newer study done by parsons, mitchell, & leonard in  sought to determine 
whether asd students, using virtual reality as a representation of reality, could generalize 
skills of social appropriateness to their environment.",9
"there were  participants in this study, 
 of which had a diagnosis of asd.",9
"all participants demonstrated a full-scale iq of  or 
greater with the exception of one who’s full-scale iq was .",9
"the  asd participants were 
between the ages of  to  and were considered high functioning.",9
"each asd participant 
was grouped with two other participants and matched by age, gender, verbal iq (viq) and 
performance iq (piq).",9
"the participants were given training virtual environments to begin with to make sure 
that the students were comfortable with navigating and using the vr equipment.",9
"once they 
completed four training trials, the virtual café environment was used to work on daily skills.",9
this environment was more complex than the training environment with a more realistic look.,9
participants were given a checklist of tasks to perform while in the virtual café.,9
"minimal 
prompting was given to students and when participants ask about upcoming tasks, they were 
directed back to the checklist that was provided.",9
"some results from the study: for each task 
given in the virtual café, the asd group scored lowest (except for the card shift test) and the 
piq group scored the highest.",9
"in general, the piq groups scored higher on tasks that either the 
asd group and the viq group.",9
"overall, the piq group seemed to be quickest in the areas of 
completing trials and navigation while the viq group had an uneven profile and the asd 
group seemed to show improvements across the trials.",9
"one finding that was discussed was 
that asd participants in this study, with lower iq’s, were more likely to err on tasks 
involving social judgement, which may suggest there is a link between social understanding 
and iq.",9
"using virtual reality devices 
 
 
 studies have also been done to test the acceptance and willingness of participants with 
asd to use vr equipment.",9
"a study was done in  with  participants, all of which had a 
previous diagnosis of asd and iq’s ranging from  to .",9
"the purpose of the study was to 
investigate the willingness and acceptance of people with asd to use vr head mounted 
displays.",9
"it also explored the sense of presence and the immersion of asd participants 
(newbutt et al., ).",9
"of the participants of this study, the mean age was .",9
"and the 
majority of them were males.",9
"a basic questionnaire about demographics was administered first as well as the 
wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence (wasi).",9
"once these were completed, subjects 
participated in phase  experimental session where they used a head-mounted display (hmd) 
virtual reality technology (vrt).",9
"during phase , participants were to navigate three simple 
vr scenarios, for approximately  minutes.",9
"participants were asked after phase  if they 
would like to return for the second phase and of the  participants,  chose to return.",9
"from 
those , eleven were chosen to participate in the next session, phase ii, which consisted of 
two longer vr experiences (about  minutes) which were more intense.",9
"after phase ii was 
completed, another questionnaire was given to participants about the immersion experience.",9
here are some of the results from this study.,9
"during both phases, all participants were 
willing and able to wear the hdm.",9
"from the wasi, the participants were divided into two 
groups (iq’s less than or equal to , iq’s greater than or equal to ).",9
"results showed that iq 
did not affect the acceptance of wearing and using the hdm.",9
"this study revealed, from the 
questionnaires given and observations, that asd participants accepted the hmd and were 
willing to complete the vr experiences.",9
"these findings were important because they provided 
initial evidence that for this group of asd participants, there was minimal negative effects 
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
from wearing a hmd.",9
"these results help to shed light on how people with asd react to and 
accept the use of hdm.",9
"all of the literature that was reviewed and discussed points to a 
conclusion.",9
"this conclusion is that social skills intervention is needed for asd students and 
while there are many different methods that have been used, there are very few that have 
incorporated the use of virtual reality.",9
"many of the studies showed a greater positive impact on students when using methods 
in unison with each other verses independently.",9
"and programs that incorporate virtual reality 
allow instruction to be done in a safe controlled environment where students are able to 
practice the skills they have learned.",9
"these studies have shown that virtual reality can be an 
effective method for teaching social skills to students with asd.",9

show a significant change from pre-test to post-test scores in social communication skills.",9

students and teaching them in areas where they have deficits.",9
"one of the biggest areas that seems 
to be a common skill deficit is in the area of social skills.",9
"and while there are many instructional 
interventions available that can be used, teachers are often looking for a social skills program 
that is general enough to be work for each asd student’s need.",9

formulated regarding a less common intervention method.  
. will high school students with asd improve their social conversation skills through 
the use of virtual reality?

"will the high school students with asd generalize the social skills learned in the 
virtual world into the classroom with their peers?",9

student’s current iep data with a review of assessments used to determine what level of delays 
they possess.",9

video/worksheet program (www.everydayspeech.com) was used in lessons  through , which 
were done prior to entering the virtual reality phase.",9
"the conversation train book created a 
visual approach for students to learn some of the basics of conversation by relating these steps to 
a train.",9
trains were used as metaphors for the elements of conversation.,9
"the book gave six areas 
of conversation skills to teach and to review which included: () starting a conversation; () 
using virtual reality devices

worksheets, which was followed by a brief discussion on the specific social scenarios they saw 
and then they participated in some role play.",9
"then, students applied their social communication 
skills when participating in a virtual environment.",9
the topic of the first lesson was the conversation train.,9
"this lesson included: the teacher 
reading the conversation train book, followed by discussion and class activities on the areas of 
conversation skills to which included: () starting a conversation; () taking turns in 
conversation; () staying on track; () changing topics; () ending the conversation; and ()

communication skills such as; ability to start conversation, not interrupting, remaining on topic, 
and forms of communication.",9
"the students’ social communication skills were assessed in an 
academic setting using the checklist prior to virtual instruction and also after virtual instruction.",9
"research questions 
will high school students with asd improve their social communication skills 
through the use of virtual reality?",9
"the results showed that after the use of virtual reality 
teaching social skills, there was a small increase in most areas of student social communication.",9
students practiced using real world social scenarios in a virtual world.,9
"because students with 
asd are visual learners, practicing appropriate social behaviors through the use of imitation and 
viewing the models in the virtual world lead to some success.",9
"will the high school students with asd generalize the social skills learned in the 
virtual world into the classroom environment with their peers?",9
"the results showed that the 
students increased minimally in scores after being in the virtual reality scenarios and 
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
demonstrated the skills they learned with peers in the classroom.",9
"the teacher pre-and post-rating 
scores indicated that students were able to generalize some of the social communication skills in 
the classroom.",9
"the virtual world allows for the practice of high school social scenarios which 
increases the potential for generalization in the classroom and also in the real world.",9
"conclusions  
the purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of virtual reality when 
teaching social communication skills to high school students with asd.",9
"the study attempted to 
evaluate the application of virtual reality to improve these students’ conversational skills in 
social communication with their peers.",9
"the six target social skills were evaluated by student 
conversation scores across phases a and b, and teacher ratings.",9
"the results showed that students 
had small increases in their social communication skills after using virtual reality social 
communication scenarios.",9
"these scenarios contained examples of appropriate conversations as a 
model for students.",9
"thus, the students’ social communication opportunities increased compared 
to their performance in the baseline.",9
"the purpose of virtual reality is to provide students an opportunity to learn appropriate 
social communication behaviors in certain social situations.",9
"it may create another social 
communication environment for some learners who are not feeling comfortable to face real 
persons, but like to practice in a situation in a virtual world.",9
"teachers should make every effort 
to obtain information regarding the social skills training for their students.",9
"intervention strategies 
(e.g., social stories and video modeling) implemented along with virtual reality may be necessary 
to increase the opportunities to teach social communication skills.",9
"virtual reality intervention can 
provide a chance for students to learn appropriate social skills that lead to their success in school.",9
"using virtual reality devices 
 
 
students with asd struggle to develop, build, and maintain social relationships; virtual 
reality provides an opportunity to improve social engagement as well as social communication in 
school.",9
the findings of this study support previous research (e.g.,9
"recommending 
social skills training for students with asd.",9
"future research is needed to validate the findings 
and also to expand to students of different ages and even different disabilities.",9
"using virtual reality devices 
 
 
chapter four 
the use of technology in school provides an effective way for teachers to teach and 
students to learn.",9
one example is the use of virtual reality.,9
"this study attempted to teach social 
communication skills to high school students with autism by use of virtual reality, and created 
another option for teachers for social communication skills instruction.",9
"i believe that the use of 
technology provides more options for teachers in instruction and this in turn is very beneficial for 
students.",9
"action plan 
although each student demonstrated some positive outcomes, there are some areas of 
improvement that need to be considered in order for virtual reality to be established as an 
evidence-based practice.",9
"there are very limited curriculum choices for teaching asd students’ 
social communication skills.",9
"the use of different programs to find out which is the most 
effective for teaching social skills to students with asd is needed.",9
"it would be important to 
compare the q moment ar social pragmatics program with other vr programs that focus on 
teaching social skills to students with asd.",9
"it would also be beneficial to study the use of virtual reality for students of different ages, 
such as middle school students.",9
"further, other skills and behaviors can be taught through the use 
of virtual reality in addition to the six specific communication skills.",9
"this study used the q 
moment ar and merge cube as the only program for the social skills training in the virtual 
world.",9
virtual reality programs teaching social communication skills are limited.,9
"given the 
lifelong social communication difficulties associated with asd, more information needs to be 
explored in terms of social communication skills taught through the use of virtual reality.",9
"this 
study demonstrates the effects of virtual reality on the social communication of high school 
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
students with asd in a resource room setting.",9
"future research may extend beyond the 
intervention phase in order to determine the long-term benefits of virtual reality for students with 
disabilities.",9
"further information is needed regarding the use of virtual reality with students with 
asd as well as with students with other disabilities.",9
"using virtual reality devices 
 
 
chapter five 
social experiences and relationships can be difficult for students with asd.",9
"using virtual 
reality provides opportunities for these students to practice social communication skills in a 
comfortable and safe environment.",9
"this opportunity should be considered by administration and 
school personnel in order to provide such an environment for students with disabilities.",9
"teachers 
should be exposed to this virtual world to search for resources for their students.",9
"plan for sharing 
the school where this research study was conducted has monthly sessions called 
common prep.",9
"once a month, teachers are expected to attend a learning session during their 
prep class period that is typically put on by administration.",9
"the focus of these sessions is 
creating a relaxed atmosphere to share new information and to provide a small group arena for 
learning.",9
the results of this study will be shared with staff during a common prep session.,9
"this common prep session was created for teaching staff as well as for administration and 
it will present an overview of autism as well as some evidence-based intervention approaches.",9
"the objectives for this session for attendees are as follows: to gain a basic understanding of the 
diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, to learn some of its characteristics, to gain an overview of 
some key strategies for educating students with asd specifically in the area of social skills, to 
gain an overview of current evidence-based approaches to intervention when working with asd 
students, and to explore the use of virtual reality as an intervention method.",9
"as the definition told us, autism spectrum disorder is a “broad continuum (salend, 
)” which means that each student is different.",9
"when designing instruction or interventions, 
an individuals’ needs must be carefully considered.",9
"the primary focus of any instructional 
method, strategy, or intervention should be on improving communication skills, social skills, and 
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
academic skills.",9
"by focusing on these ideas, you are focusing on quality-of-life outcomes for 
these individuals and the hope for a successful future.",9
