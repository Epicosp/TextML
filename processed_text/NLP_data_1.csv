. how blockchain works
the blockchain (literally, a “chain of blocks”) made its first appearance in the research scenario in
, in the frame of the bitcoin initiative [,].",Blockchain,0
"the objective was to transfer online payments from
one party to another, without relying on intermediaries.",Blockchain,0
"in this context, the blockchain was acting
as the underlying ledger recording bitcoin transfers and guaranteeing, by means of cryptographic
operations, the authentication and non-repudiation of payments.",Blockchain,0
"even though bitcoin is, by far, the most famous cryptocurrency, it is not alone.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, since ,
more than  cryptocurrencies have been created [], which are being used as exchange tokens in
many different blockchain-based applications.",Blockchain,0
the core concepts behind the blockchain technology are reported in the following.,Blockchain,0
"- transactions: each cryptocurrency transfer from one subject to another is represented as a
transaction from a to b. cryptocurrency is neither a physical nor a software object, but the result
of incoming and outgoing transactions.",Blockchain,0
"for this reason, the blockchain keeps track of all the
transactions occurred from its birth.",Blockchain,0
- blocks: transactions are grouped in blocks.,Blockchain,0
"each block collects all the transactions occurring in
a given timeframe and keeps a reference to the preceding block (that is where the concept of
“chain” comes from).",Blockchain,0
"future internet , ,   of 
- nodes: instead of being stored in a centralized database, the blockchain is spread over network
computers (the “nodes”), each containing a local copy of the entire blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"- majority consensus: since a central authority is missing, decisions on the network are made
according to a majority consensus.",Blockchain,0
"each node modifies its local copy of the blockchain to make it
mirror the status of the majority of the network nodes.",Blockchain,0
"- mining: nodes could either passively store a copy of the blockchain, or actively take part to
the maintenance of the blockchain, in the so-called “mining” process.",Blockchain,0
"during mining, nodes
check previous transactions to verify whether a subject is entitled to spend a given amount
of cryptocurrency and, each time a block has to be added to the chain, solve a complex
computational-intensive mathematical problem.",Blockchain,0
"this problem was specifically designed to
limit the possibility for a malicious entity to manipulate the blockchain by falsifying transactions.",Blockchain,0
"the probability of attacks is extremely low, since adding a new (malicious) block or modify a
previously added block to the chain would require control of the majority of the network nodes
(to make them agree with the modification).",Blockchain,0
- wallet: people transfer cryptocurrency using wallets.,Blockchain,0
"cryptocurrency cannot be stored on a
physical memory; rather, it is the result of previous transactions.",Blockchain,0
"hence, the wallet only stores
credentials (a complex, unchangeable combination of automatically assigned numbers and letters),
which enable blockchain users to transfer cryptocurrencies they own.",Blockchain,0
"each wallet is associated to
one (or more) unique addresses.",Blockchain,0
"should a user want to send a given amount of cryptocurrency to
a peer, he/she would have to specify the recipient’s address and the desired amount, and use
his/her credentials to validate the transaction.",Blockchain,0
"this aspect is particularly important, since in case
of credentials loss, the cryptocurrency owned by the user would not “disappear”, but the user
would be no more able to spend it.",Blockchain,0
"moreover, the fact that the user validates the transaction with
his/her credentials certifies that he/she was the actual initiator of the transaction.",Blockchain,0
"in order to better understand how the blockchain works, it could be worth considering the example
shown in figure .",Blockchain,0

her wallet (with address “xz”) to arthur’s wallet (with address “vy”).",Blockchain,0

"the above example should have allowed the reader to get better acquainted with the main
characteristics of the blockchain, which make it a disruptive technology:
- decentralized validation: the validation of transactions is performed by network nodes without
the need of intermediaries;
- data redundancy: each network node has a local copy of the blockchain, which prevents
data losses;
- data immutability: data stored in the blockchain could not be modified or deleted;
- trust: cryptography enables trust between parties, since a transaction that has been validated
using user’s credentials cannot be repudiated;
- transparency: everyone could read the blockchain and the transactions stored in it.",Blockchain,0
"though the example in figure  refers to a transfer of cryptocurrency, application possibilities of
the blockchain are not limited to monetary assets, but could encompass a wide variety of use cases.",Blockchain,0
"among the early application scenarios that were explored for the blockchain, it is worth recalling
the notarial context.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, since the blockchain is immutable and publicly available, researchers
suggested using it for storing public records and attestations [].",Blockchain,0
"another domain where the blockchain
has been recognized to be able to bring significant benefits is intellectual property protection.",Blockchain,0
"in this
context, blockchain technology could be used to prove/certify the existence of a document at a given
time [].",Blockchain,0
"in contexts where, e.g., freedom of thought is threatened, blockchain technology could be
used to store information in order to avoid censorship []: in fact, everyone can write information on
the blockchain and read it.",Blockchain,0
"as time has passed, researchers have realized that the blockchain could also be used to store other
kinds of assets, including pieces of code.",Blockchain,0
"it was the birth of “smart contracts”, i.e., small programs
stored in the blockchain and programmed to autonomously behave in a given manner when some
conditions are met.",Blockchain,0
"the idea of a smart contract has been known since the s [], but it was only with the blockchain
technology—and, in particular, with the ethereum blockchain (probably the most famous blockchain
after bitcoin)—that smart contracts were able to unleash their full potential [].",Blockchain,0
"with a smart contract, a person could, for instance, encode his/her will in the blockchain in the
form of a set of rules.",Blockchain,0
"in case of death, the smart contract could then automatically transfer the testator’s
money or other kind of assets to the beneficiary.",Blockchain,0
"the testator may also provide additional constraints,
such as enabling the transfer only when the beneficiary reaches the age of majority, when he/she
obtains a diploma, etc.",Blockchain,0
"since smart contracts’ conditions are based on data stored in the blockchain, they need to rely
on external services, which take data from the “real” world (e.g., from death records) and push them
to the blockchain (or vice versa).",Blockchain,0
these services are referred to as “oracles” [].,Blockchain,0
"by considering
the testator’s example, an oracle could inspect death records to identify whether the person passed
future internet , ,   of 
away.",Blockchain,0
"if so, it could write this information on the blockchain (e.g., by changing the value of a boolean
variable indicating whether the person is alive or not).",Blockchain,0
"the smart contract, then, would trigger a
conditional statement (based on the value of the variable), and execute the block of code initiating the
money transfer.",Blockchain,0
"based on the type of information collected and on the interaction with the external world, oracles
have been grouped into “software”/“hardware” oracles, and “inbound”/“outbound” oracles [].",Blockchain,0
"software oracles are in charge of extracting information mainly from web sources, whereas hardware
oracles are meant to extract information from the physical world (e.g., through sensors).",Blockchain,0
"inbound
oracles insert information in the blockchain, whereas outbound oracles allow smart contracts to send
information to the external world (e.g., letting hotels’ intelligent lockers unlock themselves as soon as
a person pays for a night).",Blockchain,0
"oracles have a huge responsibility in the correct execution of smart contracts, as the insertion
of wrong information could trigger a money transfer without possibility of refund.",Blockchain,0
"thus, there are
companies that have developed oracles that certify the authenticity of extracted data for a small
cost [].",Blockchain,0
"in some cases, it could be worth relying on more than one oracle, e.g., by considering a
situation as “happened” if  out of  oracles confirm it [].",Blockchain,0
"recently, an even more complex application of smart contracts and oracles was proposed, which
is associated to the concept of decentralized autonomous organization, or daos [].",Blockchain,0
"in this context,
smart contracts are used to encode rules to govern an organization, e.g., how decisions are taken,
the weight of each member’s vote, etc.",Blockchain,0
"the advantage is that no external party is required to verify
that the organization is properly managed, and underlying rules can be verified by the wider public,
ensuring transparency and trust.",Blockchain,0
"from the architectural point of view, it is worth remarking that there exist different types of
blockchains, which differ in terms of read/write permissions.",Blockchain,0
"“public blockchains” (such as the bitcoin
blockchain) are blockchains that could be readable and potentially writable by everyone.",Blockchain,0
"“private
blockchains” are blockchains that could be written only by organization members.",Blockchain,0
"read permissions
can be either restricted to the organization, or made public.",Blockchain,0
"in “consortium blockchains”, a set of
selected nodes belonging to different institutions control validation, and the blockchain is used to
share information among participant institutions.",Blockchain,0
"public blockchains are particularly useful when
no central entity is available to verify a transaction, and full decentralization is needed.",Blockchain,0
"private
and consortium blockchains provide some advantages, such as lower validation costs and shorter
validation times (given the fact that, because of the smaller number of nodes, the mathematical problem
can be simplified), reduced risk of attacks (since nodes that validate transactions are known) and
increased privacy (as read permissions could be granted only to selected nodes).",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, in case
of errors or bugs in smart contracts, private and consortium blockchains could extraordinarily modify
or revert previous transactions.",Blockchain,0
"the choice of the type of blockchain to adopt should be based on the amount of decentralization
required, and on time/cost constraints [,].",Blockchain,0
"eventually, some hybrid solutions, exploiting cross-chain
exchange layers between public and private blockchains, could be exploited [], e.g., by using a
private blockchain for a company’s backend activities and a public blockchain for receiving/sending
money from/to customers.",Blockchain,0
"finally, it must be underlined that, when selecting the blockchain to
use, one should pay attention to avoiding decentralization for the sake of itself.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, a number of
companies’ processes are currently managed in a successful way using relational databases, and the
switch to a (private) blockchain could not be worth the effort [,].",Blockchain,0
"with respect to private blockchains
versus centralized databases, experts argue that “the biggest advantages of private blockchains in
comparison to centralized databases are cryptographic auditing and known identities.",Blockchain,0
"nobody can
tamper with the data, and mistakes can be traced back” [].",Blockchain,0
"others suggest that a blockchain could be
a solution more suitable than a database only in case a company “plans to start privately and evolve
into a regular public blockchain for public cross-verification as demand/volume grows” [].",Blockchain,0
"blockchain applications in insurance: selected use cases
as illustrated in the previous section, advantages of blockchain are various.",Blockchain,0
"could write qualifications achieved by a person on the blockchain; human resources staff could
then easily obtain information about when and where a given competency was obtained.",Blockchain,0
"a rather comprehensive overview of applications developed in each of the above sectors can be
found in [,].",Blockchain,0
"what should be evident from the above list is that benefits deriving from the adoption
of blockchain technology are not limited to a single sector/scenario.",Blockchain,0
"moreover, even within a given
sector, blockchain can have different impacts considering the various stakeholders operating in it, their
business models, their needs, etc.",Blockchain,0
"in the following, the attention will be specifically devoted to the insurance sector, where the
use of blockchain could positively affect different internal processes (from customer acquisition
and management, to frauds prevention, etc.)",Blockchain,0
"and could even allow companies to reach new
markets [,,,].",Blockchain,0
"in particular, a selection of use cases that could potentially benefit from blockchain
technology will be introduced.",Blockchain,0
"for some use cases, prototype implementations have already been
developed.",Blockchain,0
"in other cases, the use of blockchain has been only analyzed from a theoretical point of view.",Blockchain,0
"for each use case, advantages, disadvantages and impact on the insurance domain will be discussed.",Blockchain,0
".. improvement of customer experience and reduction of operating costs
in this use case, blockchain and smart contracts could be exploited to increase the speed of claim
processing as well as to reduce the costs (and mistakes) associated with the manual processing of
claims.",Blockchain,0
"from this perspective, a smart contract could encode the rules for enabling the transfer of
refund from the company to the insured.",Blockchain,0
"a simple application could consist of triggering an automatic transfer of refund only if the
customer repairs the car at a certified mechanic, with the mechanic sending a transaction to the smart
contract to prove its identity.",Blockchain,0
more complex use cases could also involve oracles to gather information from the real world.,Blockchain,0
"to make an example, in crop insurance an oracle could periodically check weather data and push this
information in the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"a smart contract could then read these data, and trigger a payment in
case of persistence of bad weather.",Blockchain,0
"these problems have been dealt with, for instance, in the prototype presented in [].",Blockchain,0
"in this case,
the focus is on travel insurances, and the idea is to exploit a smart contract developed on the ethereum
blockchain for automatically refunding travelers if their flight/train was delayed.",Blockchain,0
"another interesting use case, which could widely benefit from the increasing diffusion of sensors,
is the exploitation of smart contracts in combination with iot.",Blockchain,0
"for instance, homes could be equipped
future internet , ,   of 
with sensors that can directly notify a smart contract of a damage (e.g., damp sensors could be used to
monitor damages on the roof) [].",Blockchain,0
"similarly, smart appliances could automatically monitor their state,
and initiate a claim or directly contact the repairer for a quicker assistance when needed.",Blockchain,0
"solutions such as the ones envisioned above bring benefits to different actors: to the insurance
company, which could reduce the amount of resources normally devoted to claim processing, but also
to customers, who would receive money even before having become aware of the damage.",Blockchain,0
another advantage would come from the fact that everyone could inspect the smart contract.,Blockchain,0
"that is, the customer undersigning a policy would get a clear idea of its contractual conditions (even
though, at the moment, he/she should master some programming skills in order to understand
the smart contract code).",Blockchain,0
"consequently, it would become easier for him/her to compare policies.",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, the choice of a policy would no more based only on how much he/she trusts a given
company (since trust would be implicitly guaranteed by the smart contract), but on objective data.",Blockchain,0
"despite these advantages, it must be said that the scenario above could be adopted only for a
limited number of policies.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, the majority of claims processed by insurance companies still need
to be evaluated by an external expert before being settled.",Blockchain,0
"in case of manual processing, however,
the customer experience could still be improved by managing payments in cryptocurrencies, whose
transfer would be quicker than with traditional methods (several seconds or minutes depending on
the blockchain used).",Blockchain,0
"from the architectural point of view, probably the most suitable choice is to adopt a combination
of private and public blockchains.",Blockchain,0
"the private blockchain could be used to record policies and
claims data, whereas the public blockchain could be used to trigger the refund in terms of tradable
cryptocurrencies (such as ethers or bitcoins).",Blockchain,0
"the private blockchain could be maintained by trusted
company’s computers/nodes characterized by lower mining costs with regard to those of public
blockchains.",Blockchain,0
"the public blockchain would be maintained by the wider public, through the mining
incentives presented in section .",Blockchain,0
"alternatively, the company could decide to exploit only a public
blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"this choice could be successful in case the company needs to improve its own reputation
and obtain customers’ trust (as the process would be fully decentralized), but would imply higher
transaction costs.",Blockchain,0
".. data entry/identity verification
the cryptographic mechanism underlying the blockchain could be used to reduce the overhead
related to manual data entry and verification of new customers [].",Blockchain,0
"with the blockchain, customers would be identified by a unique address (e.g., the one linked to
their wallet).",Blockchain,0
"the first time they use a service, a certified intermediary would verify their identity and
link it to their address.",Blockchain,0
"from that time on, every time they undersign a policy, they would no more
need to provide an identification document; rather, they would only need to use their credentials.",Blockchain,0
"benefits of this use case could be seen again in a reduced time and cost to gather/provide
information.",Blockchain,0
"nonetheless, this use case also has some relevant drawbacks the company should be aware of.",Blockchain,0
a first drawback is related to the possible loss/steal of credentials.,Blockchain,0
"as said, since the blockchain works
without intermediaries, no one could reset users’ credentials.",Blockchain,0
"a solution could be to rely on external
services, which could store credentials and return them to the users in case of loss.",Blockchain,0
"however, using such
services would mean providing someone else access to one’s sensitive information.",Blockchain,0
"another drawback
is linked to the fact that the current legal regulations should be modified to include blockchain-based
identification, and some governments could refuse to approve this type of identification, e.g., due to
mistrust in the technology.",Blockchain,0
"from the architectural point of view, companies deciding to exploit blockchain-based know your
customer (kyc) could rely on external services running on public blockchains.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, some kyc
services recently appeared, offering some prototypes based on existing blockchains.",Blockchain,0
"one example is
civic [] (based on the bitcoin blockchain) and kyc legal [] (exploiting the ethereum blockchain).",Blockchain,0
"future internet , ,   of 
such companies already built a network of validators, which receive a reward for each performed
validation and charge small fees to companies requiring their services.",Blockchain,0
".. premium computation/risk assessment/frauds prevention
in this scenario, the blockchain is used to let multiple certified intermediaries record information
related to a person (by linking them to his/her address).",Blockchain,0
"a smart contract could read all the information linked to a person and automatically compute the
premium and perform risk assessment, based on his/her physical health, driving behaviors, etc.",Blockchain,0
another application scenario is represented by fraud prevention.,Blockchain,0
"in this scenario, a smart contract
could analyze collected data and identify frauds during claim processing (e.g., by crossing data related
to a person’s previous claims).",Blockchain,0
"a scenario such as the one depicted in the above examples, however, could be difficultly realized in
the short term.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, it implies that each person possesses a unique blockchain address (as presented
in section .",Blockchain,0
"), and requires the active involvement of different actors (insurance companies, police
officers, medical staff, etc.)",Blockchain,0
"as the quality of the results would be a consequence of the quality and
quantity of data stored in the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"privacy is another relevant issue (especially for what it
concerns medical records).",Blockchain,0
"in this view, in the construction of such a system, a thorough attention
should be devoted to let only selected actors link information extracted from the blockchain to
a person’s identity.",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, particular care should be devoted to the definition of common
standards to record the information, in order to enable interoperability.",Blockchain,0
the most suitable architecture for this use case is a consortium blockchain.,Blockchain,0
"the blockchain would
be maintained by selected nodes of the consortium, e.g., belonging to the different actors involved.",Blockchain,0
the limited number of trusted nodes would increase security and privacy.,Blockchain,0
"furthermore, the blockchain
would keep track of the sender of each transaction.",Blockchain,0
"finally, being controlled by a small number of
nodes, mechanisms to revert blockchain state in case of transactions erroneously made (e.g., a driving
infraction notified to the wrong person) could be devised.",Blockchain,0
".. pay-per-use/micro-insurance
smart contracts- and blockchain-based payments could enable new revenue sources, such as micro-
and pay-per-use insurances.",Blockchain,0
"though in the past micro-insurances were threatened by administrative
costs, the exploitation of smart contracts could enable quick and cheap policy undersignment and
management (even on mobile devices) [].",Blockchain,0
"similarly, pay-per-use insurances could become a praxis,
possibly in combination with iot solutions for automatic undersignment.",Blockchain,0
"for instance, gps data could
be used to automatically collect, e.g., a travel premium only if the customer is abroad, a car premium
only when the car is moving, etc.",Blockchain,0
"pay-per-use mechanisms could be exploited in services such as uber
or airbnb, e.g., activating the service when a customer is picked up or hosted.",Blockchain,0
"with respect to the other use cases described in the paper, from the point of view of actors and
technology to be involved, this is probably one of the quickest and easiest to be realized (because of
the limited number of involved actors, and because the feasibility of prototypal solutions has already
been demonstrated []).",Blockchain,0
"moreover, from the point of view of the insurance company, introducing
blockchain-based pay-per-use insurances (which could be even paid by using cryptocurrencies) could
bring a competitive advantage, especially attracting young, technology enthusiasts.",Blockchain,0
"concerning architectural choices, companies aiming at addressing pay-per-use insurance could
rely on a public blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"in this way, a smart contract could collect money from customers (e.g.,
ethers or bitcoins), keep them until a given date and transfer them to the insurance company if
no damage occurs.",Blockchain,0
"being on a public blockchain, everyone could inspect the smart contract code,
increasing trust between parties.",Blockchain,0
"in this context, smart contracts could represent an important innovation, as they would enable
the creation of daos, where self-insured groups’ functioning rules could be hard-coded.",Blockchain,0
"a prototype solution named dynamis and based on the ethereum blockchain has already
been implemented [].",Blockchain,0
"this solution aims to provide supplemental unemployment insurance for a
community of self-managed people in terms of underwriting and claims acceptance and processing.",Blockchain,0
"even though in peer-to-peer insurance the blockchain could really become the key technology,
from the insurance company’s perspective it must be underlined that the objective of peer-to-peer
insurance is the removal of intermediaries (i.e., the insurance companies themselves).",Blockchain,0
"hence, a wise
choice insurance companies could make here is to recognize this risk, and turn it from a threat into a
business opportunity, e.g., by providing the infrastructure for peer-to-peer insurance.",Blockchain,0
"from the architectural point of view, since this scenario requires a high amount of decentralization,
a public blockchain would be more suited.",Blockchain,0
"it should be underlined, however, that the adoption of peer-to-peer insurance models by the wider
public is not imminent yet.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, apart from a small amount of technology enthusiasts who aim at
reducing insurance costs, a high number of customers still considers the interaction with intermediaries
important and worth of extra costs [].
. a swot analysis
the above discussion should have provided the reader with a broad overview of potential
applications of blockchain technology in the insurance sector.",Blockchain,0
"as seen, advantages appear to
be numerous.",Blockchain,0
"nonetheless, only a few prototypes exist so far, and it has been estimated that
blockchain-based applications will be available to the wider public only in – years [].",Blockchain,0
"starting from the considerations drawn in section , in the following a swot analysis
summarizing advantages and disadvantages of this technology is provided (table ).",Blockchain,0
"the objective
here is to abstract from the specific domain considered, i.e., insurance, and to perform an analysis,
which could potentially be helpful in a variety of contexts/sectors.",Blockchain,0
"the strengths of blockchain technology are mainly related to the technological aspects presented
in section .",Blockchain,0
"by removing intermediaries, the cost of money transfers can be lowered (e.g., bank
commissions cease to exist).",Blockchain,0
"transfers can also be made faster, as cryptocurrencies are directly moved
from a wallet’s address to another without intermediate steps (as it usually occurs, e.g., in overseas
bank transfers).",Blockchain,0
smart contracts provide a high degree of automation.,Blockchain,0
"transparency is guaranteed as
well, as the blockchain could be accessed worldwide.",Blockchain,0
"the underlying cryptographic mechanism guarantees that
data are not modified and that transactions could not be repudiated.",Blockchain,0
"finally, the replication of the
blockchain on each network node ensures that the blockchain would survive to unexpected events.",Blockchain,0
"the most relevant weaknesses are related to scalability, energy consumption and performance.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, at present, the number of transactions that could be handled per second is extremely
low when compared to traditional systems (mainly because of the computational power required to
validate new blocks).",Blockchain,0
"if, at the present time, blockchain-based transactions are quicker than traditional
bank transfers (on average they require few seconds to several minutes, instead of – days), for instant
payments and for other kinds of applications, performance should not be adequate to needs.",Blockchain,0
"in this
respect, it is worth outlining that some blockchain platforms are changing the process of validating
blocks, reducing the complexity of the mathematical problem to be solved and restricting the possibility
to perform mining only to a subset of trusted nodes.",Blockchain,0
"apart from time, space is also an issue, since
future internet , ,   of 
data are replicated on each network node.",Blockchain,0
"to make an example, the bitcoin blockchain requires more
than  gb of storage on each network node [].",Blockchain,0
"in addition, the amount of energy consumed
by network nodes, and the cost of the hardware required to validate new blocks is extremely high,
estimated around $ per transaction [] (though it must be underlined that several initiatives to limit
the amount of consumed energy are currently under development []).",Blockchain,0
swot analysis of the adoption of blockchain.,Blockchain,0
"- availability of a huge amount of
heterogeneous data, pushed in the
blockchain by different actors
threats
- could be perceived as unsecure/unreliable
- low adoption from external actors means
lack of information
- governments could consider blockchain and
smart contracts “dangerous”
- medium-long term investment
- not suitable for all existing processes
- customers would still consider personal
interaction important
the fact that, once information is encoded in the blockchain, it is immutable and accessible by
everyone is another weakness, and could harm users’ privacy.",Blockchain,0
"to make an example, everyone could
check the amount of money owned by a person, by analyzing his/her incoming transactions.",Blockchain,0
"should
other types of information be stored in the blockchain (e.g., medical records), this issue would become
even more relevant.",Blockchain,0
"to cope with privacy issues, some solutions to anonymize payments/transactions
have been proposed [–].",Blockchain,0
"the immutability and self-execution of code could be another weakness for blockchain, since
smart contracts could become “candy for hackers” [].",Blockchain,0
"in fact, hackers could exploit bugs in smart
contracts to steal money, as it recently happened on the ethereum network, where, in the most famous
attack of this kind, around $ million were “stolen” in june .",Blockchain,0
"even assuming that smart contracts
are free of bugs, some applications would still need external oracles to inject information in the
blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"the weakest point, in this case, would become the oracle.",Blockchain,0
"as said, the consequences of
injecting in the blockchain wrong information could be partially mitigated by relying on more than
one oracle, each getting information from different sources.",Blockchain,0
"apart from technical aspects discussed above, other weaknesses affect blockchain usability.",Blockchain,0
"first
of all, the impossibility to receive assistance in case of credentials loss (even though this weakness
could be partially removed by relying on trusted services, as explained in section ).",Blockchain,0
"another aspect
is cryptocurrencies volatility, which could become a limitation to the adoption of blockchain-based
payments.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, given the fact that cryptocurrencies are subject of speculation and considering
future internet , ,   of 
that technology is not fully mature yet (and bugs frequently appear), value of cryptocurrencies show
huge fluctuations.",Blockchain,0
"another weakness is related to the fact that development tools are still in an early stage,
and standards for developing blockchain-based applications have not been defined yet.",Blockchain,0
"finally, it is worth remarking that, in some cases, blockchain would not be the most suitable
technology to use, as existing, well-mastered alternatives would enable the achievement of comparable
results [].",Blockchain,0
opportunities are mainly related to whether the market would embrace the technology or not.,Blockchain,0
"at the present time, interacting with the blockchain requires some technical skills (e.g., mastering
the concept of blocks, installing a wallet, etc.).",Blockchain,0
"several efforts are currently carried out in order to
reduce/hide the complexity behind the technology (e.g., the development of browser plugins which
let users easily inspect the ledger [], the creation of user-friendly wallets [], etc.).",Blockchain,0
"should the above
initiatives be successful, companies providing blockchain-based applications and services (and, in the
insurance market, companies offering blockchain-based policies) could have a competitive advantage.",Blockchain,0
"this advantage would become larger in case of an increasing diffusion of iot, as smart contracts could
be coded to autonomously make decisions based on data acquired by sensors [–].",Blockchain,0
"another opportunity is related to the possibility to address new markets and create new types of
services, mainly by leveraging daos and low transactions fees.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain could be successfully used
to support the sharing economy, from car and house sharing [] to disk storage rental [] (and, in an
insurance scenario, to support micro, on-demand and peer-to-peer insurances).",Blockchain,0
"finally, should a high number of actors write data on the blockchain, innumerable new
applications could appear.",Blockchain,0
"as a matter of example, a person’s previous medical history could be easily
retrieved by doctors in case of urgency; blockchain could become a repository of medical data which
could be used by research scientists; blockchain-based supply chains could be more efficient as data
could be shared nearly instantaneously among heterogeneous involved actors; in an insurance scenario,
data could be used for frauds prevention, policies personalization, etc.",Blockchain,0
"nonetheless, the type and
impact of these applications would be a function of the amount and quality of information recorded.",Blockchain,0
threats are linked to different external causes.,Blockchain,0
"first of all, there is still a risk that the market
distrusts this technology, perceiving it as unsecure or unreliable, due to bugs, cryptocurrencies
volatility, etc.",Blockchain,0
"other actors could think that it is too complicated, and the adoption rate on a worldwide
basis could be low.",Blockchain,0
"as a countermeasure, such actors should receive a suitable training to be made
aware of the advantages of this technology.",Blockchain,0
"alternatively, efforts could be carried out to hide the
underlying complexity.",Blockchain,0
"particular attention should be paid to legal regulations, which could threaten the adoption of
blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"for instance, the regulation of the use and jurisdiction of smart contracts is still under
debate.",Blockchain,0
"to make some examples, there could be situations in which the outcome of a smart contract
would not be considered as legal by a court under existing laws (e.g., a smart contract regulating
transactions of illegal goods) [].",Blockchain,0
"similarly, there could be situations where hackers exploit smart
contracts bugs to steal money.",Blockchain,0
"some governments could consider blockchain and smart contracts too
“dangerous”, thus resulting in a limitation of the adoption on a larger scale.",Blockchain,0
"concerning practical aspects, blockchain-based applications are a medium- to long-term
investment, and they could not be suited for integration in all the existing processes.",Blockchain,0
"in fact,
as previously discussed for the insurance sector, some claims would still need to be manually processed,
as not all the damages could be evaluated by sensors.",Blockchain,0
"finally, should blockchain technology become a praxis, it could impact on companies’ relationship
with their customers.",Blockchain,0
"first of all, some customers could refuse to adopt it, as they might still consider
the personal interaction important.",Blockchain,0
"similarly, companies that invested in human capital to offer a
good customer service could lose market share, as the competition could be moved from the quality of
service provided, to its price.",Blockchain,0
"conclusions
blockchain is receiving an ever-growing attention from research and industry, and is considered
a breakthrough technology.",Blockchain,0
"the increasing enthusiasm reported in the media, however, could bias
an objective evaluation about whether to invest or not in this technology.",Blockchain,0
"the risk is that a company
decides to embrace blockchain technology because it is fascinating, without reflecting on whether it is
mature enough for an adoption in everyday activities, and by a wider public.",Blockchain,0
"to help companies reduce the risk of chasing decentralization for the sake of itself just because
blockchain is now under the spotlight, in this paper we presented an overview of potential applications
and use cases of blockchain and smart contracts in the insurance sector.",Blockchain,0
"we also drafted a more general
swot analysis of blockchain, which could be potentially applied to a variety of other sectors.",Blockchain,0
"we decided to focus on insurance because this is a sector where blockchain has not been fully
explored yet and in which blockchain could have a relevant impact on several processes and application
scenarios.",Blockchain,0
"hence, use cases in this sector could be helpful in identifying advantages and disadvantages
of the technology itself.",Blockchain,0
"the considerations made throughout the paper helped us answer the key questions reported in
the introduction.",Blockchain,0
"concerning question , “are there clear use cases exploiting blockchain technology and smart
contracts in the insurance sector?”, at the present time a number of use cases and prototype solutions
have been devised in this sector.",Blockchain,0
"in particular, blockchain and smart contracts could be successfully
used to speed up claims processing and reduce operating costs.",Blockchain,0
"in another scenario,
data entry/identity verification, the blockchain could be used as the infrastructure to verify a person’s
identity.",Blockchain,0
"people’s identities could be linked to a blockchain address; then, each time a person needs
to be verified (e.g., to open a bank account), he/she could send a signed transaction from his/her
address, by proving he/she is the address’ owner.",Blockchain,0
"in the context of premium computation/risk
assessment/frauds prevention, the blockchain could act as a shared ledger recording a person’s
previous history (previous claims, committed infractions, medical history, etc.).",Blockchain,0
"insurance companies
could rely on these data to identify frauds, or to automatically compute the premium of a policy.",Blockchain,0
"in the scenario of pay-per-use/micro-insurance, blockchain and smart contracts could be used to
automatically activate/deactivate policies and covers, based on data collected by sensors.",Blockchain,0
"concerning question , “in case we want to adopt a blockchain, what is the most suitable
blockchain architecture for our needs?”, as presented in section , the architectural solutions should
be chosen based on the company’s decentralization needs.",Blockchain,0
"in general, for the backend a private
blockchain may be sufficient.",Blockchain,0
"private blockchains have been frequently demonized, since using an
instrument originally born to foster decentralization in a fully centralized environment may seem a
contradiction.",Blockchain,0
"nonetheless, they have the advantage of keeping track of the sender of a transaction and
of all the previous occurred transactions, reducing the risk of data tampering.",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, together
with smart contracts, they could be used to increase the automatization of existing tasks.",Blockchain,0
"in case
multiple institutions need to access data, a consortium blockchain may be preferable.",Blockchain,0
"this blockchain
could be maintained by nodes belonging to the different institutions of the consortium, and could be
used as a shared ledger.",Blockchain,0
"finally, public blockchains could be useful to manage (automatic) payments
with existing cryptocurrencies, or when there is the need to provide trust (using an unmodifiable
ledger) between parties.",Blockchain,0
"concerning question , “is blockchain technology mature enough for insurance?”, while we
believe that blockchain is a tremendous invention that could have an impact similar to the world wide
web in the s, we also think that this technology still needs several improvements before becoming
future internet , ,   of 
mainstream.",Blockchain,0
"the reasons behind this statement are various: first of all, a current limitation of existing
(public) blockchains is scalability.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, the number of transactions per second is low, and the network
frequently suffers congestions.",Blockchain,0
"in a pay-per-use insurance scenario, these facts would translate into
long waiting times before the desired policy cover is actually activated (and, what if an accident occurs
while the transaction activating a cover was waiting for validation?).",Blockchain,0
"second, a winning blockchain is still missing.",Blockchain,0
"that means that a company could develop an
application exploiting a given blockchain, and discover after few years that the chosen blockchain is
no longer supported by the wider network.",Blockchain,0
"using a public blockchain supported by few nodes could
increase the risk of attacks (as few nodes could control the majority of the network).",Blockchain,0
"third, the interaction with the blockchain is still complex for the “average user”.",Blockchain,0
"mastering the
concepts of wallet, transaction, mining, etc.",Blockchain,0
requires some technical background.,Blockchain,0
"at the same time,
bitcoin has frequently been associated with a pyramid scheme or a fraud.",Blockchain,0
"as a consequence, there
is still a lot of misinformation on blockchain, and people could still prefer “traditional” applications
rather than decentralized ones.",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, cryptocurrency volatility (which sometimes is driven by
media news) could scare the potential users of decentralized applications.",Blockchain,0
"finally, the resources and best practices to develop a free-of-bugs smart contract are still insufficient.",Blockchain,0
"smart contracts frequently experience attacks, in some cases with disastrous consequences [].",Blockchain,0
"this
aspect could especially threaten peer-to-peer insurances, which would widely rely on smart contracts
for their governance.",Blockchain,0
"for the above reasons, we do not expect blockchain-based insurance applications to appear in the
very near future.",Blockchain,0
"it must be said, though, that the blockchain community is devoting great efforts to improving the
above weaknesses.",Blockchain,0
"regarding scalability, lightning network (for bitcoin) [] and raiden network
(for ethereum) [] are currently under development.",Blockchain,0
"both solutions are investigating how to mix
online and offline transactions, in order to reduce mining costs and time.",Blockchain,0
"concerning easing the
interaction with the blockchain, some applications that let users easily interact with blockchain-based
applications using their browsers or mobile phones are currently under development [,].",Blockchain,0
"concerning smart contracts security, bug bounties programs are more and more frequent, and a
wide community of blockchain white hat hackers is currently being created [].",Blockchain,0
"once the above initiatives are successful, blockchain technology could be gradually inserted in
everyday lives.",Blockchain,0
"in the meantime, insurance companies are strongly suggested to start investigating it,
by acquiring the required competencies, and by creating some prototype solutions.",Blockchain,0
"such prototypes
could be useful to evaluate how existing processes would be influenced and to what extent this
technology would be accepted by the staff or by customers.",Blockchain,0
"what is clear already is that blockchain is bringing a radical transformation to the way we act and
think, and we all should be prepared for this change.",Blockchain,0
"author contributions: the paper was prepared by all the five authors, which were involved in a study of
blockchain technology in the insurance sector.",Blockchain,0
all the authors equally contributed to the manuscript.,Blockchain,0
"valentina
gatteschi focused on technical aspects related to blockchain and on state of art approaches and applications,
under the guidance of prof. fabrizio lamberti and prof. claudio demartini, who also provided assistance while
shaping and revising the paper.",Blockchain,0
"chiara pranteda and víctor santamaría provided their knowledge of the insurance
sector and helped developing the discussion on insurance-related use cases as well as revising the paper.",Blockchain,0
conflicts of interest: the authors declare no conflicts of interest.,Blockchain,0

"the blockchain is a revolutionary technology which can assist in solving the challenges of healthcare by
providing decentralized trust.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain-enabled decentralization promises to minimize the problem of vendor lock-in
that has plagued the healthcare industry.",Blockchain,0
"patient data is scattered across different entities in the value chain of the healthcare industry referred to as data silos and
sharing of data is prone to a multi-level process of permission control.",Blockchain,0
"because of this, oftentimes crucial data is not
accessible and available at the time of urgent need.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain can solve this issue with health information exchange
(hie) by serving as a basis for a trusted decentralized database.",Blockchain,0
"it can enable one-stop access to the entire medical
history of a patient across all healthcare providers.",Blockchain,0
"access control system built using trust on blockchain puts patients
in control of their data; they can grant consent and access rights to external parties like researchers to have access to all
or subset of their medical records.",Blockchain,0
"this feature fits nicely with the patient-centric model of healthcare where blockchain
can act as a catalyst inducing trust.",Blockchain,0
the records written on the blockchain are immutable and cannot be altered or deleted.,Blockchain,0
"this characteristic of blockchain
provides primitives like data integrity and provenance which can be used to build solutions to prevent drug counterfeiting
and medical frauds.",Blockchain,0
"for instance, fraudulent results and removal of data in clinical trials which do not align with
researcher’s bias or funding source can be prevented by enforcing the integrity of data in blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"in addition, it
allows keeping an immutable log of subject’s consent in a clinical trial.",Blockchain,0
"on a financial note, blockchain could save
hundreds of billions for the pharmaceutical industry by defining a chain-of-custody in the supply chain[].",Blockchain,0
"it is possible to write custom laws and rules forming contracts on the blockchain, which are equivalent to real-world
contracts and can be legally binding.",Blockchain,0
these contracts are referred to as smart contracts.,Blockchain,0
"smart contracts can be used in
several processes within healthcare including billing and insurance which helps in automating the process and reducing
the costs.",Blockchain,0
"later in subsequent sections, we see several companies leveraging the smart contracts to build solutions.",Blockchain,0
"in this publication, we discuss the problems in the healthcare ecosystem and how the right use of blockchain technology
may solve these problems.",Blockchain,0
we begin by giving a brief introduction to inner workings of blockchain in chapter .,Blockchain,0
"in
subsequent chapters, we review major use cases of blockchain in healthcare along with the projects pursuing these use
cases.",Blockchain,0
"we have reviewed works in the field of healthcare data management, pharmaceutical use cases like supply chain
and medication adherence, billing/claims management, analytics, telemedicine, and blockchain as a service.",Blockchain,0

"in chapter , we
discuss the challenges in the adoption of blockchain based solutions in healthcare.",Blockchain,0
"the final chapter concludes with
the overall discussion on the landscape of healthcare, problems therein, promises of the blockchain, and the state of
blockchain based solutions.",Blockchain,0
"several other review papers have discussed the applications of blockchain in healthcare [, , , , ].",Blockchain,0
"blockchain
blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin [], an open peer-to-peer (pp) value transfer network that solved the
problem of double spending for the first time.",Blockchain,0
"with the release of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies became the first use case
of the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"cryptocurrencies are analogous to fiat money like usd or eur facilitating the exchange of value
but use cryptographic protocols as the basis for governance rather than depending on a central authority like banks.",Blockchain,0
"in
recent years, there has been increasing awareness that the blockchain has much more to offer than cryptocurrencies;
blockchain can be an ideal tool for creating trust based solutions.",Blockchain,0
"in bitcoin like cryptocurrencies, a blockchain represents an append-only linear chain of blocks or ledger replicated
across a network of computers; a block is a group of validated transactions in the network, and the two consequent
blocks are cryptographically linked.",Blockchain,0
"however, in recent times we observe variations on how blockchain is defined.",Blockchain,0
"often it is used as an umbrella term for the distributed ledger technology used in any pp network that tries to solve
problems like double spending.",Blockchain,0
"in this publication, we broadly consider blockchain as a pp distributed append-only
ledger with immutable and tamper-proof records.",Blockchain,0
"it is important to understand the concept and life cycle of a transaction
to understand how blockchain works.",Blockchain,0
"in blockchain, a transaction represents a change of state.",Blockchain,0
"for instance, a transfer of
coins from a sender to a receiver is a transaction where the account balance represents the state.",Blockchain,0
"when a new transaction
is created, it is broadcasted to the network where a miner node (computer) picks up the transaction and compose a block
by combining one or more transactions and broadcasts the block into the network.",Blockchain,0
"each blockchain has a set of rules
that determine whether a block created by a miner is valid or not, and only the valid blocks are added to the chain.",Blockchain,0
"for
example, a block is considered valid and mined in bitcoin if it has the correct cryptographic hash [].",Blockchain,0
"these set of
rules form the basis of consensus in the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"a preprint- december , 
consensus
the consensus in a blockchain network is the mechanism on agreeing on a common version or state of the blockchain
which is considered to be the trusted truth of the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"the consensus mechanism prevents the double spending
as trying to double spend an already spent transaction causes a conflict with the existing state, thereby the transaction
is rejected and will never be added to the chain.",Blockchain,0
"a consensus protocol includes the rules for transaction validation,
accepting the newly created block into the chain, and selection of fork/partition in case of network partitions.",Blockchain,0
"depending
on the context and the use case, the need and requirement for the consensus could differ.",Blockchain,0
"consensus mechanism can be
broadly classified as global or local.
. in global consensus model, the first block of the chain called genesis block is common for all nodes in the
network and every node agrees on the same state of the network and stores the complete chain to validate any
transaction.",Blockchain,0
"most common examples of global consensus blockchain are bitcoin and ethereum.
. in local consensus model, every participant owns an individual genesis block and the consensus is only reached
among the parties involved in the transactions.",Blockchain,0
"this local consensus reduces the storage requirements on
individual nodes and is generally more scalable than global consensus counterparts.",Blockchain,0
"example blockchains are
trustchain [] and nano [].",Blockchain,0
most of the current blockchains use some version of the consensus protocol of bitcoin called nakamoto consensus [].,Blockchain,0
"the nakamato consensus is a global consensus model; it uses proof of work (pow) for accepting the new block and
dictates to choose the longest chain in case of network partitions.",Blockchain,0
"in pow, miners compete to find a cryptographic hash
that solves a computationally difficult problem and the block proposed by the miner with the correct hash is added to
the chain.",Blockchain,0
proof of work is resource intensive and inherently non-scalable.,Blockchain,0
"proof of stake (pos) is an alternative block
validation model where the creator of the new block is chosen in a deterministic way depending on its wealth, also
called the stake [].",Blockchain,0
pos is much more efficient in terms of performance and energy consumption.,Blockchain,0
"we are observing a
shift from pow to pos or hybrid model in recent blockchains where ethereum remains a strong proponent.",Blockchain,0
"smart contracts
a smart contract represents a self-executing, self-verifying, and tamper-resistant piece of code with programmable
application logic which resides and executes on the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"it formalizes the transaction rules and relationship
among entities and assets in the blockchain and gives the flexibility to write custom application logic which becomes a
law enforced by the blockchain itself without any reliance on trusted intermediaries.",Blockchain,0
"smart contracts form the basis for
trust in the application layer.",Blockchain,0
"from the early days of bitcoin, it supported a basic scripting language [] that allowed people to write custom
logic to spend transactions.",Blockchain,0
this language gave the people the flexibility to design primitive contracts.,Blockchain,0
"for example,
enforcing a transaction to spend only after a certain time or requiring a multi-party signature to spend a transaction
became possible.",Blockchain,0
"though bitcoin scripts provided a way to write contracts, it was limited and restrictive.",Blockchain,0
"then, the
blockchains specifically designed to support the execution of custom code came into existence.",Blockchain,0
"ethereum [] is a
pioneer blockchain explicitly designed as the smart contracts platform.",Blockchain,0
"with smart contracts, real-world rules and laws
can be embedded and enforced into the blockchain, and thus developing a decentralized trusted application (dapp)
became a lot easier.",Blockchain,0
cryptocurrency token and digital assets became the most popular contract applications.,Blockchain,0
"soon an
outburst of dapps was seen contributing to a world-wide blockchain hype.",Blockchain,0
"prediction markets [] and decentralized
exchanges [] are some examples which demonstrate the real strength and flexibility of smart contracts.",Blockchain,0
"apart from ethereum, there are several other blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts: nem [], hyperledger
fabric [], stellar [], neo [], etc.",Blockchain,0
"types of blockchain
blockchain can be public or private depending on the permission level [], but here we broadly classify it to three
different levels of granularity.",Blockchain,0
"• public blockchain a public blockchain is permissionless, and anyone can easily participate and validate the
transactions.",Blockchain,0
transactions are public and anonymous/pseudonymous.,Blockchain,0
"the blockchain is maintained by the
public community, so there is the highest level of decentralized trust.",Blockchain,0
bitcoin is the pioneer public blockchain.,Blockchain,0
"bitcoin, ethereum, waves [], dash [], and bitshares [] are few examples of public blockchains.",Blockchain,0
"• federated blockchain a federated blockchain is a permissioned blockchain operating under the leadership of
a group often called the consortium.",Blockchain,0
predefined consortium nodes control the consensus.,Blockchain,0
"the transactions may
or may not be public.",Blockchain,0
"some examples includes r corda [], ewf (energy) [], and bi (insurance) [].",Blockchain,0
"a preprint- december , 
• private blockchain a private blockchain is a permissioned blockchain centralized to one governing orga-
nization.",Blockchain,0
transactions are validated internally and may or may not be public readable.,Blockchain,0
"private blockchains
usually have faster block times and can process higher transaction throughput.",Blockchain,0
"however, these are vulnerable
to security breaches.",Blockchain,0
"the value of private blockchain can be seen as a trust transformer where trust is based on
an algorithm rather than an authority.",Blockchain,0
"monax [], hyperledger with sawtooth [], private ethereum are a
few examples of private blockchains.",Blockchain,0
"trust and traceability are the two basic promises of the blockchain obtained out of the box which solves the generic
trust problem on all public, federated, and organization levels.",Blockchain,0
"however, these traits are not always sufficient to
provide a complete solution, which is why we often see blockchain paired with strong cryptographic protocols like
zero-knowledge proofs [].",Blockchain,0
"this pairing ensures to provide trust, traceability, security, and control which are the core
building blocks for critical solutions in several industries including health care and supply chain.",Blockchain,0
"data recorded in the
blockchain cannot be changed or deleted without leaving a trace.",Blockchain,0
"this immutability and traceability of the data is a
critical requirement for any health care system.",Blockchain,0
"thus, the benefits of blockchain seem imminent.",Blockchain,0
"here, we list some of
the core issues/concerns that need to be addressed in health care solutions and later show how blockchain could help in
solving them.",Blockchain,0
"• secure storage and integrity protection
• privacy and ownership of data
• data sharing
• traceability and accountability of data
while each of these concerns can be addressed separately with the proper use of cryptography and privacy-preserving
technologies, the key concerns in such solutions have always been the governing trust model.",Blockchain,0
"in such solutions,
blockchain as a trustful decentralized ledger technology can act as a trust binding glue.",Blockchain,0
"challenges & future
despite the massive potential, there are limitations as of the current state of the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"currently, every node in
the network processes the transaction which makes the blockchain rather slow and unsuitable to handle real-world
transactions which range in tens of thousands of transactions per second.",Blockchain,0
"this disparity highlights the scaling issue that
blockchains have to overcome for wider adoption across all industries.",Blockchain,0
"moreover, with the growth in usage, the size of
blockchain is increasing enormously, making it difficult for normal users to keep the full copy of it.",Blockchain,0
"on a positive note,
with huge investment and research efforts invested into blockchain [], a better scalable blockchain may evolve in the
future.",Blockchain,0
"decentralization, consistency, and scalability (dcs) are the three desirable properties that blockchain platforms strive
to maintain.",Blockchain,0
"a blockchain system can only simultaneously provide two out of three properties; there will always be
a trade-off.",Blockchain,0
"platforms like bitcoin and ethereum are dc system where they provide sufficient decentralization and
consistency of data but lack scalability.",Blockchain,0
"on the other hand, hyperledger is an example of a cs system which ensures
data consistency and can scale above k+ transactions per second at the cost of losing decentralization.",Blockchain,0
"in the last decade, we have observed the evolution of blockchain in three generations.",Blockchain,0
"cryptocurrencies represented the
first .",Blockchain,0
generation which was primarily designed as an alternative payment system.,Blockchain,0
"then, decentralized applications
based on smart contracts (dapps) represented the .",Blockchain,0
"applications providing business logic abstraction and execution
on a trusted platform where safety and security of smart contracts is the key issue.",Blockchain,0
"smart contracts which can be
validated and tested before deployment on a live blockchain prevents financial losses due to flaws in the code.",Blockchain,0
"the third
generation is taking a pervasive multi-dimensional approach connecting internet of things (iot), machine learning, and
different branches of science.",Blockchain,0
"these different generations of blockchain are evolving simultaneously in their own pace,
addressing the issues like scalability, security, and privacy along the way.",Blockchain,0

 healthcare data management
the management of healthcare data which includes storage, access control, and sharing of the data is an important
aspect of the healthcare industry.",Blockchain,0
"proper management of healthcare data improves healthcare outcomes by allowing
holistic views of patients, personalized treatments, and efficient communication.",Blockchain,0
"it is also critical for operating
healthcare industry cost-effectively and efficiently.",Blockchain,0
"however, managing healthcare data is a challenging task due
to its sensitive nature and subsequent trust issues.",Blockchain,0
"and it is one of the main reasons why the healthcare system is
disconnected—healthcare data and services exist in disparate forms in several silos.",Blockchain,0
"this disconnected system is a
culprit for several inefficiencies in healthcare and is a major hurdle for healthcare research.",Blockchain,0
"healthcare professionals
generally do not have access to the complete data of patients, thereby, hampering the subsequent diagnosis and treatment
steps; and researchers struggle to find the desired data for their studies, thereby, slowing down healthcare research.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain may enable the efficient sharing of healthcare data while ensuring data integrity and protecting patient
privacy.",Blockchain,0
"secure, efficient, cost-effective, and interoperable hie can be built with its right use alongside with other
technologies.",Blockchain,0
"moreover, the adoption of blockchain can push forward the movement of patient-centric healthcare
model where patients control their healthcare data.",Blockchain,0
"the major hurdles behind data-sharing in both patient-centric and
traditional models are lack of trust and lack of incentives to share.",Blockchain,0
"the blockchain technology can solve both problems
by acting as a trust layer and introducing the incentive mechanisms such as rewarding crypto tokens for sharing data.",Blockchain,0
"moreover, blockchain can be the bridge for the integration of medical device data and healthcare internet of things; the
healthcare and lifestyle data collected by wearable devices can be critical for correct diagnosis but are underutilized
since there is a lack of a proper way for a physician to access the patient-generated data.",Blockchain,0
"with blockchain-enabled trust and incentive structure, there is a promise for a global hie and a marketplace on top
of it.",Blockchain,0
"but the lack of common healthcare data standards can be one of the major obstacles to overcome before the
development of an interoperable hie connecting multiple disparate data silos.",Blockchain,0
"however, there is a possibility that the
incentives introduced by blockchain-based data exchange may fuel the creation and the development of the open data
standards.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain-based hie will be an interesting use case that requires the balance among privacy, transparency,
and efficiency.",Blockchain,0
"moreover, country-specific regulations will be another obstacle for a hie connecting multiple regulatory
regions.",Blockchain,0
"since patients have full ownership of their healthcare data in many countries, blockchain enabled patient-centric
healthcare data model can be one fitting way to bypass these regulatory challenges.

drug discovery and research take a significant cost on the operations of any pharmaceutical company.",Blockchain,0
"with increasing
costs of healthcare, together with the need to innovate faster on new medicinal treatments, it is imperative that multiple
pharmaceutical companies find an approach to collaborate competitively.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain can enable the technological
platform to facilitate the transfer of trusted information and knowledge among multiple parties.",Blockchain,0
"the usage of blockchain
for robust digital proof of intellectual property (ip) through immutable records and time-stamping is one fitting
proposition for the collaboration.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain-based solutions can also provide mechanisms to share clinical and trial data
competitively.",Blockchain,0
"even under a non-collaborative research and drug development scenario, blockchain provides benefits for
effectively tracking and managing various aspects of clinical trials like data management, consent management, tracking
side-effects of drugs usage, etc.",Blockchain,0
"also, it is not uncommon for a pharmaceutical research company to outsource their
clinical research projects.",Blockchain,0
"in this case, blockchain could provide a feasible mechanism to assure data integrity and proper
outcome validation.",Blockchain,0

advanced digital ledger technology (adlt).",Blockchain,0
"the overarching goal is to inter-connect the currently disconnected parties
in silos.
. supply chain and counterfeit drugs detection
the importance of the supply chain in the medical industry cannot be overstated.",Blockchain,0
"right from the raw materials and
production, to different stages of storage and distribution, proper monitoring and tracking are required to ensure
optimal and intended usage.",Blockchain,0
one of the growing concerns in recent years is that of counterfeit drugs.,Blockchain,0
"there must be a
mechanism for the end users and all the stakeholders of the supply chain to verify the ingredients of a drug.",Blockchain,0
"with lack of
a proper tracking mechanism, there are ample weak links in the supply chain where the drug can be tampered with, or a
counterfeit drug can be infused in the supply.",Blockchain,0
"to address this growing concern, new regulations have been brought forth
to have all stakeholders of the medicine supply chain provide a robust mechanism to track and trace the pharmaceutical
supplies that pass through them.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain provides a perfectly fitting solution to this need for tracing and tracking,
where this information has to be maintained in an open yet safe and tamper-proof system accessible to multiple parties.",Blockchain,0

business models must be explored that can provide fair incentives to all the stakeholders.",Blockchain,0
"the provided incentives
should acknowledge the costs and efforts in deploying or adopting a blockchain based technologies, along with any
underlying changes in the operational model that the deployed solution entails.",Blockchain,0
"consider the solution for blockchain
based patient data management.",Blockchain,0
"in this particular scenario, a fair incentive scheme must be devised in a sustainable
business model that can be accepted by the patients, device manufactures, backend it solution providers, hospitals, etc.",Blockchain,0
"as this application is still evolving, it would be some time before proven robust incentive models are aplenty.",Blockchain,0
"in the
meantime, any associated risk of a particular incentive model must be rigorously assessed and quantified as much as
possible.
. uncertain cost of operation
while blockchain has promising features such as no need of central authority (and hence no central point of failure),
transparency and relatively fast settlement of transactions, the cost of operating blockchain systems are not yet known.",Blockchain,0
"today, a significant amount of resources in healthcare is being spent on personnel, time, and money to build and manage
the current traditional information systems and data exchanges.",Blockchain,0
"on top of that, there is an overhead of continuously
updating the systems, troubleshooting issues, performing backups, worrying about hacks and data breaches.",Blockchain,0
"the
blockchain-based hie system could prove itself to be cost-effective and more efficient compared to the traditional
hie system.",Blockchain,0
"this, for example, could come due to the enhanced security by design.",Blockchain,0
"nonetheless, the overall cost
factors involved in a blockchain technology-based healthcare services must be robustly assessed in a given business and
operational model of a healthcare organization.
. regulation
a solution in the healthcare space needs to adhere to a various set of regulations as the patient’s health and even life
is at stake, directly or indirectly.",Blockchain,0
"further, as it concerns health data, the concerns regarding data privacy are also the
highest.",Blockchain,0
"the blockchain technology being a new technological solution that is being adopted among the early users,
one of the challenges remain on how the solutions on top of blockchain technology comply with existing regulations
and standards.",Blockchain,0
"while existing hie systems have multiple years to evolve towards meeting the regulatory requirements,
the blockchain technology might be still in the evolution phase to find the sweet landing spot within the healthcare
space where it can also adequately adhere to set healthcare standards and regulations.",Blockchain,0
"to achieve this, a number of pilot
deployments and rigorous test and validation of the underlying technological pieces must be considered by the solution
providers.",Blockchain,0
"the requirements to adhere to regulations could also be an impetus for further technological advancements
in the blockchain technology.",Blockchain,0
"the requirements from recently enforced general data protection rule (gdpr) is one of the cases which is leading
discussion and thoughts on how blockchain technology can further evolve to comply with set regulations.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain
and gdpr has a dual relationship.",Blockchain,0
"on the one hand, gdpr, as an example, enforces provisions like the right to
erasure/right to be forgotten, giving a person (data originator) full right and control over his or her data which directly
conflicts with the immutable nature of blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"healthcare data are generally stored off-chain and only pointers
to the data, usually, its cryptographic hash, is stored in the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"this approach provides a way to make a
blockchain application gdpr compliant.",Blockchain,0
"however, one can always argue that the cryptographic hash can still be
considered a form of the personal data which is a separate discussion in itself.",Blockchain,0
"over time better trade-offs are bound to
come where regulatory compliance feeds very well to only evolution and maturity of blockchain technology for even
more widespread adoption.",Blockchain,0
"at this point, it is wise to consider incorporating gdpr like regulations in blockchain
applications.",Blockchain,0
"on the other hand, from a decentralization perspective, regulations like gdpr and blockchain are perfect
partners.",Blockchain,0
"with the increasing awareness among users about their personal data and enforcement of privacy regulations,
there has been a surge in the interest around the patient-controlled health care data.",Blockchain,0
"given the existence of user-friendly
applications for management of the personal data with proper security and incentive structures, individuals can have
access and control to their healthcare data and can participate in pp global data-exchange required for healthcare
research and services, all powered by blockchain.
. governance
the basic premise of the distributed nature of blockchain helps to bring multiple parties into a trusted transaction
scheme, without the need of any centralized authorities.",Blockchain,0
"however, if we consider how healthcare organizations operate,
there can be several different operational models.",Blockchain,0
"in certain operational models of blockchain based solutions, it might

a preprint- december , 
be imperative to have a certain stakeholder assuming the role of a regulator to govern the overall operation of the
blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"this governing model might, for example, be needed to meet the regulatory requirements.",Blockchain,0
"it is not yet clear
how such a governance structure can be managed properly in a system with multiple disparate parties.",Blockchain,0
"this aspect of
governance will also have a tie-in with the intended incentive schemes.",Blockchain,0
"however, as the adoption of blockchain based
solutions will evolve in the healthcare space, we would see various solutions also to the requirements of governance.
. scaling
not only in healthcare but any industry, the underlying blockchain network has to be scalable for successful application
of any blockchain-based solutions.",Blockchain,0
"it is likely that, at least in the early phase, several solutions in healthcare will use
semi-permissioned blockchains which are scalable and have high transaction throughput at the cost of decentralization.",Blockchain,0
"however, there will still be a need for public blockchains for communication among permissioned blockchain networks.",Blockchain,0
"besides, a blockchain-enabled global hie can only be possible with highly scalable public blockchains.",Blockchain,0
"in current
form, public blockchain networks like bitcoin and ethereum are not fast and cheap enough to host any decentralized
applications on a large scale.",Blockchain,0
and some of them are already being adopted in practice.,Blockchain,0
"in the future,
it is likely that the public blockchains will be fast and cheap enough for their mass adoption.",Blockchain,0
"conclusion
blockchain technology has the potential to solve several problems plaguing the healthcare industry today.",Blockchain,0
"as a trust
mediator, it can enable novel healthcare solutions; and as an incentive machine, it can enable novel business models
that may lead to a new dynamic among various healthcare stakeholders like patients and providers.",Blockchain,0
"for example, a
patient-centric healthcare model and a global hie might be realized by virtue of blockchain enabled decentralized trust
and incentive structures.",Blockchain,0
"similarly, blockchain based decentralized network/services may minimize vendor lock-in
problems in healthcare.",Blockchain,0
"examples
of organizations developing blockchain-based applications for these use cases were also presented.",Blockchain,0
"the proposed
applications range from moonshot projects trying to build a complete decentralized health care ecosystem to specific
applications such as data provenance, counterfeit drugs identification, consent management, etc.",Blockchain,0
"despite the immense potential of blockchain technology and an enormous amount of interest around it, we found that
its impact on healthcare is minimal and is still in the early days.",Blockchain,0
"most of the blockchain based healthcare solutions are
still in the form of novel concepts represented by whitepapers, prototypes, or only a very small number of working
products with a limited user base.",Blockchain,0
"however, the field is evolving rapidly; we anticipate a significant positive impact
of blockchain in healthcare in the future.",Blockchain,0
"challenges such as interoperability, integration with the existing systems,
uncertainty in cost, technological and adoption barrier, regulatory compliance, and scaling have to be successfully
tackled to help blockchain make its mark in the healthcare industry.",Blockchain,0

"by answering the questions, novice developers could know what resources to exploit 
to support their blockchain relevant programming tasks and blockchain project 
communities could better acknowledge how to make blockchain technology more 
practical to front-line developers.",Blockchain,0
"in this article, we conduct a case study by stack overflow, a popular technical 
question and answer (q & a) website attracting millions of developers.",Blockchain,0
"we extracted all 
the blockchain relevant question posts and investigate how blockchain is discussed by 
developers there.",Blockchain,0
"overview of the study 
in this study, we attempt to draw a profile of blockchain in the eyes of developers with 
stack overflow as a point of penetration.",Blockchain,0
"in brief, the motivation of this study contains 
three parts.",Blockchain,0
"first, we want to evaluate the popularity of blockchain, or to check whether 
blockchain is hot.",Blockchain,0
"to this end, we use the frequency of blockchain relevant questions in 
stack overflow as an index.",Blockchain,0
"second, we want to acknowledge what are the frequently 
encountered problems about blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"hence, we analyze the blockchain relevant 
questions in stack overflow to find the common terms.",Blockchain,0
"third, we also want to know 
what frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques can be used by developers in blockchain 
relevant tasks.",Blockchain,0
so we try to identify these entities from tags of stack overflow posts.,Blockchain,0
"in 
summary, the study is to answer the following three questions: 
q: how frequently blockchain relevant questions are posted in stack overflow?",Blockchain,0
q: what are the common problems when blockchain is involving?,Blockchain,0
"q: what blockchain specialized entities (programming relevant platforms, frameworks, 
tools, libraries, techniques, etc) do there exist?",Blockchain,0
"with these questions, the study is conducted according to the following steps.",Blockchain,0
"at first, 
we extract the question posts in which the string “blockchain” is mentioned.",Blockchain,0
"an 
evolvement analysis of these posts is conducted.",Blockchain,0
"next, we manually categorize these 
extracted question posts into different types in perspective of developers’ demands.",Blockchain,0
"the 
description of each type is summarized further.",Blockchain,0
"then, blockchain relevant tags of the 
extracted question posts are selected.",Blockchain,0
"after that, these tags are identified as commonly 
used frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques related to blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"figure  outlines 
the process of this study.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain relevant entities indicate concepts 
specialized in blockchain technology such as platforms, frameworks, or techniques.",Blockchain,0

"we parse the file to obtain post 
metadata, for example, the post title, the post body, the tags, and the score.",Blockchain,0
"with these data, we extract the question posts in which “blockchain” is mentioned.",Blockchain,0
"specifically, we first remove all the code snippets and hyperlink text (enclosed in <a 
href=“...”> html tags) from the bodies of all the question posts.",Blockchain,0
"then, we go through 
the titles, bodies, and tags of all the question posts.",Blockchain,0
"a question post is extracted as 
blockchain relevant if the string “blockchain” or “block[^a-z]chain” appears in at least 
one of these three fields, where “[^a-z]” represents a character but not a letter.",Blockchain,0
"using 
these heuristics, , question posts are identified as blockchain relevant.",Blockchain,0
"evolvement of the blockchain relevant posts 
among all ,, question posts in stack overflow, only , of them are 
blockchain relevant.",Blockchain,0
"we suppose that blockchain is an emerging concept and going to 
rise.",Blockchain,0
"to prove this idea, we investigate the evolvement of the blockchain relevant 
question posts.",Blockchain,0
"figure  presents the number of blockchain relevant question posts per 
month.",Blockchain,0
"the stack overflow website was operative as early as july , but blockchain 
relevant question posts were not mentioned for a long time at the beginning.",Blockchain,0
"the first 
blockchain relevant question was posted in january .",Blockchain,0
"the time span before that date 
is omitted in the figure.",Blockchain,0
the data of march  is eliminated as it is not complete.,Blockchain,0
we have two observations from the evolvement.,Blockchain,0
"on the one hand, blockchain is an 
ongoing topic in stack overflow programming practice.",Blockchain,0
"the monthly number of 
blockchain relevant question posts shows a clearly increasing trend especially since 
january .",Blockchain,0
"moreover, the increasing speed tends to increase, too.",Blockchain,0
"that means more 
and more programming issues about blockchain are raised and discussed.",Blockchain,0
"although the 
current number of blockchain relevant question posts is relatively small, we believe that it 
could rise fast in the future.",Blockchain,0
"on the other hand, the application of blockchain is lagging 
behind the theory of blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"the idea of blockchain was conceptualized in 

.",Blockchain,0
"but only still , it emerged in stack overflow, where blockchain is viewed in the 
application perspective.",Blockchain,0
there is a time delay between theory and application.,Blockchain,0
"however, 
blockchain has attracted the attentions from programming communities and blockchain 
relevant questions are continuously growing.",Blockchain,0
"a. currently, blockchain relevant questions only occupy a small part of all stack 
overflow posts, but the monthly number is increasing over time (figure ).",Blockchain,0
evolvement of blockchain relevant question posts.,Blockchain,0
"question types summarization 
 
posts categorization 
to give a summary of what tasks developers face with, we categorize the blockchain 
relevant question posts into different types.",Blockchain,0
"as the extracted question post set is not very 
large, and for the sake of accuracy, we do this work manually.",Blockchain,0
"to make the results more understandable, we do not focus on technical details but the 
demands of askers.",Blockchain,0
"a question post is labeled with a unique type which reflects the main 
purpose of the asker.",Blockchain,0
"for example, in a post, the asker writes “i want to query the 
blockchain to find the moment when an unconfirmed transaction comes through for a 
particular bitcoin address” (#).",Blockchain,0
"that is, the asker wants to access the 
blockchain to obtain some information of transactions.",Blockchain,0
"then we may label the post as 
“access”.",Blockchain,0
"in another example, “what’s the difference between distributed hashtable 
technology and the bitcoin blockchain?” (#), the asker just wants to 
discriminate the two concepts but does not leak the practical requirements.",Blockchain,0
"then the post 
could be labeled as “discussion”.",Blockchain,0
"with this consideration, we categorize the posts following the iterative process of 
mobile app reviews tagging.",Blockchain,0
"specifically, for each of the blockchain relevant question 
post, we label it with an existing type.",Blockchain,0
"if a question post does not match any existing 
types, then we add a new type to the existing types and relabel the blockchain relevant 
question post from the beginning.",Blockchain,0
"finally  types of blockchain relevant question posts 
are detected.",Blockchain,0
"types of the blockchain relevant question posts 
for the  types of blockchain relevant question posts, we summarize their substances 
and give a brief description and an example question post for each type.",Blockchain,0
"the details are 
shown in figure .",Blockchain,0
"as a question post is labeled with a unique type, the blockchain relevant question posts 
are grouped into  clusters.",Blockchain,0
"if a large number of question posts belong to the same type, 
then this type of issues are frequently encountered and should be paid more attention to.",Blockchain,0
"the number of question posts a type involves (cluster size) reveals the popularity of this 
type.",Blockchain,0
"to find the popular types, we rank the  types according to the numbers of 
question posts and the results are displayed in figure  (a).",Blockchain,0
"the top three types are configuration, deployment, and discussion, which account for 
more than  percent of all the posts.",Blockchain,0
"questions of configuration are about how to 
configure the environment to work well.",Blockchain,0
"many askers reported to get errors during the 
configuring process, such as post#: error running custom blockchain 
(hyperledger) application with security enabled.",Blockchain,0
"similarly, deployment is about how to 
set up or install the blockchain system, such as post#: how can i integrate 
etherium or waves platform wallet on my site?",Blockchain,0
"among all the askers of these two types of 
questions, a number of them are in the learning phase and do not have certain tasks.",Blockchain,0
"askers of  question posts declared that they tried to follow the steps provided in the 
tutorials.",Blockchain,0
questions of discussion are related to more general topics.,Blockchain,0
"the askers may 
want to talk about the ideas (e.g., are there already other practical uses for blockchain?",Blockchain,0
"#), understand the mechanisms (e.g., where are chaincodes executed?",Blockchain,0
"#), resolve their puzzles (e.g., bitcoins, how can someone receive much less 
than have spent?",Blockchain,0
"#), or verify their thoughts (e.g., is blockchain a decentralised

"these facts imply that the application of blockchain is still in the 
initial phase.",Blockchain,0
"many developers are confused with the principles of blockchain and many 
developers have set out to work with blockchain.",Blockchain,0
the  types of blockchain relevant question posts.,Blockchain,0
then we evaluate the  types in another perspective.,Blockchain,0
"a question post can be evaluated 
with different metrics.",Blockchain,0
"for example, score measures the quality of the post, viewcount 
measures the number of visitors, and favoritecount measures how many developers mark 
it as favorite.",Blockchain,0

"(#) 
make transactions, receive or send cryptocurrency between accounts transaction 
example post: simple -to- bitcoin transaction with bitcore (#) 
retrieve or query information from blocks, cryptocurrency accounts, addresses, etc.",Blockchain,0
"the question is just what many other developers want to ask; the topic of the question is 
what many other developers concern; the question is related to the jobs what many other 
developers are doing.",Blockchain,0
"in brief, many other developers are interested in the question.",Blockchain,0
"to 
find the types developers interested in, we rank the  types according to the average 
score, viewcount, and favoritecount of posts they involve.",Blockchain,0
"the results are shown in 
figure  (b) – (d).",Blockchain,0
"we note that the three metrics of question posts belonging to contract and protocol 
are all in top ranks.",Blockchain,0
"questions of contract are about how to develop or implement the 
smart contract, that is, to contribute, verify or implement the negotiation or performance 
of the contract.",Blockchain,0
"in brief, they are about the business logics of blockchain, e.g., 
post#: how to destroy tokens/coins in a smart contract?",Blockchain,0
"questions of 
protocol are about how to deal with protocols to make blockchain work correctly.",Blockchain,0
"that is, 
they are about the underlying logics of blockchain, e.g., post#: how exactly to 
make consensus when chaincode has coding block of authority or event?",Blockchain,0
"in general, the 
types that developers are interested in are all related to the operating mechanisms of 
blockchain.",Blockchain,0
there are some implications of the findings.,Blockchain,0
"the official organizations of existing 
blockchain platforms, frameworks, or libraries may provide more manuals, tutorials, or 
books to facilitate the novice developers to handle these techniques.",Blockchain,0
"the practitioners of 
blockchain may write more informal reading materials to make the masses understand the 
fundamental principles of blockchain more easily.",Blockchain,0
"moreover, the blockchain 
communities may set up specialized forums or websites so that the blockchain enthusiasts 
could discuss or exchange their ideas more conveniently.",Blockchain,0
"a. questions about blockchain can be roughly categorized into  types (figure 
).",Blockchain,0
"among them, questions about configuration, deployment, discussion, and 
mechanisms (contract or protocol) of blockchain are notable.",Blockchain,0
the ranks of  types according to different metrics.,Blockchain,0
"blockchain relevant entities detection 
 
tags selection 
in stack overflow, a question post contains up to five tags.",Blockchain,0
"the tags can usually reveal 
the main technologies the question post involves

, and they can usually be identified as 
named entities, e.g., operating systems, apis, and platforms.",Blockchain,0
"therefore, we attempt to 
find commonly used frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques which are relevant to 
blockchain from the tags of the blockchain relevant question posts.",Blockchain,0
"to select blockchain relevant tags, we leverage association rule mining.",Blockchain,0
"generally, if a 
tag frequently appears and only appears in the blockchain relevant question posts, then 
this tag is highly possible to be specialized in blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"there are usually two measures 
of each tag: support indicates the frequency the tag appears in the blockchain relevant 
question posts; confidence represents the proportion of the appearances of the tag in the 
blockchain relevant question posts to the total appearances of this tag.",Blockchain,0
"the common process of association rule mining is to set thresholds for the two 
measures respectively and select the tags whose measures are above the thresholds.",Blockchain,0
"however, blockchain is a relatively new topic in stack overflow and blockchain relevant 
tags may appear very few times, for instance, only one time.",Blockchain,0
"therefore, we set the 
threshold of support to be zero, i.e., all the tags which appear in the blockchain relevant 
question posts are considered, so that more potential blockchain relevant tags can be 
selected.",Blockchain,0
"for confidence, we sort the values of this measure of all the tags in a descending order 
and draw a curve of the sorted values with their ranks.",Blockchain,0
"then we find the knee of the 
curve

.",Blockchain,0
"that is, in the curve, the value decreases steeply before the knee and get smooth 
after the knee.",Blockchain,0
the value at the knee is chosen as the threshold of confidence.,Blockchain,0
"in this way, 
 tags are selected as their measures exceed the corresponding thresholds.",Blockchain,0

for each of the blockchain relevant tag, we check the tag’s descriptions in stack 
overflow to determine what the entity the tag represents.",Blockchain,0
"nevertheless, descriptions of some tags can not be found in stack overflow.",Blockchain,0
"under 
this condition, we search the tag on the internet and check which descriptions are related 
to blockchain.",Blockchain,0

"that means, a unique entity can be 
deduced from the information of the tag which is related to blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"when the entities of all the blockchain relevant tags are identified, the blockchain 
relevant frameworks, tools, libraries, or techniques are clear to us.",Blockchain,0

blockchain explicitly, he described its structure as a chain of hashed timestamps: “each timestamp includes 
the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones 
behind it” (nakamoto, ).",Blockchain,0
"although this approach was later refined for bitcoin, the concept was laid out: 
a chain of blocks, each cryptographically linked to the previous, using a hash digest.",Blockchain,0

that a blockchain is little more than a sequence of records, each hashed and linked to the previous block 
(figure ).",Blockchain,0

"any attempt to “corrupt” the 
blockchain and award more coins in a transaction will fail as the blockchain hashes would have to be

"the first usage of bitcoin dates to january ,  at which point nakamoto created the blockchain

"this leads to one more observation: blockchains form an 
immutable historic record of every transaction from the date of origin in a transparent, decentralized data

"a blockchain gains its secure, immutable nature by combining two innovations: a cryptographic link 
between records that makes changes progressively more difficult the longer the chain is, and the distribution

".. transactions & smart contracts 
a transaction is an exchange of assets that is managed under the entity service’s rules.",Blockchain,0
"such rules are usually 
operationalized through scripting languages (e.g.",Blockchain,0
"bitcoin’s forth) and are used for advanced transactions 
(such as escrow and multi-party signatures) to be performed.",Blockchain,0
"these rules also form the basis for smart 
contracts.",Blockchain,0
"a smart contract is a set of logic rules in the form of a coded script which can be embedded into the 
blockchain to govern a transaction.",Blockchain,0
"the contract is executed autonomously and is used to govern the 
transaction (buterin, ).",Blockchain,0
"in this way, contracts act as smart software agents (stark, ).",Blockchain,0
"once a smart 
contract is embedded in the blockchain, it becomes an autonomous agent that is permanently tamperproof.",Blockchain,0

all parties must have identical copies of the blockchain; but each participant is responsible for verifying it.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain’s decentralization is a core strength, as a copy of the database file is owned by all actors.",Blockchain,0
"in 
order to ensure the integrity of each copy, a consensus algorithm is required.",Blockchain,0

"nakamoto suggested using a proof-of-work approach, in which a 
hard cryptographic puzzle must be solved by miners (nakamoto, ).",Blockchain,0
"miners expend computing resources 
and are rewarded for their efforts using various incentives.",Blockchain,0
"other consensus models such as proof-of-stake, 
proof-of-burn, proof-of-elapsed-time, and proof-of-capacity have been proposed in the literature to overcome 
some of the weaknesses of the original proof-of-work model by attempting to balance fairness and resource

"there are no middlemen; the notion of trust becomes 
implicit as each record in the blockchain is verified by the community which holds multiple copies of the 
blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"by removing trust agents from transactions, blockchain has the ability to disrupt many major 
industries.",Blockchain,0
traditional transaction models rely on central authority to act in the clearinghouse role.,Blockchain,0
"trust is granted 
to the central authority with an expectation that it will remain honest while verifying and clearing 
transactions.",Blockchain,0
the instances of records reside with the authority.,Blockchain,0
"if the central authority is compromised, either 
intentionally (manipulation) or unintentionally (hacked), the interlocutor can wreak extensive havoc on the 
system.",Blockchain,0
"the blockchain model eliminates the central authority (figure ) by instead disseminating copies of 
the records to all parties.",Blockchain,0

"they broadcast 
changes by forming new blocks and requesting validation based on the rules of the consensus model.",Blockchain,0
"once 
validated, the block is added to everyone’s chain.",Blockchain,0
"the process is potentially safer than the traditional model, 
and the middleman agent isn’t required, invoking a disruption to the status quo.",Blockchain,0
"traditional vs blockchain transaction model 
a blockchain relies on mathematics via cryptography to establish independent trust for each transaction, 
and on computationally expensive consensus models to replace central authorities.",Blockchain,0
"pools of recent 
transactions are ordered into a block.",Blockchain,0
"the block is then cryptographically linked to a chain of blocks (the 
blockchain) and is verified through a consensus model that involves significant computing resources 
(mining).",Blockchain,0
"as the blockchain is an open-access file replicated on multiple full-nodes of the network, no one 
entity controls the transaction list.",Blockchain,0
"since each block is hashed and inserted into the chain, it is immutable and 
serves as a final record of past transactions.",Blockchain,0
"an entity cannot change the chain without changing all blocks 
that follow it, an effort which is computationally hard and expensive.",Blockchain,0

necessarily true for a private blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"private blockchains are those used by enterprises to record asset 
transactions within a limited user base (restricted scope).",Blockchain,0
"hybrid blockchains can be visualized as very small 
scale public blockchains; they are decentralized only across a limited participant base.",Blockchain,0
"as a summary, we can formalize the afore-noted features of the blockchain into a list of four core 
characteristics: 
 immutable – (permanent and tamper-proof) a blockchain is a permanent record of transactions.",Blockchain,0
"once a block is added, it cannot be altered.",Blockchain,0
this creates trust in the transaction record.,Blockchain,0

"this mechanism works without the use of a central authority or an explicit  
trust-granting agent.",Blockchain,0
" transparent – (full transaction history) since the blockchain is an open file, any party can access it 
and audit transactions.",Blockchain,0
"this creates provenance under which asset lifetimes can be tracked. 
. towards a definition 
there are many different blockchain definitions offered, ranging from application-specific to the excessively 
technical.",Blockchain,0
"for example, coinbase, the  world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, defines blockchain as “a
distributed, public ledger that contains the history of every bitcoin transaction” (coinbase, ).",Blockchain,0
"as an 
application-specific definition, this characterization does not account for the fact that blockchains can be 
reused for other cryptocurrencies and industry applications independently.",Blockchain,0
"the oxford english dictionary 
broadens the definition somewhat, defining blockchain as “a digital ledger in which transactions made in 
bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly” (oxford dictionaries, ).",Blockchain,0
"this definition also falls short as blockchain technology can be used independently of bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies.",Blockchain,0
"both these definitions also highlight the role of a blockchain as a digital ledger, and much 
of the literature would agree with this.",Blockchain,0
"however, this domain is evolving rapidly, and ledger usage is simply 
a feature of the blockchain but not its essence.",Blockchain,0
"this feature only pertains to blockchain applications that focus 
on managing the exchange of value in the case of virtual assets.",Blockchain,0
"a somewhat broader definition is offered by webopedia where a blockchain is defined as “a type of data 
structure that enables identifying and tracking transactions digitally and sharing this information across a 
distributed network of computers, creating in a sense a distributed trust network.",Blockchain,0
"the distributed ledger 
technology offered by blockchain provides a transparent and secure means for tracking the ownership and 
transfer of assets” (stroud, ).",Blockchain,0
"while this definition succeeds in capturing more of the characteristics of 
blockchain, it highlights distribution as a key feature of blockchain computing without acknowledging that

"the key distinction here is that while a distributed system partitions work among participants 
in an optimal fashion, a blockchain requires that each and every participant maintain a full node of the system 
and enforce its rules independently.",Blockchain,0
"in a system where nodes operate on local information (decision locality) 
to accomplish goals rather than the result of a central ordering influence, this decentralization ensures that 
pulling the plug is near impossible – only one node needs to remain operational for the network to function.",Blockchain,0
"evidently, there is a need for a clear and concise definition of blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"based on the theoretical 
underpinnings of blockchain technology outlined in the previous sections, we provide the following 
definition of a blockchain:  
“a decentralized database containing sequential, cryptographically linked blocks of digitally signed

potential blockchain applications and services have been envisioned and discussed by industry pundits and 
technology research firms (cbinsights, ; mougayar, ).",Blockchain,0
"these elements constitute the crux of blockchain business applications by 
facilitating the creation, management and transfer of digital assets through automated validation rules, 
cryptographically verified rights and ownerships, and the validation of transactions without requiring 
intermediaries.",Blockchain,0
"using a blockchain platform implies that each of these six elements is programmable, and by 
disintermediating these facets, blockchains can enable new services to come to market with cheaper 
transaction fees and faster execution.",Blockchain,0
"in this way, blockchain technology is poised to disrupt many business 
models which rely on (often costly) intermediaries.",Blockchain,0
"mougayar () also classifies the role of blockchains as spanning four aspects: blockchain as a 
development platform; blockchain as a smart contract utility; blockchain as a marketplace, and finally, 
blockchain as a trusted service application (rosic, ).",Blockchain,0
"these potential roles are discussed herewith.

"blockchain as a smart contract utility 
smart contracts provide a programmatic interface to blockchains.",Blockchain,0

able to perform useful functions to create, maintain or augment the value of digital assets” (sorin et al.,

functionality can be observed in the example of visa and docusign who have partnered to operate a

online workforce marketplaces in the context of the gig economy that relies on independent contract workers 
and freelancers for short-term engagements, and the shared economy where consumers increasingly become 
prosumers.",Blockchain,0
"in such instances, blockchain platforms can ensure that service providers are not constrained by 
any central authority – hence, allowing them to extend flexible offerings, and payment interactions and 
service transactions can function in a transparent environment (aitken, ).",Blockchain,0
"overall, as a marketplace enabler, blockchains can be used to operationalize programmable assets, 
ownership and money. 
. trusted-service application 
finally, in its role as a trusted service application, blockchain technology comprises end-to-end functionality 
by facilitating highly specialized applications for any purpose imaginable.",Blockchain,0
"this more generalized use of 
blockchains to enable all types of applications through a combination of programmable assets, trust, 
ownership, money, identity, and contracts is sometimes referred to as blockchain .",Blockchain,0
"on the front-end, trusted service applications built on the blockchain using smart contracts can 
provide disintermediated, secure services to end users.",Blockchain,0
"on the backend, many of these applications reside on 
public blockchains (e.g.",Blockchain,0

"given the alternating
views, it is interesting to consider deloitte’s () four scenarios (figure ) on how blockchain
could develop in future along what deloitte considers to be two key variables: “trust in the

conclusions for the future of blockchain in banking.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain-ed opportunities in banking
.",Blockchain,0
"a better way to know your customer (kyc)
verifying the authenticity of consumer identities is a frequent and important task for banks ow-
ing to anti money laundering regulations (sarnitz and maier, ).",Blockchain,0
"given the ever increasing
problems of terrorism, kyc is a crucial aspect related to the prevention of criminal use of bank-
ing funds and services in the form of money laundering and terrorism (marr, ).",Blockchain,0
"however,
kyc also represents a significant cost for banks with thomson reuters () estimating that
financial institutions spend between  million -  million usd per annum to keep up with
kyc.",Blockchain,0
"therefore, the current kyc processes are not only expensive, but also inefficient and
feeds towards poor customer experience for banks (walker, ).",Blockchain,0
"in addition, th eu money
laundering directive requires consumer data to be monitored and constantly updated (wolos,
) whilst the general data protection regulation (gdpr) requires strict internal controls
pertaining to consumer security (walker, ).",Blockchain,0
"as such, blockchain technology, if implemented correctly for kyc can be extremely useful.",Blockchain,0
"this is because, the use of blockchain technology can do away with the need for filling out endless
kyc questionnaires when opening a bank account (sarnitz and maier, ).",Blockchain,0
"an example of a
blockchain based kyc process in banking is demonstrated via figure .",Blockchain,0
"figure : an example of a blockchain based kyc process (persistent systems, ).",Blockchain,0
"as lang (a) states, blockchain can enable banks to share customer information across
their company securely and thereby simplify the administrative process by reducing unnecessary
duplication of information and requests.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain helps cut down on duplication as it can allow
the independent verification of one client by one bank to be accessed by other banks (marr,
).",Blockchain,0
"standardized sharing of customer account opening information using blockchain creates
a single non-editable kyc record further demonstrating compliance with regulations (walker,
).",Blockchain,0
"to this end, recently, several banks completed a kyc app test on the r blockchain
platform (partz, b) whilst a major polish bank, pko bp started using a blockchain-based
document management system earlier this year (biggs, ).",Blockchain,0
"yet another emerging trend is the
increasing importance of inclusivity across sectors.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain technology could also be a means
of enhancing inclusivity in banking as consumers who do not have a credit score can create
a verifiable, decentralised, self-sovereign digital identity and thereby gain access to banking
services (garcia, a).",Blockchain,0
"as luu () asserts, efforts to kyc are more important today than
ever before as decentralization of cryptocurrencies opens it up to the risk of money laundering
and terrorism financing.
. improved transaction speeds
you thought digital payments were fast?",Blockchain,0
"the use of blockchain technology can enable banks
to speed up the time to settlement through the certainty it provides by enabling individuals
and corporations to transact directly and view the same ledger of transactions updated through
consensus and made immutable through cryptography (lang, a).",Blockchain,0
"in fact, tapscott and
tapscott () notes that settlement times can be cut down to minutes or seconds via blockchain
technology whilst ho () alerts us of the possibility of processing bank transaction /.",Blockchain,0
"decentralising via blockchain speeds transactions further as it can enable buyers and sellers
to deal forex in real time in addition to doing away with the need for intermediaries for processing
transactions (hillsberg, ).",Blockchain,0
"moreover, traditional banking practices and local banking stan-
dards dictate various necessities for financing which results in significant delays in completing a
single transaction (lowry, ).",Blockchain,0
"blockchain allows trade partners to interact with greater trust
by using a shared version of the truth about transactions in real-time and thereby increasing
efficiency with regard to access to funding and saving time throughout the trade process (smith
a; lang a).",Blockchain,0
"companies like ripple ( are completing cross-border payments today

in seconds (sarwar, ) but swift is competing rapidly without blockchain technology by
showing that nearly % of gpi payments are credited to end beneficiaries within  minutes,
and almost % of payments within  hours (wass, ).",Blockchain,0
"as the average transaction rates
have reached  to  transactions per second (tps) for blockchain technologies, miyamae
et al.",Blockchain,0
"() proposed a more efficient application programming interface between containers and
achieved a transaction rate improvement by %.",Blockchain,0
"asian banks are also exploiting blockchain
with banks in india turning to blockchain to speed up internal trade deals (satija and antony,
).",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, mitsubishi ufj financial from tokyo is to launch a  million transactions
per second blockchain payment platform in  (asia times, ) whilst more recently, taka-
hashi () noted that liqueneqs blockchain bank payments scales to millions of transactions
per second for both commercial and consumer purposes.",Blockchain,0
"however, not all authors agree that blockchain will be the answer to improved transaction
speeds.",Blockchain,0
"for example, marr () highlights that the complex, encryption based and distributed
nature of blockchain transactions can take a considerable amount of time to process when com-
pared to traditional payment systems, and therefore requires more advances in engineering and
processing speeds which leads to several challenges which are considered later on.
. enhanced security
security is of paramount importance to the banking industry.",Blockchain,0
"as tapscott and tapscott ()
stated, % of financial intermediaries are experiencing economic crimes in comparison to the
% and % for the professional services and technology sectors.",Blockchain,0
"therefore, applying blockchain
for extra sense of security is a critical component of the future digital banking model (maiya,
).",Blockchain,0
"blockchain can offer enhanced security for banking data as historical information cannot
be altered and the new information which is added in real-time is essentially shared by multiple
entities and thus making it difficult to manipulate the data (garcia, b; harsono ).",Blockchain,0
"as
patel () points out, any alterations to data within a block can be tracked and monitored
to prevent fraud and misuse and more importantly blockchain technology allows for real-time
communication and updating on potential scams (patel, ).",Blockchain,0
"blockchain is also affecting the antecedents of trust including confidence, integrity, reliabil-
ity, responsibility and predictability (beck, ).",Blockchain,0
"the transparency in blockchain’s distributed
ledger is also useful as it would enable regulators to easily scrutinize financial actions (tap-
scott and tapscott, ).",Blockchain,0
"as a trust network, consumer data stored via blockchain can only
be accessed by trusted sources in addition to the data security attainable via the encryption
capabilities of blockchain (patel, ).",Blockchain,0
"blockchain can also achieve simultaneous security and
privacy by enabling confidentiality through “public key infrastructure” and by maintaining the
size of a ledger (schou-zibell and phair, ).",Blockchain,0
"since the  financial crisis, there has been a surge in the importance of risk management
and the development of risk management capability (silva et al., ).",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, loan asset
integrity is identified as a major problem leading to the  financial crisis (moore, ).",Blockchain,0
"to this end, the adoption of blockchain in banking can enable low risk credit transactions.",Blockchain,0
"for example,the global debt registry ( is evaluating
the use of blockchains to ensure the integrity of loan assets and protect pledged assets on the
network from errors or misrepresentation in the future (moore, ).",Blockchain,0
"assets can be placed
on the decentralized ledger which will generate an immutable record of each asset, enabling all
participants in the lending ecosystem to trust and be certain they are looking at the same loan
data (moore, ; tapscott and tapscott, ).",Blockchain,0
fraud reduction is another form of enhanced security offered by blockchain technology.,Blockchain,0
"risk.net () recognised fraud as one of the top operational risks in  whilst pwc ()
notes that % of financial intermediaries suffer from economic crimes each year.",Blockchain,0
"the centralised
nature of banking systems make it more vulnerable to cyber attacks as it has one point of failure,
unlike with blockchains which are less susceptible to fraud as each block contains a timestamp
and holds batches of individual transactions with a link to a previous block (marr, ).",Blockchain,0
"in
india, there is an interest in evaluating whether blockchain technology can be a means of stop-
ping bank frauds (d’souza, ).",Blockchain,0
"as mauri (a) asserts, the distributed, immutable and
permissioned nature of blockchain will help prevent fraud.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, chiles santiago exchange
plans to use blockchain to technology to reduce errors and possible fraud in its short selling
system for securities lending (mauri, b).",Blockchain,0
"in addition, the uae’s emirates islamic was the
first islamic bank to adopt blockchain technology to issue new cheque books as a means of fraud
prevention (lyon, ) whilst the bank of thailand too is considering blockchains as a means
of fraud reduction (yakubowski, ).",Blockchain,0
"the recent facebook data scandal has heightened the
case for data privacy and blockchain can support this process as data can only be shared or sold
with the consent of the individual (garcia, a).",Blockchain,0
"technology giants such as microsoft ()
are also researching into developing ‘corda’ an enterprise-grade ledger that enables banks to
limit who sees what information and selectively share data with only relevant parties as a means
of reducing the risk of fraud.",Blockchain,0
"they also envision their efforts can lead to reducing many other
forms of banking risks in future.",Blockchain,0
"nevertheless, it is noteworthy that whilst many authors harp on the immutable nature
of blockchains, schou-zibell and phair () note that blockchains are technically prone to
modification.",Blockchain,0
"as such, the challenges pertaining to the security aspect of blockchain are dis-
cussed further in what follows.",Blockchain,0
"nevertheless, security expert frank abagnale is of the view that
blockchain is the future of secure information processing and data settlement (marinova, )
and english () notes that while blockchain is not immune to all forms of cyber risk, its
unique structure provides security capabilities not present in other legacy technologies.",Blockchain,0
"this is
because, the distributed nature and computing power required to make changes renders modi-
fication nearly impossible.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, altering a blockchain requires control of more than % of
computers in the same distributed ledger and alteration of all of the transactional records within
 minutes for bitcoin (schou-zibell and phair, ).",Blockchain,0
"those interested in more insights into
how blockchain is impacting the security landscape in banking are referred to gupta ().
. cost reductions
economics will always play an influential role in the adoption of technology, and its no different
when it comes to blockchain technology.",Blockchain,0
"the banking sector will have to consider a cost/benefit
analysis to determine the feasibility of implementing blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"first and foremost, the en-
hanced trust made possible by blockchain can reduce friction that comprises all kinds of direct
and indirect costs and efforts due to the lack of trust, and bring certainty via transaction logic
instantiated as code (beck, ).",Blockchain,0
"() summarized that the permission-less
and non-territorial features of blockchain can significantly reduce the institutional exit costs.",Blockchain,0
"in
brief, accenture () concluded that blockchain can result in dramatic costs savings for bank-
ing along the lines of  billion usd whilst a  goldman sachs report (as cited by garcia
(b)) suggests that blockchain technology could save financial institutions between  and 
billion usd per annum via reductions to the number of mistakes that result in fees and higher
operating costs.",Blockchain,0
"according to santander, blockchain-based solutions could generate cost savings
of up to  billion usd per annum (meola, ).",Blockchain,0
"in addition, settlement periods resulting from traditional banking processes cost the financial

industry between - billion usd per annum and blockchain has the potential to reduce or
even eliminate settlement times (harsono, ).",Blockchain,0
"further cost reductions are made possible by
doing away with the need for intermediaries (marr, ) and their associated charges when
completing bank transactions in a world where global enterprises could pay up to usd for an
international transaction (hillsberg, ).",Blockchain,0
"the ability to share information openly across banks
via the blockchain system would also significantly reduce administrative costs for compliance
departments (marr, ).",Blockchain,0
"those interested in a more detailed discussion on cost savings from
blockchain for banking are referred to cocco et al.",Blockchain,0
"(), and nguyen () for an outlook
from the sustainable development perspective.",Blockchain,0
"below, some practical examples of cost reductions
made possibly by blockchain are presented.",Blockchain,0
"ibm’s blockchain app store (ledgerconnect) is a sound example of how blockchain can
help reduce back-end costs for banks by providing financial companies access to seven vetted
blockchain vendors enabling banks to streamline their trading processes and back-end opera-
tions by establishing one set of records (garcia, b).",Blockchain,0
"there is also evidence that the icici
bank and emirates nbd are researching into the use of blockchain technology for reducing
transactional costs (higgins, ).",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, banks can reduce infrastructure costs by %
using blockchain technology, which translates into savings of - billion usd annually (ngo,
).",Blockchain,0
"finally, the central bank of india estimates cost reductions between - billion usd
by  via the use of blockchain for interbank transactions (richter, ).",Blockchain,0
"banks can also seek
to integrate fintechs as service providers and this will prevent costly interaction efforts (drasch
et al., ).",Blockchain,0
"therefore, it is evident that significant cost reductions are attainable through
the adoption of blockchain technology, however, the challenges around investments required for
setting up the systems are discussed later on.
. smart contracts
contracts are complex and time consuming affairs in the financial world.",Blockchain,0
"blockchains can be used
to create smart contracts by programming and storing a computer code that can be executed
to create contracts or authorise financial transactions once two or more parties enter their keys
and meet a certain set criteria (marr, ).",Blockchain,0
"figure  below summarises the process underlying
smart contracts.",Blockchain,0
"the accenture technology vision () report found % of all surveyed
executives believing that blockchain and smart contracts would be critical over the next three
decades.",Blockchain,0
"figure : smart contracts simplified (institute of international finance, ).",Blockchain,0
there is evidence of the banking sector already exploiting smart contracts.,Blockchain,0
"for example, gat-

teschi et al.",Blockchain,0
"() has systematically analyzed the implementations of blockchain based smart
contracts in insurance and finance.",Blockchain,0
"furthermore, a smart contract for travel insurance and au-
tomatically issuing refunding was developed based on the ethereum blockchain by bertani et al.",Blockchain,0
"() whilst the commonwealth bank of australia exploited smart contracts with blockchain
technology to monitor and track the shipment of  tonnes of almonds (mittal, ).",Blockchain,0
"however,
as sarnitz and maier () argue, smart contracts could make the role of banks in contract
management redundant in future.",Blockchain,0
"thus, banks must look into ways in which it can exploit smart
contracts and the related technology to its benefit and one such option would be to become the
provider of the said facility.",Blockchain,0
"those interested in more details around blockchains and smart
contracts are referred to alharby and van moorsel ().
. more transactions with more transparency
as it stands, there is considerable disagreement within the banking industry with regard to the
transaction capacity of blockchain technology.",Blockchain,0
"as a result, this issue is both an opportunity
and challenge (discussed later on).",Blockchain,0
"currently, visa’s transaction capacity is at , tps,
but research and development into ethereum’s plasma multi-child-chain solution blockchain
technology has the potential to enable  million tps (cook, a).",Blockchain,0
"in addition, japans mit-
subishi ufj financial group (mufg) is also competing with ethereum by researching into a
blockchain-based financial-transaction solution capable of conducting over  million tps (cook,
a).",Blockchain,0
"more recently, the south africa reserve bank used blockchain technology to settle the
country’s typical , daily payment transactions within two hours (average settlement rate
of - seconds per transaction) while preserving full anonymity (zhao, a).",Blockchain,0
"transparency is an increasingly important consideration along side the increase in transaction
capacities.",Blockchain,0
"whilst the traditional banking system is extremely secretive, blockchain technology
presents means of making the entire banking process more transparent and secure as it locks
records and then enables users to access the full historical data with possibilities of giving
authorised parties only access to shared transaction ledgers (hillsberg, ).",Blockchain,0
"moreover, any
changes made to public blockchains are publicly viewable by all parties (ho, ).",Blockchain,0
"in fact,
as tapscott and tapscott () asserts, blockchain technology can lower or even eliminate
the need for trust in transactions and make auditing transparent and real-time.",Blockchain,0
"it is also
promising for automating financial reporting (collomb and sok, ) and the transparent
nature of blockchain allows banks and regulators to communicate in real-time and enables swift
action when compliance violations take place (patel, ).",Blockchain,0
"blockchain-ed challenges in banking
.",Blockchain,0
"costs and standardization requirements
developing a blockchain enabled system is a high cost affair, and if the banking industry is
to make the most of the system, then it should be standardized across banks (walker, ).",Blockchain,0
"for example, for kyc information to be usefully shared across the banking industry, a common
policy on identification and verification of consumers is mandatory (walker, ).",Blockchain,0
"as clarence-
smith () asserts, kyc blockchain-based registries are unlikely to get buy-in from all banks
because of their wariness about relying completely on third party verifications of data.",Blockchain,0
"as it stands, each bitcoin transaction costs about .",Blockchain,0
"usd and can only store  bytes of
data (bauerle, ).",Blockchain,0
"the lack of harmonized industry standards (schou-zibell and phair, ),
unless addressed, will be a major hindrance to the adoption and development of blockchain in

banking.",Blockchain,0
"bech and garratt () proposed the money flower taxonomy of money, where the
central bank creates its own cryptocurrency.",Blockchain,0
"to this end, the bank of canada is validating the
implementation of a digital currency cad-coin for the use of interbank transfers (iansiti and
lakhani, ).",Blockchain,0
another concern is the energy cost required to power blockchain algorithms.,Blockchain,0
"if we take
bitcoin as an example, galeon () pointed out that the energy required to mine bitcoin is
equivalent to more energy than what  countries consume in a year.",Blockchain,0
"in fact, if cryptocurrencies
were to grow to % of global money supply, it is estimated that the processing would require
% of the energy consumed by china (caplen, ).",Blockchain,0
"moreover, as a result of electricity costs,
the single transaction cost for bitcoin can vary between - usd (bloomberg, ).",Blockchain,0
"the cost of storage is yet another growing concern for blockchain technology in banking
with some estimating that the long-term storage cost per gigabyte for a bitcoin node will exceed
 million usd or more (bloomberg, ).",Blockchain,0
"there is also a cost in terms of lost revenue for
banks.",Blockchain,0
"this is because blockchain technology threatens the livelihood of middlemen and banks
make huge profits playing this role (marr, ).",Blockchain,0
"however, to support the wide adoption of
blockchain, e-identity validation services will be crucial, for which, the banks may still be able
to take significant role as a trusted organization (buitenhek, ).",Blockchain,0
"therefore, the question
remains as to whether the cost reductions from adopting blockchain technology can in fact
outweigh the operating costs of maintaining same.
. currency stability
bankers are not open to the use of bitcoin as a currency (hillsberg, ).",Blockchain,0
"one major concern
for the adoption of blockchain payments in banking is the stability of the underlying currency,
especially as the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile (luu, ).",Blockchain,0
"currency stability
is crucial for ensuring that neither the buyer nor the seller loses out in trade due to price
fluctuations (lund, ).",Blockchain,0
"instead of regular crytocurrencies, lund () suggests a ‘stable coin’ which is basically a
digital token that will have low price volatility as a result of being pegged to some underlying
fiat currency, thereby acting as a store of value, a medium of exchange and unit of accounting
for blockchain payments.",Blockchain,0
"an example of a stable coin is stronghold usd (corradino, )
which is backed by usd deposits and is currently undergoing research and development at ibm
as a credible token for blockchain payments (lund, ).",Blockchain,0
"another example is the digital coin
called utility settlement coin backed by six of the world’s largest banks with the aim of allowing
financial groups to pay each other or to buy securities without waiting for traditional money
transfers to be completed (arnold, ; harsono, ).
. security
the security element features as both an opportunity and challenge for the adoption of blockchain
in banking.",Blockchain,0
it is no secret that banking requires high security.,Blockchain,0
"historically, banks had to only
be concerned with protecting their safes and deposits in high street banks.",Blockchain,0
"the move to online
banking saw the emergence of a new security threat from hackers around the globe, thus cre-
ating a job market for cyber security and increased costs for banks.",Blockchain,0
"in the recent past, cyber
attacks have resulted in losses of  million usd in the banking sector and therefore, banks
are cautious with regard to letting its financial data sit outside their secure firewall (hillsberg,
).",Blockchain,0
"as a security measure, miners can verify daily records in the blockchain, but given that trans-
actions are irreversible, manual data entry errors can prove extremely problematic (hillsberg,

).",Blockchain,0
"satoshi nakamoto highlighted the ‘% attack’ which means if half of the computers
working as nodes to service the network tell a lie, the lie will become the truth (bauerle, ).",Blockchain,0
"data privacy too remains a concern within blockchain technology as transactions can be seen
throughout network nodes which produce meta data leading to pattern recognition (schou-zibell
and phair, ).",Blockchain,0
"however, “self-sovereign identity” which allows consumers to control personal
information and have better control over with whom they share it is an emerging solution to
the privacy concerns (schou-zibell and phair, ).",Blockchain,0
"also, it is noteworthy that blockchains are
more secure than a centralised system in many ways (schou-zibell and phair, ).",Blockchain,0
another security challenge posed by blockchain is anonymity.,Blockchain,0
"as blockchain technology al-
lows for anonymity, such untraceable transactions would threaten the banking sector and the
regulator as it increases the difficulty to tax and can also aid criminals with money laundering
(cook, a).",Blockchain,0
"for retaining privacy to its maximum extent, there are cryptographic techniques
like zero knowledge proofs, which allows the block verification and transaction correctness with-
out providing visibility into the details of the transactions (eyal, ).",Blockchain,0
"as a possible solution,
more countries are moving towards crypto and initial coin offering (ico) legislation (cook,
b; cook a).
. legislation & regulations
in an early review by guo and liang (), the authors addressed the significance of es-
tablishing a regulatory sandbox, so that the implementation and operation of blockchain will
have a restricted scope and still maintain sufficient space for innovation.",Blockchain,0
"red tapes associated
with central bank rules and bank secrecy regulations are adversely impacting the adoption of
blockchain in banking with government intervention likely to be blocked further by lobbyists
battling against this disruption (hillsberg, ).",Blockchain,0
"the general data protection regulation
(gdpr) and other privacy laws too hinder the full exploitation of blockchain technology in
banking.",Blockchain,0
"a recent report suggests that regulators are now working with banks to develop more
blockchain friendly regulatory frameworks (kocianski, ) whilst other authors are urging
central banks to start adapting to blockchain technology (thew, ).",Blockchain,0
"however, as iansiti
and lakhani () stated, every party of monetary transactions will be required to adopt it,
which challenges the government and institutions that have been overseeing and managing these
transactions for a long time.
. scalability
it is agreed that as it stands, blockchain has very limited transaction capacity (caplen, ).",Blockchain,0
"in
fact, limited scalability is one of the serious concerns underlying blockchain technology (schou-
zibell and phair, ).",Blockchain,0
"bitcoin was built to be decentralized and secure at the expense of
scalability (tomaino, ).",Blockchain,0
"this is formally referred to as the “scalability trilemma” in which
only two of three properties decentralization, security or scalability can be attained (schou-
zibell and phair, ).",Blockchain,0
"therefore, more research and development is required for enhancing
the scalability of the blockchain technology to process more transactions than visa for a start.",Blockchain,0
"there is also disagreement between the actual scalability of blockchains as thew ()
states, currently, the bitcoin blockchain can only process  tps whilst caplen () states
bitcoin can process only - tps in relation to visa’s  transactions per second.",Blockchain,0
"furthermore,
some central banks like de nederlandsche bank is of the view that distributed ledger technology
is not suitable for existing financial payment infrastructure owing to scalability restrictions for
large volumes of transactions (zhao, b).",Blockchain,0
"therefore, the scalability issues, when coupled with

the energy concerns, suggests that blockchain is more suited to wholesale banking solutions than
the mass market (caplen, ).",Blockchain,0
"discussion
the big data trend keeps getting bigger and blockchain will further add to increasing the size of
big data in banking, as well as influencing the exchanging or trading platform for big data (chen
and xue, ).",Blockchain,0
"therefore, any blockchains used in the banking sector will need the software
and infrastructure to handle big data as never seen before (marr, ).",Blockchain,0
"whilst blockchains are
likely to result in more structured big data, the analysis would have to overcome significant issues
pertaining to increased signal and noise ratios which are already a problem in pre-blockchain
era big data (hassani and silva, ).",Blockchain,0
"this in turn means that investments into research and development of denoising and signal
extraction in big data is likely to be a worthwhile investment for the banking sector.",Blockchain,0
"as an
example, we consider the number of bitcoin transactions added to the mempool per second
( as a proxy for banking
blockchain transactions in future.",Blockchain,0
"this is a reasonable assumption given that the entire globe
could be transacting on blockchain in future should the banking industry exploit the opportuni-
ties and overcome the aforementioned challenges.",Blockchain,0
"the proxy time series captures data for 
seconds from th july  to nd august  and is represented via the first time series
in figure .",Blockchain,0
"here, we rely on a filtering and forecasting technique called singular spectrum
analysis (see, hassani and silva (), silva et al.",Blockchain,0
"while the “disruptive” potential of blockchain has been extensively debated, scientific studies about 
the impact on business processes and professional practices remain scarce (weber, et al., ) and 
the development of business models remain primarily associated to the financial sector (e.g.",Blockchain,0
"for the 
first semester of  the global investment in fintech companies – across venture capital, private 
equity and mergers and acquisitions - hits $.",Blockchain,0
"billion which is well above ’s total investment 
results (kpmg, )).",Blockchain,0
"thus, the academic and professional literature mainly presents two kinds of 
contributions about blockchain:  
i) advantages and pitfalls of blockchain technology both from a technical and business perspective; 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
and  
ii) business applications mainly focusing on cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and traceability at 
large.",Blockchain,0
"in this context, compliance, control, and audit activities have been neglected in the academic and 
scientific community in analyzing their developments or proposing new business processes and 
services.",Blockchain,0
"the purpose of this study is to explore the perception of financial auditors and information systems 
(is) auditors working in audit firms of different size in switzerland on how the use of blockchain 
technology could impact practices in the audit profession.",Blockchain,0
"the innovative point of this study can be tied to the focus on the audit profession and more 
specifically on the view of professionals in practice regarding the potential impacts of blockchain 
technology on their daily work and profession as this sector is currently under-researched despite the 
significant disruptive potential.",Blockchain,0
the next section reviews the literature and related work.,Blockchain,0
"section two describes the research 
methodology.",Blockchain,0
the research results and discussion are presented in section three.,Blockchain,0
"section four 
concludes the paper with current and future work.",Blockchain,0
"i. literature review 
    blockchain technology is a distributed data structure, or ledger, in which transactions are recorded 
in append-only mode and verified through consensus algorithms (erbguth and morin, ).",Blockchain,0
"in other 
words, it is “a distributed general ledger recording that a transaction happened, when it happened and 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
that it happened correctly, without exposing any confidential details about the subject or the parties’ 
involved” and consists of a software protocol of its own (kehoe, et al., ).",Blockchain,0
"blockchain technology also offers users the feature to make transactions irrevocable (immutability) 
thus increasing accuracy and trustworthiness of records (lemieux, ; wespra, ) while at the 
same time simplifying back office processes.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain makes it possible to tie a set of rules or 
procedures to specific transactions to standardize process activities.",Blockchain,0
"from a conceptual perspective, blockchain technology provides a series of features, which can 
revolutionize some of the existing architectures in the digital business world.",Blockchain,0
"this transparent 
distributed database records each network’s user intervention and allows encoding rules and 
procedures within the platform at the transaction level.",Blockchain,0
"it allows business enterprises to create and run 
applications as well as conduct business without a central authority or server as a control point (trusted 
third parties).",Blockchain,0
"in this regard, blockchain technology helps businesses craft applications and conduct 
transactions, which can be self-executing and autonomous at the same time (dupont and maurer, 
).",Blockchain,0
"the autonomous, decentralized and secured capabilities characterizing blockchain technology 
can help in redefining the foundational patterns of business applications (schatsky and muraskin, 
; swan, ; mahajan et al., ).",Blockchain,0
"in today’s business ecosystem, financial auditors are the trusted professionals who guarantee the 
existence of transactions, attest of their evidence, accuracy, and completeness as well as the 
presentation of related information in financial statements (hayes et al., ).",Blockchain,0
"in order to fulfill these 
objectives, the auditors need a good understanding of the client business, it infrastructure and it 
systems relevant to financial reporting and controls in place.",Blockchain,0
"in order to do so, the international 
standards on auditing (ias) allows them to team up with is auditors to gather and interpret evidence 
(axelsen, et al., ; ias , ).",Blockchain,0
"in other 
words, is auditors evaluate the design and effectiveness of an organization’s it systems and internal 
controls against policies and regulations.",Blockchain,0
"audit and control functions have been mainly established to provide assurance to shareholders, 
regulators, governments and other stakeholders.",Blockchain,0
"all types of audits (financial, operational, compliance, 
governance, etc.)",Blockchain,0
"share the same characteristics and consist of systematic processes “of objectively 
obtaining and evaluating evidence regarding assertions about economic actions and events to ascertain 
the degree of correspondence between these assertions and established criteria and communicating the 
results to interested users.” (hayes et al., ).",Blockchain,0
"an audit ultimately aims at providing trust among its 
intended public.",Blockchain,0
"for example, the purpose of a financial audit is to enhance the degree of confidence 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
of financial statements readers (ifac  revised, ).",Blockchain,0
"spoke m., a senior consultant at deloitte 
canada, stresses that an audit is an opinion provided on the financial statements of companies based 
on pre-determined accounting guidelines.",Blockchain,0
"however, after scandals such as enron in  among the most notable, the global audit industry 
has lost its principal asset; public trust (spoke, ).",Blockchain,0
"this is highlighted by the literature which shows 
that trust in audit has been undermined due to scandals and is still in a recovery process within the 
public (mueller, carter and whittle, ; fearnley, beattie and brandt ; zabihollah, ).",Blockchain,0
"as a response to rebuild this trust, new regulations as well as accounting and auditing standards 
have been imposed, adding complexity, and increasing the cost of control activities and reporting for 
companies.",Blockchain,0
"those features could not only decrease the accounting, 
auditing and compliance costs but also transform and facilitate the work of auditors (spoke, ).",Blockchain,0
"it 
is clear that such technology can enable more efficient access to data and completion of financial audit.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, the fact that any asset or document can be codified and referenced or encapsulated by a ledger 
entry helps simplify the work of auditors and accounting professionals (schatsky and muraskin, ), 
and reduce the manual work (drane, ) while at the same time help to ensure complete transaction 
traceability.",Blockchain,0
"large international audit firms themselves foresee that the cost and time necessary to conduct an 
audit would decline considerably (allison, ; tysiac, ).",Blockchain,0
"it seems therefore reasonable to expect 
a significant increase in the commoditization of financial audit services (anderson, ) and a 
decrease of audit costs.",Blockchain,0
"kpmg llp and microsoft reported a partnership to 
create a series of innovation workspaces and other initiatives dedicated to developing use cases and 
applications of blockchain technology (alarcon, ).",Blockchain,0
"and pwc also created its 
global blockchain team and set up a blockchain experience lab that works in co-creation with 
industry experts.",Blockchain,0
"blockchain is also expected to reduce reliance on auditing for testing financial transactions 
providing an “automated third-party verification” (spoke, ).",Blockchain,0
"this could ultimately lead to the 
elimination of control and audit activities or at the least to a profound redefinition of those professions.",Blockchain,0
"for example, access could be granted to auditors and regulators, providing a “single source of the 
truth” (roberts, ) and allow for real time audit (macmanus, ).. another example is the 
confirmation process that could be eliminated from the auditors’ review process; especially 
confirmation of outstanding receivable and payable balances.",Blockchain,0
"however, even though blockchain technology offers many different features and seems to be 
secured, there are several existing challenges that need to be addressed.",Blockchain,0
"one major issue is 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
interoperability.",Blockchain,0
"interoperability is defined by the francophone association of free software users as 
“a characteristic of a product or system, whose interfaces are completely understood, to work with 
other products or systems, present or future, in either implementation or access, without any 
restrictions”.",Blockchain,0
"as of today, even though multiple blockchain projects have been set up and some of them 
are even well established, such as bitcoin and ethereum, there are still interoperability issues among 
blockchain infrastructures.",Blockchain,0
"are currently being addressed by several erp vendors and technology 
companies (kacina, et al., ).",Blockchain,0
these systems are widely used across all industries nowadays.,Blockchain,0
"lastly, 
blockchain’s benefits are best realized when different industry participants come together to create a 
shared platform which increases interoperability challenges at two levels (pwc, ), first at the 
technical level as each participant’s systems need to be compatible with the shared blockchain and 
second at the blockchain governance level as each participant needs to agree on the shared network 
rules.",Blockchain,0
another key issue is the blockchain scalability.,Blockchain,0
"scalability is the ability for a system to continue to 
function well when it changes in size or volume - typically, to a larger size or volume (rouse, ).",Blockchain,0
"in the blockchain context the scalability issue arises when the number of participants increases over 
time.",Blockchain,0
"scalability has several components: latency, which is the “time for a transaction to confirm” 
(croman, ).",Blockchain,0
"as of today, latency takes at least  minutes with the blockchain bitcoin, and  
seconds for ethereum which is significantly more than current payment processing systems is.",Blockchain,0
"moreover,  % of transactions on public blockchains exceed  minutes, and  percent can exceed 
an hour (kanaracus, ; harris, ).",Blockchain,0
"potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
    size and storage are other important scalability components that need to be worked on.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, by 
design, the ledger of a blockchain contains all the transactions since the genesis block.",Blockchain,0
"thus, as the 
number of users and transactions grow, the size of the ledger also grows.",Blockchain,0
"bandwidth is also important as transactions need to be relayed through the network prior to being 
validated through consensus algorithm.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, when the number of users increases and consequently 
the number of transaction increases, a better network connectivity is necessary.",Blockchain,0
"good network 
connectivity and large storage capacity require effective record management leading to centralization, 
increased costs (harris, ), and more energy consumption.",Blockchain,0
"the last component of scalability is throughput referring to the maximal rate at which the network 
can work properly (i.e.",Blockchain,0
"transmit, receive and validate transactions).",Blockchain,0
"because of the design of the 
blockchain infrastructure, the number of transactions being transmitted, received and validated over 
the network is small in regard to other existing, centralized, infrastructures.",Blockchain,0
"with bitcoin, for example, 
the maximal rate is of approximately  transactions per second.",Blockchain,0
"this issue mainly concerns public 
blockchains and is already managed for private blockchains for which some infrastructures can already 
handle thousands of transactions per second.",Blockchain,0
there are other important types of risks.,Blockchain,0
"for example, credentials can be compromised or stolen, 
and there are concerns that it might be vulnerable to programming errors (such as in the decentralized 
autonomous organization or dao platform, which lost $ million in ) or systems weaknesses 
(such as the vulnerabilies behind the scandal of the bitcoin exchange, mt.",Blockchain,0
"this is also 
true for smart contracts.",Blockchain,0
"they are stand-alone programs that, once started, automatically execute pre-
defined conditions encoded within the blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"they work just like any conditional statement of 
the ""if - then"" type (if such a condition is satisfied, then such a consequence runs).",Blockchain,0
"no form or human 
intervention is needed to process those transactions.",Blockchain,0
"a study recently revealed that % of all smart 
contracts are fatally flawed (nikolic et al., ).",Blockchain,0
"another analysis performed by a blockchain security 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
company showed that among projects that have collectively raised $ billion, more than one quarter 
of them had critical vulnerabilities (de havilland, ).",Blockchain,0
"in addition to these technical challenges, the biggest barrier to blockchain adoption today as reported 
by pwc and deloitte in their reports (pwc, ; deloitte, ) is the regulatory uncertainty.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, 
even though many territories have begun studying and discussing the issues (pwc, ), particularly 
as they relate to financial services, the regulatory environment remains unsettled.",Blockchain,0
"overall, there are 
currently insufficient standards and controls in place to ensure that the systems are functioning as 
intended (alarcon, ).",Blockchain,0
"for example, in the european union it is unclear how any blockchain project 
can meet the general data protection regulation (gdpr) privacy standards (pwc, ).",Blockchain,0
blockchain impact on audit and control professions remains an under-researched area.,Blockchain,0
"in a context 
where blockchain developments flourish, our general hypothesis is that blockchain technologies have 
the potential to significantly disrupt and transform the audit and control work.",Blockchain,0
"research methodology 
    this section describes the methods used in developing the research, collecting and analyzing data.",Blockchain,0
the grounded theory approach was used for this research.,Blockchain,0
"strauss and corbin have defined grounded 
theory as “theory that was derived from data, systematically gathered and analyzed through the 
research process”, and charmaz and bryant as a method of qualitative inquiry in which researchers 
develop inductive theoretical analyses from their collected data.",Blockchain,0
"grounded theory was the selected 
research approach as it stresses the importance of allowing theoretical ideas to emerge from data 
(bryman, ) and provides a methodological framework to develop “emergent” theories that 
particularly fit exploratory studies such as this one where theoretical concepts have not yet been 
developed.",Blockchain,0
"research based on grounded theory “involves using multiple stages of data collection and

data analysis, atlas.ti, allowing the formulation of the hypotheses presented in this paper.",Blockchain,0
"those 
hypotheses are to be tested in the next research phase in order to generate a theory on the impact of 
blockchain on the audit and control profession.",Blockchain,0
"a guide for semi-structured interview was developed and consisted in  questions classified in  
categories: global knowledge, business processes, audit work, opportunities and challenges, and 
last questions; to explore each interviewee’s observation on blockchain and its potential impact on 
the audit profession.",Blockchain,0
"this approach allowed each participant to discuss in depth their understanding 
and concerns on the technology, as well as the foreseen changes in their profession in relation to the 
deployment of blockchain technology.",Blockchain,0

"interviews happened either in french or in english 
depending on interviewees’ proficiency.",Blockchain,0
"based on the interviewees’ request answers were either 
recorded or transcribed through notes in preparation for analysis and coding within atlas.ti.",Blockchain,0
"the sample selection was based on the theoretical sampling process where two researchers jointly 
collected, coded and analyzed the data in order to identify major categories.",Blockchain,0
"theoretical saturation 
where nothing new emerged was reached after  interviews of financial and is auditors from  audit

is audit which has been defined by weber as “the process of collecting and evaluating evidences to 
determine whether a computer system safeguards assets, maintains data integrity, allows 
organizational goals to be achieved effectively and uses resources efficiently” (weber, ).",Blockchain,0
"as 
controls can be embedded into the technology, some auditors think that audit and accountancy firms 
will have to ensure that the technology is properly deployed and set-up and that automated controls 
are proper.",Blockchain,0
"as such, some of the interviewees hypothesized that auditors will be primarily “it engineer 
auditors” with specific it skills such as programming and not financial auditors as it is the case today, 
some even mentioned “blockchain auditors” whose function will be to certify blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"% of the interviewees anticipate that auditing firms will hire more is auditors in the very near 
future instead of financial auditors.",Blockchain,0
"more importantly they expect that auditing firms will hire new 
profiles such as analytics specialists, data scientists and statisticians.",Blockchain,0
"this is reinforced by the fact that 
today, in most cases, when the it environment is not complex, even though financial auditors are not 
it experts and have no training in is audit, they perform themselves is audit work by following a 
predetermined audit program to complete this part of the engagement (axelsen et al., ) as 
confirmed by the interviewees.",Blockchain,0
"however, blockchain technology is complex and not well understood 
by most financial auditors and even by many is auditors as demonstrated by the answers obtained.",Blockchain,0
"none of them has had hands-on experience with it and none of them knows how to audit such a 
technology.",Blockchain,0
"we noticed that  the two major auditing standards bodies, the international auditing and assurance 
standards board (iaasb), and the public company accounting oversight board (pcaob) do not 
dissociates technologies from one another and have both set up working groups to investigate “new 
technologies”, which include among other data analytics and blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
    the interviewees also highlight the fact that there is currently no blockchain-specific auditing 
standard and report a lack of personal experience with this technology, suggesting the need for the 
audit firms to integrate new skills.",Blockchain,0
"as 
the scope of the audit is expected to shift, and as audit firms are expected to hire people with a wider 
range of skills, better interaction and better communication among financial and is auditors, and other 
specialists will be necessary for the audits to be as efficient, effective and of higher quality as 
anticipated by the use of new technologies.",Blockchain,0
"at the same time, % of the interviewees foresee that the traditional auditing workload will 
decrease.",Blockchain,0
"this trend appears to be in line with 
the literature that foresees efficiency gains as a result of the use of new technologies in auditing 
(raphae, ; sheehan, ; smith ).",Blockchain,0
"thus % of the interviewees think that auditors will 
therefore be able to focus on value added activities and provide better insights to their audit clients 
based on their professional judgment.",Blockchain,0
"this is aligned with current literature explaining that the 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
traditional role of data verification responsibilities will change and evolve over time, but the need for 
data interpretation and integration into strategy are positioned to grow and change moving forward 
(smith, ).",Blockchain,0
"some auditors also predict that they will be able to perform real time audit, as also mentioned in the 
literature.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, if operational and financial information is uploaded into the blockchain network on 
a continuous basis, and if auditors have continuous access to the blockchain used by their clients, then 
they will be able to analyze this information in a real time manner (banham ).",Blockchain,0
"real time review 
will also contribute to providing better insights to audit clients, thus not only increasing the value of 
the audit but also bringing audit quality to a new level as exceptions will be detected earlier and 
corrected by clients on a timely basis.",Blockchain,0
findings have some other implications for the audit firms.,Blockchain,0
"indeed ‘the future is characterized by 
unparalleled organizational and informational complexity, with corporate and business reporting 
evolving rapidly’ (axelsen, et al., ).",Blockchain,0
"if the auditors and the audit firms are to keep up with these 
changes and the it current development, accounting firms should think about what the audit of the 
future will look like and whether their audit teams have the required skills (macmanus, ).",Blockchain,0
"as of 
today, the big four have already invested in the use of new technologies such as data analytics 
software, and ai programs and started proof-of-concept projects on blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"all interviewees are 
anticipating a “people challenge” at two levels.",Blockchain,0
"first, auditors need to stay up to date on new auditing 
and accounting standards and latest developments, and more importantly increase their is skills.",Blockchain,0
"indeed % of the interviewees think that auditors, financial and is, in place and in training need 
deeper it skills.",Blockchain,0
"to address those requirements, the big four continuously invest to ‘re-train’ and ‘re-
skill’ their employees and keep them informed on “hot topics”.",Blockchain,0
"however, it seems that smaller auditing 
firms are not investing as much as larger auditing firm in training their employees on new technologies

including blockchain and therefore are not as prepared for the changes to come as our study shows.",Blockchain,0
"indeed % of the audit firms surveyed that are not among the big four have not started investigating 
the subject matter.",Blockchain,0
"they are in a “wait and see” mode and hope that they will be able to catch up with 
any new developments when time comes, but this might be too late.",Blockchain,0
"the second challenge comes from 
the fact that the tedious and manual audit processes and tests that are currently performed by junior 
auditors will be automated, therefore, auditing firms will not need as many juniors as they need today.",Blockchain,0
"instead they will need more specialists and more experienced professionals who will be able to use 
their professional judgment to solve complex problem, analyze data, identify control improvements 
and provide value-added insights to their clients.",Blockchain,0
"this will affect the audit pyramidal organization and 
the way auditing firms manage their workforce careers, which is partially based on a high turnover 
rate especially at the junior and senior auditor positions.",Blockchain,0
"lastly as reported by % of the interviewees, the auditing standards will have to be updated to 
include more it related guidance.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, as of today there is no auditing standard describing how to 
perform an audit on blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"the extent and the pace to which international rules will be modified 
in relation to the growth of blockchain use and other new technologies such as data analytics and ai 
remain unknown at this stage.",Blockchain,0
"we can say that the iaasb initiated an awareness process that can be 
illustrated both with the presentation of blockchain done by chuck landes, chair of the iaasb 
innovation working group, and the feedback statement by the data analytics working group 
(dawg) on ‘exploring the growing use of the technology in the audit, with a focus on data analytics’.",Blockchain,0
"the feedback statement reports that the respondents to their request for input from the audit 
professionals emphasized the need for the iaasb to ‘reflect the digital era in application guidance’ 
and recommended that the dawg members ‘consider other technologies whose impact on auditing 
deserves further consideration such as blockchain technology’(iasb, ).",Blockchain,0
"also, the pcaob 
announced in december  the plan to form a new task force on data and technology to explore 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
whether there is a need for guidance, changes to pcaob standards, or other regulatory actions in light 
of the increased use of data analytics and of other new and emerging technology-based tools (pcaob, 
).",Blockchain,0
"to the best of our knowledge, the swiss transmitter of the national auditing standards, 
expertsuisse, has not yet set up such a working group to assess the impact of blockchain on the 
audit profession.",Blockchain,0
"in the meantime, swiss financial auditors already face the challenge to audit 
companies active on blockchain or companies that have implemented blockchain platforms to run 
some of their business processes.",Blockchain,0
"this situation requires them to use their professional judgement when 
auditing standards are silent or not adequate.",Blockchain,0
"the evolution of norms or the development of new 
standards may follow and draw on the evolution of this professional practice.",Blockchain,0
"over all, the findings suggest that the profession is at a turning point and three major hypotheses 
have emerged:  
 
h.: the potential disruptive effect of the technology on the profession is not fully anticipated and 
smaller auditing firms are not tooling up to face the changes to come.",Blockchain,0
"the impact of blockchain on the audit profession would be different if audit clients adopt it as part 
of their business process, or if it is used by auditing firms as an audit tool.",Blockchain,0
"even though both venues are possible, none of the auditors interviewed, even the auditors working 
for the big four mentioned blockchain as a possible audit tool on its own.",Blockchain,0
"all of them only considered 
the potential impacts blockchain would have on their profession if it is used by their clients, how this 
would have an effect on the relationship with their clients, how they would access clients’ data, and 
how they would audit the new system in place.",Blockchain,0
"those companies, at the strategic level, are developing the knowledge and the resources to not only 
anticipate but also influence the deployment and usage of blockchain by their clients, and the audit of 
the technology by audit professionals.",Blockchain,0
"on the other hand, smaller auditing firms have not started to 
invest and to investigate the technology, as they do not have the financial and human capacity.",Blockchain,0
"they 
also believe that their client type (smaller firms) will not embrace the technology at the same pace as 
larger firms and therefore they can wait to develop their capacities and capabilities.",Blockchain,0
"however, as 
blockchain offer many interesting characteristics and as the technology is based on “shared and 
distributed” features, we can anticipate that once it will start to root into the business ecosystem, its 
adoption will most probably be rapid and general.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, pwc recently reported that in the  
countries where they surveyed leaders, % of them explain that their company is already engaged 
into a project related to blockchain (pwc ).",Blockchain,0
"another survey from deloitte led in  countries 
reported that % of the  senior executives working in companies with annual revenues over $ 
million think that their company will adopt the technology within the next  months (deloitte, ).",Blockchain,0
"we can thus infer that most smaller audit firms as they do not have sufficient current knowledge and 
understanding of the technology are not anticipating the impact of the technology on their profession 
and sooner than later might not be able to answer their clients’ emerging needs on the technology.",Blockchain,0
h.: the profession will change its paradigm to become more it oriented and more forward-looking.,Blockchain,0
"first, blockchain allows controls to be embedded into the technology, therefore some processes and 
transactions will be automated.",Blockchain,0
"moreover, records of all transactions will be instantly available to the 
auditors and will be automatically validated by the technology itself.",Blockchain,0
"we can then induce that the main 
focus of the auditors will not be to guarantee the existence of transactions, attest of their evidence, 
accuracy, and completeness as those checks are going to be performed by the technology itself but to 
attest that blockchain is working as intended.",Blockchain,0
"is auditors will have to not only understand the 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
technology but also the underlying code, they will have to assess the related risks and the emerging 
issues that could affect their clients.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, as demonstrated by kinney, businesses place a great 
reliance upon is as part of their business strategy and operations (axelsen, et al., ), which will be 
reinforced by the use of blockchain.",Blockchain,0
"the change in the profession paradigm will also be accelerated 
by the fact that not only the audit clients but also the audit firms use more and more different kinds of 
technologies to perform their audit work.",Blockchain,0
"for example, kpmg has partnered with ibm watson to 
begin automating and streamlining audit and tax processes (smith, ), other type of artificial 
intelligence systems can also be used to reconcile data, while drones can help with inventory counts.",Blockchain,0
"second, audit has always been a “back-looking” activity whose purpose is to obtain reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements of an audited entity are free from material misstatement (isa 
, ) to provide an audit opinion for an ended period (isa , ).",Blockchain,0
"thanks to the use of 
blockchain and data-driven analysis, auditors will be able to provide new insights to their clients.",Blockchain,0
"we 
can then construe that the profession will move from checking past data to providing new types of 
analysis and therefore become “forward-looking”.",Blockchain,0
"even though none of the  auditors interviewed 
already provides forward-looking information to their audit clients, we expect this move to happen 
sooner than later.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, audit clients will probably urge their auditors to provide them with advisory 
as it would bring them additional value.",Blockchain,0
"however, auditors are currently restricted in the type of 
services they can provide to their audit clients for independence reasons, which might represent an 
ethical challenge that the profession will have to tackle.",Blockchain,0
h.: profile of auditors will change.,Blockchain,0
"the hypothesis  suggests that the audit paradigm will change as it will be more it and advisory 
driven.",Blockchain,0
"even though today’s financial auditors and is auditors are well educated - indeed many 
financial auditors are also cpas, is auditors cisa and both financial and is auditors have graduated 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
with a bachelor or a master’s degree - we can induce that to address the changes brought by the 
paradigm shift, profile of auditors will have to change in several ways.",Blockchain,0
"if the role of 
auditors is less and less to audit the financial data but to audit the blockchain and certify that it is 
properly implemented, then auditors will have to be able to thoroughly understand those features.",Blockchain,0
"they 
will have to widen their technical skillset to master coding, hashing, cryptography and also work on 
their soft skills.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, if auditees use smart contracts that execute automatically  predefined 
conditions within the blockchain (if such condition is satisfied then such consequence runs), auditors 
will have to first understand the underlying code and second will have to be able to communicate 
clearly with lawyers to ensure that those contracts are legally valid.",Blockchain,0
"indeed, all the auditors interviewed who work for a big 
four mentioned that they already use data analytics as an audit tool, which is, however, not yet the 
case in smaller cpa firms, as only a few interviewees working for this type of firm already use it.",Blockchain,0
"therefore, audit firms will have to hire data scientists or train their auditors in order to drill down large 
volumes of data.",Blockchain,0
"those data scientists will team up with experienced auditors or field specialists (tax, 
finance, valuation) to interpret data and provide the insights and advice auditees will expect to receive 
from their auditors.",Blockchain,0
"as such audit firms will need more experienced professionals instead of juniors 
and, instead of hiring juniors who gain experience over the years and climb the hierarchy, will directly 
hire experienced people.",Blockchain,0
"today auditors leave audit firms to work in the industry, in the future the 
other way around might prove to be true.",Blockchain,0
"professionals might leave the industry and work for audit

firms directly as managers or directors, which will deeply impact audit firms’ organizational chart.",Blockchain,0
"conclusion 
    indeed, blockchain is sometimes compared to automation and data analytics that will require 
transforming how audits are performed (raphae, ).",Blockchain,0
"blockchain technology has the potential not 
only to make the accounting and auditing rules change, but also to impact the nature of the accounting 
and auditing profession.",Blockchain,0
"some top executives highlight the fact that blockchain is a better ledger 
because it allows adding entries to a ledger and to have multiple ledgers crosschecking against each 
other (martindale, ).",Blockchain,0
"in addition, it provides a third validation point that did not exist before, 
where auditors have previously stepped in and may not have to do so anymore in a near future 
(martindale, ).",Blockchain,0
"finally, a major opportunity resides in the fact that blockchain could facilitate the 
audit and control work by encoding rules directly in specific processes.",Blockchain,0
"but, a major challenge exists 
in terms of potential redefinition of audit and control activities based on the properties of blockchain 
technology (transparency, traceability, security, persistency and immutability of transactions).",Blockchain,0
"the question of the nature and scope of audit work in the case of blockchain use has been raised and 
not fully answered yet.",Blockchain,0

made it nearly impossible for investigators to track them down.",Cryptocurrency,1
"some estimate that 
anywhere between  and  million dollars were stolen as a result of this fraud (cryptick, 
et al).",Cryptocurrency,1
"regardless of what the scope of the damage of this crypto-ponzi scheme actually 
 
 
was, the fraud was prominent enough to make many potential crypto-investor wary of his 
or her next crypto-investment.",Cryptocurrency,1
"another notable ‘crypto-ponzi scheme’ would be the one 
that a company by the name of bitfinex perpetrated.",Cryptocurrency,1
"bitfinex started out as legitimate 
‘crypto-company’ that took in investors just as any public company would.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the scam 
began when bitfinex servers were hacked and thieves made off with $,, worth 
of customer investments.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in an attempt to minimize the effects of the theft, bitfinex 
executives encouraged investors to convert their shares into equity within the company 
thus creating value from nothing at all.",Cryptocurrency,1
"once most of the investors had converted their 
investments to shares, bitfinex then encouraged them to sell their equity as shares to new 
investors.",Cryptocurrency,1
"once enough people had fallen for the fraud, they used the new investors’ 
funds to pay off the hack victims’ hold outs, in effect, creating an effective ponzi scheme 
(bitfinexed, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"the cryptocurrency tether is yet another example of a ponzi scheme 
committed with cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tether is a type of cryptocurrency that is purposefully 
set to an equal exchange rate.",Cryptocurrency,1
"theoretically, this allows tether to act as a safe medium 
for investors who are constantly trading one cryptocurrency for another.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tether claims 
that for each tether on the marketplace, there will be one u.s. dollar to back it up.",Cryptocurrency,1
"red 
flags manifest when you look into the numbers for yourself.",Cryptocurrency,1
"on the open exchange at the 
time this research was conducted, tether has approximately ,,, tethers in 
circulation (www.coinmarketcap.com).",Cryptocurrency,1
"according to tether’s last audit at the time of this 
research, which occurred on may rd, , auditors could only account for 
$,,.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in u.s. dollars which is not even close to the figure of tether in 
circulation (crypto investor, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"many crypto-investors believe that tether is 
perpetrating a ponzi scheme since the amount of cash that they are supposed to have to 
 
 
back up their cryptocurrency is nowhere close to the amount of cryptocurrencies on the 
market as there should be.",Cryptocurrency,1
"along with the numbers not matching up, many crypto-
investors are also wary of a few other red flags surrounding tether’s business practices 
such as the business ties with the aforementioned bitfinex, the disintegration of 
relationships with many prominent banks, lawsuits against said banks, the tendency of 
tether to withhold crucial information from investors as well as ronn torrosian’s (head 
of public relations for tether) past association with a company that had committed a 
ponzi scheme in the past (bitcoinexchangeguide,).",Cryptocurrency,1
"fraudsters are famous for their 
craftiness and ingenuity, so it is no surprise that they have adapted an age-old scheme to 
cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"another typical fraud associated with cryptocurrencies would be the fake ico 
scheme.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in the world of cryptocurrencies, ico’s or initial coin offerings are similar in 
many aspects to initial public offerings for stocks.",Cryptocurrency,1
"typically, a cryptocurrency company 
will release a predetermined number of coins to the open market in the same way stocks 
are issued when a company goes public.",Cryptocurrency,1
"many ico’s are in fact legitimate 
cryptocurrencies that have potential to make the investor a profit like any other security.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, there is a substantial portion of ico’s that are deemed fraudulent since the 
executives of these companies attempt to coerce investors to invest in cryptocurrencies 
that do not actually exist in an attempt to relieve them of their money in a quick and 
efficient manner.",Cryptocurrency,1
"these con artists capitalize on potential investors’ fomo, or ‘fear of 
missing out’ on the next big cryptocurrency payout (zhu and zhang, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"researchers 
from a ‘big ’ accounting firm, ernst & young, estimate that more than % of the $.",Cryptocurrency,1
"billion invested in ico’s thus far have been stolen due to fake ico schemes such as these 
 
 
to date (zhu and zhang, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"fake ico perpetrators will attempt to entice potential 
investors to become ensnared in their scheme by fabricating exorbitantly high return 
rates, lying about the numbers of investors and how much they had invested as well as 
advertising novel features in an effort to make their non-existent cryptocurrency 
irresistible.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a fake ico scheme under the guise of a fake cryptocurrency by the name of 
plexcoin did just this.",Cryptocurrency,1
"plexcoin’s executives promised unbelievable returns of up to 
,% in the first  days, which of course cannot be a number that any feasible security 
could guarantee (levine, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"plexcoin also brought in investors by suggesting that 
they were in the process of developing a credit card like instrument deemed ‘plexcard’.",Cryptocurrency,1
"supposedly, this fictitious card was designed to draw plexcoin out of atm’s as well as 
“be used anywhere in the world and [would] be connected directly to [a] plexwallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it 
will give you the opportunity to spend your money in a totally confidential way” (levine, 
).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in addition to the ridiculous statements concerning the fake cryptocurrency, 
plexcoin’s website and business plan were also worryingly vague.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it turns out that the 
fake ico scheme perpetrated by plexcoin was the brainchild of a repeat fraudster, 
dominic lacroix.",Cryptocurrency,1
"was able to prosecute lacroix since fake ico’s fall under 
securities fraud (levine, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"unfortunately, lacroix was still able steal over $ 
million before his arrest (lee, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"another interesting example of a fake ico scheme 
would be the recoin scheme.",Cryptocurrency,1
"recoin was a fictitious cryptocurrency created by a 
fraudster by the name of maksim zaslavskiy.",Cryptocurrency,1
"zaslavskiy pedaled his ‘revolutionary’, new 
cryptocurrency as being the first ever cryptocurrency to be backed by real estate.",Cryptocurrency,1
"one 
article described recoin as a great investment vehicle for investors wary of the world of 
cryptocurrency since, unlike any other cryptocurrency, the “proceeds from the initial sale 
 
 
of tokens will be invested in the highly regulated real estate market in virtually all 
jurisdictions while reinforcing the holders' and investors' confidence in the recoin 
“(zaslavskiy, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"zaslavskiy also perpetrated the same fraud with another fake 
cryptocurrency with the designation of drc for diamond reserve club.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the theory 
behind drc was similar to recoin, but instead of proceeds being invested in real estate, 
proceeds were supposedly invested in diamonds (morris, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, it seems as 
though zaslavskiy never did invest any proceeds from recoin into any real estate or any 
proceeds from drc into diamonds.",Cryptocurrency,1
"according to an investigation conducted by the sec, 
it was discovered that neither recoin or drc had any operations (morris, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"zaslavskiy and lacroix are just a few of many fraudsters that have attempted to 
perpetrate fake ico schemes.",Cryptocurrency,1
"believes that this problem is so prevalent that 
this is such a prevalent issue for potential crypto-investors, that they have even made a 
mock, fake ico website in order for them to consult when wondering whether or not 
invest in a cryptocurrency (liao, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
the next scheme to be discussed is exit schemes.,Cryptocurrency,1
"according to investopedia, an 
exit scheme is “a fraudulent practice by unethical cryptocurrency promoters who vanish 
with investors’ money during or after an ico” (shobhit, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"sometimes, exit schemes 
may be able to start out as legitimate enterprises.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, due to adverse economic 
conditions, poor business planning or a combination of both, future perpetrators of exit 
schemes may attempt to vanish into thin air in an attempt to escape the consequences of 
overseeing a failing business, making off with all the investors’ funds in the process.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this 
 
 
sort of scheme has become popular with cryptocurrency start ups seeing as anonymity is 
easy to maintain when all a business’s operations are virtual.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a crypto-company by the 
name of giza perpetrated a scheme just like this.",Cryptocurrency,1
"investors believed giza to be a 
legitimate company since it had announced a partnership with a russian tech firm, third 
pin llc.",Cryptocurrency,1
"giza contracted third pin to aid in the creation of a secure device that could 
store cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"giza in turn raised over , ethereum coins, an amount equal to 
roughly $.",Cryptocurrency,1
"investors began to worry when third pin announced that 
they had cut ties with giza.",Cryptocurrency,1
"around february of , all of the investors’ funds were 
transferred out of the known giza wallet, supposedly by the mysterious and anonymous 
c.e.o.",Cryptocurrency,1
"no one has been able to track down fike (if that is even his 
real name) since his linkedin profile contained falsified information such as the fact he 
attended oxford university when oxford has no record of his attendance (kharpal, 
).",Cryptocurrency,1
"giza has now become synonymous in the crypto-trading community with exit 
schemes.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a similar exit scheme was perpetrated by the crypto-company, loopx.",Cryptocurrency,1
"loopx 
told investors that it had developed a complex crypto-trading software that contained an 
algorithm that would earn investors weekly profits.",Cryptocurrency,1
"contrary to the payouts that they 
were expecting, investors were instead relieved of  bitcoin and , ethereum in 
january .",Cryptocurrency,1
"it appears as if loopx decided to pull an exit scheme when they decided 
that they would not be able to convince investors that they were unable to come up with a 
software that could do everything that they promised.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there are no traces of loopx’s 
website or the type-o riddled white paper anywhere on the internet seeing as the 
fraudsters wiped every trace of loopx’s existence from the internet (mix, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"even 
though some crypto-companies may pull an exit scheme to escape a business plan gone 
 
 
wrong, there are many more fraudsters perpetrate the same scheme with no intention of 
ever delivering anything for their customers or investors.",Cryptocurrency,1
"one of the biggest exit schemes 
that fits into this category would be the one pulled off by cabbagetech.",Cryptocurrency,1
"of cabbagetech pulled his exit scheme by offering customers crypto-
investment trading advice in exchange for payments of cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cabbagetech 
claimed that with their service, one could expect as high as a “% return on an 
investment in less than a week” (cheng, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, mcdonnell never delivered the 
service to his customers, and attempted to simply exit the business with approximately 
$.",Cryptocurrency,1
million worth of customers’ bitcoin.,Cryptocurrency,1
"however, the securities and exchange 
commission and commodity futures trading commission have filed charges against 
mcdonnell and cabbagetech to thwart ever growing cryptocurrency fraud in america

the cabbagetech fraud is not alone by any stretch of the imagination.,Cryptocurrency,1
"benebit was supposed to be a novel cryptocurrency company that would use benefits to 
incentivize customers to invest.",Cryptocurrency,1
"benebit also claimed that it would the rewards system 
would work like racking up frequent flyer miles from your airline.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, investors 
began to question benebit’s authenticity when they discovered that the photos of the team 
members were fake.",Cryptocurrency,1
"soon after the allegations were brought up, the scammers exited 
with estimated funds of $.",Cryptocurrency,1
"to $ million before ever even bringing their novel 
cryptocurrency idea to the market (kean, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"a cryptocurrency by the name of opair 
has a very similar story.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a mysterious developer who went by wasserman offered a 
cryptocurrency that supposedly would act as a sort of “decentralized debit card system 
using its own token, xpo” (kean, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"the cryptocurrency brought in an estimated 
$.",Cryptocurrency,1
"million before the fraudsters exited with all the funds after investors noticed that the 
 
 
team’s linkedin profiles were fake.",Cryptocurrency,1
"to date, nobody knows the true identity of 
wasserman, or where the money from opair has gone to (kean, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"not all exit 
schemes have to be as elaborate as the previous examples do.",Cryptocurrency,1
"probably the most 
ridiculous exit scheme was perpetrated by the ironically named ponzicoin.",Cryptocurrency,1
"ponzicoin 
raised over $, before the perpetrator vanished with the funds.",Cryptocurrency,1
"apparently, the 
cryptocurrency openly marketed itself as a scam, however, gullible investors were still 
drawn to invest money into what they must have thought was a legitimate cryptocurrency 
(kean, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"with the ever-increasing amount of exit schemes that are uncovered every 
day, prospective crypto-investors must remain careful to research the legitimacy of these 
cryptocurrencies and businesses now more than ever.",Cryptocurrency,1
"pump and dump schemes have been around for ages and have proven to be fairly 
lucrative schemes for fraudsters to perpetrate.",Cryptocurrency,1
"according to investopedia, pump and 
dump schemes can be defined as a fraud “that attempts to boost the price of a stock 
through recommendations based on false, misleading or greatly exaggerated statements” 
(investopedia, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in other words, fraudsters will pump up the price by buying 
substantial amounts of the stock as well as propagating fake news through fake celebrity 
tweets or fake articles to entice others to help them inflate the price of the security, then 
dump it all in one single coordinated effort to make a profit.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this may seem like a 
victimless crime, but one must consider the amount that investors who are purchasing the 
‘dumped’ securities are purchasing them at an artificially inflated price under the false 
pretenses of the scammers.",Cryptocurrency,1
"these new investors will no doubt lose significant amounts to 
the scam.",Cryptocurrency,1
"pump and dump schemes have been popular ever since the ’s and remain 
relevant today almost  years later.",Cryptocurrency,1
"fraudsters have now taken to perpetrating these 
 
 
schemes with cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"due to cryptocurrency’s markets inherent qualities of 
volatility and unpredictability, crypto-investors’ extreme fear of missing out on the next 
big cryptocurrency as well as the ability to remain completely anonymous using the 
internet, pump and dump perpetrators have found it relatively easy to make a quick profit 
off budding cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"usually these scams are started by only one or a handful of 
people.",Cryptocurrency,1
"these ‘investment groups’ (as many pump and dump groups like to refer to 
themselves) coordinate their efforts through anonymous messaging apps such as discord 
and telegram and recruit new members through means of shameless social media 
advertising and member recruitment.",Cryptocurrency,1
"recruitment is vital to the success of these pump 
and dump schemes since the biggest contributing factor to how much the price of the 
cryptocurrency can be inflated is based solely on how many coins are bought up by how 
many investors.",Cryptocurrency,1
"members are enticed to recruit new members with the incentive of being 
promoted to higher ranks within the group based on how many new members that they 
have invited.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the advantages of being of a higher rank means that you will get anywhere 
.",Cryptocurrency,1
"to a . second earlier notification when to dump your coins to get a higher return on 
an investment since you will be selling before a majority of the group does.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this means 
that the higher rank you are within the group, the better opportunity you will have to 
make the highest possible profit.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, this logic backfires for most of the members, 
in effect, scamming the scammers.",Cryptocurrency,1
"only the top of the group sees any real profit while 
the ones who lost are left to rationalize their loss based on the assumption that they 
simply sold too late (martineau, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"as these scams have become more and more 
popular over the past couple years, the government has decided to step in to try to 
regulate them.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the commodity futures trading commission has announced that they 
 
 
will focus on “detecting and deterring fraudulent activities, such as pump and dump 
schemes, while not stifling early innovation in the crypto space” (cftc, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"the 
cftc and sec can prosecute pump and dump schemes under the securities act of  
(sec, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, due to the anonymity of the message groups, it is hard to discern 
who is involved in these schemes.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this is the reason for the cftc offering rewards of 
$, or up to % of the sanctions recuperated by the fraudsters for whistleblowers 
who expose the heads of these pump and dump schemes (crypto insider, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in addition to the aforementioned schemes that can be committed with 
cryptocurrencies, there are a few schemes that i have categorized simply as 
‘cryptocurrency theft’.",Cryptocurrency,1
"due to the inherent nature of cryptocurrencies being a virtual 
currency, hackers have attempted to relieve unsuspecting investors of their 
cryptocurrencies for years.",Cryptocurrency,1
"i have chosen to categorize the following frauds as 
cryptocurrency theft since they all involve some sort of perpetrator stealing 
cryptocurrencies from an unsuspecting holder.",Cryptocurrency,1
"most financially literate individuals will 
be familiar with the infamous ‘nigerian prince’ or  fraud (labeled  due to the 
section of nigerian law that makes it illegal).",Cryptocurrency,1
"this scheme is a type of advance fee 
scheme that involves a scam artist, stereotypically from nigeria, that entices someone to 
wire him or her a small sum of money in order to clear a large sum in which the scammer 
claims can be split between both the con-man and the conned.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, all these stories 
are fictitious, and the investor usually never sees any of their investment ever again.",Cryptocurrency,1
"these scammers are now perpetrating these same  scams, but now with 
cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in addition to scamming citizens abroad such as us in america, these 
nigerian scammers have also taken to scamming their own countrymen.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the goal is to 
 
 
convince unsuspecting nigerians to wire over naira; the local, nigerian currency, for 
phony cryptocurrencies such as ‘billion coin’ (mcdonnell, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in addition to these 
crypto-nigerian schemes, hackers have also become prevalent threats to the security of 
investors’ cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"these hackers will use many different tactics to steal 
cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"despite the many safeguards that blockchain technology can offer to 
help protect investors from hackers, they still manage to steal cryptocurrencies every day.",Cryptocurrency,1
one man in a suburb of los angeles lost his life savings to crypto-hackers.,Cryptocurrency,1

in his profile.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the next time dejrit logged in, he noticed that his entire stash of bitcoin 
was gone without a trace (cbs los angeles, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"another type of cryptocurrency theft 
that has become more and more popular over the past couple years are ransomware 
schemes.",Cryptocurrency,1
these schemes have caught the entire crypto-world off guard.,Cryptocurrency,1
"fraudsters 
perpetrate these schemes by utilizing ransomware to take over people’s computers and 
vow only to unlock them once a payment of untraceable cryptocurrency has been made to 
the fraudster’s e-wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in , it was estimated that cryptowall, a specific type of 
ransomware virus, made off with over $ million worth of cryptocurrencies (the 
data team, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"ransomware, another prominent ransomware virus, also swept 
across europe in may of  causing considerable damage to all those affected.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the 
impact was so great that many european legislators attempted to make cryptocurrencies 
illegal so that scams such as ransomware would not be allowed to persist (coleman, 
).",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, the most egregious cryptocurrency thefts that the world of 
cryptocurrency has ever seen would have to be the hacks of mt.",Cryptocurrency,1
gox and bitfinex are both what the cryptocurrency community refers to as exchanges.,Cryptocurrency,1

cryptocurrency exchange acts as a market place where cryptocurrencies can be stored and 
traded.",Cryptocurrency,1

trusted by their customers to provide a safe trading environment.",Cryptocurrency,1

exchange by using an auditor’s credentials that were supposed to be kept confidential.",Cryptocurrency,1

customers had lost all faith in the company, and it filed for bankruptcy shortly afterwards

cryptocurrency usages and relate the matter in taxation area.",Cryptocurrency,1
"we also explore how 
digital forensics can be done to gather information regarding cryptocurrency 
activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"lastly, we suggest several steps to enhance cryptoforensics which are 
tailored for law enforcement agencies such as directorate general of taxes. 
 
. background 
this chapter describes the background knowledge of our paper, which 
consists of three parts, namely cryptocurrency, taxation, and digital forensics.",Cryptocurrency,1
"to enable the feature, several cryptographic techniques are 
implemented in the system, making it fully run by the automated protocols.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency runs on the internet, where traditional boundaries such as 
working hours, geographical locations, and jurisdictions are eliminated.",Cryptocurrency,1
"international money transfers can be done through cryptocurrency network which 
can be verified within minutes.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the success of bitcoin has caused a rapid adoption 
of cryptocurrencies across the world.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... the technologies behind cryptocurrency 
in recent days, there is a huge collection of technologies being implemented 
in various cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, there are several core technologies that are 
used in (almost) all cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"pkc is a cryptographic technique which 
utilises two keys: public key and private key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as the name implies, the public key 
is intended to be publicized (shared) to other parties, while the private key needs 
to be kept secret by the owner.",Cryptocurrency,1
"both keys are different but having a -to- 
relationship.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this technique enables the cryptocurrency users to prove the 
ownership of the coins without revealing their real identities by the help of digital 
signatures.",Cryptocurrency,1
distributed ledger technology (dlt).,Cryptocurrency,1
"dlt is a public ledger where the 
information stored in the ledger is shared among system participants.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the 
                                                             
 based on information published by coinmarketcap.com on  november  
information inside dlt is constructed such that stored data is infeasible to tamper.",Cryptocurrency,1
"dlt is an append-only database; consensus method is applied to determine which 
participant can write the next data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there are at least two major types in dlt, 
namely blockchain and directed acyclic graph (dag).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in dlt, new data is first 
collected and then stored once every predetermined period (epoch), constructing 
a sequential historical data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the way it is stored in the existing storage is by linking 
it to the previous data: the hash of the previous data is included in the new data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"while blockchain can only have one main branch in the system (nakamoto ), 
dag allows multiple branches when storing information (popov ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in this 
paper, blockchain and dlt will be used interchangeably to refer dlt as a general 
concept.",Cryptocurrency,1
hash functions and merkle tree.,Cryptocurrency,1
"hash function is an algorithm to convert 
an arbitrary length data into a value which has a constant length over the same 
hash function.",Cryptocurrency,1
"one of the main roles of hash function is to represent data without 
mentioning the data at all, hence it acts as the commitment of the represented 
data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"merkle tree is a form of binary tree where anyone can verify the correctness 
of any data within its leaves without the need of knowing all the leaves.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the merkle 
tree is often used as an authenticated data structure (ads) where it is easy to 
verify the integrity of its leaves.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... various types of cryptocurrency 
classifying cryptocurrencies is important in digital forensics as it will 
determine the tools and methods during the investigation, or even determine how 
difficult the investigation will be.",Cryptocurrency,1
"based on its characteristics, we can classify the 
cryptocurrencies into several types.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the naming convention is coined based on 
bitcoin as the standard cornerstone, hence we also use the blockchain technology 
in our classification.",Cryptocurrency,1
"blockchain .. the cryptocurrencies in this class are those 
cryptocurrencies following the identical (or with minor changes) protocols of 
bitcoin.",Cryptocurrency,1
"litecoin and dogecoin are two most popular cryptocurrencies other than 
bitcoin.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this class is marked by its legacy protocols such as nakamoto consensus, 
pseudo-anonymity, and input-output transactions.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the main function of these 
cryptocurrencies is payment method.",Cryptocurrency,1
"blockchain .. this class is for those cryptocurrencies that have evolved 
from version .",Cryptocurrency,1
by embedding additional features on their systems.,Cryptocurrency,1
"the 
cryptocurrencies in this class are nxt, ardor, nem, waves, and others.",Cryptocurrency,1
"not only 
as payment methods, these cryptocurrencies also provide rich features such as 
peer-to-peer marketplace, child chains, digital asset management, electronic 
voting, and so on.",Cryptocurrency,1
"blockchain .. the need of stronger anonymity motivated people to embed 
extra anonymity features on cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the members of this class are 
known to be more difficult to analyse than bitcoin, such as monero, zcash, and 
dash.",Cryptocurrency,1
"several other cryptocurrencies such as verge claimed that these products 
are anonymous, despite it is still unclear how their proposed protocols can provide 
a strong anonymity to the data and to their users.",Cryptocurrency,1
"blockchain .. the development of ethereum has expanded the scope of 
blockchain from merely storing data into a system that enables its users to run 
programs on its virtual environment which is in sync to its permanently-stored data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"offers smart contract capability to its users, where the users are 
given the flexibility of creating complex algorithms using the provided software 
development tools.",Cryptocurrency,1
"not only providing a payment scheme, the smart contract can 
be utilised to develop decentralized applications (dapps) with unlimited features 
which will be run directly on the blockchain (wood ).",Cryptocurrency,1
this class exists due to the popularity of smart contract.,Cryptocurrency,1
"in a smart 
contract platform, a developer can create a contract which contains values, or 
tokens.",Cryptocurrency,1
these tokens can be set to be transferred from their owners to receivers.,Cryptocurrency,1
"token can be treated as a different class of cryptocurrency, but it can also be a 
derivation of smart contract.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the most popular token platform at the time of the 
writing is ethereum, where erc (vogelsteller and buterin ) is the most 
known standard when creating tokens.",Cryptocurrency,1
"by implementing the erc standard, a 
token can be traded with other tokens in a peer-to-peer token market as they have 
identical functions and characteristics.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this type of token is also commonly called 
as erc token.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... activities related to cryptocurrency 
as a system, several activities are closely related to cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"these 
activities are: mining/staking, transacting, trading, and providing services.",Cryptocurrency,1
"mining 
and staking are activities related to cryptocurrency’s open consensus.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in a 
cryptocurrency implementing a proof-of-work (pow) consensus, a miner uses 
computing devices such as computers and application-specific integrated circuit 
(asic).",Cryptocurrency,1
"the miners compete to compute mathematical questions, where the 
winner can write the next block.",Cryptocurrency,1
"stakers are participant of any cryptocurrencies 
implementing proof-of-stake (pos) consensus mechanism, where coins are being 
staked and raffled to determine who has the authority to produce the next block.",Cryptocurrency,1
"both miner and staker are motivated by the prize coin promised to be rewarded by 
the protocol as well as the right to claim the transaction fees paid by the 
cryptocurrency users.",Cryptocurrency,1
"while mining requires investment in the form of computing power and staking 
requires a huge amount of money to acquire a significant portion of the coins, 
creating transactions can be done by anyone.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the two requirements for creating a 
transaction are a wallet and a fraction of coin.",Cryptocurrency,1
"creating a transaction in a 
cryptocurrency system means the user utilises the wallet application to construct a 
digital information which expresses the coin movement from the payer to the 
payee(s).",Cryptocurrency,1
"this information will be authorized by using digital signature(s) which will 
validate that the payer owns the coin(s) to be sent to the payee(s).",Cryptocurrency,1
"it is feasible to 
send a fraction of a coin only if the amount exceeds the minimum amount (if 
determined by the cryptocurrency system) and sufficient to pay the transaction fee.",Cryptocurrency,1
cryptocurrency trading activity is a logical result of the emerging digital asset.,Cryptocurrency,1
"as the cryptocurrencies were getting more valuable and usable in daily life, 
cryptocurrency trading facilitates supply (ask) and demand (bid).",Cryptocurrency,1
"while the trading 
platform will receive trading fees, the traders expect to make profits from their 
trading activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as a valuable intangible asset, it is possible that the cryptocurrencies are 
used as a payment method, as most of them were intended to be.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, until 
now the indonesian government do not facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies as a 
legal tender, where currency act  defines rupiah as the only legal tender in 
indonesian jurisdiction.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the statement is further clarified by indonesian central 
bank through a press release on  january  (press release no.",Cryptocurrency,1
//dkom) with a lengthy explanation through a faq document.,Cryptocurrency,1
"... cryptocurrency-related tools 
in general, a cryptocurrency system is entirely run by its set of protocols.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the 
protocols are implemented in one or more application (software) bundles, where 
there will be multiple and separated parties are running the main application, 
usually called as a node.",Cryptocurrency,1
"each node manages a copy of the blockchain containing 
the entire transactions from the genesis block to the newest block.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it also validates 
new transactions, (re)publish transactions to its connected peers, and lets wallets 
request information about the blockchain data which will be responded with the 
requested information by the node to the requesting wallets.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a wallet is a client-side application which helps a user to create transactions, 
manage private keys, and compute the remaining coin balance.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the wallet does 
not store any information about the blockchain, hence it relies on the node when it 
requires certain information.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there are multiple types of wallet, namely mobile 
wallet which runs in smartphones, desktop wallet in computers, web wallet which 
can be accessed through web browsers and hosted by service providers.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there 
are also special wallets such as hardware wallet which contains secured storage 
to protect the private keys and paper wallet which stores private keys in a piece of 
paper.",Cryptocurrency,1
"most wallets (excluding paper wallet) are spv-wallets (simplified payment 
verification wallet) which only store the blockchain header.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the correctness of the 
information received from the node it is connected to will be checked by using the 
blockchain header it manages.",Cryptocurrency,1
"merkle tree and the chained blocks structures help 
the data integrity checking.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the relationship between nodes and wallets can be 
expressed in figure .",Cryptocurrency,1
"an illustration of a blockchain system with multiple nodes (daemons) and several wallets 
connected to one of the node (wijaya, et al.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a blockchain explorer is an application which will help the users to explore 
the content of a blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"normally, every cryptocurrency provides at least one 
blockchain explorer as a way to prove the transparency of the system.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, 
popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have many options of 
blockchain explorers which are provided for free by multiple parties.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... indonesian cryptocurrency markets 
indodax (previously known as bitcoin indonesia) is the first cryptocurrency 
exchange in indonesia and the only cryptocurrency exchange for several years.",Cryptocurrency,1
"indodax provides two types of markets, namely idr (indonesian rupiah) and 
btc (bitcoin).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in idr market, the users can buy or sell the paired cryptocurrency 
by using rupiah, while in btc by using bitcoin.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tokenomy supports four markets 
(ten, btc, eth, and usdt).",Cryptocurrency,1
"luno pairs bitcoin with several currencies such as 
eur (european euro), idr, myr (malaysian ringgit), ngn (nigerian naira), zar 
(south african rand), and eth (ethereum).",Cryptocurrency,1

self-photos) before the new accounts are activated.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the kyc and aml procedures 
allow the service providers to store the users’ identities and id cards on their own 
local storage.",Cryptocurrency,1
".. taxation 
taxation plays an important role in indonesia state budget.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in financial year 
, at least % of the total revenue for the national budget comes from tax 
(kementerian keuangan republik indonesia ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"this figure shows the 
importance of taxation for the country.",Cryptocurrency,1
"self-assessment policy has been 
implemented as a part of the first indonesian tax reform in  to replace the 
legacy tax administration system which was highly inefficient and low compliance 
(prasetyo n.d.).",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, the self-assessment policy does come with a cost.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tax avoidance 
cases could happen as the taxpayers tend to minimize their tax due.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tax audits 
will be established to measure the compliance, and when preliminary proofs are 
found, the case can be escalated into tax fraud case, which is an offense according 
to taxation act .",Cryptocurrency,1
".. digital forensics techniques 
digital forensic has multiple branches according to various medium to store 
or to compute digital information.",Cryptocurrency,1
"nevertheless, disk-based forensics and network 
forensics are popular due to their wide scope and usefulness in during the 
investigation.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in the disk-based forensics, the focus of the analyses includes but 
not limited to operating system analysis, deleted file analysis, password recovery, 
and user-related data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"while the network forensics’ focus is on how multiple 
computers communicate through computer networks, including how network 
protocols are utilized to carry information from the sender to the receiver.",Cryptocurrency,1
"digital forensic activities are supported by various forensic tools in the form 
of hardware and software.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in accordance to the activities, there are also protocols 
and standard procedures to be followed such that the digital information gathered 
during acquisition process is well-preserved, hence it can be presented as a valid 
evidence in the court. 
 
. cryptaxforensic: cryptoforensics for taxation 
purposes 
in this chapter, we describe cryptaxforensics in details.",Cryptocurrency,1
"we coined the term 
cryptaxforensic to define cryptoforensic activities in the taxation area.",Cryptocurrency,1
"data 
collection methods, challenges, and proposed methods to enhance 
cryptoforensics are covered in this chapter.",Cryptocurrency,1
".. the (potential) role of cryptoforensics in directorate general of 
taxes 
cryptoforensic techniques have increased in demand and popularity in 
recent years due to the massive increase of cryptocurrency use.",Cryptocurrency,1
"while 
cryptocurrency was not created for ill-purposes, people always find ways to utilize 
the medium in legal offences.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tax offense and other financial fraud cases, 
unfortunately, are not unfamiliar cases in cryptocurrency area, for example in 
(pearce ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"moreover, cryptocurrencies are considered as tax havens due to 
their technologies (marian ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"while traditional tax fraud cases will be one of the main concerns for 
directorate general of taxes, cryptocurrency-related cases must also be on the 
list.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptoforensics as digital forensics methods and procedures can be useful in 
collecting information related to cryptocurrency activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
".. data collection in cryptoforensics 
we have identified several methods for data collection in cryptoforensics, 
including disk-based cryptoforensics, network cryptoforensics, blockchain 
cryptoforensics.",Cryptocurrency,1
"wallet seizure will be discussed in a separate subchapter as it 
serves a different purpose.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... disk-based cryptoforensics 
disk-based cryptoforensics focuses on the examination of wallet applications 
which can be used to manage their coins and/or create transactions.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as it has been 
described that there are various types of wallet, multiple digital forensics 
techniques are also needed to gather information.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the desktop wallets are 
generally compatible with multiple operating systems such as windows, osx, and 
linux.",Cryptocurrency,1
"moreover, multiple wallets store information in different methods.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, it is almost certain that the database file to store the private keys 
and transaction details is encrypted and password-protected.",Cryptocurrency,1
"despite the difficulty 
to read the private keys, it is advisable to collect all information from the application 
folders as well as other locations such as home folder and application data folder 
to investigate the log files.",Cryptocurrency,1
"passwords, pin keys, or seed words might need to be 
obtained from the users through any appropriate procedures.",Cryptocurrency,1
"web browsers such as mozilla firefox and google chrome are also good 
places to search.",Cryptocurrency,1
"two most popular ethereum wallets, myetherwallet (mew) 
and metamask provide web browser addons for their clients.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in mew, addresses 
are visible without login to the wallet, as shown in figure .",Cryptocurrency,1
myetherwallet shows several addresses it manages.,Cryptocurrency,1
"once the ethereum addresses are known, the balance will be easily defined 
by the help of any ethereum explorer, for example etherscan.",Cryptocurrency,1
"not only the 
balance, their associated erc tokens can also be concluded by using the same 
tool.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... network cryptoforensics 
as with other standard network forensic methods, network cryptoforensics 
also can be done through packet capture techniques.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in most cryptocurrency 
systems, there will be two types of network packets, namely rpc and pp 
connections.",Cryptocurrency,1
rpc is the protocol for the connection between a node and a wallet.,Cryptocurrency,1
"the wallet sends requests by using rpc interface, and the responses will be sent 
by the node, either in json (javascript object notation) or bin (binary) formats.",Cryptocurrency,1
captured network packets showing rpc communication.,Cryptocurrency,1
"pp (peer-to-peer) protocol, on the other hand, is used to exchange 
information between nodes.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the protocol’s packets are identified by its “packet 
magic” as a fingerprint.",Cryptocurrency,1
"every cryptocurrency system has its own packet magic, or 
often called as “magic bytes”.",Cryptocurrency,1
an example is shown on figure .,Cryptocurrency,1
captured network packets showing pp communication.,Cryptocurrency,1
"... blockchain cryptoforensics 
the increase use of cryptocurrency motivated the development of blockchain 
analyses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"taint analysis is commonly used in blockchain ., where all related 
addresses can be concluded.",Cryptocurrency,1
"taint analysis shows other addresses and 
transactions that are directly and indirectly related to a specific address.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, 
the taint analysis will eventually produce a cluster which contains a massive 
number of related addresses, as they are mostly using “haircut” method 
(greenberg ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"several companies such as chainanalysis, coinfirm, and 
ciphertrace use the method to track bitcoins (greenberg ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"furthermore, 
clustering analyses have been developed and being used to check the information 
stored in bitcoin’s blockchain (meiklejohn, et al. )",Cryptocurrency,1
"a recent research describes a novel approach which was based on a british 
legal system (anderson, shumailov and ahmed ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"the new approach 
describes first-in-first-out (fifo) method instead of taint analysis, which results 
in a shortened list of related address.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... wallet/coin seizure 
unlike any other digital assets or financial instruments where user ids are 
required to transact, cryptocurrencies only require private keys to move coins to 
other addresses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"when the private keys are seized from the users or suspects, it 
                                                             
 an example of bitcoin taint analysis can be seen in  
  
  
  
is advisable that the information is carefully managed such that anyone having 
access to the private keys cannot easily move the digital assets.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the event where 
rogue law enforcement agents moved seized bitcoins has happened in the past 
(redman ) 
the way the problem can be mitigated is to create a new wallet with 
multisignature feature.",Cryptocurrency,1
"several cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin has this feature, 
although unfortunately not all cryptocurrencies have implemented it.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in a 
multisignature wallet, each transaction requires more than one valid signature 
which implies that every transaction is approved by multiple parties.",Cryptocurrency,1
"of course, it 
is assumed that the new multisignature wallet’s private keys are held by different 
parties.",Cryptocurrency,1
".. challenges 
we identify several challenges for cryptoforensics activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"sometimes, 
they are not straightforward as its counterparts.",Cryptocurrency,1
"some of these challenges are 
pseudonymity, privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, and worldwide markets.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... pseudonymity 
although the public blockchains utilized by the cryptocurrencies are 
transparent and accessible through blockchain explorers, it does not mean that 
determining the owners of the coins being transacted in the blockchains is trivial.",Cryptocurrency,1
"pseudonymity is a default characteristic in those public blockchains, where the 
users are identified by their addresses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, complications occur because one 
user can create unlimited number of addresses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a quantitative analysis has 
successfully determined the activities conducted by a cryptocurrency thief (ron 
and shamir ), however the same technique cannot be applied to other cases.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies 
privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies such as monero and zcash have 
implemented extra cryptographic techniques such that several information in the 
blockchain is obfuscated.",Cryptocurrency,1
"monero is using ring signature method where the real 
signer is obfuscated by using decoys or false addresses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"moreover, the 
implementation of ring confidential transaction (ringct) encrypts the amount of 
coins such that it cannot be seen by anyone but the payer and the payee (noether 
and mackenzie ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"several studies have discovered the weaknesses in monero 
system (moeser, et al. )",Cryptocurrency,1
"), and since 
then monero has gone through several updates to improve its security.",Cryptocurrency,1
"different compared to monero, zcash is using zero knowledge proof (zkp) 
technology, zk-snarks to be specific, where transaction history is completely 
obfuscated and relationships between coins are hardly identified (ben-sasson, et 
al.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, recent finding discovered the weakness of the implementation 
of zcash (quesnelle ) (kappos, et al. )",Cryptocurrency,1
"due to the extensive computing 
requirements for its wallet which hinders its users from using the secure mode, 
namely z-addr.",Cryptocurrency,1
"despite this finding, it is difficult to say that zcash technology has 
been broken, as the problems found are in the system level.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... worldwide markets 
although there are already exist several cryptocurrency markets in 
indonesia, it does not mean that all indonesian cryptocurrency users are only using 
them when conducting trading.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a trader is motivated to open accounts in as many 
exchanges as possible, where it is free to create them; all she needs to do is to 
provide a username and password followed by identity verification.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency market is unique and totally different compared to stock 
market, such that there will be multiple prices in different markets.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a skilled trader 
can leverage the opportunity by buying on the lowest price market and selling on 
the highest price market.",Cryptocurrency,1
"by doing this, it is expected that she could gain significant 
profits.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, this so-called opportunity for the traders could become a significant 
obstacle for law enforcement agencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"unlike any fiat currencies where their 
transactions are limited by regulations and boundaries, cryptocurrencies do not 
share the same limitations.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a user can send payments through cryptocurrency to 
the other side of the world in a matter of several minutes.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as there are many 
cryptocurrency markets in the world, a trader can store her digital assets not in the 
local cryptocurrency exchanges but in any exchanges beyond the reach of any 
local law enforcement agencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
".. enhancing cryptoforensics 
after identifying several challenges for cryptoforensics, we propose methods 
to enhance cryptoforensics.",Cryptocurrency,1
"our proposed methods are not about enhancing 
technical capabilities, but mainly about legal instruments, collaboration, and 
extensive research.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... legal instruments 
we propose the use of any available legal instruments to support 
cryptoforensics activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the legal instruments could ensure that information 
related to cryptocurrency activities within the country’s jurisdiction can be acquired.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this includes but not limited to enforcing kyc/aml procedures for onboarding new 
customers of cryptocurrency-related businesses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... collaboration 
collaboration is important in cryptoforensics, especially for gathering a 
proper information.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the main actors for collaboration in this matter are 
cryptocurrency markets or exchanges.",Cryptocurrency,1
"they hold important information about the 
users, as the users provided their real identities to the markets and this information 
can be utilized to connect cryptocurrency-related activities with the persons doing 
them.",Cryptocurrency,1
"an important scheme developed in the monero community called eabe 
shows the importance of cryptocurrency exchanges (holmes ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"eabe stands 
for exchange-alice-bob-exchange.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in this scheme, alice purchases several 
cryptocurrency coins from an exchange, then she transfers the coins to bob.",Cryptocurrency,1
"bob 
then sells the coins to an exchange (not necessarily the same exchange where 
alice purchased the coins) to get the local currency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in the scenario, although 
normally it is infeasible to determine who alice and bob are, with the help of two 
cryptocurrency exchanges, it is now possible to map the transactions and identify 
two parties, alice and bob.",Cryptocurrency,1
"... extensive research 
with the rapid development in cryptocurrency technology, digital forensics 
need to keep up with the pace, hence extensive research in cryptoforensics field 
need to be conducted.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the research focuses on finding relevant artefacts that can 
help law enforcement agencies to track down illicit activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the massive adoption of 
cryptocurrency, the growing number of new technologies that have brought new 
products into the markets, and the significant rise in the prices could shift the 
taxation problem from its traditional landscape into a global, broader, and more 
complex ecosystem as in the cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"we also have described the recent development in both areas: 
cryptocurrency and digital forensics, including how existing digital forensic 
methods can be utilized to explore digital evidences with regards to 
cryptocurrency-related activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"we then discussed challenges in the areas, 
including proposals to enhance cryptoforensics.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrencies represent new payment technology, which allows payers and payees to directly  
send value to each other electronically and anonymously without the need to use the services 
of trusted third parties, like financial institutions (ex.",Cryptocurrency,1
"digital currency is 
both a virtual and a cryptocurrency (with computer encryption protecting coin supply and ownership

theoretical background / technology acceptance theories  
 
there are several social psychology based classical models of behavioral decisions and 
behavioral intentions which analyze people’s behavior when faced with something novel (pavloy, 
a).",Cryptocurrency,1
"theory of reasoned actions (tra) is a general model explaining person’s behavior based on 
the relationship between the variables beliefs-attitude-intention-behavior (fishbein and ajzen, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"this model takes into consideration the attitude towards behavior and the person’s subjective norm as 
an explanation factors for intention.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tra became a base for technology acceptance model (tam) 
which aims to explain information technology and information systems adoption behavior (davis, 
; davis, bagozzii and warshaw, , munoz, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"tam states that adoption 
behavior is determined by the intention to utilize a particular system determined by the perceived 
usefulness and ease of use.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tam states that information technology users act rationally during their 
decision whether to use technology or not.",Cryptocurrency,1
"user’s intention to use new technology depends on their 
beliefs of perceived usefulness (pu) and perceived ease of use (peu) of the technology.",Cryptocurrency,1
"pu is defined 
as the degree to which a person perceives that adopting the system will boost his/her performance.",Cryptocurrency,1
"peu 
is defined as the degree to which a person believes that adopting the system will be effortless.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tam 
model is relevant as it provides a framework by which the effect of the external variables on a system 
usage can be assessed.",Cryptocurrency,1
tam became the base for several models of innovation technology acceptance.,Cryptocurrency,1
"for example tam was extended to tam which includes social and organizational variables 
(subjective norm, image, job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability) which are shown to have 
direct impact on pu (venkatesh and davis, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"tam and utaut models continued to be 
explored and improved in new research (luarn and lin, ).there are tam (venkatesh and bala, 
), moptam- mobile phone technology acceptance model (renaud and biljon’s, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"research on new technology acceptance by different user types is ever more relevant and 
necessary in the era of disruptive innovation technologies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"tam provide a core elements and could be 
developed and expanded differently in line with the it and is innovations (venkatesh and morris, 
; lin and nguen, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"there are several primary constructs that have been recognized to strongly influence 
technology acceptance in the past research.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in 
relation to financial interactions and new payment system acceptance perceived security (security, 
risk, trust) is especially relevant in the context of financial transactions (khalilzadeh et al., ) and 
would be of critical importance for the present cryptocurrency payment adoption study.",Cryptocurrency,1
"are all explicitly identify the payer in transactions, and are centrally or quasicentrally administered 
(pomarole et al., ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in other words the user provides his account information to the merchant, and 
trusts the merchant and the processor to withdraw only the agreed-upon (folkinshtein and lennon, 
).",Cryptocurrency,1
"on the other hand cryptocurrency payment is pseudo anonymous, it do not explicitly identify 
the payer or the payee, transactions are irreversible but requires third party, a global peer-to-peer 
network, mediation which makes all transactions completely transparent (pomarole et al., ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency is a ―push-basedǁ payment system—the user creates a transaction transferring a 
specific amount to the merchant and without specific further action on the part of the user in creating a 
new transaction, no other amount can be taken.",Cryptocurrency,1
"to make an analogy to the world of cash, with 
cryptocurrency you take some cash out of your wallet and hand it to the merchant.",Cryptocurrency,1
"with the bank/credit 
card system, you give your wallet to the merchant and ask him to take out the amount you agreed upon, 
while you turn your back and do not look (sigala & christou, ; folkinshtein and lennon, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"blockchain technology and cryptocurrency and widely recognized by the scientific and 
business community as a pioneering technological innovation which contributes to the shaping of a 
new market and network (roussou and stiakakis, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"growing popularity of crypto currencies is influenced by decreasing public confidence and trust in the 
credibility of financial institutions as well as leading to new ways of transactions, without third party 
mediation (roussou and stiakakis, ) which is very popular among millennial generation (lou and 
li, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"for example bitcoin currency is considered the first application of block chain innovation 
which gradually changes the current organization and structure of the market and the financial system, 
displacing previous value systems (antonopoulus, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency payment involves fast, secure, anonymous, person to person payment via 
internet, without time or space limitation.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as block chain technology increases in popularity, 
cryptocurrency payment continue to facilitate secure electronic commercial transactions between 
organizations or individuals.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this paper focuses one the important innovation that is steadily gaining 
popularity for which adoption processes are not yet understood- cryptocurrency payment.",Cryptocurrency,1
"block chain 
is a decentralized public transaction ledger, it is transparent and immutable technology which has a 
potential of fast, cheap, peer-to-peer financial transactions (folkinshtein and lennon, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin is an entirely digital distributed currency, not dependent on any 
particular national currency or geographic location (folkinshtein and lennon, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"there are several primary constructs that have been recognized to strongly influence technology 
acceptance in the past research.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in relation to financial interactions and new payment system acceptance perceived security 
(security, risk, trust) is especially relevant in the context of financial transactions (khalilzadeh et al., 
) and would be of critical importance for the present cryptocurrency payment adoption study.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in this paper, authors adopt tam as the robust and widely used theoretical foundation for 
understating one of the latest technologies of cryptocurrency payment adoption.",Cryptocurrency,1
"we therefore propose 
to include several constructs at the same time the study of cryptocurrency payment.",Cryptocurrency,1
"following tam sequential approach authors add attitude 
construct as a mediator of the impact of perceived usefulness and ease of use on behavioral intention 
(davis, bagozzi and warshaw, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"sequential approach of tam model logic has a potential to 
enhance the explanatory power of the current study research model.",Cryptocurrency,1
"integrated research model 
proposed in this study focuses on cryptocurrency characteristics and perceived security constructs 
influence on behavioral intent.",Cryptocurrency,1
"with an empirical test of this model, this paper seeks to achieve three research purposes: ) to 
extent the explanatory power and predictive accuracy of tam model in technology acceptance studies; 
) to investigate integrated effect of technology, individual and social characteristics on business 
owners intention to use cryptocurrency payment technology in hotels; ) to address differences in 
determinants of block chain technology based cryptocurrency acceptance in hotels.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the paper is 
organized as follows: first theoretical background of the study is presented, then hypothesis are 
developed and a conceptual framework is introduced, third research method, analysis and results are 
explained and finally the findings, implication, limitations and contributions of this study are discussed.",Cryptocurrency,1

components, and how they differ from flat currencies such as cash.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a few cases that are 
related to cryptocurrency would also be discussed in order to understand their 
connection to cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"what is cryptocurrency 
cryptocurrency are digital assets that are designed to work as a medium of exchange, 
using cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, 
and to verify the transfer of assets.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrencies can be classified as a subset of 
digital currencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"what is unique regarding cryptocurrency is that they utilise 
decentralised system; in decentralised banking system, boards or governments does not 
hold control over the system.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this differs from traditional banking system, which utilises 
centralised control.",Cryptocurrency,1
"what are some of the terms associated with cryptocurrency 
there are a few terms that are closely associated with cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"brief description 
will be given below, in order to assist with understanding the later contents of this work.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptography 
cryptography is the practice and study of secure communication in the presence of a 
third party.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this also includes construction of protocols that prevent third parties, or the 
public, from reading private details within a message.",Cryptocurrency,1
"blockchain  
blockchain is a public transaction database.",Cryptocurrency,1
"blockchain also functions as a distributed 
ledger which contains list of records called blocks – linked and secured using 
cryptography.",Cryptocurrency,1
"each block contains a pointer as a link to the previous block, a timestamp, 
and transaction data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"decentralised  
a decentralised system in economy means that none actually holds control of them 
system; neither the government, nor the boards.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in other words, the government holds 
no power in setting market cap for cryptocurrencies, or how much a cryptocurrency is in 
circulation, whereas in the traditional banking system such as cash, the government 
regulates how much cash are in circulation, and setting the market cap.",Cryptocurrency,1
"digital asset 
a digital asset is anything that exists in binary format, and is able to be used for trade 
purposes.",Cryptocurrency,1
"ledger  
a ledger is a summary of all amounts entered in supporting journals which list individual 
transactions by date.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the function of a ledger is to record, and total economic 
transactions.",Cryptocurrency,1
"volatile  
cryptocurrencies are known to be volatile.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a cryptocurrency can have a high value in a 
moment, and become significantly cheaper the next moment.",Cryptocurrency,1
"such risk is common 
amongst cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"components of cryptocurrency 
cryptocurrency trading involves several key components, in which without would result 
in failure to trade cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the components are cryptocurrency keys, 
cryptocurrency wallets, blockchain, and cryptocurrency mining.",Cryptocurrency,1
"details of each 
component will be discussed below.",Cryptocurrency,1
"keys  
there are two types of keys that are essential in cryptocurrency trading: private keys and 
public keys.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a private key is stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and proves ownership of a 
public key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a public key is connected to a particular amount of cryptocurrency, and can be 
used to access that amount.",Cryptocurrency,1
"both the private and public keys are significant tools to 
maintain the security of crypto-economy.",Cryptocurrency,1
"private key 
a private key is a sophisticated form of cryptography that allows a user to access his or 
her cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a private key is an integral aspect of cryptocurrency, and its security 
helps in protecting a user from theft and unauthorized access to their cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in cryptocurrency trade, a use is commonly given a public address and a private key to 
receive cryptocurrency in a form of coins or tokens ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the private key is made up of  
alphanumeric characters, which make it hard for a hacker to obtain.",Cryptocurrency,1
the private key of a user is typically stored in a digital wallet belonging to the same user.,Cryptocurrency,1
"when a transaction is commenced, the wallet software creates a digital signature by 
processing the transaction with the private key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this symbolizes a secure system, since 
the only way to generate a valid signature for any given cryptocurrency transaction is to 
use the private key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the signature is then used to confirm that a transaction has come 
from a particular user, and ensures that the transaction cannot be changed one it has 
been broadcasted into a blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"if a transaction is altered, the signature will change 
as well.",Cryptocurrency,1
"if the private key is lost, the user can no longer access their wallet to spend, withdraw, or 
transfer cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"hence, it is imperative that to save the private key in a secure 
location.",Cryptocurrency,1
"private keys can be stored on paper wallets, or hardware such as smartcards or 
usb devices.",Cryptocurrency,1
an offline software wallet can also be used to store private keys.,Cryptocurrency,1
"this type of 
wallet has an offline portion for private keys, and an online portion which contains the 
public key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in short, a private key is an indispensable component in order to conduct a 
cryptocurrency transaction.",Cryptocurrency,1
"security measures need to be taken to prevent loss of private 
key, whether accidental, or theft by hackers.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a solution to cryptocurrency private key security was suggested by wisekey international 
holding ltd, a leading cyber security and iot company in january , about the use of a 
 
 
secure mechanical watch called wis.watch, powered by contactless secure hardware 
enabled wallet ().",Cryptocurrency,1
it was designed to offer security and ease to cryptocurrency users.,Cryptocurrency,1
"the wis.watch can securely store a user’s private key, and allows them to make 
contactless transactions.",Cryptocurrency,1
"every time a contactless blockchain transaction is initiated, 
including a bitcoin transaction, the private key must be validated by using the near field 
technology, before enabling the transaction.",Cryptocurrency,1
"while software wallets continue to be 
vulnerable to hackers, the secure hardware wallets have gained popularity.",Cryptocurrency,1
"with the 
existence of wis.watch, hardware wallets such as usb flash drives are now able to be 
used without contact, and users can establish multiple private keys into the secure store 
by using the wisewallet application, and access these private keys to make transactions 
().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the wisewallet application was said to be compatible with most of the existing 
blockchain technologies, and works as a part of payment using wisekey blockchain-as-a-
service technology offerings.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the wis.watch is also said to be able to be used as a 
unique personal key identifier and trusted device to access smartphones, applications, 
personal data, and secured cloud storage.",Cryptocurrency,1
"public key  
the public key is where cryptocurrency funds are deposited and received.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it is a 
cryptographic code that allows a user to receive cryptocurrencies into their account ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"when a user initiates their first transaction with a cryptocurrency, a unique pair of public 
key and private key is created.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the transaction would also be broadcasted to the 
network, where distributed nodes confirm the validity of the transaction, before finalising 
it and recording it on the blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was noted that before a transaction is 
broadcasted, it needed to be signed digitally using the private key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the signature would 
 
 
prove the ownership of the private key, but not divulge the details of the private key to 
anyone.",Cryptocurrency,1
"since a public key is created based on the private key, the user’s public key is used to 
prove that the digital signature came from their private key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"once the transaction has 
been verified as valid, the cryptocurrency funds are sent to the recipient’s public address.",Cryptocurrency,1
the public address is a hashed version of a public key.,Cryptocurrency,1
"since the public key is made up of 
extremely long string of numbers, it needed to be compressed and shortened, hence the 
creation of public address.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in other words, a private key generates a public key, which 
then generates a public address.",Cryptocurrency,1
"when two users agreed to conduct a transaction, they 
would reveal their public addresses to each other.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the sender needs the recipient’s public 
address to be able to send the funds to, which will then be able to spend or withdraw the 
amount using their private key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the recipient can also verify the sender’s batch of 
cryptocurrency coins using the sender’s public address, which is displayed on their 
screen.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency wallets 
cryptocurrency wallets are essential component of cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"they are digital 
wallets that are used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a cryptocurrency 
wallet is commonly used to store a private key that proves ownership of a public key, 
which is a public digital code connected to a particular amount of currency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"types of cryptocurrency wallets  
there are several types of cryptocurrency wallets, and each wallet has their advantages 
and disadvantages.",Cryptocurrency,1
"most cryptocurrency have their official wallet, or a few officially 
recommended third-party wallets.",Cryptocurrency,1
"typically, no wallet can store many cryptocurrency; 
 
 
most can only hold one, or two cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency users would need to 
figure out which wallet can store their chosen cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency wallets can also be divided into two categories: cold wallet, and hot 
wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a cold wallet is generally considered to be effective for long-term storage of 
unused funds.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a hot wallet is described as a type of wallet that is carried around for 
immediate use of the funds within.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the key difference between hot and cold wallets is 
that hot wallets are connected to the internet, whereas cold wallets are not.",Cryptocurrency,1
"hot wallets 
are also considered to be more likely targets from hackers, as they’re connected to the 
internet – cold wallets are offline/not connected to the internet; hence they’re safe from 
hackers.",Cryptocurrency,1
"due to this, it was recommended to have as many layers of protection as 
possible on hot wallets.",Cryptocurrency,1
"layers of protection can include two-factor authentication, 
strong password, and security settings.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was also thought to not have many funds in a 
hot wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the reason being that hackers can see how much funds are inside a hot wallet 
as it’s connected to the internet.",Cryptocurrency,1
lesser funds would naturally mean less appealing target.,Cryptocurrency,1
"however, despite having an offline feature to protect them from online threats, cold 
wallets are not immune to threats.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a study found that a malware can be preinstalled, or 
pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"alternatively, it can infect the 
cold wallet’s system when removable media such as usb flash drives is inserted into the 
wallet’s computer in order to conduct a transaction.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the study found that these attack 
methods have been repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade (, , , , ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"in conclusion, even though cold wallets provide a high 
 
 
degree of isolation, it is still possible for attackers to compromise such wallets and steal 
private keys from the owners.",Cryptocurrency,1
"desktop wallet  
a desktop wallet is the type that is considered more secure, when compared to both an 
online and mobile wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, the degree of security is directly related to the quality 
of the desktop’s protection against online threats, such as computer virus, and malware.",Cryptocurrency,1
"examples of desktop wallets are desktop applications, such as exodus, multibit, armory, 
and bitcoin core.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a desktop wallet also has a feature that can identify it as a ‘cold’ wallet; when not 
connected to the internet, the desktop wallet is impervious to online threats from 
hackers, viruses, etc.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a cold, desktop storage can be an older laptop that is completely 
offline, and on a clean operating system install.",Cryptocurrency,1
"some of the advantages of desktop wallets are that they are easier-to-use cryptocurrency 
wallet as compared to the others, good cold storage solution, and private keys not stored 
on a third-party server.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was noted however, that they are only great solution for a cold 
wallet, only if they have never been connected to the internet before; if they have been 
connected to the internet, they would obtain an ip address, which hackers can trace and 
use to access the desktop.",Cryptocurrency,1
"desktops can also store private keys by downloading and 
storing them - eliminating the need to rely on third-party server.",Cryptocurrency,1
"disadvantages of desktop wallets include the security concerns, when and if they are 
connected to the internet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as mentioned before, connecting to the internet would 
present the desktop with an ip address, which hackers can use to hack the desktop.",Cryptocurrency,1
"being 
able to or connected to the internet also exposes the desktop to other online threats, 
 
 
such as malware, key loggers, and viruses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"desktops are also not immune to physical 
damages.",Cryptocurrency,1
"fixing desktops by relying on service of others can expose its contents to them; 
they can examine the desktop’s contents, potentially obtaining access to cryptocurrency 
funds of the owner.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was also mentioned earlier that desktops can download private 
keys into them for storage.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this also creates a risk such as that if a backup key/s were not 
made and the desktop become disabled or inaccessible; the key/s would be lost, and 
likely impossible to retrieve.",Cryptocurrency,1
"mobile wallet 
mobile wallet is a type of wallet that is run from a phone application.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it provides access to 
cryptocurrencies via mobile devices and provides additional features via the applications; 
however, it does create security risks similar to desktop wallets when connected to the 
internet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"advantages of mobile wallets include them being practical and easier to use and access 
than other cryptocurrency wallets; mobile phones can be carried around and accessed 
anywhere, so long as there’s internet connection.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this enables users to accept, or send 
cryptocurrency payments practically from anywhere.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was also mentioned that mobile 
wallet have additional features via the applications.",Cryptocurrency,1
"one such feature includes qr code 
scanning to access cryptocurrency funds.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the disadvantage of mobile wallets is the fact that mobile phones in general are 
incredibly insecure devices; just as desktops, they can also be infected with online threats 
such as malware and viruses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"online wallet 
online wallets are commonly cryptocurrency wallets that are accessed via web browsers, 
which is why they can also be referred to as web wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"advantages of online wallets include the fact that they are the fastest way to complete 
cryptocurrency transactions, given that there is no lag between locations of the 
application and server.",Cryptocurrency,1
they are also ideal to hold small amounts of cryptocurrency.,Cryptocurrency,1
"this 
characteristic categorise them as hot wallets, and share their property; ideal for quick, 
daily transactions that does not involve massive amount of cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"some online 
wallets are also able to manage multiple cryptocurrencies, transfer between them, or be 
directly integrated into a cryptocurrency exchange marketplace.",Cryptocurrency,1
"disadvantages of online wallets include users being susceptible to phishing scams, 
malware, and insider tracking, and out-dated security measures.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the risks mentioned are 
a part of the hazard of using web browser services, and often out of the user’s control.",Cryptocurrency,1
"information relating to user’s cryptocurrency details are also out of their control, as in 
they are stored in a third-party storage, the internet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"use of online wallet requires a 
desktop, and as mentioned earlier, desktops connected to the internet are at risk from 
malware, key loggers, and viruses.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as such, it is generally not recommended to use 
services such as internet café, to reduce the risk of information theft.",Cryptocurrency,1
"hardware wallet  
hardware wallets are dedicated hardware that is built to be able to hold cryptocurrency, 
and keep it secure.",Cryptocurrency,1
"hardware wallets include usb devices, and external hard disks.",Cryptocurrency,1
"these 
devices are able to go online when connected to desktop, conduct transactions, and 
taken offline upon completion, for transportation and security.",Cryptocurrency,1
"requiring a desktop and 
 
 
internet connection to conduct transactions relating to cryptocurrency classifies this type 
of wallet as hot wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"paper wallet 
paper wallets are a medium in which stores information related to both public and 
private keys.",Cryptocurrency,1
"an example of the information stored is qr code that belonged to a private 
key.",Cryptocurrency,1
"using that qr code, a user can both send, and receive digital currency using a paper 
wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"overall, paper wallets enabled an option of not storing digital data about a user’s 
data, such as private key, by using a paper wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"mining  
cryptocurrency mining is the process of generating new cryptocurrency in the form of 
coins.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency mining is called such, from to the fact that when transactions are 
added to the public ledger that is blockchain, new coins is created, or in other word, 
mined.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency mining is an integral part of how cryptocurrency functions as a digital 
currency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the mining network relies on miners to verify and update the public ledger of 
cryptocurrency transactions, to verify that cryptocurrency users are not trying to cheat 
the system, and to add newly-discovered coins into the system.",Cryptocurrency,1
"miners 
as explained earlier, miners work together to verify transactions, ultimately mining new 
coins into the system.",Cryptocurrency,1
but that does not mean that all miners are on the same team.,Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency miners gets rewarded in the form of some new coins for their hard work 
in mining coins, but the amount of coins rewarded are directly proportional to the 
contribution a miner had in the process of generating new coins.",Cryptocurrency,1
"hence, there are 
competitions amongst cryptocurrency miners in adding new transactions into the ledger 
 
 
as part of generating new coins.",Cryptocurrency,1
"to put it simply, the more a miner contribute into adding 
new transactions into the ledger and generating coins, the more coins the miner obtains 
as rewards.",Cryptocurrency,1
"proof-of-work  
in cryptocurrency, proof-of-work is a system that utilises hard-to-compute, but easy-to-
verify functions, in order to limit exploitation of cryptocurrency mining by miners.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a proof-of-work system’s hash function is the algorithm used to find a solution to the 
computational puzzle, which is simple to calculate the output is if the input is known.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, it is virtually impossible to calculate an output, if the input is unknown; trying 
every possible input would be done until the correct input is found.",Cryptocurrency,1
"when cryptocurrency 
miners mine digital coins and add blocks of transactions to a blockchain, they effectively 
complete a proof-of-work system by using high-powered computers to solve a 
mathematical problem that is cryptographical puzzle.",Cryptocurrency,1
"one of the most popular proof-of-work functions is called sha, a part of the sha- 
family of secure hash algorithms.",Cryptocurrency,1
it is also the one that is used as bitcoin’s proof-of-work.,Cryptocurrency,1
it was first used by adam back in  as a way to block spam emails.,Cryptocurrency,1
"recently however, 
bitcoin started utilising an alternative to proof-of-work, called proof-of-stake (, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"it 
was a new proof-of-work mechanism that improves decentralisation and reduces risk of 
% attack, without increasing the risk of sybil attack – an attack in which a single node 
such as a cryptocurrency miner assumed multiple identities ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"there is a single major flaw to the proof-of-work system, and that is requiring a large 
amount of computing power, to solve cryptographical puzzle.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the proof-of-work system 
holds no use apart from protecting the validity of cryptocurrency transactions and 
 
 
generally ensuring cryptocurrency system are ran honestly.",Cryptocurrency,1
"this would mean that the 
process of mining cryptocurrency with proof-of-work is horribly wasteful, in terms of 
energy-use.",Cryptocurrency,1
"given the wasteful energy spent on proof-of-work system, it was not viewed 
as a long-term for cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"alternatives such as the aforementioned proof-of-
stake are seen as a more friendly function.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in short, proof-of-work is indeed designed to be difficult, in order to prevent malicious 
behaviour, such as a miner trying to add fake transaction block into a blockchain to get 
reward coins.",Cryptocurrency,1
"proof-of-work would not only protect digital currency such as 
cryptocurrency from malicious miners, but also prevent a single person from assuming 
control over which transaction block to next be added into the blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"how cryptocurrency are mined  
in order to add transactions into a blockchain, all miners collect all transactions that were 
recently broadcasted by cryptocurrency users, verify the transactions, and compile them 
down into a transaction block – a condensed record of all transactions for that period of 
time.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it is possible for a miner to simple create a fake transaction block and adding it into the 
blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"due to this, the cryptocurrency algorithm was designed to make 
cryptocurrency mining difficult.",Cryptocurrency,1
"to prevent a miner from adding a transaction block at 
their will, they have to solve a difficult computational puzzle – a proof-of-work scheme.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the proof-of-work scheme was designed to provide solutions that are easy to verify, but 
difficult to find.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in short, cryptocurrency miners compete against each other to see who can solve a 
difficult, cryptographic puzzle first.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as one miner found the solution, they broadcast the 
 
 
solution to all the other miners, for them to verify that the solution is correct.",Cryptocurrency,1
"if the 
solution is indeed correct, the network adds the successfully-mined transaction block to 
the accepted blockchain permanently.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the miner who was the first to successfully solve the cryptographic puzzle of transaction 
block is the rewarded for their effort, by receiving new coins – the amount of coins differs 
and depends on the transaction block size.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the possibility of reward acts as an incentive 
for cryptocurrency miners to keep investing in computational time and effort into mining 
new cryptocurrency coins.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the process of rewarding cryptocurrency miners with coins for 
their hard work of solving cryptographic puzzle also contributes to the overall 
cryptocurrency coins supply.",Cryptocurrency,1
"where cryptocurrencies are mined 
it was explained that cryptocurrencies are mined by miners, in which they solve 
cryptographical puzzle to add transactional blocks into a blockchain, creating new coins 
as a result.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as such, cryptocurrency mining can be done from practically everywhere, 
providing that the miner have access to a computer with sufficient computing power.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was also explained that mining cryptocurrency with proof-of-work in place would 
require a large amount of energy.",Cryptocurrency,1
this raised a concern such as carbon footprint ().,Cryptocurrency,1
"it 
was estimated that the combined electricity consumption for bitcoin and ethereum 
mining, which represented as high as % of the total cryptocurrency market 
capitalisation (), had already reached a staggering  terawatt-hours yearly, and is on 
the rise.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in terms of perspective, greece’s population of  million consumed close to  
terawatt-hours annually; the consumption of energy to mine bitcoins and ethereum coins 
alone nearly require as much energy as greece, a nation.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a vast majority of cryptocurrency mining (%) was done in china, and is typically 
powered by coal plants ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"with the use of life-cycle impact-assessment methodology, 
it was estimated that the annual carbon footprint for bitcoin and ethereum mining was 
comparable to that of some .",Cryptocurrency,1
"million average european inhabitants; hence the 
conclusion of the study being that the cryptocurrency industry was in need of reform to 
be more environmentally sustainable.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, despite the claim that cryptocurrency mining was environmentally hazardous, a 
different study found that findings to be economically unsound.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in a review, stuart 
wimbush mentioned a possible fault in the claim of the combined annual electricity 
consumption due to bitcoin and ethereum mining was % that of greece ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was 
found that bitcoin and ethereum generated a total wealth of us$ billion in , 
whereas the  million inhabitants of greece generated a total wealth of approximately 
us$ billion in the same year.",Cryptocurrency,1
"given that greece generated less wealth than 
cryptocurrency mining, and would have consumed much more than simply electrical 
energy in the process, it was thought that the mining of cryptocurrency seemed to be 
considerably less wasteful.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in other words, it was natural for 
cryptocurrency mining to have consumed as much power (electrical) in order to generate 
a large amount of wealth.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was also suggested for nations to transit from using fossil-
fuel-based electricity generation, to nuclear or other sustainable alternatives ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"this 
 
 
would allow generation of a large amount of wealth such as from cryptocurrency mining, 
and using a large amount of sustainable energy.",Cryptocurrency,1
"blockchain  
in terms of cryptocurrency, a blockchain is a public ledger of all a cryptocurrency’s 
transaction.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as new transactions are made, they are compiled into blocks, which will be 
added into the sequential blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in order for a transaction to be considered 
successful, it has to be added into the blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"once a transaction block is added into 
a blockchain, it will remain there permanently and are considered as public record.",Cryptocurrency,1
"other uses for blockchain 
aside from cryptocurrency, there are emerging theories in ways to utilise the blockchain 
technology.",Cryptocurrency,1
"amongst them are medicines, gun control, stock exchange, and other 
investments such as gold.",Cryptocurrency,1
"medicine  
a use of the blockchain ledger system was suggested by m. hoy in medicines ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was 
suggested to tie everything from medical records to library checkouts using a blockchain 
ledger containing verifiable time-stamped records of creation and ownership.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the system 
can also potentially prevent changes in documents, and data tampering.",Cryptocurrency,1
"gun control 
it was suggested by thomas f. heston that the blockchain used for effective gun control 
().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the blockchain protocol can be used to keep track of gun flow from manufacturer to 
end user, and track sales from a gun owner to another.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the blockchain’s anonymity 
feature would also allow better privacy than existing background check systems, and 
simultaneously link ownership of a particular gun to an individual in an immutable 
manner.",Cryptocurrency,1
"stock exchange  
in december , it was announced that asx, australia’s main stock exchange, would 
start using blockchain technology to process its equities transactions ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"asx would begin 
replacing its current system, chess, with the distributed ledger technology to help 
manage the clearing and settlement for buying and selling stocks.",Cryptocurrency,1
"asx chief executive at 
that time, dominic stevens, stated that the change into using blockchain technology 
would put australia at the forefront of innovation in the financial markets.",Cryptocurrency,1
"other investments – gold  
it is apparently possible to implement the blockchain system onto other types of 
investment.",Cryptocurrency,1
"an article was published about australia’s biggest gold refiner, perth mint, 
developing their own blockchain-based gold products, as a response to the threat posed 
by the increasing in popularity of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"richard hayes, 
chief executive of perth mint at that time, commented that the underlying blockchain 
technology behind cryptocurrencies presented an opportunity for perth mint to develop 
new products with greater security, and traceability.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in summary, blockchain has features that are beneficial to many fields.",Cryptocurrency,1
"such features 
include anti-tempering, as all records added into a blockchain are final, anonymity, and 
continual records to keep updated about a matter.",Cryptocurrency,1
"how to trade cryptocurrency  
trading cryptocurrency requires having good background knowledge, and the 
components needed to trade cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the two main components a user needed 
to start trading cryptocurrency are cryptocurrency wallet, and cryptocurrency exchange.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in terms of having good background knowledge, there are several notes to consider.",Cryptocurrency,1
"first, 
a beginner should choose a trading company with a good reputation that offers an 
 
 
exchange and a wallet.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a beginner should also trade prominent coins, as starter.",Cryptocurrency,1
"bitcoin 
and ethereum are two of the most prominent coins as of june  (, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"how to spend cryptocurrency  
one of the major concerns regarding cryptocurrency is finding ways to spend it.",Cryptocurrency,1
"conducting a search using a search engine was thought to be one of the best ways to look 
for ways, or merchants who accepts cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"gambling is also a way to spend 
cryptocurrency () 
spending cryptocurrency is not always possible, as some countries have banned trading 
of cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
some countries opted for a compromise in the form of regulations.,Cryptocurrency,1
government regulations will be discussed in more detail in a later section.,Cryptocurrency,1
"how cryptocurrencies differ from flat currencies 
as explained earlier, cryptocurrency differs from regular, flat currency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the difference lies 
in two major ways.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrencies are only accepted as payment by other users – if no 
one accepts it, then it is considered worthless.",Cryptocurrency,1
"flat currency however, will always be 
accepted as payment by the government, at the very least.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the second major difference 
is that cryptocurrency token supply is not managed by a central authority, whereas flat 
currency is managed by the government and can lead to either inflation, or deflation.",Cryptocurrency,1
"popular cryptocurrencies (latest price)  
there are thousands of cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it can be hard to determine which cryptocurrency 
is the best, or worst.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there are several parameters that can be used to rank 
cryptocurrency: their price, market cap, supply rate, and existing volume in circulation.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in 
 
 
terms of price, the four highest-ranked cryptocurrency as at june  are bitcoin, 
bitcoin cash, mixin, and ethereum ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"crime types in australia 
the types of crimes in australia will be listed, and matched with some of the cases related 
to cryptocurrency discussed below.",Cryptocurrency,1
"some of the most recent crimes in relation to cryptocurrency  
to understand more as to how cryptocurrency can be related to crimes, various case 
involving cryptocurrency in general, or a particular cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, various 
case that occurred in the last decade will be discussed below.",Cryptocurrency,1
"swoop for cases that 
occurred in the last decade was decided, as cryptocurrency, or at least the proof-of-
concept, was published in  by satoshi nakamoto ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"december  – hacking of nicehash  
one of the case examples to be explained is the cyber-attack against nicehash.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the crime 
happened on the th of december , where nicehash, a crypto-mining company 
based in slovenia, reported that their system was breached in a cyber-attack().",Cryptocurrency,1
"nicehash is known as the world’s largest crypto-mining marketplace, and was created 
based on the concept of a shared economy.",Cryptocurrency,1
"they were founded on the th of march 
, and has grown to exponential heights ever since, and harboured , 
cryptocurrency miners daily on average ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"nicehash is different from any crypto-
mining marketplace in that they applied a new system to cryptocurrency mining that 
 
 
resolved around the relationship between cryptocurrency sellers and buyers.",Cryptocurrency,1
"nicehash 
users upon registration are presented with three options.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the first option would be that 
users can choose to sell their hashing power generated from their mining hardware to 
receive earnings.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the second option would be that investors can choose to buy a package 
to mine a particular cryptocurrency at a designated set pool with the support of crypto-
algorithm.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the last option would be to be a combination of a buyer, and a seller via 
nicehash.",Cryptocurrency,1
"on more detail about the case, it was reported on newstex finance & accounting blogs 
that about , bitcoins were stolen ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the approximate worth of those stolen bitcoins 
was $ million.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was reported earlier that day, that the price of bitcoins was at a 
record-high of more than $, ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the record-high price of the bitcoin was very 
possibly be the motive of the crime, or at least tempted them to steal bitcoins.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in terms of bitcoin-theft, the case was not the first reported case in the field.",Cryptocurrency,1
"gox, a bitcoin exchange based in japan, reported a theft of , coins ().",Cryptocurrency,1
those bitcoins were worth nearly $ million at that time.,Cryptocurrency,1
"gox were shut down not 
long after the case (), and filed for bankruptcy protection in japan, later that year ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"a 
study of this case found that a meteoric rise in price and rapid growth were associated 
with cryptocurrency, particularly bitcoin – this also attracted thieves/hackers ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"in regards of the aftermaths of the case about nicehash, the ceo of nicehash at that 
time, marko kobal, had resigned following the incident (), and reimbursements were 
carried out by the company.",Cryptocurrency,1
"on the st of january, nearly two months after the hacking 
of bitcoins, the company announced that they are going to reimburse their service users 
that were affected by the security breach that occurred on th of december  ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was also reported along with the fourth stage, that % of the 
old balance amount was already reimbursed to all users that were impacted by the 
security breach.",Cryptocurrency,1
"more details about the program are unknown, or if there will be any 
more, but  given that there are four stages thus far and % of the stolen amount 
reimbursed, it can be predicted that there will be about seven more stages of 
reimbursements, with each stage reimbursing approximately % of the stolen amount.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it 
was concluded that users of blockchain are able to add non-financial data for purposes 
such as describing a transaction’s purpose, and insert benign messages or record 
information for other financial services.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the objectionable contents were found to be 
imbedded in such data, and given that blockchain are viewable by practically all users, the 
data would be downloaded and persistently stored by them.",Cryptocurrency,1
this discovery would place certain users of the bitcoin network in legal difficulties.,Cryptocurrency,1
"the 
researchers also mentioned that this discovery could pose an obstacle for greater 
adoption and mainstream acceptance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"upon 
further analysis, the researchers found that most of the files were harmless, but some of 
the files contained copyright violations and the disclosure of the people’s identifiable 
information, and at least eight files were said to containing sexual content ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"amongst 
 
 
the child pornography materials, two files were found to contain  links to child 
pornography websites, and a file depicting a nude image of a minor.",Cryptocurrency,1
"experts said that the files were likely to be downloaded as a part of notes to transactions, 
or inserted as the transactions themselves.",Cryptocurrency,1
"users of blockchain are able to add non-
financial data for purposes such as describing a transaction’s purpose insert benign 
messages, or record information for other financial services – anyone with access to 
bitcoin software such as miners, exchanges, and traders, have the ability to upload any 
content into the blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"arbitrary data insertion methods for bitcoin’s blockchain  
as explained before, aside from recording financial transactions, bitcoin’s blockchain are 
also able to be filled with non-financial data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"non-financial data can take a form of short 
messages via special transaction types, or even complete files.",Cryptocurrency,1
"to add complete files into 
a blockchain, arbitrary data has to be encoded as standard transactions.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there are two 
insertion methods for non-financial data: low-level insertion methods, and content 
insertion services.",Cryptocurrency,1
"benefits and risks of arbitrary blockchain content 
bitcoin’s blockchain design included several ways to insert arbitrary, non-financial data 
into its blockchain, both intentionally, and unintentionally.",Cryptocurrency,1
"potential benefits of engraving 
arbitrary data into the bitcoin’s blockchain and the risks associated with them will be 
discussed further below.",Cryptocurrency,1
"benefits  
bitcoin offered coinbase, a digital currency exchange headquarters, and op_return, a 
special transaction template that allows one small data chunk as an attachment onto a 
transaction, as explicit channels to insert small chunks of non-financial data into their 
 
 
blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the benefit of using op_return is that different services use op_return to 
link non-financial assets such as vouchers, to bitcoin’s blockchain.",Cryptocurrency,1
"coinbase differ from 
op_return in those only miners who dedicate significant computational contribution to 
maintain the blockchain, to be able to add extra chunks of data into the new transaction 
blocks.",Cryptocurrency,1
"risks  
there are several risks associated with adding data into blockchain content.",Cryptocurrency,1
"some of 
them are copyright violations, malware, privacy violations, politically sensitive content, 
and illegal & condemned content.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as the blockchain are akin to file-sharing networks, 
pirated data can be distributed as part of a transaction block.",Cryptocurrency,1
"malware is also a threat, as 
they can be inserted as an attachment, and if downloaded and opened, can cause 
cataclysmic damage onto the system or device.",Cryptocurrency,1
"governments have valid concerns 
regarding a leakage of classified information.",Cryptocurrency,1
"if such classified information is added into a 
blockchain, it would mean that more than a single user having the file, and the ability to 
access it, potentially exposing sensitive information about a government.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in short, there are ways for someone to add an objectionable content into a blockchain, 
and cause harm if possessed or accessed by other users.",Cryptocurrency,1
"unlike systems such as social 
media platforms, file-sharing networks, and online storage systems, contents that are 
stored in a blockchain can be do so while remaining anonymous, making it hard to trace 
the culprit.",Cryptocurrency,1
"examining the data (non-financial data) 
there are three methods to examine non-financial data in a blockchain: low-level 
insertion methods detectors, and service detectors, and suspicious transaction detectors.",Cryptocurrency,1
"low-level insertion method detectors 
the low-level insertion method detectors were designed to match individual transactions 
that are likely to contain non-financial data.",Cryptocurrency,1
"they detect manipulated financial 
transactions, as well as op_return, non-standard, and coinbase transactions.",Cryptocurrency,1
"service detectors  
the service detectors enabled the detection and extraction of files based on the service’ 
protocols, and also tracking of data used in service-created transactions.",Cryptocurrency,1
"suspicious transaction detectors  
the suspicious transaction detectors examine standard transactions that are likely to 
carry non-financial data, but were not detected.",Cryptocurrency,1
"for a transaction to be examined by this 
method, it has to have at least  suspicious outputs.",Cryptocurrency,1
"illegal drugs  
there was a reported case in india about a drug trade related to cryptocurrency ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"an 
arrest was made by the police against two university students that were caught 
purchasing drugs using cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the duo would purchase an amount of drug, 
and then have it transported into a particular place where it’ll be picked up.",Cryptocurrency,1
it was not the first case where cryptocurrency was used to purchase drugs.,Cryptocurrency,1
"there was a 
case in , where a university student sold/auction drugs via an online drug 
marketplace called ‘silk road’ ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the student had created a fake profile and auctioned 
drugs online, where customers would buy, and have it delivered to an address of their 
choice.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the method of payment was cryptocurrency, with different drugs cost different 
amount of coins.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the case was ultimately solved when police made an arrest of the 
student in a public library, where he logged in into his silk road profile.",Cryptocurrency,1
"march  
in a newspaper article published on march , it was announced that pavel lerner, a 
cryptocurrency businessman, was kidnapped in ukraine by armed assailants, and was 
forced to pay $ million ransom in the form of bitcoins from his digital wallet ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the 
case led to demands being made to the government to clamp down on cryptocurrency 
crime.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was mentioned that every month, the ukrainian police would raid the kvazar 
semiconductor plant in kiev, and seize millions of pounds in form of computer 
equipment, which were claimed to be taken by russians and used to finance the 
separatist regions of donetsk and lugansk.",Cryptocurrency,1
"base on the case examples below, in terms of type of crimes in australia by acic, 
cryptocurrency had been used in two categories of crimes: illicit drugs (silk road), 
cybercrime (hacking of nicehash).",Cryptocurrency,1
"child pornography and kidnapping did not quite fit into 
the crime categories listed, but they are serious crimes, nonetheless.",Cryptocurrency,1
"government regulations  
in response to several concerns such as environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining 
and the risks of owning cryptocurrency, several governments had decided to take actions 
against cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"actions taken include total banning, and putting regulations in 
place.",Cryptocurrency,1
"china  
china as of february  had completely banned cryptocurrency trading within their 
country.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the process actually started from september , where it was announced that 
chinese regulators declaring initial coin offerings illegal ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"this meant that 
cryptocurrency owners are not allowed to promote, much less sell, their cryptocurrency 
 
 
to anyone in the country.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the regulatory action was said to be caused by growing fear 
from initial coin offerings, which caught investors’ imagination that further leads to 
phishing activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"ultimately, cryptocurrency was banned in total starting february .",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was announced 
in an article that was published by financial news, a publication company that is affiliated 
with the people’s bank of china, that the chinese government’s recent attempts to stamp 
out digital currency trading by shutting down domestic cryptocurrency exchanges were 
not successful in completely eradicating cryptocurrency trading, and that the government 
will strengthen measures, to thoroughly remove any onshore or offshore trading 
platforms related to virtual currency trading ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"south korea 
south korea is another country that moved to regulate cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"initially, it was 
reported that south korea planned to ban cryptocurrency trading, in light of 
cryptocurrency abuse.",Cryptocurrency,1
"south korea’s justice minister at that time, park sung-ki, 
mentioned there being great concerns regarding virtual currencies (, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, as 
at mid-january , a ban had not been placed, but instead considered taxing 
cryptocurrency transactions, according to the south korean finance minister at that time, 
kim dong-yeon ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"later in the month, raids were conducted by the country’s police 
and tax agencies on major cryptocurrency exchanges for alleged tax evasion.",Cryptocurrency,1
"aside from 
alleged tax evasion case, the police were also looking for a seoul-based cryptocurrency 
exchange, over possible gambling allegations.",Cryptocurrency,1
"ultimately, the south korean government officially banned anonymous cryptocurrency 
trading commencing at the end of january  ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"this would mean that 
 
 
cryptocurrency traders could only make cryptocurrency transactions from bank accounts 
set up under their real names.",Cryptocurrency,1
"ukraine & kazakhstan 
ukraine had started to intensify the search for methods to regulate cryptocurrencies, due 
to growing concerns in their capital, kiev, that exploitation of the digital assets by 
criminals and geopolitical adversaries presented a growing national security risk ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"ukraine’s national security and defence council chief, oleksandr turchynov, warned that 
the current legal vacuum posed a threat to the economy and security of the state.",Cryptocurrency,1
"he also 
mentioned that given the rapid development of cryptocurrencies around the world, the 
issue could not be left out of attention, hence the plans to develop regulations.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the 
soaring prices of cryptocurrency have made the market an increasingly lucrative target 
for cyber criminals.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there was also a growing concern among regulators and governments 
that cryptocurrency could be used by organised crime-groups for money laundering (, 
), and other criminal activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in a response to growing concerns of cryptocurrency being used, or simply being related 
to crimes, the kazakhstan association of blockchain and cryptocurrency submitted a 
proposal to the eurasian economic union (eaeu) to create an advisory board on 
blockchain and cryptocurrency ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the proposal was submitted during the 
cryptoconference  in almaty, and had gathered some support for governments to 
adopt legislation to regulate the cryptocurrency market.",Cryptocurrency,1
"conference participants were 
pushing for the adoption of cryptocurrency laws within the eaeu in order to protect the 
best interests of all market from third parties such as cryptocurrency exchange 
marketplace.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the regulation also aimed to prevent the use of cryptocurrency as a tool for 
 
 
illegal transactions, the legalisation of proceeds from crime, and the financing of 
terrorism.",Cryptocurrency,1
"australia  
as of april , new laws for digital currency exchange (dce) providers operating in 
australia were implemented by austrac, australia’s financial intelligence agency, anti-
money laundering, and counter-terrorism financing regulator (amf/ctf) ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"the new 
laws would cover regulation of service providers of cryptocurrency, such as 
cryptocurrency exchange marketplace.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the austrac ceo, nicole rose, announced that the new laws would strengthen the 
agency’s compliance and intelligence capabilities to help dces implement systems and 
controls that can minimise the risk of criminals using them for purposes such as money 
laundering, terrorism financing, and cybercrime.",Cryptocurrency,1
"with the new laws in place, dces with a business operation located in australia must now 
register with austrac, and meet the government’s aml/ctf compliance and reporting 
obligations.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the transition period were run until may , to allow dces time to register 
them.",Cryptocurrency,1
"corporate regulations  
countries are not the only one capable of banning, or at least regulating 
cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was found that massive corporations such as google, and apple, have 
also moved to regulate cryptocurrency – cryptocurrency mining, to be exact.",Cryptocurrency,1
"google 
on the rd of april , it was reported that google had decided to start cracking down 
on malicious cryptocurrency mining via extensions on their website platform, google 
 
 
chrome ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"until that period, google chrome’s web policy had been permitting 
cryptocurrency mining in their extensions, providing that cryptocurrency mining was 
indeed an extension’s single purpose of use, and that the user is adequately informed of 
the cryptocurrency mining behaviour.",Cryptocurrency,1
"unfortunately, it was found that approximately % of extensions with cryptocurrency 
mining scripts that developers have attempted to upload to the chrome web store failed 
to comply with google chrome’s policies ().",Cryptocurrency,1
"that resulted in their rejection or removal 
from the store, according to james wagner, extensions platform product manager, 
explained in a blog post.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it was then decided that chrome web store would no longer 
accept extensions that mine cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, the currency existing extensions 
with blockchain-related purposes other than cryptocurrency mining would still continue 
to be permitted in the web store.",Cryptocurrency,1
"apple  
apple is one of the latest companies to ban cryptocurrency mining on their devices ().",Cryptocurrency,1
it began with the release of a new set of developer guideline updates.,Cryptocurrency,1
"virtual currencies 
such as cryptocurrency heavily rely on cryptocurrency mining to sustain their existence.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the process required using a computer’s processing power in order to obtain fractions of 
coins – this consumes an incredible amount of power.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the power drains could potentially 
end up leading to a higher electricity bill, surpassing the price of what are mined.",Cryptocurrency,1
"it could 
also put a significant burden on the mining device.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the reason of apple banning 
cryptocurrency mining seemed to be caused by the latter concern, as they banned 
cryptocurrency mining on their devices due to power consumption, and the potential of 
the process to put unnecessary pressure on the devices.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in summary, some countries actively ban cryptocurrency, while others opted to 
compromise by placing regulations in place.",Cryptocurrency,1
"concerns regarding cryptocurrency being 
used for crime seemed valid, but with regulations such as the new law implemented by 
australia’s austrac would ensure transparency of dces, and assist in solving crimes by 
having decs registered in the system, and keeping track into their activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the new law 
would also help in monitoring decs for any sign of criminal activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"conclusion  
in conclusion, cryptocurrency indeed have a relation to crimes.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there have been cases 
where cryptocurrency was used to commit a crime such as purchasing a drug, kidnapping 
a person and demand ransom in the form of cryptocurrency, and hacking into a 
cryptocurrency marketplace to steal cryptocurrency.",Cryptocurrency,1
"based on the crime types listed by 
acic, two crime categories have been proved to be related to cryptocurrency: 
cybercrime, and illicit drugs.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in response to crimes related to cryptocurrency being 
committed, laws were put in place in several countries.",Cryptocurrency,1
"some laws were implemented to 
ban cryptocurrency completely such as in china, whereas others such as south korea and 
australia opted to regulate cryptocurrencies as opposed to completely banning them.",Cryptocurrency,1
"as 
cryptocurrency are able to continue to rise, so too are the number of people that accept 
them as payments – this can be a cause for a crime.",Cryptocurrency,1
"in this study, there was no search 
conducted on the relation between cryptocurrency against other crime types such as 
violence and arson.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a future study concerning the relation between cryptocurrency and 
other crime types, including the lesser ones, would be helpful in identifying more ways 
cryptocurrency can be used, or related to a crime – this can help in placing laws, or create 
methods to counter, or solve those crimes.",Cryptocurrency,1

"today there is no single internationally recognized definition of cryptocurrency, which 
would clearly reveal its essence and economic nature.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the development of the conceptu-
alization of the cryptocurrencies phenomenon became relevant only in recent years that 
happened due to the emergence of hundreds of new cryptocurrencies, blockchain plat-
forms and strengthening their role in the modern financial system.",Cryptocurrency,1

legal and theoretical aspects of the cryptocurrency disclosure as an economic category 
without affecting the questions of its practical use as an investment tool.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, despite the existing achievements in this field, cryptocurrency conceptual 
foundations in the global economy with a clear definition of the cryptocurrency roles in 
world processes require further disclosure and more detailed studies.",Cryptocurrency,1

basis in the global economy.",Cryptocurrency,1

the works of scientists, the statistics of the origin, development and dynamics of the 
cryptocurrency functioning.",Cryptocurrency,1
"the study was conducted on the basis of dialectical, analytical, 
systematic methods and scientific abstraction.",Cryptocurrency,1
"for comparison of the price dynamics 
for different types of cryptocurrency mathematical method of correlation analysis was 
applied.",Cryptocurrency,1
"there are  main definitions of the «cryptocurrency» concept in scientific circles as:
.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a form of digital currency, whose emisson and accountingare based on asymmet-
ric encryption and the use of different cryptographic protection methods (angel, );
.",Cryptocurrency,1
"innovative payment network and a new form of money that uses the pp (people-
to-people) technology, that operates without a central controlling authority or the bank, 
transaction processing and emissions are produced collectively by the efforts of the net-
work (gervais, );
.",Cryptocurrency,1
"a special kind of electronic money that is based on a decentralized mechanism of 
issue and circulation and has a complex system of information and technological proce-
dures that are built on cryptographic methods of protection, governing the identification 
of owners and fixation of their changes facts (ober, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"a key feature of cryptocurrencies is the lack of any internal or external administra-
tor.",Cryptocurrency,1
"therefore, banks, tax, judicial and other public or private bodies may not affect the 
transactions of all participants in the payment system (kobrin, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"such a situation 
facilitates the anonymous use of the cryptocurrency and provides the irreversibility of the 
deals, so no one can cancel, block, challenge or be forced to make a transaction without 
access to the private key of the owner.",Cryptocurrency,1
"generally, cryptocurrency developers are setting a first upper limit for the total 
emissions.",Cryptocurrency,1
"however, some cryptocurrencies have no fixed upper limit of emissions with 
possible reverse process of demission (by annihilating a small fixed amount in each 
transaction).",Cryptocurrency,1
"the emergence of cryptocurrencies has led to the emergence of a new phenomenon, 
that is difficult to be classified in the financial and industrial activities.",Cryptocurrency,1
"for instance, mining – 
is the process of obtaining compensation in the form of a certain number of cryptocur-
rency for the use of their computing power to verify each next block of payments.",Cryptocurrency,1
the cryptocurrencies also has some disadvantages.,Cryptocurrency,1
"the main one is the high price 
volatility, which affects the incentives for the accumulation of such currency and increases 
the cost of hedging (volatility of gold averages around .%, while other major currencies 
average between , % to , %).",Cryptocurrency,1
"other crucial drawback of cryptocurrencies is the low

provide any legal or regulatory protection for users of cryptocurrency (this group includes 
most countries of the world); .",Cryptocurrency,1
"venezuela until recently was 
an extreme opponent of of the cryptocurrencies usage, however, in it announced 
the introduction of the national cryptocurrency, which aims to improve the economic 
situation of the country.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency as the financial trend of a new generation attracts the attention not 
only of scientists, it-experts and corporate sector, but also creates «schools» that represent 
their vision of the concept of cryptocurrencies, and its use in the future.",Cryptocurrency,1
"concerning the 
use of cryptocurrency bitcoin, there are two main way of seeing the applicability of this 
currency (figure ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"the first group consists of the so-called «bitcoin radicals» who believe that the 
cryptocurrency will be used as a complete substitute for modern currency and money in 
the traditional sense, but their purpose has rather ideological arguments rather than real 
solutions to the modern monetary problems (greenspans, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"the second group – representatives of the «аltchain» – see cryptocurrencyas more 
than just a sharing tool.",Cryptocurrency,1
"cryptocurrency is a new tool of enrichment, which brings a 
lot of prospects (penney, ).",Cryptocurrency,1
"this group consists of investors, in the classic sense  –

we cannot lie.",Genetic engineering,2

used to fulfill one’s own goals, and we cannot intentionally harm.",Genetic engineering,2

quite similar to an economic theory.",Genetic engineering,2

justifiable or not based on what a behavior produces and not the path it took to get to that 
outcome.",Genetic engineering,2

crispr-cas technology, in its current condition, to eliminate risk or determinate genes of 
alzheimer’s disease?",Genetic engineering,2

 a middle-aged couple had been attempting to conceive a child and they just found out 
that the woman is pregnant.",Genetic engineering,2

father is positive for the mutated apolipoprotein ε- (apoe-) gene that is the major precursor 
for the formation of β-amyloid plaques, and therefore a large precursor for alzheimer’s disease.",Genetic engineering,2

the apoe- gene.",Genetic engineering,2
"they have the belief that they should do anything and everything to make sure 
that their child has the best and longest life possible.",Genetic engineering,2
"after screening, it is determined that the 
embryo also carries the mutated apoe- gene that is a precursor for alzheimer’s.",Genetic engineering,2
"they decide 
that they want to use current genetic engineering technology, the crispr-cas system, in order 
to edit out the mutated gene and replace it with a normal one.",Genetic engineering,2
"however, the couple’s physician is 
skeptical about using the technology in its current state to perform this procedure.",Genetic engineering,2
"is it ethically 
justifiable for the couple and the physician to do go ahead with the editing of the embryo?",Genetic engineering,2
"my 
conclusion, as shown in the arguments below, is that at the current state of the crispr-cas 
technology, it is not ethically justifiable for the couple to edit out the mutated apoe- gene from 
their growing embryo.",Genetic engineering,2
"case study : analyzing deontological theory 
 editing the mutated gene out of the couple’s embryo would violate major aspects of 
deontological theory.",Genetic engineering,2
"first of all, it can be argued that the couple is not currently relying on 
rational thought.",Genetic engineering,2
"although it could be argued that wanting to do everything for your child is 
  
rational, in this case the parents are not scientists that know the small details of the unintended 
consequences, even if they have been informed of these consequences by their physician.",Genetic engineering,2
"they 
are trying to do everything possible to help their child, and even though editing out the mutated 
gene is possible, it is not rationally okay to do in its current state.",Genetic engineering,2
"as stated in the previous 
section, the scientific issues of unintended base changes and mosaicism could lead to 
consequences we have not yet discovered or predicted.",Genetic engineering,2
"even though the couple wants to use it to 
possibly eliminate the risk of alzheimer’s or alleviate later symptoms of alzheimer’s in their 
future child, they are not considering the possible side effects.",Genetic engineering,2
"although alzheimer’s could be 
gone, many other complications, which possibly could be fatal, could arise from the use of the 
crispr-cas system.",Genetic engineering,2
"from the physician and scientist standpoint, the physician would be violating 
deontological theory as he would be using someone else in order to reach his own goal of 
eliminating and/or alleviating alzheimer’s disease, especially knowing that there could be 
possible consequences.",Genetic engineering,2
"deontological theory states that we cannot use others to achieve personal 
goals.",Genetic engineering,2
"he has the obligation to give the best possible care to each patient he encounters, and to 
make sure that he helps the patient become as healthy as possible.",Genetic engineering,2
"knowing that there are 
possible detrimental consequences of using the crispr-cas technology in its current state 
would be violating the commitment he made when he became a physician.",Genetic engineering,2
"kant places a lot of emphasis on the importance of the rational person, and how humans 
must be considered rational in order to make the decision of what is right and wrong.",Genetic engineering,2
"around the 
age of -, kant allows children moral status because they are then capable of rational 
thought.",Genetic engineering,2
"according to this theory, embryos are not capable of rational thought and do not have 
moral standing.",Genetic engineering,2
"however, the embryos will eventually develop into infants and later adults with 
  
a moral standing.",Genetic engineering,2
"kant would originally discount the moral standing of embryos, but they do 
have potential to eventually develop rational thought, which must be considered in the 
deontological analysis of each of the following case studies.",Genetic engineering,2
"in the real world, deontological 
theory would not apply to these embryos that we are able to genetically manipulate until they are 
capable of rational thought.",Genetic engineering,2
"kant also states, as a part of deontological theory, that no person can be simply used to 
fulfill one’s own goals.",Genetic engineering,2
"this applies in the sense that embryos cannot give consent at the time 
they would be edited, and when they reach the point of rational thought we have already violated 
the prohibition against using them for our own personal goals without their permission and 
consent.",Genetic engineering,2
"case study : analyzing consequentialist theory 
 not only through the theory of deontology, but also through the consequentialist theory, 
the gene editing of this embryo would not be ethically justifiable.",Genetic engineering,2
"in this theory, we are trying to 
act in a way where the outcome produces the greatest good for the greatest number.",Genetic engineering,2
"in the 
scenario described above, the physician would be editing a gene that is in the embryo’s germline, 
which means that the edited would be passed on to future generations.",Genetic engineering,2
"since the crispr-cas 
technology is not at the current state of a % success rate, or even a very high success rate, he 
could be causing more harm to the masses than good, which would violate this aspect of 
consequentialism.",Genetic engineering,2
"through a cost-benefit analysis (as this theory is similar to economic 
theories), the risk of harm resulting from performing this procedure in this scenario greatly 
outweighs the benefits, as the unpredicted consequences could end up to be more fatal than 
alzheimer’s.",Genetic engineering,2
"unlike the theory of deontology, however, the consequentialist theory allows for sacrifice 
of the individual to save the many (i.e.",Genetic engineering,2
one is able to use others to accomplish personal goals).,Genetic engineering,2
"following this principle, it would be okay to try to edit the germline of this embryo in order to 
observe the outcome.",Genetic engineering,2
"even if the outcome were detrimental rather than successful, it would still 
provide new research and new observations on what may happen when altering a human embryo, 
and therefore could help the masses in the future.",Genetic engineering,2
"however, this still would violate the other 
concepts of consequentialist theory.",Genetic engineering,2
"going along with the same concept of providing the greatest good for the greatest 
number, it could also be argued the opposite way, that it would not be providing good for the 
greatest number.",Genetic engineering,2
"using crispr-cas, with its known complications, could easily cause more 
harm than good, as stated above, especially in the discussion of editing the germline and not just 
somatic cells.",Genetic engineering,2
"in this sense, using the technology and harming the human embryo would not 
provide the greatest good to the greatest number as it would not only harm the human embryo 
but also emotionally harm the parents and others involved in the procedure, as well as harm all of 
the future offspring of the embryo.",Genetic engineering,2
"case study : analyzing non-maleficence 
 the physician, in this case, is also clearly violating the medical ethics principle of non-
maleficence.",Genetic engineering,2

from performing an act or not performing one at all.",Genetic engineering,2

removing harm from any patient and to always be of benefit to the patient.",Genetic engineering,2

 we project ourselves into a future in which multiple studies and trials with the crispr-

changes, etc.",Genetic engineering,2
"(the problems explained in the previous chapter) have been reduced to a %

to screen your fertilized embryo for the diseases that are being edited by crispr-cas, attend a

perform this procedure on this specific family because this family is only one of the extreme few

out would be those of wealthy upper-class families.",Genetic engineering,2

by insurance, it would be extremely expensive.",Genetic engineering,2

financial aspect, and the gap created would render the technology ethically un-justifiable.",Genetic engineering,2

"the current framework of diversification and adaptation
tenets of the current, widely-held conceptual framework used to 
characterize diversification and adaptation are defined by muller 
():
in a condensed form, these tenets are as follows: (i) all 
evolutionary explanation requires the study of populations 
of organisms; (ii) populations contain genetic variation 
that arises randomly from mutation and recombination; 
(iii) populations evolve by changes in gene frequency 
brought about by natural selection, gene flow and drift; 
(iv) genetic variants generate slight phenotypic effects 
and the resulting phenotypic variation is gradual and 
continuous; (v) genetic inheritance alone accounts for 
the transmission of selectable variation; (vi) new species 
arise by a prevention of gene flow between populations 
that evolve differently; (vii) the phenotypic differences 
that distinguish higher taxa result from the incremental 
accumulation of genetic variation; (viii) natural selection 
represents the only directional factor in evolution (p. ).",Genetic engineering,2
"muller’s equivalence of diversification and adaptation with 
evolution is questioned by those in creationist and intelligent design 
circles.",Genetic engineering,2
"the principle 
incongruities which prompted the  royal society meeting 
are recently identified mechanisms regularly characterized with 
non-random descriptors such as: biased and directional, rapid, 
predictable, and repeatable (table  lists multiple examples).",Genetic engineering,2
"these findings are contrary to the classic framework of gradual 
diversification and adaptation resulting from random variation 
fractioned out through diverse death-driven scenarios where 
survival and reproduction are highly dependent on “luck” (snyder 
and ellner ).",Genetic engineering,2
"accordingly, there is a growing insistence on 
modification of this framework (laland et al.",Genetic engineering,2
"some believe the current framework is so out-of-date that it 
still fails to incorporate knowledge of developmental regulatory 
mechanisms into both theoretical population genetics and genetic 
accommodation theory (laland et al.",Genetic engineering,2

true, criticizing the current framework as merely “out-of-date” may 
be misidentifying the problem.",Genetic engineering,2

the current framework is that the basic tenets of the framework—

are fundamentally incompatible with recent discoveries.",Genetic engineering,2
"adaptive 
mechanisms characterized as regulated, rapid, repeatable, and 
predictable are anomalous precisely because those words seem to 
describe the purposeful outcomes of engineered systems.",Genetic engineering,2

that there are good reasons to incorporate this approach into a

be discovered that will operate by different engineering principles

operating or could be operating?",Genetic engineering,2
"therefore, researchers open to 
intelligent causation for living creatures should expect to find an 
ever-increasing resemblance of biological function to sophisticated 
engineering.",Genetic engineering,2
"since creatures were commanded to “fill the earth” (genesis :, 
; :; :, ) which was a highly dynamic place after creation 
and the flood, design-guided biological researchers should begin to 
identify the basic engineering principles governing the operation of 
systems which appear to self-adjust to dynamic external conditions 
(i.e., the how of biological adaptation).",Genetic engineering,2
"incorporating several 
broad observations and re-interpreting them in this light will form 
a new description of what organisms achieve when they adapt (i.e., 
the design objective for what they are doing).",Genetic engineering,2
"further, there is a 
growing body of evidence that appears to indicate that recently-
discovered regulated mechanisms enable organisms to actively 
and continuously track environmental changes.",Genetic engineering,2
"for instance, 
organisms appear to quickly respond to significant environmental 
changes—often making surprisingly rapid adaptations—and then 
more gradually adapt to conditions during periods with relatively 
little environmental change (reigner ).",Genetic engineering,2
"we posit that organisms are continuously tracking 
environmental changes and responding with suitably self-adjusted

generationally—resulting in adaptation.",Genetic engineering,2

entities to search for: corresponding systems and their elements, 
mechanisms, engineering principles fundamental to operation, and 
assembly processes to assist in research.",Genetic engineering,2

what are the elements of biological systems that should correspond 
to man-made tracking systems?",Genetic engineering,2
"tracking systems are generally 
part of larger, robust, adaptive control systems.",Genetic engineering,2
"these follow 
the movement of a select “target” within a specified “field of 
view” and elicit response per a predetermined algorithm.",Genetic engineering,2
"these 
“surveillance systems” use one or more sensors, coupled to a 
computer system, that gather and interpret incoming data about 
uncertain environments.",Genetic engineering,2
"there are three irreducible elements common to all tracking 
systems: ) sensors to detect pre-specified conditions; ) condition-
consequence logic mechanisms that process information by 
specifying if (+) condition then (+) consequential output response, 
and ) output responses which adjust activities to effectively pursue 
a target (blackman and popoli ; ioannou and sun.",Genetic engineering,2
"(if 
navigation or interception at a precise location is desired, then a 
chronometer or circadian device to measures time is also an essential 
element.)",Genetic engineering,2
"if the cet hypothesis is correct, we would expect to find 
biological mechanisms with corresponding irreducible elements 
that are recognizable by the following characteristics:
() sensors.",Genetic engineering,2
"the element linking the system to its environment is 
the sensor.",Genetic engineering,2
"understanding three key characteristics of how sensors integrate 
into systems helps illuminate important details of the relationship 
between an entity and exposures.",Genetic engineering,2
"first, sensors are exquisitely 
designed to be selective by specifying the environmental conditions 
to which they will be sensitive and insensitive.",Genetic engineering,2
"sensors should 
minimally disturb the condition being monitored so its “true value” 
remains.",Genetic engineering,2
"second, a sensor must be ready to collect data by means 
of detecting a condition, often by “active surveillance.” third, 
sensors are an integral part of the system.",Genetic engineering,2
"this relationship may be 
difficult to see since sensors are often remotely located.",Genetic engineering,2
"sophisticated internal logic mechanisms 
are currently being designed as more than basic if-then types of on-
off switches (or gates.)",Genetic engineering,2
"engineers are patterning logic mechanisms 
in tracking systems after the nervous system in living organisms 
so that they function as artificial neural networks.",Genetic engineering,2
"ioannou () 
believes his approach to adaptive control systems “…will be of 
great interest to the neural and fuzzy logic audience who will 
benefit from the strong similarity that exists between adaptive 
systems, whose stability properties are well established, and neural 
networks, fuzzy logic systems where stability and convergence 
issues are yet to be resolved” (p. xiv).",Genetic engineering,2
"the logical programming 
may be extraordinarily complex and mathematically rigorous to 
process the array of incoming variables, especially when multiple 
sensors are tracking multiple moving targets (oh et al.",Genetic engineering,2
"advanced logical programming integrates data from multiple 
sensors with pre-programmed ranges to further reduce target-
tracking uncertainties by filtering out useless data or “noise” and to 
make determinations on the validity of data prior to specifying an 
output response (luo et al.",Genetic engineering,2
"the final step in tracking is to respond to 
target movements.",Genetic engineering,2
"though the response is usually a necessary 
consequence when specific conditions are encountered, responses 
can range from a simple discreet on-off action, to a continuous 
range produced by an algorithm utilizing input variables.",Genetic engineering,2
"this 
is illustrated in the multiple uses for tracking eye movements 
which range from medical diagnostics, refractive surgery, human-
computer interfaces, and commercial marketing (gneo et al.",Genetic engineering,2
"responses may be integral to a tracking system itself, such as a 
mechanism using stepping motors to keep a solar panel tracking 
the sun’s movement.",Genetic engineering,2
"implications of this hypothesis help clarify biological adaptability
a fundamental design constraint is that the capacities for a designed 
entity to both relate to—and adapt to—external conditions must be 
built entirely into an entity.",Genetic engineering,2
"in terms of external conditions, these are 
insufficient to cause changes to an internal system’s function.",Genetic engineering,2
"an 
engineer would identify conditions pertinent to performance and 
may specify some (amongst a myriad of conditions) as variables 
that are either present or not.",Genetic engineering,2
"the implication of the utilization 
of engineering principles and causation is reflected in the second 
half of our engineering-based, organism-focused characterization 
which keeps the operational spotlight on the organism rather than 
the environment.",Genetic engineering,2
"an engineering approach focuses on whole systems and not 
individual elements.",Genetic engineering,2
"since the entire system ceases to function 
with the loss of any vital element, then, no single element is 
declared to be causal.",Genetic engineering,2

no vital element is omitted—in causal chains.",Genetic engineering,2

of the paper) lists  different highly regulated, non-random 
mechanisms that would not be classified as environmentally 
fractionated heterozygosity, but instead confer phenotypic diversity 
through other means to enable (usually) rapid adaptation to new 
environments.",Genetic engineering,2
"the reference section and table  identify many of 
the major source materials, but not all those reviewed.",Genetic engineering,2
"findings were analyzed for correspondence of mechanisms 
utilized in living organisms to elements of human-engineered 
tracking systems.",Genetic engineering,2
"results were also investigated to answer specific 
questions about adaptive mechanisms: do published results identify 
a predominant mechanism for adaptation utilized by organisms?",Genetic engineering,2
"is modification of genetic sequence the principle mechanism to 
express phenotypic changes?",Genetic engineering,2
"could variations be categorized, 
irrespective of genetic or epigenetic causality, in discernable 
patterns that would give clues that organisms were tracking 
environmental changes?",Genetic engineering,2
"the final area investigated involved 
cataloging mechanisms of adaptation that could potentially lead to 
speciation or other diversification events.",Genetic engineering,2

a remarkable number of non-random mechanisms specifically 
directing variable, adaptive responses to changes in distinct 
environmental conditions were reported.",Genetic engineering,2
"several of the following 
examples thoroughly describe the chain from exposure to a changed 
condition to a phenotypic response by identifying sensors, logic 
mechanisms, and an output.",Genetic engineering,2
"these were analogous to the elements 
of human-engineered tracking systems.",Genetic engineering,2
"the significance of these 
results as evidence for the cet framework is withheld until the 
discussion section.",Genetic engineering,2
"by way of overview, results can be grouped into systems-based 
adaptive mechanisms and phenotypic responses.",Genetic engineering,2
"non-random 
phenotypic output responses could be traced to both genetic and 
epigenetic mechanisms.",Genetic engineering,2
"responses encompass modifications 
to physiological systems involved in maintaining cellular and 
organismal homeostasis.",Genetic engineering,2
"external modifications ranging from 
color variation to the total non-development of organs, major 
morphotypic reformations, and alterations in behavior.",Genetic engineering,2
"some 
responses happened in a single organism within minutes, while 
others were found to affect entire populations and persist for several 
generations.",Genetic engineering,2
"other novel responses did not result directly from 
either genetic or epigenetic changes but were the consequence of 
internal processes initiated upon detection of changed conditions.",Genetic engineering,2
"of particular note was the identification of certain mechanisms and 
phenotypic responses which are both predictable and reversible.",Genetic engineering,2
"we further subcategorize variations as developmental responses 
(both embryonic and juvenile)—these are the primary drivers of 
morphology—and adult responses, which directly influence the 
distribution of traits in diverse niches.

the development of blind cave fish, astyanax mexicanas, from a 
population of sighted river fish is the subject of active research.",Genetic engineering,2
"a critical question was how a river fish finding itself suddenly 
trapped in a cave environment would respond.",Genetic engineering,2
"rohner et al () 
investigated the activity of a common stress-related chaperone 
protein hsp  [heat shock protein ] which has wide-ranging 
activity in cells, including a molecular mechanism for buffering 
latent, adaptable genetic variation (if present in the genome) and 
expressing it in response to differing environmental conditions.",Genetic engineering,2
"the target environmental condition was cave water abiotic factors 
(but not the presence of light.)",Genetic engineering,2
"caves have other distinguishing 
conditions besides darkness.",Genetic engineering,2
"the ability of water to conduct 
electricity may show up to a five-fold decrease in cave water 
compared to surface streams.",Genetic engineering,2
"the authors presupposed that a. 
mexicanas, would respond (by an undescribed mechanism) to 
fluctuations in water conductivity.",Genetic engineering,2
"they showed that fish embryos 
which develop in low conductivity up-regulate hsp  response 
genes, which enabled expression of innate variability in eye size 
ranging from slightly decreased to absent within the first generation.",Genetic engineering,2
"river fish placed in low conductivity during larval development 
displayed a % increase in eye and orbit size variation.",Genetic engineering,2
"additional 
tests showed that de novo mutations did not cause these genetic 
variations for small eye size, and after being “unmasked” they 
seemed to remain expressed in offspring.",Genetic engineering,2
"for various reptiles including some lizards, snakes, turtles, and 
alligators, a single clutch of eggs may all converge on the same 
sex (sifuentes-romero ).",Genetic engineering,2

heteromorphic chromosomes, but by a developmental program 
using data they collect about their incubating temperature during 
a temperature-sensitive period.",Genetic engineering,2
"all females develop at one 
temperature, all males at another, and a ratio of both sexes at 
temperatures in between (ratios are further modulated by added 
data on sand moisture content.)",Genetic engineering,2

"b. juvenile development
phenotypic plasticity refers to the expression of different 
combinations of traits from a single genotype as an organism 
responds to different environmental conditions.",Genetic engineering,2
"plasticity is a 
broader description for a graded response that usually correlates 
to the quantity of exposure to certain conditions.",Genetic engineering,2
"polyphenism is a type 
of plasticity where discrete, all-or-nothing expressions of traits 
happens upon exposure—usually to a threshold level.",Genetic engineering,2
"the change 
in color of an artic fox’s fur from grey-brown to white in the fall is 
an example of seasonal polyphenism.",Genetic engineering,2
"the significance of phenotypic plasticity to diversification and 
adaptation is described by west and packer () who say that 
the “environmental effects on trait morphology can be substantial, 
outweighing both genetic effects and reproductive advantages” (p. 
).",Genetic engineering,2
"a few illustrations highlight the importance of external-
condition detectors to initiate developmental, physiological, 
phenotypic, or behavioral changes, and the extent to which these 
changes could lead to speciation and diversification.",Genetic engineering,2
"observable phenotypic differences that distinguish species, 
and certainly genera, are assumed to be the result of genetic 
polymorphisms.",Genetic engineering,2
but this assumption may not be accurate.,Genetic engineering,2
"() report experiments which indicate that some genera-level 
morphotypes of a fig-associated nematode pristionchus are the result 
of polyphenism and not genetic polymorphism.",Genetic engineering,2
"upon colonizing 
the island-like microecosystem of individual figs, symbiotic 
nematodes of the genus pristionchus expressed a polyphenism with 
up to five discrete adult morphotypes per species.",Genetic engineering,2
"the principle 
target condition in this study was found to be both fig type and fig 
maturation.",Genetic engineering,2
"since juvenile development cannot be cultured outside 
of figs, any environmental cues detected during development 
associated with differing morphs cannot be identified.",Genetic engineering,2
"yet, the five 
major morphotypes identified were associated with fig type, fig 
phase (early and late interfloral), and transit on, versus through, 
their specific wasp vector (ceratosolen spp.).",Genetic engineering,2
"genetic sequencing 
demonstrated that from a single genotype, developmental plasticity 
had led to discontinuous novelties whose variation exceeded level 
of genera in the same family.",Genetic engineering,2

of “macroevolutionary-scale” diversification, with some structures 
having no analogs in other nematodes, without genetic divergence.",Genetic engineering,2

developmental phenotypic adjustment when exposed only to 
aquarium tank water that had harbored dragonfly larvae of the 
tadpole predators aeshna or anax.",Genetic engineering,2

() document that tadpoles have exquisite capability to, “detect 
waterborne chemical” substances “produced by predators” (p. ).",Genetic engineering,2

which increased their probability to escape future predation better 
than tadpoles isolated from predator exposure during development.",Genetic engineering,2

determine whether a plastic trait expressed in one generation could 
be passed on to offspring which themselves experienced variable 
levels of the exposure during their development.",Genetic engineering,2
"he concluded that 
“predator-induced traits can frequently be heritable, although the 
magnitude of heritability can be wide ranging across environments.",Genetic engineering,2
"moreover, the plasticity of these defenses also can be heritable” 
(p.).",Genetic engineering,2
"multiple studies identify an exquisite detection-response linkage 
in some organisms.",Genetic engineering,2
"they detect the presence of predators, respond 
with phenotypic adjustments either during development or as 
adult forms, and then pass a tendency for the adjusted form on 
to offspring.",Genetic engineering,2
"stabell and lwin () conducted experiments to 
determine elements of an underlying mechanism that might explain 
why the body depth and muscle mass of crucian carp, carassius 
carassius, increases in the presence of the predator northern pike, 
esox lucius.",Genetic engineering,2
"they demonstrated that crucian carp did not respond 
with growth changes after exposure to either the pike itself, nor 
to pike-fed arctic char, salvelinus alpinus.",Genetic engineering,2
"morphological changes 
occurred only after carp were exposed to pike which had been 
feeding on other crucian carp, or when exposed to water containing 
skin tissue (prepared and homogenized) of conspecifics.",Genetic engineering,2
"they 
conclude that chemical substances from the skin of conspecific fish 
are a stimulus for induction of the phenotypical changes.",Genetic engineering,2
"another review paper indicates that the role of phenotypic plasticity 
for diversification and speciation may be going unnoticed.",Genetic engineering,2

plasticity and conclude that “generally, phenotypic plasticity can 
play a largely underappreciated role in driving diversification and 
speciation” (p. ).",Genetic engineering,2

desert locusts which can change reversibly between solitarious

"these are so dissimilar in physiology, 
morphology and behavior, that they were recognized as different 
species until .",Genetic engineering,2

previously discovered sensor on the hind femora is subjected to 
increased tactile stimulation due to forced crowding, solitarious 
locusts begin within one hour to exhibit the behaviors of the long-
term gregarious locusts.",Genetic engineering,2

assumption that guinea pigs have a neurological mechanism to 
detect temperature changes (without identifying a specific sensor.)",Genetic engineering,2

technology introduces complex morality issues – most of all when modifications on the germline and 
enhancement procedures are considered.",Genetic engineering,2

variety of demographics, since previous research and literature suggests a wide spectrum of opinions.",Genetic engineering,2
"this spectrum is bounded by two extremes: one side favors continuous research and argues that the value

be irresponsible to use the technology, with all the risks and unknowns currently present, therefore 
arguing that the risks are greater than the benefits.",Genetic engineering,2

in order to collect representative data of opinion trends across the entire united states that would

(suthaharan, ).",Machine learning,3
"in the current big data system, this parallelization is not transparent and it 
performs optimal resource allocation and utilization automatically.",Machine learning,3
"however, in some situations, 
it is important for the users to set the system parameters such as the number of cores, executors 
and memory size.",Machine learning,3
"machine learning 
 
the initial progress in machine learning has defined the standard methodological processes that 
include the development of parametric models and development of algorithms that help optimize 
the model parameters using training, validation, and testing processes, and given (labeled) data.",Machine learning,3
"these methodological processes may be grouped into two categories: interpretable knowledge 
discovery (suthaharan, ) and actionable knowledge discovery (cao, ).",Machine learning,3
"additionally, the 
machine learning models are defined using two types of parameters, namely, hyperparameters 
and learned‐parameters.",Machine learning,3
"the hyperparameter values must be selected at the beginning of the 
training process—requires some expertise in the research domain—and the learned‐parameters 
are optimized by machine learning algorithms. 
 
. parametrization 
 
to date, the machine learning models are parametrized in three groups: mathematical, 
hierarchical, and layered models.",Machine learning,3
"the mathematical models include the models developed using 
the concept of support vectors and statistical regression—examples are support vector machine, 
logistic regression, and lasso regression.",Machine learning,3
"the hierarchical models include the models developed 
based on the concept of decision tree—examples are random forest models.",Machine learning,3
"the layered models 
include the models proposed based on the concept of neural networks—examples include deep 
learning models.",Machine learning,3
the first two types of approaches have been proposed to address batch learning.,Machine learning,3
"these approaches are based on the concepts of gradient descent or 
stochastic gradient descent (luketina, berglund, greff, & raiko, ).",Machine learning,3
"smart machine learning 
 
as deep learning technique progresses—of course!",Machine learning,3
"as a promising solution to solve big data 
analytics problems—researchers have been trying to make machine learning techniques more 
intelligent as possible to meet the requirements of interdisciplinary research and applications.",Machine learning,3
"hence, the expected features of machine learning techniques are currently divided into three 
groups: automatic, adaptive, and cognitive features.",Machine learning,3
"as a result, the current trend in big data 
analytics focuses on three types of machine learning—automl, adaptive machine learning, and 
cognitive machine learning.",Machine learning,3
"in essence, bayesian learning, bayesian optimization, and related 
approaches can help us develop smart machine learning. 
 
. bayesian learning 
 
the bayesian learning, which includes bayesian optimization and bayesian mixture models, is 
especially adopted to optimize hyperparameters because of its ability to defend the difficulties 
that come from the big data characteristics using probabilistic approaches.",Machine learning,3
"these approaches replace mathematical optimization with 
probabilistic optimization—a preferable approach for big data settings. 
 
. bayesian mixture model and machine learning 
 
the bayesian mixture models assume data heterogeneity and represent a data domain in action 
as a composition of multiple sub domains (or clusters) with finite or infinite number of mixture 
distributions (tafaj, kasneci, rosenstiel, & bogdan, ).",Machine learning,3
"an example of its implementation in 
software systems for a big data environment is that the master node in a data sharing network can 
distribute these sub domains to worker nodes by associating them with general prior distributions 
and then the worker nodes process them and generate corresponding posterior distributions to 
specify hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms, such as the kernel and regularization 
parameters in support vector machine (svm) (klein et al., ), and weights and learning‐rate 
parameters in deep learning (suthaharan, ). 
 
. automated machine learning 
 
a machine learning technique can be claimed to be truly automatic, only if every step of the 
machine learning technique is automated such that it can minimize the problems of 
interdisciplinary applications.",Machine learning,3
"the research in automl for big data analytics is still in progress 
and it includes the research work reported in (feurer et al., ) and (luo, ).",Machine learning,3
"the current 
approaches mainly focus on the optimization of hyperparameters and the selection of models and 
algorithms to create suitable automl approaches that can be adopted by any types of users of 
interdisciplinary applications.",Machine learning,3
this objective requires efficient learning models and algorithms.,Machine learning,3
"the current research 
progress in this area shows a significant interest and an appropriate use of computational 
techniques based on bayesian (klein et al., ) and radial basis function (ilievski, akhtar, 
feng, & shoemaker, ).",Machine learning,3
"another aspect of an automl is the automatic selection of models and algorithms for 
optimization and learning.",Machine learning,3
"as we know, the hyperparameter selection requires the automatic 
selection of suitable models and algorithms from a large pool of models and algorithms for 
optimization with respect to a given data set.",Machine learning,3
"however, in big data analytics environment, this 
selection process is problematic and very challenging because of the data characteristics that 
include complexity, scalability, and heterogeneity.",Machine learning,3
"today, it can be 
observed that the big data characteristics and the current widespread interdisciplinary 
applications have enforced new constraints and requirements that triggered the exploration of 
novel approaches for adaptive machine learning.",Machine learning,3
"one aspect of adaptive machine learning is the selection and optimization of the learned model 
parameters with respect to changing data characteristics between interdisciplinary domains.",Machine learning,3
"in other words, 
we can say that the progress in adaptive machine learning focuses on learning techniques that are 
adaptive to unseen data.",Machine learning,3
"another aspect of adaptive machine learning is the revision of machine 
learning models and algorithms, with a minimum effort, to work with changing data 
characteristics between interdisciplinary domains.",Machine learning,3
"for example, in a recent paper, the authors 
have proposed a learning‐based approach that generates an adaptive best‐fit algorithm from a set 
of supervised learning algorithms to detect silent errors that occur in a high‐performance 
computing environment (subasi et al., ).",Machine learning,3
"they described the silent errors as silent data 
corruption in high performance computing systems, and these errors corrupt the execution results 
with no warning and undetectable by hardware or software. 
 
. cognitive machine learning 
 
cognitive machine learning is an emerging field and it includes both the adaptive and automl 
concepts.",Machine learning,3
"in big data analytics, the use of exact or complete knowledge for making decisions is 
impractical because of the big data characteristics that include data heterogeneity, 
unpredictability, and scalability.",Machine learning,3
"hence, the machine learning research community has realized 
the need for developing techniques and technologies that mimic the cognitive processes that the 
humans use to solve complex environmental problems and make decisions through 
approximation, hypothesis, and reasoning.",Machine learning,3
"in this computing platform, cognition‐enable 
means the availability of methodologies and techniques that mimic human cognitive process that 
utilize object‐recognition, speech‐recognition, and functional brain networks (machine learning, 
reasoning, and analysis) to make cognitive decisions.",Machine learning,3
"similarly, the cost‐effective feature 
includes computational cost as well as affordable systems and software that support 
interdisciplinary settings.",Machine learning,3
"finally, resource‐efficient feature includes the automated resource 
allocation and resource utilization with no transparency to users—it is especially useful to 
nonexpert users of the learning models (hurwitz, kaufman, & bowles, ). 
 
. smart deep learning 
 
a literature review suggests that machine learning for big data analytics is converging to deep 
learning techniques.",Machine learning,3
"for example, based on the proceedings of the  international conference 
on machine learning held in sydney, australia, on august –, , we can clearly see that 
the research interest of the machine learning community has shifted toward deep learning 
significantly.",Machine learning,3
"the deep learning, compared to other machine learning techniques, focuses on 
single‐data‐point analysis (i.e., it enables both on‐line learning and batch learning), which is a 
highly preferred option for a big data analytics framework.",Machine learning,3
"hence, it is expected in the current 
research of big data analytics that the deep learning will be studied, focusing on automated, 
adaptive, and cognitive approaches to create smart deep learning.",Machine learning,3
"conclusions 
 
the progress of research in big data analytics and machine learning was reviewed and 
understood in three phases: past, present, and future.",Machine learning,3
"in phase , a significant amount of research 
has been done on data analytics and machine learning by defining data‐driven approaches.",Machine learning,3
"in 
other words, the focus of research in phase  was mainly on interpretable knowledge 
discovery theme (i.e., the development of models and algorithms that enhance the discovery of 
interpretable knowledge from a given set of data).",Machine learning,3
"in essence, the data‐driven approaches 
focused on the discovery of patterns that help understand the source that produced the data.",Machine learning,3
"in phase , the focus of data analytics research shifted to big data analytics based on the 
redefinition of data that describe big data characteristics.",Machine learning,3
"hence, the research has started to shift 
toward domain‐driven approaches (which of course included data‐driven approaches).",Machine learning,3
"in other 
words, the focus of the research in phase  was on actionable knowledge discovery theme.",Machine learning,3
"the 
actionable knowledge discovery defines the practical significance of the knowledge discovered 
from data through domain‐driven data mining.",Machine learning,3
"hence, it defines the flow of knowledge from 
data‐driven approaches to domain‐driven interdisciplinary applications.",Machine learning,3
"it is now well understood that big data analytics research spans across multiple disciplines where 
automl models and algorithms are required to solve problems without the help of data science 
experts.",Machine learning,3
"hence, as we have seen, the selection and optimization of hyperparameters became a 
very strong research component among machine learning (or artificial intelligence) and data 
science research community.",Machine learning,3
"a significant research still has to be done on hyperparameter 
selection and optimization using bayesian optimization to develop automl approaches that are 
useful for interdisciplinary big data analytics.",Machine learning,3
"in phase , over the next two decades, a significant research is expected on fullautoml 
approaches, toward achieving smart machine learning techniques that are fully automated, 
adaptive, and cognitive under big data characteristics.",Machine learning,3
"however, to advance this research, it is 
important to study approaches that help discover patterns that are sensitive to changes between 
interdisciplinary domains.",Machine learning,3
"hence, the progress reported in this paper suggests an establishment 
of a new research theme—transformative knowledge discovery.",Machine learning,3
"it means that, when a learning 
model is developed for a big data environment (big data domain or a discipline), it is important 
to discover the knowledge that can cause a noticeable change to the model, in addition to 
discovering the knowledge that is interpretable and actionable.",Machine learning,3
"this knowledge will help the 
model to become adaptive to a new environment.",Machine learning,3
"hence, when a learning model is built for a 
data domain, it is important to study all the potential alternatives, which include both the real and 
hypothetical alternatives.",Machine learning,3
"the discovery of transformative knowledge from big data can significantly benefit from 
bayesian learning, including bayesian optimization and bayesian mixture models.",Machine learning,3
"in other 
words, we need to define a new research discipline called transformative data science and 
analytics, or transformative data science and big data, or transformative big data 
analytics that study bayesian optimization approaches and bayesian mixture models 
extensively.",Machine learning,3

do this in eight to ten hours of playing time over sixty years ago 
using machine learning.",Machine learning,3

computer was to provide it with the rules of the game, a general 
sense of direction regarding how the game worked, and a list of 
parameters that were thought to have something to do with the game,

unknown and unspecified to the computer.",Machine learning,3

. supervised 
 
with supervised machine learning, one knows the desired output 
of the algorithm based on a dataset, usually referred to as “training 
data,” that is used to optimize a performance criterion.",Machine learning,3

"how machines learn  
after analyzing the base data using the training dataset, the 
programmer can make algorithmic tweaks (or changes to the 
training data) to right the course.",Machine learning,3
"in supervised machine learning, all 
of the data within a training data set is “labeled” (or assigned a 
value), which allows the machine to easily compare analysis data 
against the training set baseline.",Machine learning,3
"the algorithm generates 
information based on its analysis of the training data, and uses that 
information to produce inferred or revised functions.",Machine learning,3

functions can be used by the end user to discern new trends 
regarding a dataset, or to refine the algorithmic analysis itself.",Machine learning,3
"analyzing enormous data sets at a speed only computers can 
achieve, the algorithm can identify trends, flag otherwise 
unidentified issues, and give the algorithm operator other desired 
results that can be tweaked using variations in the algorithm or 
training data.   
 
. unsupervised 
 
in unsupervised machine learning, there is no training data, and 
the outcomes are unpredictable.",Machine learning,3
"unsupervised machine learning 
algorithms can solve problems using input datasets alone, with no 
reference or training data, by recognizing patterns in the data and 
grouping together reoccurring or common data characteristics.",Machine learning,3

unsupervised machine learning uses functions to uncover previously

these similarities and group together the apples with the apples, the 
oranges with the oranges, and the bananas with the bananas.",Machine learning,3

intelligence, and companies often use it to analyze large datasets 
of customer transactions, generate common trends or characteristics 
based on the past transactions, group those customers into clusters, 
and use that cluster of information to refine the company’s business 
model.",Machine learning,3

“semi-supervised” machine learning, in which an algorithm-
operator uses a small amount of labeled training data to inform a 
much larger unlabeled dataset.",Machine learning,3

is usually thought of as halfway between unsupervised and 
supervised learning.",Machine learning,3
"both supervised and semi-supervised 
machine learning tend to lend themselves to relatively predictable 
outcomes, and are often used by companies to optimize user 
experiences based on predicted or predetermined outcomes.

reinforcement learning is based on an algorithm that has a 
concept of how an environment should behave, and learns an 
optimal behavior for such an environment by analyzing repetition 
and repeated failures over time.",Machine learning,3

involves conversational agents who assist students by using an application or website.",Machine learning,3
"the 
process works is quite simple with the student needing to input text.",Machine learning,3
"on the other hand, the 
agents execute the task and determine the appropriate response to the input before provid-
ing an easy response that the student can easily understand.",Machine learning,3

monitor their students’ progress through their learning activities at any time.",Machine learning,3
"this is the 
best approach to training students to enhance their experience.",Machine learning,3

teachers save time that is normally spent in preparing lectures, creating exams, document 
review, document creation, and light specific research.",Machine learning,3
"the proposed framework facilitates 
the leveraging of the most powerful technologies in improving the quality of education for 
both student and teacher.",Machine learning,3

ability to recall information previously taught.",Machine learning,3
"the problem is that this model ignores examining 
how well the students understand the information and how they apply it in real-life situations.",Machine learning,3
this model has proven to be toxic over the years.,Machine learning,3

customized and personalized learning – machine learning is flexible enough to cater to all students 
regardless of their learning speeds.",Machine learning,3
"by making use of algorithms that learn how the student 
consumes information, machine learning allows the learner to move ahead only after they have 
truly grasped the previous content.",Machine learning,3

to help increase the performance level of learning.",Machine learning,3
"various machine learning algorithms and 
techniques, such as decision-making algorithms and techniques, can be implemented for 
allowing the virtual assistant to communicate with the students and teachers.",Machine learning,3
"there are two main parts to the virtual assistants, namely, one for students and other for 
teachers.",Machine learning,3
students can answer one or more virtual assistant’s questions.,Machine learning,3
"one or more spon-

"the sponsored 
links can be voice, audio data, displaying video or textual information.",Machine learning,3
"exam training and 
test dates remainder are kinds of the virtual assistant that gets provided to learners.",Machine learning,3
"also, the 
machine learning in educational technology


proposed system helps students to manage their teamwork project.",Machine learning,3
"after the session with the 
system, a student is provided with the feedback about his progress.",Machine learning,3
the system is also able to design presentations for specific learners.,Machine learning,3
"notably, different students 
have different learning abilities; therefore, the system is able to compute a favorable learning 
style for each student.",Machine learning,3
"the teacher monitors the progress of each student through feedback 
about how each student performed in the sessions.",Machine learning,3
this facilitates appropriate grading.,Machine learning,3
"also, 
the virtual assistant is able to point out areas of the course that need to be explored further to 
enhance learning by providing additional reference materials to a topic.",Machine learning,3
"also, the teacher is 
able to identify which students need extra help using the feedback provided by the system.",Machine learning,3
"the proposed architecture is a reliable virtual assistant website that not only helps teachers 
and students to do their tasks in a shorter time but also allows them to coordinate their work.
. technical implementation
the underlying technical implementation of the virtual assistant system starts with creating 
use cases for the product.",Machine learning,3
"the identification of virtual assistants and the underlying technol-
ogy are required for moving ahead with the implementation of the proposed website [].",Machine learning,3
"the 
 following technical specifications have been identified for building the virtual assistant website:
software used:
• bitvoicer: speech recognition.",Machine learning,3
": coding language
• eclipse, geany or your preferred interface for coding on python virtual com port.",Machine learning,3
"to facilitate interaction between the virtual assistant website and the user, a software known 
as wit.ai is installed.",Machine learning,3
"wit.ai offers a perfect combination of voice recognition, and subsequent 
machine learning in the context of developers.",Machine learning,3
"the software offers services that concentrate on 
converting verbal commands into text.",Machine learning,3
"moreover, wit.ai has the capability of understanding 
the commands that are said.",Machine learning,3
"the most sophisticated forms of wit.ai can be programmed to 
understand commands whose prior understanding was scant or non-existent.",Machine learning,3
"this is crucial 
in the educational context since learners tend to understand at varying paces.",Machine learning,3
"the extensive 
capability of wit.ai software to improve the interactivity of virtual assistant website can be 
verified by the fact that it has been incorporated by a number of notable social media net-
works, such as facebook [].",Machine learning,3
"clarifai is another service that can be added to the virtual assistant website to improve its 
interactivity.",Machine learning,3
"clarifai is a service geared towards ai, and it possesses the ability to decode 
contents that is in an image and video format.",Machine learning,3
"another strength associated with clarifai is that 
it possesses a deep learning engine that improves with its usage [].",Machine learning,3
"the tool is of paramount 
importance when there is a need to make improvements in the ai prototype and grant it the 
capability of seeing and recognizing objects.",Machine learning,3
"machine learning - advanced techniques and emerging applications
the virtual assistant experience with the users has been remarkable.",Machine learning,3
"all students who pro-
vided feedback regarding their interactions reported positive experiences.",Machine learning,3
"fundamentally, the 
issue of the ease of interactivity, friendly user interfaces and responsiveness were reviewed.",Machine learning,3
"the first student reported that the system has a friendly user interface that is not complex, thus 
allowing a user to navigate through different sections of the system.",Machine learning,3
"the student added that 
the system was highly responsive in terms of answering questions.",Machine learning,3
"he recounted that, in the 
traditional class setting, he was afraid to ask questions in front of the other student.",Machine learning,3
"however, 
the virtual assistant offered personalized interaction where he could ask any questions, clari-
fications and point out his areas of weakness.",Machine learning,3
"the second student who experimented with the 
software also found it quite useful.",Machine learning,3
"he emphasized that he liked the fact that he was able to get 
immediate feedback on his questions.",Machine learning,3
"this was a vast improvement over the traditional way 
of waiting to talk to the teacher after class, when the teachable moment has already expired.",Machine learning,3
some instructors are always in a rush after finishing their classes.,Machine learning,3
"as such, they are unable to 
allocate ample time to explain specific concepts taught in class to the student.",Machine learning,3
"therefore, the 
student misses out on these concepts that might cause low academic performance.",Machine learning,3
"in other 
cases, teachers recommend students with clarifications to get the assistance of their class-
mates.",Machine learning,3
"this hampers full understanding as one needs to develop a rapport with their fellow 
student to enhance learning, and others become intimidated.",Machine learning,3
"however, the virtual assistant 
allocates enough time and is able to answer all questions, providing detailed explanations.",Machine learning,3
"the third student said that she found it was an effective supplement to one teacher’s exten-
sive use of multiple choice exams.",Machine learning,3
"according to the student, while such exams might tell her 
whether or not she knows the answer to a question, they do not help her understand the logic 
underlying the answer.",Machine learning,3
the virtual assistance was helpful in achieving that understanding.,Machine learning,3
the fourth student also reported satisfaction with the system.,Machine learning,3
"firstly, the student confessed 
to being a slow learner.",Machine learning,3
this had really affected how she grasped concepts.,Machine learning,3
"most of the times, 
she felt left behind in classwork and had no one to consult as she was shy about her condition.",Machine learning,3
"however, the system helped her to learn at her pace and recommended interactive learning 
model that allowed her ask for clarification after every  minutes of the learning session.",Machine learning,3
"she 
was enthusiastic to note that this has helped her understand most of the concepts taught in 
class and generally improve her grades.",Machine learning,3
"lastly, a teacher who had made use of the assistance 
said it allowed her more time to figure out what her students actually understood and where 
they were having difficulties.",Machine learning,3
"by so doing, it helped her know which areas needed much atten-
tion to enhance understanding.",Machine learning,3
"she recounted that teaching a class of  students can some-
times be difficult to know who understood well, who needed extra attention on a specific topic 
and what learning model suited a specific group of students.",Machine learning,3
"the virtual assistant, according 
to the teacher, answers these questions.",Machine learning,3
"the system is able to compile interactive activities to 
address specific learning outcomes to indent whether the students understood the topic.

ditions can be parallelised effectively.",Machine learning,3
"we consider a parallelisation to be effective if the (ε,∆)-
guarantees (equation ) are achieved in time polylogarithmic in n(ε,∆).",Machine learning,3
"the cost for achieving
this reduction in runtime comes in the form of an increased data size and in the number of processing
units used.",Machine learning,3
"for the parallelisation scheme presented in this paper, we are able to bound this cost by
a quasi-polynomial in /ε and log /∆.",Machine learning,3
"the main practical contribution of this paper is an effective
parallelisation scheme that treats the underlying learning algorithm as a black-box, i.e., it can be
parallelised without further mathematical derivations and without writing dedicated code.",Machine learning,3
"similar to averaging-based parallelisations [, , ], we apply the underlying learning algorithm
in parallel to random subsets of the data.",Machine learning,3

radon point increases the confidence in the aggregate doubly-exponentially with the height of the
aggregation tree.",Machine learning,3
"we describe our parallelisation scheme, the radon machine, in detail in section .",Machine learning,3

rithm on random subsets of the data to quickly achieve weak hypotheses and then iteratively aggre-
gates them to stronger ones.",Machine learning,3

executed in parallel.",Machine learning,3
"to aggregate hypotheses, we follow along the lines of the iterated radon point
algorithm which was originally devised to approximate the centre point, i.e., a point of largest tukey
depth [], of a finite set of points [].",Machine learning,3

definition .",Machine learning,3
"a radon partition of a set s ⊂ f is a pair a,b ⊂ s such that a ∩ b = ∅ but
〈a〉 ∩ 〈b〉 = ∅, where 〈·〉 denotes the convex hull.",Machine learning,3

"for that the set is partitioned into subsets of
size r (line ) and the radon point of each subset is calculated in parallel (line ).",Machine learning,3
"the final step of
each iteration is to replace the set of hypotheses by the set of radon points (line ).",Machine learning,3
the scheme requires a hypothesis space with a valid notion of convexity and finite radon number.,Machine learning,3
"while other notions of convexity are possible [, ], in this paper we restrict our consideration to
euclidean spaces with the usual notion of convexity.",Machine learning,3
"radon’s theorem [] states that the euclidean
space rd has radon number r = d + .",Machine learning,3
"radon points can then be obtained by solving a system
of linear equations of size r × r (to be fully self-contained we state the system of linear equations
explicitly in appendix c.).",Machine learning,3
"the next proposition gives a guarantee on the quality of radon points:
proposition .",Machine learning,3
"given a probability measure p over a hypothesis space f with finite radon number
r, let f denote a random variable with distribution p . furthermore, let r be the random variable
obtained by computing the radon point of r random points drawn according to p r. then it holds
for the expected regret q and all ε ∈ r that
p (q (r) > ε) ≤ (rp (q (f ) > ε)) .",Machine learning,3
the proof of proposition  is provided in section .,Machine learning,3
"note that this proof also shows the robustness
of the radon point compared to the average: if only one of r points is ε-bad, the radon point is
still ε-good, while the average may or may not be; indeed, in a linear space with any set of ε-good
hypotheses and any ε′ ≥ ε, we can always find a single ε′-bad hypothesis such that the average of
all these hypotheses is ε′-bad.",Machine learning,3
"a direct consequence of proposition  is a bound on the probability that the output of the radon
machine with parameter h is bad:
theorem .",Machine learning,3
"given a probability measure p over a hypothesis space f with finite radon number r,
let f denote a random variable with distribution p . denote by r the random variable obtained by
computing the radon point of r random points drawn iid according to p and by p its distribution.",Machine learning,3

reduced: with a bound δ on this probability for the base learning algorithm, the bound ∆ on this
probability for the radon machine is
∆ = (rδ)
h
. ()
in the next section we compare the radon machine to its base learning algorithm which is applied
to a dataset of the size necessary to achieve the same ε and ∆.",Machine learning,3
"sample and runtime complexity
in this section we first derive the sample and runtime complexity of the radon machine r from
the sample and runtime complexity of the base learning algorithm l. we then relate the runtime
complexity of the radon machine to an application of the base learning algorithm which achieves
the same (ε,∆)-guarantee.",Machine learning,3
"in this case all base learning algo-
rithms can be executed in parallel.",Machine learning,3
"in practical applications fewer physical processors can be used
to simulate rh processing units—we discuss this case in section .",Machine learning,3
"the runtime of the radon machine can be decomposed into the runtime of the base learning al-
gorithm and the runtime for the aggregation.",Machine learning,3
"the base learning algorithm requires n ≥ nl (ε, δ)
samples and can be executed on rh processors in parallel in time tl(n).",Machine learning,3
"the radon point in each of
the h iterations can then be calculated in parallel in time r (see appendix c.).",Machine learning,3
"thus, the runtime
of the radon machine with n = rhn samples is
tr,h(n) = tl (n) + hr .",Machine learning,3
"()
in contrast, the runtime of the base learning algorithm for achieving the same guarantee is
tl(m) with m ≥ nl (ε,∆).",Machine learning,3
"ignoring logarithmic and constant terms, nl (ε,∆) behaves as
hnl (ε, δ).",Machine learning,3
"to obtain polylogarithmic runtime of r compared to tl(m), we choose the parame-
ter h ≈ ldm − ld ldm such that n ≈ m/h = ldm .",Machine learning,3
"thus, the runtime of the radon machine is in
o (ldκm + r ldm).",Machine learning,3
this result is formally summarised in theorem .,Machine learning,3
"the radon machine with a consistent and efficient regularised risk minimisation al-
gorithm on a hypothesis space with finite radon number has polylogarithmic runtime on quasi-
polynomially many processing units if the radon number can be upper bounded by a function poly-
logarithmic in the sample complexity of the efficient regularised risk minimisation algorithm.",Machine learning,3
"the theorem is proven in appendix a. and relates to nick’s class []: a decision problem can
be solved efficiently in parallel in the sense of nick’s class, if it can be decided by an algorithm
in polylogarithmic time on polynomially many processors (assuming, e.g., pram model).",Machine learning,3
"for the
class of decision problems that are the hardest in p , i.e., for p -complete problems, it is believed
that there is no efficient parallel algorithm for solving them in this sense.",Machine learning,3
"theorem  provides a
step towards finding efficient parallelisations of regularised risk minimisers and towards answering
the open question: is consistent regularised risk minimisation possible in polylogarithmic time on
polynomially many processors.",Machine learning,3
"a similar question, for the case of learning half spaces, has been
called a fundamental open problem by long and servedio [] who gave an algorithms which runs
on polynomially many processors in time that depends polylogarithmically on the sample size but
is inversely proportional to a parameter of the learning problem.",Machine learning,3
"while nick’s class as a notion of
efficiency has been criticised [], it is the only notion of efficiency that forms a proper complexity
class in the sense of blum [].",Machine learning,3
"to overcome the weakness of using only this notion, kruskal et al.",Machine learning,3
"[] suggested to consider also the inefficiency of simulating the parallel algorithm on a single
processing unit.",Machine learning,3
"we discuss the inefficiency and the speed-up in appendix a..

 empirical evaluation
this empirical study compares the radon machine to state-of-the-art parallel machine learning al-
gorithms from the spark machine learning library [], as well as the natural baseline of averaging
hypotheses instead of calculating their radon point (averaging-at-the-end, avg).",Machine learning,3
"we use base learn-
ing algorithms from weka [] and scikit-learn [].",Machine learning,3
"we compare the radon machine to the base
learning algorithms on moderately sized datasets, due to scalability limitations of the base learners,
and reserve larger datasets for the comparison with parallel learners.",Machine learning,3
"the experiments are executed
on a spark cluster ( worker nodes,  processors per node).",Machine learning,3
"all results are obtained using -fold
cross validation.",Machine learning,3
"we apply the radon machine with parameter h =  and the maximal parame-
ter h such that each instance of the base learning algorithm is executed on a subset of size at least
 (denoted h = max).",Machine learning,3
"averaging-at-the-end executes the base learning algorithm on the same
number of subsets rh as the radon machine with that parameter and is denoted in the figures by
stating the parameter h as for the radon machine.",Machine learning,3
"all other parameters of the learning algorithms
are optimised on an independent split of the datasets.",Machine learning,3
see appendix b for additional details.,Machine learning,3
what is the speed-up of our scheme in practice?,Machine learning,3
"in figure (a), we compare the radon machine to
its base learners on moderately sized datasets (details on the datasets are provided in appendix b).",Machine learning,3

"the dashed lines connect
the radon machine to averaging-at-the-end with
the same base learning algorithm and a compara-
ble spark machine learning algorithm.",Machine learning,3
"there, the radon machine is between  and
around -times faster than the base learner
using  processors.",Machine learning,3
"the speed-up is de-
tailed in figure .",Machine learning,3
"on the susy dataset
(with    instances and  features),
the radon machine on  processors with
h =  is  times faster than its base learn-
ing algorithms.",Machine learning,3
"at the same time, their predic-
tive performances, measured by the area under
the roc curve (auc) on an independent test
dataset, are comparable.",Machine learning,3
"how does the scheme compare to averaging-
at-the-end?",Machine learning,3
"in figure (b) we compare the
runtime and auc of the parallelisation scheme
against the averaging-at-the-end baseline (avg).",Machine learning,3
"in terms of the auc, the radon machine out-
performs the averaging-at-the-end baseline on
all datasets by at least %.",Machine learning,3
"the runtimes can
hardly be distinguished in that figure.",Machine learning,3
"a small
difference can however be noted in figure 
which is discussed in more details in the next
paragraph.",Machine learning,3
"since averaging is less computa-
tionally expensive than calculating the radon
point, the runtimes of the averaging-at-the-end
baselines are slightly lower than the ones of
the radon machine.",Machine learning,3
"however, compared to the
computational complexity of executing the base
learner, this advantage becomes negligible.",Machine learning,3
how does our scheme compare to state-of-the-art spark machine learning algorithms?,Machine learning,3
"we
compare the radon machine to various spark machine learning algorithms on  large datasets.",Machine learning,3
"the
results in figure (c) indicate that the proposed parallelisation scheme with h = max has a substan-
tially smaller runtime than the spark algorithms on all datasets.",Machine learning,3
"on the susy and higgs dataset,
the radon machine is one order of magnitude faster than the spark implementations—here the com-
paratively small number of features allows for a high level of parallelism.",Machine learning,3
"on the casp dataset,
the radon machine is % faster than the fastest spark algorithm.",Machine learning,3
"the performance in terms of auc
of the radon machine is similar to the spark algorithms.",Machine learning,3
"in particular, when using wekalogreg
with h = max, the radon machine outperforms the spark algorithms in terms of auc and runtime
on the datasets susy, wikidata, and casp.",Machine learning,3
"details are given in the appendix b. a summarizing
comparison of the parallel approaches in terms of their trade-off between runtime and predictive
performance is depicted in figure .",Machine learning,3
"here, results are shown for the radon machine and averaging-
at-the-end with parameter h = max and for the two spark algorithms most similar to the base

learning algorithms.",Machine learning,3
"note that it is unclear what caused the consistently weak performance of all
algorithms on wikidata.",Machine learning,3
"nonetheless, the results show that on all datasets the radon machine has
comparable predictive performance to the spark algorithms and substantially higher predictive per-
formance than averaging-at-the-end.",Machine learning,3
"at the same time, the radon machine has a runtime comparable
to averaging-at-the-end on all datasets and both are substantially faster than the spark algorithms.",Machine learning,3
how does the runtime depend on the dataset size in a real-world system?,Machine learning,3
"the runtime of
the radon machine can be distinguished into its learning phase and its aggregation phase.",Machine learning,3
"while
the learning phase fully benefits from parallelisation, this comes at the cost of additional runtime for
the aggregation phase.",Machine learning,3
"the time for aggregating the hypotheses does not depend on the number of
instances in the dataset but for a fixed parameter h it only depends on the dimension of the hypothesis
space and that parameter.",Machine learning,3
"in figure  we compare the runtimes of all base learning algorithms per
dataset size to the radon machines.",Machine learning,3
"results indicate that, while the runtimes of the base learning
algorithms depends on the dataset size with an average exponent of ., the runtime of the radon
machine depends on the dataset size with an exponent of only ..
how generally applicable is the scheme?",Machine learning,3
"as an indication of the general applicability in practice,
we also consider regression and multi-class classification.",Machine learning,3
"for regression, we apply the scheme to
the scikit-learn implementation of regularised least squares regression [].",Machine learning,3
"on the dataset yearpre-
dictionmsd, regularised least squares regression achieves an rmse of ., whereas the radon
machine achieved an rmse of .. at the same time, the radon machine is -times faster.",Machine learning,3
"we
also compare the radon machine on a multi-class prediction problem using conditional maximum
entropy models.",Machine learning,3
"for multi-class classification, we use the implementation described in mcdonald
et al.",Machine learning,3
"[], who propose to use averaging-at-the-end for distributed training.",Machine learning,3
"we compare the radon
machine to averaging-at-the-end with conditional maximum entropy models on two large multi-
class datasets (drift and spoken-arabic-digit).",Machine learning,3
"on average, our scheme performs better with only
slightly longer runtime.",Machine learning,3
"the minimal difference in runtime can be explained—similar to the results
in figure (b)—by the smaller complexity of calculating the average instead of the radon point.",Machine learning,3
"discussion and future work
in the experiments we considered datasets where the number of dimensions is much smaller than
the number of instances.",Machine learning,3
what about high-dimensional models?,Machine learning,3
"the basic version of the paral-
lelisation scheme presented in this paper cannot directly be applied to cases in which the size of the
dataset is not at least a multiple of the radon number of the hypothesis space.",Machine learning,3
"for various types of
data such as text, this might cause concerns.",Machine learning,3
"however, random projections [] or low-rank approx-
imations [, ] can alleviate this problem and are already frequently employed in machine learning.",Machine learning,3
an alternative might be to combine our parallelisation scheme with block coordinate descent [].,Machine learning,3
"in this case, the scheme can be applied iteratively to subsets of the features.",Machine learning,3
in the experiments we considered only linear models.,Machine learning,3
"learning
non-linear models causes similar problems to learning high-dimensional ones.",Machine learning,3
"in non-parametric
methods like kernel methods, for instance, the dimensionality of the optimisation problem is equal
to the number of instances, thus prohibiting the application of our parallelisation scheme.",Machine learning,3
"how-
ever, similar low-rank approximation techniques as described above can be applied with non-linear
kernels [].",Machine learning,3
"furthermore, methods for speeding up the learning process for non-linear models ex-
plicitly approximate an embedding in which then a linear model can be learned [].",Machine learning,3
"using explicitly
constructed feature spaces, radon machines can directly be applied to non-linear models.",Machine learning,3
"we have theoretically analysed our parallelisation scheme for the case that there are enough process-
ing units available to find each weak hypothesis on a separate processing units.",Machine learning,3
"what if there are
not rh, but only c < rh processing units?",Machine learning,3
"the parallelisation scheme can quite naturally be “de-
parallelised” and partially executed in sequence.",Machine learning,3
"for the runtime this implies an additional factor of
max{, rh/c}.",Machine learning,3
"thus, the radon machine can be applied with any number of processing units.",Machine learning,3
"the scheme improves ∆ doubly exponentially in its parameter h but for that it requires the weak hy-
potheses to already achieve δ ≤ /r.",Machine learning,3
is the scheme only applicable in high-confidence domains?,Machine learning,3
"many application scenarios require high-confidence error bounds, e.g., in the medical domain []
or in intrusion detection [].",Machine learning,3
"in practice our scheme achieves similar predictive quality much faster
than its base learner.",Machine learning,3
"besides runtime, communication plays an essential role in parallel learning.",Machine learning,3
"what is the commu-
nication complexity of the scheme?",Machine learning,3
"as for all aggregation at the end strategies, the overall amount
of communication is low compared to periodically communicating schemes.",Machine learning,3
"for the parallel aggre-
gation of hypotheses, the scheme requires o(rh+) messages (which can be sent in parallel) each
containing a single hypothesis of size o(r).",Machine learning,3
"our scheme is ideally suited for inherently distributed
data and might even mitigate privacy concerns.",Machine learning,3
in a lot of applications data is available in the form of potentially infinite data streams.,Machine learning,3
"can the
scheme be applied to distributed data streams?",Machine learning,3
"for each data stream, a hypotheses could be
maintained using an online learning algorithm and periodically aggregated using the radon machine,
similar to the federated learning approach proposed by mcmahan et al.",Machine learning,3
"in this paper, we investigated the parallelisation of machine learning algorithms.",Machine learning,3
"is the radon
machine more generally applicable?",Machine learning,3
"the parallelisation scheme could be applied to more general
randomized convex optimization algorithms with unknown and random target functions.",Machine learning,3
"we will
investigate its applicability for learning in non-euclidean, abstract convexity spaces.",Machine learning,3
"conclusion and related work
in this paper we provided a step towards answering an open problem: is parallel machine learn-
ing possible in polylogarithmic time using a polynomial number of processors only?",Machine learning,3
"this question
has been posed for half-spaces by long and servedio [] and called “a fundamental open prob-
lem about the abilities and limitations of efficient parallel learning algorithms”.",Machine learning,3
"it relates machine
learning to nick’s class of parallelisable decision problems and its variants [].",Machine learning,3
"early theoretical
treatments of parallel learning with respect to nc considered probably approximately correct (pac)
[, ] concept learning.",Machine learning,3
"vitter and lin [] introduced the notion of nc-learnable for concept
classes for which there is an algorithm that outputs a probably approximately correct hypothesis in
polylogarithmic time using a polynomial number of processors.",Machine learning,3
"in this setting, they proved positive
and negative learnability results for a number of concept classes that were previously known to be
pac-learnable in polynomial time.",Machine learning,3
"more recently, the special case of learning half spaces in par-
allel was considered by long and servedio [] who gave an algorithm for this case that runs on
polynomially many processors in time that depends polylogarithmically on the size of the instances
but is inversely proportional to a parameter of the learning problem.",Machine learning,3
"our paper complements these
theoretical treatments of parallel machine learning and provides a provably effective parallelisation
scheme for a broad class of regularised risk minimisation algorithms.",Machine learning,3
"some parallelisation schemes also train learning algorithms on small chunks of data and average the
found hypotheses.",Machine learning,3
"while this approach has advantages [, ], current error bounds do not allow
a derivation of polylogarithmic runtime [, , ] and it has been doubted to have any benefit
over learning on a single chunk [].",Machine learning,3
"another popular class of parallel learning algorithms is based
on stochastic gradient descent, targeting expected risk minimisation directly [, and",Machine learning,3
"supervised-learning models [] and decision-
reinforcement learning models [] can be used for perception
and planning, and conventional control theory can be used
for control, respectively.",Machine learning,3
"on the other hand, in order to per-
form qa on a system, it is necessary to predefine quality
standards and a qa process in advance, and strictly follow
them at development time.",Machine learning,3
"in this study, we identify open

deep learning for safety-critical in engineering systems kuwajima et al.",Machine learning,3
"problems related to the three levels: the in-vehicle automated-
driving system, the subsystems, and the machine learning
model.",Machine learning,3
"thus, we use an automated-driving system as an ex-
ample of a safety-critical machine-learning system.",Machine learning,3
"then, we
investigate the open qa problems in terms of the three steps
of the development process: design (requirements and speci-
fications), verification (including validation), and operation
(including maintenance).",Machine learning,3
"the three levels and three steps
are shown in fig. . open problems that can be addressed
using conventional methods are beyond the scope of this
research study and are therefore excluded.",Machine learning,3
"notably, many of
the open problems considered in this paper do not occur only
in automated-driving systems, but in safety-critical systems
in general.",Machine learning,3
"open problems of in-vehicle
automated-driving systems
in-vehicle automated-driving systems are automated-driving
systems that are installed in vehicles.",Machine learning,3
"in the three layers of
the system operating on an automated vehicle: the in-vehicle
automated-driving system, the subsystems, and the machine
learning model, only the former is exposed to the physi-
cal environment.",Machine learning,3
"therefore, it is necessary to consider data
on the physical environment more than theoretical assump-
tions when designing and verifying an in-vehicle automated-
driving system.",Machine learning,3
"the open problems in this paragraph are to
capture the operational physical environments of automated-
driving systems, and address the intractableness of field op-
eration testing (fot).",Machine learning,3
"requirement: qa requires limitations, orwarranty scopes.",Machine learning,3
"therefore, a machine-learning system must be implemented
in a predefined environment.",Machine learning,3
"in the automobile industry, this
is called the operational design domain (odd), and it essen-
tially corresponds to the driving conditions with which the
system is compatible [].",Machine learning,3
"efficiently collecting driving sce-
narios on actual roads from past field operational tests and
customer data remains a huge task and an open challenge in
qa, but it is necessary for defining assumed environments
and verifying the developed qa system against them.",Machine learning,3
"in
addition, the evaluation criteria (such as test coverage) must
be defined for the collected scenarios, in order to measure
whether they are sufficient to ensure safety and security.",Machine learning,3
"verification: the simplest approach to guaranteeing the
quality of an in-vehicle automated driving system is through
verification against actual data.",Machine learning,3
"accumulating a large num-
ber of safe automated-driving trips, as long distance as with
human drivers, will effectively demonstrate that automated-
driving systems are as safe as human drivers.",Machine learning,3
"however, ob-
taining statistically significant results would require conduct-
ing fot by driving for hundreds of thousands to hundreds
of billions of miles fot [].",Machine learning,3
"the purpose of this project is to clarify the expected per-
formance level and evaluation criteria of automated-driving
systems through scenario-based verification.",Machine learning,3
"each scenario is defined by three levels of abstraction:
the functional scenario (natural language description), the
logical scenario (parameterized model), and the concrete sce-
nario (model with specified parameters).",Machine learning,3
"first, in the concept
phase, natural languages are used to describe the functional
scenario without ambiguous terms, in a way that can be un-
derstood by human experts.",Machine learning,3
"next, in the system development
phase, we define the parameters and their distributions, and
describe the logical scenario in a specified data format.",Machine learning,3
"in
the test & verification phase, specific parameters are sam-
pled from the parameter distributions, and the scenario is
detailed into a concrete scenario, so that it can to be executed
(simulated) with test tools.",Machine learning,3
"scenarios are collected from test
drives and the market to demonstrate that systems are equal
to or better than human drivers.",Machine learning,3
"regular scenarios are con-
tinuously tested by simulation, and those critical are tested
through artificially configured environments on test courses.",Machine learning,3
"the pegasus project is an excellent example of continuous
definition of requirements for (in-vehicle) automated-driving
systems and their verification.",Machine learning,3
"the open problems in qa for
the in-vehicle automated-driving system level require sta-
tistics and simulation techniques to develop solutions for

each subsystem including those incorporatingmachine-learning

"as a result, qa of subsystems that do not usemachine-
learning models can be performed through conventional
methods, with minimal change in the development process.",Machine learning,3
"subsystems with different functionalities, such as percep-
tion and planning, may require different qa approaches.",Machine learning,3
"for
example, the same qa approach cannot be applied to per-
ception with a convolutional neural network [] and to
planning with a deep q-network [].",Machine learning,3
"in general, a machine-
learningmodel cannot achieve % accuracy on test data [],
and as accuracy approaches %, further performance im-
provement becomes difficult.",Machine learning,3
"therefore, optimizing machine-
learning models are not the only way to improve subsystem
performance.",Machine learning,3
"in fact, a subsystem should be subdivided and
verified based on its development process, combining the con-
ventional deductive approach with the inductive approach
that is unique to machine learning [].",Machine learning,3
"rigorous breakdown
of subsystem requirements into machine-learning model re-
quirements is essential for safety-critical machine-learning
systems.",Machine learning,3
"in this process, safety analysis methods and pro-
cesses are important, such as: black box verification; encapsu-

addition, sotif, which is a safety standard/process concern-
ing performance limits of normal functions, is also focused
on securing functions with uncertainty even under normal
conditions [].",Machine learning,3
"we consider that the most relevant technical
area for qa at the subsystems level is software engineering.",Machine learning,3

tive (manual) development of systems and the inductive

mining the parameters by training is called a model structure

deductively design the requirements of the machine learning
models and their test data, as the final step manual engineer-
ing in machine-learning systems.",Machine learning,3
"requirement: in machine learning, we consider that the
roles of training data and test data are different.",Machine learning,3
"while the
training data is used for improving the performance of the
machine-learning model, the test data should be used to ac-
curately reflect the environmental conditions in operation.",Machine learning,3
"for example, when all the data obtained at the time of de-
velopment are randomly divided, some of them are used as
training data and the others are test data.",Machine learning,3
"in this way, the
training data and the test data are approximately equally
distributed, but the relationship to the operational data is
unknown.",Machine learning,3
"particularly in a safety-critical machine-learning
system, it is necessary to design the test data distribution
considering the operational environment, in which the sys-
tem will actually be operated in the future, and to collect test
data based on the designed data distribution.",Machine learning,3
"in this way, by
accepting an a-priori viewpoint of the test data distribution,
we can deductively define the assumed environment, and
inductively collect data based on the requirements of the
overlaid subsystem.",Machine learning,3
"moreover, by assuming the distribution
of the test data, we can now discuss their distribution, and
define the operation domain with concrete design informa-
tion.",Machine learning,3
"even in the current development of in-vehicle automated-
driving systems, the test data would be collected assuming
the operational environment, in order to make the distri-
bution at the time of operation and the distribution of the
test data as consistent as possible.",Machine learning,3
"however, the methods of
describing the assumed environment of machine-learning
models are not organized.",Machine learning,3

describe the properties of the test data.",Machine learning,3

realized in a variety of systems, by exploiting conformational changes triggered by 
changes in redox potential or temperature, reversible binding of small molecules or ions, 
or irradiation.",Nanotechnology,4
"“the incorporation of such devices into arrays could in principle lead to 
complex structural states suitable for nanorobotic applications, provided that individual

"this 
could be readily achieved with devices that are controlled individually by separate and

 by prof. seeman that consisted in a machine constructed from dna molecules, 
which had two rigid arms that could rotated from fixed positions by adding a chemical to 
the solution.",Nanotechnology,4
"the problem was that this chemical affected all molecules within a structure 
uniformly.",Nanotechnology,4

molecule pairs without affecting others within a larger structure, what is got by inserting 
dna set and fuel strands into individual molecule pairs.",Nanotechnology,4

manufacture of electric power, which generically mckibben considered itself as a 
country's economy (see mckibben et al, , p. ).",Nanotechnology,4

reality.",Nanotechnology,4
"it can be noted, for example, in the particular case of the production of electric 
energy through the photovoltaic panels use.",Nanotechnology,4
"the emphasis is placed on the competitive 
advantage associated to the use of nanotechnology versus the solar energy production for 
companies in this market segment.",Nanotechnology,4
"the american firm ""nanosolar"", which studies are sponsored by major 
companies like google or ibm, or resulting from the allocation of benefits offered by the 
department of energy, is leading the competition for energy production resulting from 
nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"the company has named this technology as ""nano-photovoltaic panels"".",Nanotechnology,4
"the photovoltaic solar energy is obtained converting light into electricity: the 
so-called ""photovoltaic effect"" (see becquerel, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"the photovoltaic cell works when light reaches the photovoltaic panel, 
exciting energetically electrons, making them circulate freely from atom to atom, forming 
the electric current.",Nanotechnology,4
the photovoltaic cell is a practical application of photoelectric effect.,Nanotechnology,4
"the 
photovoltaic cell that turns the light into electricity will continue to generate electric 
power according to the level of radiation received.",Nanotechnology,4
"note that the energy produced with the classic solar panels is much more 
expensive than the energy produced in either thermoelectric power plants or dams.",Nanotechnology,4
"if 
instead nano-photovoltaic panels are used, although, more expensive, the price is already 
comparable with the price of the energy produced in either thermoelectric power plants or 
dams (see ferreira et al, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"companies need to be dynamic in the development of innovations and thus 
creating competitive advantages.",Nanotechnology,4
"through their production processes, they can create 
economic value, and consequently generate their viability in the market in which they 
operate.",Nanotechnology,4
"the competition is part of a dynamic and evolutionary operation of the 
nowadays economy.",Nanotechnology,4
"conferring to mcafee and brynjolfsson (, p. ) ""the result is that an 
innovator with a better way of doing things can grow at unprecedented speeds and 
dominate the industry"".",Nanotechnology,4
"at the same time, it is interesting to note that nanotechnology is a technology 
that may use a minor quantity of natural resources than other technologies.",Nanotechnology,4
"probably, a 
  
company gets additional benefits and has a lower cost and additionally gets better results 
for operating inputs.",Nanotechnology,4
"to nogami and passos (, p. ), from the harsh reality of scarcity arises 
the necessity of choice.",Nanotechnology,4
"since it is not possible to produce everything that it is felt as 
needed, mechanisms must be created to show somehow to the societies the path to decide 
what goods are effectively to produce and what needs have to be met.",Nanotechnology,4
"all the means or methods of production indicate different combinations of 
forces and inputs.",Nanotechnology,4
production methods vary according the way such combinations occur.,Nanotechnology,4
every concrete act of production incorporates a kind of combination.,Nanotechnology,4
"a company can 
itself be considered a combination, and even may be the conditions of production of the 
whole economic system (see schumpeter, , p. ).",Nanotechnology,4
"roughly speaking, being photovoltaics already an innovation in itself, when it 
is combined with nanotechnology, its power of subversion, which can also be interpreted 
as its ability to break paradigms in the energy industry, takes the form of a powerful 
competitive weapon for the production units.",Nanotechnology,4
"given this context, nanotechnology combined with the production of solar 
energy becomes interesting for the production units, whether they are public or private.",Nanotechnology,4
"describing the way a nanopanel is manufactured, begin to note that first it is 
necessary to produce the semiconductor’s nanoparticles.",Nanotechnology,4

costs when compared with other solar panels and also in terms of performance even

other countries like canada, for example, shows the importance of the development of 
alternative energies.",Nanotechnology,4

be well above inflation in the country for a long period.",Nanotechnology,4
"recently, brazil took the 
advantage of using photovoltaic energy through the use of nano-panels.",Nanotechnology,4
"it may be noted 
in fact that this is one of the reasons that qualify the use of photovoltaic energy as a 
generator of competitive advantage in the market.",Nanotechnology,4

"nano-panels allow also to perceive a competitive advantage 
in environmental conservation terms, when compared with the energy provided by public 
network (ferreira et al, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"in short: nanotechnology strongly implements the transformation of traditional

"this transformation may be in the way goods and services are produced, or in the 
way the production is conducted and made.",Nanotechnology,4

nowadays life.",Nanotechnology,4
"and there is a great fundamental hope in nanotechnology to improve the 
capabilities of electronic components, namely in what concerns the reducing their 
dimensions, weight and power consumption.",Nanotechnology,4
"indeed, being the electronic components traditionally of very short 
dimensions and very low weight, the reducing of these quantities to the nanoscale level 
makes possible to conceive electronic devices with much more qualities, since then it is 
possible to incorporate there much more components and even so to reduce the size and 
weight of the device.",Nanotechnology,4
"as for the reducing of power consumption, only to emphasize that this is 
crucial in these times in which the energy shortage becomes an increasingly dramatic 
problem, nothing being too much in the efforts to achieve that the human activity 
happens to follow with an increasingly lower consumption of energy, attempting to reach 
a situation close to the one of no wastes 
  
                    also to refer that the nanotechnology developments may also contribute to 
the improvement of human creativity allowing to conceive new kinds of electronic 
components, to be used either in classical electronic devices or in modern ones.",Nanotechnology,4
"all this in order to improve the humanity life standard both in work and 
leisure.",Nanotechnology,4
"when speaking about the applications of nanotechnology to electronics it is usual 
to designate it as nanoelectronics, being the emergence of this word a sign of the huge 
importance of nanotechnology in electronics.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanoelectronics holds some answers for how it is possible to increase the 
capabilities of electronics devices and simultaneously reduce their weight and power 
consumption, making its operation more and more convenient and cheaper.",Nanotechnology,4
"many of the 
nanoelectronics areas under development are devoted to the following topics: 
                    -everybody is aware of the enormous and surprising properties that 
electronic device screens currently have.",Nanotechnology,4
"practically everything is remote from the touch 
of a finger, and moreover on devices as small as mobile phones.",Nanotechnology,4
"it seems that this 
situation will become overwhelmingly dominant for all electronics, and for example for 
televisions is already there.",Nanotechnology,4
and also for the medical monitors used in medicine.,Nanotechnology,4
"this will 
ensure greater speed and precision in the most varied procedures.",Nanotechnology,4
"improving display 
screens on electronics devices is precisely a nanoelectronics area under development.",Nanotechnology,4
"this involves reducing power consumption while decreasing the weight and thickness of 
the screens and above all to develop new properties for the screens that, for example, 
allow the touch command.",Nanotechnology,4
"-everyone is amazed at how much information can be stored nowadays in 
such small spaces.",Nanotechnology,4
it can even be said in microspaces.,Nanotechnology,4
"but everything indicates that much 
greater fears are to come in this matter.",Nanotechnology,4
"increasing the density of memory chips is a target 
for many scientists working in the nanoelectronics area.",Nanotechnology,4

"it seems that it is an enormous exaggeration but who knows the

"an enumeration of applications under development, falling in the topics 
described above may be seen in reference .",Nanotechnology,4
"nanotechnology in medicine- friendly efficient 
healthcare 
                    nanotechnology is giving continuous steps towards new developments in research 
and applications.",Nanotechnology,4
"it will be expanded to many areas of life and sciences, particularly in medicine, 
  
where the diagnosis, drug deliveries’ systems in the body or the treatment of diseases are 
particularly important.",Nanotechnology,4
"applications of nanotechnology for treatment, diagnosis, monitoring, and control of 
biological systems were recently referred to as ""nanomedicine"" by the institutes of health (see 
moghimi et al, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"the origin of the concept of nanomedicine is related to the idea that nanorobots and 
related machines could be designed, manufactured, and introduced into the human body to 
execute cellular repairs at the molecular level.",Nanotechnology,4
"nowadays, nanomedicine has multiplied in many 
directions, understanding the idea that the ability to structure materials and devices at the 
molecular scale can bring enormous immediate benefits in the research and practice of medicine 
(see freitas, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"the use of instrumentation techniques inside the human body for ‘medical 
nanorobotics for diabetes control’, ‘nanorobotics for brain aneurysm’, ‘nanorobots for treatment 
of patients with artery occlusion', ‘nanorobots for laparoscopic cancer surgery’, has been 
established and now only requires further industrial implementation and commercialization.",Nanotechnology,4
"aspects such as integrating and using ‘nanorobotic architecture for medical target identification’ 
can effectively contribute to the advance of several medical issues, thus improving biomedical 
engineering.",Nanotechnology,4
"upcoming and current available technologies should be used to achieve a fully 
functional ‘medical nanorobot architecture based on nanobioelectronics’ (cavalcanti, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"according to (moghimi et al, ), the application of nanotechnology to medical 
activities, according to the idea inherent to the concept of nanomedicine, involves the 
identification of precise targets (cells and receptors) related to specific clinical conditions and the 
choice of the appropriate nanocarriers to achieve the required responses while minimizing the 
side effects.",Nanotechnology,4
"they say yet that “mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and 
cancers (tumor cells, as well as tumor neovasculature) are key targets”.",Nanotechnology,4
"in (moghimi et al, ) also it is shown how important are, nowadays, 
nanotechnology and nanoscience approaches to particle design and formulation.",Nanotechnology,4
"the authors 
highlight that they begin to expand the market for many drugs and are forming the basis for a 
highly profitable niche within the industry.",Nanotechnology,4
"their article highlight rational approaches in design 
and surface engineering of nanoscale vehicles and entities for site-specific drug delivery and 
medical imaging after parenteral administration.",Nanotechnology,4
"among the most relevant fields of nanotechnology use one is the development 
of artificial tissues, organs and cells.",Nanotechnology,4
"the implantation of encapsulated cells is being planned for 
the treatment of diabetes, liver failure and kidney failure.",Nanotechnology,4
"and also for the use of encapsulated 
genetically engineered cells for gene therapy.",Nanotechnology,4
"artificial cells uses are very relevant for drug 
delivery and other applications in biotechnology, chemical engineering and medicine (see kubik 
et al, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"new researches are being directed to discover new techniques which may contribute 
for the artificial growth of organs and tissues on nanopatterned scaffolds, aiming to obtain 
internal tissues implants.",Nanotechnology,4
"the studies on the creation of nanostructures that can interact with and 
replace natural biological materials give raise to many opportunities and hope for medical 
treatments.",Nanotechnology,4
"some of the medical areas in which nanomaterials have successful utilization 
are precisely the medical diagnosis, the proper and efficient delivery of pharmaceuticals or the 
development of artificial cells.",Nanotechnology,4
"as seen above, many advances in nanomedicine have been worked.",Nanotechnology,4
"their use in 
valuable medical diagnostics or clinical therapeutics brings significant results.",Nanotechnology,4
"particularly, it is interesting to show the case of the advances on dna 
sequencing and the consequent benefits.",Nanotechnology,4
an ultrafast dna sequencing has been made possible.,Nanotechnology,4
"branton’s team at harvard university used an electric field to drive a variety of rna and dna 
polymers through the central nanopore of an a-hemolysin protein channel mounted in a lipid 
bilayer similar to the outer membrane of a living cell.",Nanotechnology,4
"branton first showed that the nanopore 
could rapidly discriminate between pyrimidine and purine segments along a single rna molecule 
and later demonstrated discrimination between dna chains of similar length and composition 
differing only in base pair sequence (freitas, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"a colossal increase has been got recently in the understanding of the way basic 
biological processes happen at a molecular level (see for example the very particular case of the 
human genome sequence).",Nanotechnology,4
"the importance of these developments continues to grow very fast and 
so the focus on the essential molecular mechanisms underlying the normal functioning of cells, 
tissues and organisms themselves.",Nanotechnology,4
"molecular medicine, by itself, exploits molecular and cellular 
  
biology advances to characterize how normal cellular processes fail or are subverted in disease.",Nanotechnology,4
nanotechnology has an important role in this matter.,Nanotechnology,4
"according to freitas, cited by kubik (), there are three important molecular 
technologies: 
                          - nanoscale-structured materials and devices are promising for advanced 
diagnostics and biosensors, targeted drug delivery and smart drugs, and immunoisolation 
therapies.",Nanotechnology,4
"- biotechnology offers the benefits of molecular medicine via genomics, 
proteomics, and artificial engineered microbes.",Nanotechnology,4
"- molecular machine systems and medical nanorobots will allow instant pathogen 
diagnosis and extermination, chromosome replacement and individual cell surgery in vivo, and 
the efficient augmentation and improvement of natural physiological function.",Nanotechnology,4
"operating in the human body, nanorobots can monitor levels of different 
compounds and store information in an internal memory.",Nanotechnology,4
"the use of nanodevices may permit to 
reduce the intrusiveness, increasing the patient comfort and to give a greater fidelity on results, 
once the target tissue can be examined in its active state in the actual host environment.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanorobots may be used to rapidly examine a given tissue location, surveying its 
biochemistry, biomechanics, and histometric characteristics in greater detail (see kubik et al, 
).",Nanotechnology,4
"if, or when this happen, this will help in better disease diagnosing.",Nanotechnology,4
"in general, nanotechnology works the engineering of molecularly precise structures 
and molecular machines; and nanomedicine makes the application of nanotechnology to 
medicine, considering also the use of medical nanorobotics.",Nanotechnology,4
"medical nanorobots can offer 
targeted treatments to individual organs, tissues, cells and even intracellular components.",Nanotechnology,4
"they 
can get involved in biological processes at the molecular level.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is clear at this moment that nanotechnology will continue to offer very effective 
solutions in many medical areas, allowing new treatments, giving more efficiency to the classic 
treatments, with much less suffering for the patients.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanomedicine may even give answers at 
the level of the control of human aging.",Nanotechnology,4
"this world is a completely new open world, with very 
large potentialities at diverse scales and dimensions, very particularly in the area of telemedicine.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is very interesting to understand that the extent of telemedicine and telehealth success will 
depend on how well the heath care system exploits the capabilities of advanced information 
technology.",Nanotechnology,4
"this technology can extend the reach of medical facilities and resources, promoting 
efficiency, productivity, accuracy in clinical decision making, coordination and integration 
(ackerman et al, ).",Nanotechnology,4
"ethics and nanotechnology 
                      computers have brought the ability to type and made handwriting more and more 
superfluous, even obsolete.",Nanotechnology,4
"mobiles and their miniaturization brought the ability to generally 
communicate anywhere to anybody, making more and more useless the traditional phones.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanotechnology, because of its negligible dimension of devices, will spread the use of devices 
that now are nuisance.",Nanotechnology,4
"for instance, the pacemaker that now is used like a “last resource”, maybe 
soon will be used in a much larger scale if it will be possible to design one at a nanoscale.",Nanotechnology,4
however ethical questions rise with the development of nanotechnology.,Nanotechnology,4
"what are 
the borders for this kind of progress?",Nanotechnology,4
"what are the implications in a 
later phase of development of these technologies?",Nanotechnology,4
"global discussion has begun about this theme since the beginning of the 
discoveries about this subject.",Nanotechnology,4
"legal, ethical and social implications are irreversible and the 
discussion is usually asked to be hard.",Nanotechnology,4
"vanessa nurock, cited in bensaude-vincent (), questions the standard view of 
an ethics for nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"she argues that none of the current trends in the discipline of ethics 
would qualify for application to nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"then considering that neurotechnology – a 
rapidly growing field at the intersection between nano and biotechnology – can affect moral 
capacities of the brain, she suggests that ethics itself may be affected by nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"and she 
leaves open the question of a co-construction of ethics and bionanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"freitas () says that the society should be “able to muster the collective 
financial and moral courage to allow such extraordinarily powerful medicine to be deployed for 
human betterment, with due regard to essential ethical considerations”.",Nanotechnology,4
"at eu, there are some important concerns and discussion about the development 
of the integration of human beings and artificial (software/hardware) entities.",Nanotechnology,4
"next generations, in the perspective of the utilization of nanomaterials, will have 
many benefits in all these chapters (health, economic, environmental, etc).",Nanotechnology,4
"by using this kind of 
advanced technology, with many more applications and much friendlier using, the conditions this 
technology offers will be very environmental friendly as well, as already seen.",Nanotechnology,4
"actually, there are irreversible and long-term impact consequences for future 
generations and for the environment.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, there are risks, as well.",Nanotechnology,4
"but in truth there are 
incredible potential advantages.",Nanotechnology,4
and the discussion is all over the place.,Nanotechnology,4
"the borders are, of 
course, evident and there has to be an achieved balance between the path found to the new 
dimension of knowledge and the contours the problem has.",Nanotechnology,4
"the rub of the question is exactly in 
what measure criticisms may have into account the potential of the technology.",Nanotechnology,4
"so, despite the high feasibility for the economy and the environment, there are 
some considerations regarding the ethical, human dignity and moral borders on nanotechnology 
that should be taken into account.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is interesting to go to the definition of human dignity and its relationship to 
moral made in the “opinion of the european group on ethics in science and new technologies to 
the european commission”, , when discussing the ethical aspects of information and 
communication technologies (ict) implants in the human body.",Nanotechnology,4
"the group makes allusion to 
the eu’s draft treaty that establishes a constitution for europe, stating that “human dignity is 
inviolable.",Nanotechnology,4
"it must be respected and protected” (article ii-), and goes on to explain that “the 
dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis 
of fundamental rights” (declaration concerning the explanations relating to the charter of 
fundamental rights).",Nanotechnology,4
"this group says yet that this explanation does not strictly define human 
dignity and that many writers have attempted to fill this gap.",Nanotechnology,4
"one such attempt
 
suggests that 
human dignity is defined as follows: “the exalted moral status which every being of human origin 
uniquely possesses.",Nanotechnology,4
"human dignity is a given reality, intrinsic to human substance, and not 
contingent upon any functional capacities which vary in degree.",Nanotechnology,4
"(…) the possession of human 
  
dignity carries certain immutable moral obligations.",Nanotechnology,4
"desires, challenges but also 
concerns are always present… what are the consequences?",Nanotechnology,4
"are 
humans creating a new being?",Nanotechnology,4
"are we prepared to get different, biologically and to become 
another thing?",Nanotechnology,4
"are humans creating further ""nano-digital devices"" between humans that have 
access to these advanced technologies and humans that have not access?",Nanotechnology,4
"this discussion is 
recognized but probably the ethical discussion has not been enough promoted.",Nanotechnology,4
"in the long term, which are the consequences that nanotechnology has in the 
environment?",Nanotechnology,4
"it is possible to predict that less damage in nature can be done if nanomaterials are 
considered instead large equipments are used.",Nanotechnology,4
"besides, once the need of inputs to produce these 
devices is lesser, probably there is an additional advantage on this perspective for nature 
preservation.",Nanotechnology,4
but what is the reverse of the medal?,Nanotechnology,4
"really, the implications and directions of nanotechnology need further 
discussion.",Nanotechnology,4
"the consequences of avoiding the discussion may be severe for public, considering 
rejection or fear of the effects.",Nanotechnology,4
is there a need for a regulatory authority?,Nanotechnology,4
"which kind of 
mechanisms are needed to interfere in the nanotechnologies developments area?",Nanotechnology,4
"in truth, it may be possible in general to consider  topics for discussion (see 
mnyusiwalla et al, ) about ethics in this subject.",Nanotechnology,4
"they are equity, privacy, security, 
environment and metaphysical when discussing the relationship human-machine.",Nanotechnology,4
"about each one 
of them some considerations may be made.",Nanotechnology,4
"so, assuming these topics, it may be said the 
following, without going until the limit of the analysis: 
                               - equity: the classical problem of developed and developing countries may 
assure a new topic for discussion.",Nanotechnology,4
"in fact, technology and development are closely related.",Nanotechnology,4
"some 
important subjects that developing countries are worried with are poverty reduction, the problems 
of energy, water and health and somehow biodiversity as well.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanotechnology would help these 
  
countries to better conditions of population health and way of life.",Nanotechnology,4
"but it is costly to implement 
any project in this area and as often there are no financial resources to do that, consequently these 
countries will be the less benefited with these advances.",Nanotechnology,4
"the main problem happens with the 
access to the benefits of technology considering the poorest and the richest people in any country.",Nanotechnology,4
who may reach the advances of science and benefit from them?,Nanotechnology,4
"anyway, it is true that poor, 
whatever they are, may benefit from these advances.",Nanotechnology,4
"it may depend on the will of politicians and 
on the investments of some of these countries, for example.",Nanotechnology,4
"a consequence would be lower needs 
for energy and a cleaner energy production as well as other environmental benefits, a safer drug 
delivery, the improvement on health through for example better prevention, diagnosis and 
treatment.",Nanotechnology,4
"- privacy: at this level, it is possible to consider the enormous innovations 
which can be reached, by improving surveillance devices or other devices that restrict human 
privacy.",Nanotechnology,4

physiological sensors bring enormous implications in e-health.",Nanotechnology,4
"one point needed is about the 
necessary discussion about privacy and security.",Nanotechnology,4
"- security: certainly new powered weapons will be available very soon, as far 
as “invisible” microphones and cameras will be available.",Nanotechnology,4

and the use of nps becomes a question.",Nanotechnology,4
"with the extended use 
of nps in food industry the primary concern would be “how 
safe are these applications”?",Nanotechnology,4
"use of nps in food industry may 
result in nps mediated toxicity at different levels as shown in 
fig. .
these nps can adhere or blend to the packed food materials 
and result in toxicity-.",Nanotechnology,4
"considering the harmful effects of 
nps all the benefits of this technology get annulled.",Nanotechnology,4
"nps are 
used in various sensors to monitor and eliminate microbial 
contamination and toxins from food.",Nanotechnology,4
"nps can contaminate 
food during this process and result in toxicity as food comes in 
contact with nps.",Nanotechnology,4
"in-vivo and in-vitro studies have highlighted 
the lethal effect of these metal oxide nps.",Nanotechnology,4
"in the current scenario 
there is no relevant data about release of nps from the packing 
material in food, therefore indepth studies are required in cases 
where metal oxide are used in packaging.",Nanotechnology,4

of silicate are quite promising for safer manufacture of nano 
made packing material in food industry, however these nps 
can mildly interact with food and toxicity studies are required 
to implement their use.",Nanotechnology,4

quality of the food item by control oxidation, release active 
components and maintain the texture of food.",Nanotechnology,4

food additives like gelatin, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, 
aliginate are effectively used in nanoenacapsulation for food 
packaging and application in relative to food industry.",Nanotechnology,4
"organic 
and biocompatible nano formulation can certainly ensure better 
packaging as well as safety of the food items. 
.  oral consumption of nps and toxicity at 
cellular level
recent research has showed that nps present toxic effects 
when in contact with biological interface.",Nanotechnology,4
"after ingestion these 
particles are diffused to the blood and lymph through which 
these can reach vital organs like heart, spleen, lungs, liver and 
possibly to brain with the ability to cross blood brain barrier.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanoscale formulations are biologically more available, 
as they can penetrate deep into the tissue and cell, resulting 
in enhanced interaction with various biological molecules 
culminating toxicity.",Nanotechnology,4
"the toxicity mediated by the nps greatly 
depends on size, composition, properties and aggregation.",Nanotechnology,4
"with reduction in size the surface area increases, which results 
in offering more space for any interaction to occur.",Nanotechnology,4
"these nano 
bio interactions can trigger novel toxicological pathways.",Nanotechnology,4
"nps are reported to stimulate inflammation, increased ros 
production, immunological reactions, protein denaturation 
and dna damage.",Nanotechnology,4
"most of toxicological studies focus on 
exposure to nps through inhalation, ingestion, injection and 
dermal absorbtion however, considering food nanotechnology,

"currently there are 
no well-defined regulatory guidelines for manufacturing units 
to ensure safety while handling nps.",Nanotechnology,4
"also there is lack of 
knowledge as far as lethal dose of exposure, is concerned.
. nano flavour: adding taste can be risky
nano ingredients are profoundly used in food industry to 
alter food in various prospects.",Nanotechnology,4
"most of the nano supplements 
are used to enhance taste and nutritional value.",Nanotechnology,4
"various vitamins 
are available in the food market at nano level however, the 
major concern is that at nano level these food ingredients 
can be toxic, specifically at higher doses.",Nanotechnology,4
"consumption of 
vitamins at nano level may result in excessive, unmonitored 
absorption of vitamins by the body which could be detrimental 
and possibly result in various neurological disorders.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is 
unpredictable that nano fortification food, claim to meet the 
dietary requirement could replace the natural varied diet.
. nano packing and toxicity
use of nps in food packaging is considered safe, as nps 
are not a food component and usually accepted by the public; 
however, leaching of nano substituent of packing materials is 
quite possible.",Nanotechnology,4
"nps are used in packing material like wraps, 
container, beer bottle, chopping board, cooking utensils etc, 
where nps can leach out and contaminate the food.",Nanotechnology,4
"metal oxide 
nps like zinc oxide, silver oxide, copper oxide and magnesium 
are used for making packaging material as these ensure long 
term storage of food items.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, it is quite possible that

dose intake of polystyrene nps, blocks iron absorption and its 
long term utilisation may result in intestinal structure changes.",Nanotechnology,4
nps can also result in gut related ailments like cron disease.,Nanotechnology,4
"increased absorption of nps may result in altered nutritional 
profile and intrusion of foreign substances in the blood.",Nanotechnology,4
"when 
ingested, these nano particles can disturb the gut microbial flora 
which also determines the health of an individual.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is important 
to study the fate of nps that include absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion by the human body.",Nanotechnology,4
"the body can 
breakdown these nps into more toxic metabolites e.g.",Nanotechnology,4
"metal 
oxide nps into metal ions.",Nanotechnology,4
"the intensely used nano formulations in food industry 
which include aluminium, silicon and titanium are commonly 
seen to aggregate in lymphoid tissue.",Nanotechnology,4
"biological entities like 
nucleus of the cell are easily reached by these particles.",Nanotechnology,4

are reported to cross the placental barriers,.",Nanotechnology,4

surface to volume ratio enable more interaction with cellular 
bodies.",Nanotechnology,4

by the increased surface area influence cellular uptake and 
interactions,.",Nanotechnology,4
"ros generation is a common phenomenon on exposure 
to nps.",Nanotechnology,4
"cells have defensive machinery to overcome ros 
generations, however failure in this, results in toxicity,.",Nanotechnology,4
"increased surface area of the nps results in extensive ros 
generations.",Nanotechnology,4
"the interaction of these particles may result in 
altered cellular morphology and cytoskeleton,.",Nanotechnology,4
"showed that nps disrupt cytoskeleton networks by 
changing actin fibers.",Nanotechnology,4
"though it is reported that nps effect the 
cytoskeleton network, the detailed mechanism and the role of 
cellular pathways involved is yet to be studied.",Nanotechnology,4
"inorganic nps can interfere with the delicate balance of 
cellular homeostasis and thereby alter complex intracellular 
signalling pathways, resulting in a cascade of possible effects.",Nanotechnology,4
"these interactions can occur by several mechanisms, such 
as: genotoxic effects caused by high levels of ros, altered 
protein or gene expression due to the perinuclear localisation 
of the particles, altered protein or gene expression levels 
due to leaching of free metal ions, altered activation status 
of proteins by interfering with stimulating factors such as 
cell-surface receptors, and altered gene expression levels in 
response to the cellular stress that the nps induce.",Nanotechnology,4
"to date, the effect of nms on protein or gene expression 
levels has only scarcely been investigated and sufficient data 
needs to be generated in order to get a holistic view of the extent 
nps can cause alterations to intracellular signalling pathways.",Nanotechnology,4
"studies on genotoxicity induced by these nps lacks detailed 
data and real harm caused by these nps is yet not clear.",Nanotechnology,4
"the 
effect of chronic exposure and subsequent lethal damage of the 
genetic material has not been investigated conclusively.",Nanotechnology,4
"because of the high surface to charge density, ph at 
nps surface is different from their surrounding.",Nanotechnology,4
"nps are 
also exposed to various enzymatic degradation resulting in 
generation of free ions and disruption in cellular homeostasis,.",Nanotechnology,4
"the surface charge enables nps to bind with various proteins, 
leading to formation of protein corona,.",Nanotechnology,4
"even the presence 
of proteins will result in strong bonding between the nps and 
proteins which can be prevented by protective coating.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is clearly demarked that bio nano-interaction can mediate 
toxicity at different level of cellular organisation.",Nanotechnology,4
"not only this, 
there is a dual concern of toxicity effecting human health as 
well as environment.",Nanotechnology,4
"these nps inadvertently get built up at 
different level in the food chain during the manufacturing, 
utilisation and disposable process.",Nanotechnology,4
"at different levels these nps 
may behave different with different unexpected surrounding, 
resulting in novel reactions and formation of lethal substances.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is important to effectively evaluate and put forward standard 
guidelines before the nano food market flourish.
.  regulations: elsis
the need of the hour is to develop considerable ethical, 
legal and social implications (elsis) before nano food 
products are introduced in the market.",Nanotechnology,4
"till date, there are no 
specific guidelines to evaluate toxicity related to nano food.",Nanotechnology,4
"the monitoring agencies like fda regulate food products not 
technologies, thus multiple regulatory bodies are required to 
deliver safe nano food products in market.",Nanotechnology,4
"combitorial system 
comprising of toxicologist and food technologist is required 
before implementing nanotechnology to human health.",Nanotechnology,4
"another aspect by the institute of food science and technology 
is that when nano material is a component of food additive then 
conventional e-numbering system should be implemented 
along with subscript “n”.",Nanotechnology,4
"despite of the lack of concrete rules 
and regulations and incomplete knowledge nano food market 
is flourishing by the day, ignoring the detrimental effects.",Nanotechnology,4
"in 
european union, “scientific committee on emerging and 
newly identified health risks” risk assessment related to 
nanotechnology and defining recognised terminology to evaluate 
toxicity mediated by nps is emphasised.",Nanotechnology,4
"standard analytical 
methods must be developed for effective detection of nps in 
food.",Nanotechnology,4
"regulations related to nanotechnology can be framed 
well defined horizontal and vertical legislation.",Nanotechnology,4
"the horizontal 
legislation is very broad and includes aspect of nanotechnology 
but does not specifically state methodologies to do so.",Nanotechnology,4
"on the 
other hand the vertical legislation is well defined, explanatory 
and most recent.",Nanotechnology,4
"registration, evaluation, authorisation and 
restriction of chemicals (reach) and general product and 
safety directive (gpsd) in european countries regulate nano 
technologies under horizontal legislation.",Nanotechnology,4
"both define safety 
through gathering adequate information that whether the 
substance used is safe on production and well explained on 
labelling.",Nanotechnology,4
"the food additives directive (//eec) was 
the first legislation to include nano technologies in specific. 
.  public acceptance to nano-food 
technology 
the prime concern is public acceptance, trust and 
willingness to pay for nano technologies in food industry.",Nanotechnology,4
"the 
public is willing to buy food with nano packaging but nano 
food where a nm is a part of ingredient are less acceptable 
and considered to be less safe and compared to the nano based 
packaging.",Nanotechnology,4
"it was found that the 
public is reluctant to accept nanotechnology related foods or 
food packaging with nano composition.",Nanotechnology,4
"thus the big question is 
will this novel technology be accepted or rejected?",Nanotechnology,4
"in a research 
it was found that public perception on food nano technologies is 
not simple but complex, and influenced by multiple factor e.g.",Nanotechnology,4
", july, doi : ./dlsj..
when product is less beneficial, consumers are more concerned 
about risk as compared to, when benefits are high.",Nanotechnology,4
"research 
on public perception on nano technologies also indicates that 
there is lack of information about nano food application and 
their impact on health and environment.",Nanotechnology,4
"due to the unexpected 
outcome of the genetically modified food, public is reluctant to 
accept something which is artificially synthesised.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, 
a change in this notion can be brought through transparency, 
education, implementation and assurance of safety.
.  future of food nanotechnology 
considering the current scenario, the conflict between 
benefits and risk will last long before a proper regulatory 
authority would be constituted and guidelines will be 
framed; however, despite the safety concerns the benefits 
of food nanotechnology cannot be ignored.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is therefore 
essential to maintain a balance between “too strict” and “too 
loose” in scheming the standards and guidelines for food 
nanotechnologies.",Nanotechnology,4
"updated research on toxicity correlated 
with innovative upcoming nanotechnologies is essential for their 
safe application in food industry.",Nanotechnology,4
"safety of nps applications in 
food industry can be ensured only by evaluating their physio-
chemical properties in the corresponding surrounding.",Nanotechnology,4
"benefits of nanotechnology in food industry can be harnessed 
by using nps of biological and organic origin.",Nanotechnology,4
"based on the 
research information, implementation of a well designed safety 
guideline in consideration to the food based applications of nps 
is a prerequisite.",Nanotechnology,4
"public acceptance of this novel technology 
can be achieved if the benefits are worth paying and more as 
out weights its drawbacks.",Nanotechnology,4
"public awareness about both pros 
and cons of this application is required, by proper labelling and 
advertisement of such applications in food industry.",Nanotechnology,4
"though, 
demanding practical implementation of this technology in food 
industry is a far off dream, yet nanotechnology can certainly 
modernise the food industry.

every technology comes with a pros and cons.",Nanotechnology,4
"the janet 
facet of nanotechnology cannot be ignored.",Nanotechnology,4
"on one hand 
nanotechnology has made our lives much easier on the other 
hand there can be severe harmful drawbacks of this technology.",Nanotechnology,4
"currently scientific research is at the very benign state, and 
many mysteries of the nanotechnology are yet to be known 
before wide spread diaspora of these in the surrounding.",Nanotechnology,4
"application of nano based products can certainly be used in 
food industry under well defined regulatory guidelines.",Nanotechnology,4
"such a question is not usually
taken into consideration in discussions about regulations concerning
nanotechnology, i.e.",Nanotechnology,4
"technology that includes structures measuring in the 
millionths of a millimetre.",Nanotechnology,4

extremely vast and includes such fields as the food industry, medicine,
construction, and textiles.",Nanotechnology,4

"the starting point of the paper is to present nanotechnology as an emerging

regulating public authority liability will create incentives for policy-makers so
that they will take more effective and more precautionary actions; c) by
regulating public authority liability tort law could regain its primary function
which is the materialization of the idea of justice; d) although any additional
regulations can result in stifling the pace of technological development,
regulating public authority liability can slow down this pace potentially to a
lesser degree than regulating the liability of companies because public authority
liability does not affect the functioning of tech companies directly and thus it

authority, which means that the public authority will have to prove that it has
not infringed precautionary principles.",Nanotechnology,4

using the product, etc.).",Nanotechnology,4
"this uncertainty is the result of basing production

consequences of nanomaterials for human health are mostly unknown.",Nanotechnology,4
"one of
the potential uses of nanotechnology in medicine is that of enabling nanodevices
such as nanotubes or nanoshells to circulate in the bloodstream.",Nanotechnology,4

"deciding when and how to regulate
nanotechnology
when facing challenges caused by technological innovations, policy-
makers have in practice two possible scenarios to enact.",Nanotechnology,4
"nci, ‘‘cancer & nanotech”, supra note .",Nanotechnology,4
"for example brownsword describes new technologies as the challenge of regulatory
public authority liability & the regulation of nanotechnology 
can introduce some regulations on the emerging technology.",Nanotechnology,4
"the regulations will
usually impose limits on the application of the technology, set out requirements
for introducing the technology to market, the conditions under which the
technology can be used (e.g.",Nanotechnology,4
"safety standards) or, in the most extreme way, they
can forbid the use of the technology.",Nanotechnology,4
"in the second scenario, policy-makers can
simply wait and observe how the new technology is going to develop.",Nanotechnology,4
"even
though policy-makers do not take any steps to establish new regulations for the
technology, the technology will usually be regulated, to some extent, by existing
legal rules.",Nanotechnology,4
"in this case the concept of ‘‘translation”, developed by lawrence
lessig, is of key importance.",Nanotechnology,4
"according to lessig’s concept, in the face of
changing technological realities, ‘‘translation” protects the meaning and restores
the original values of existing legal regulations.",Nanotechnology,4
"in some cases changing an
interpretative practice and, for example, increasing the scope of the application
of existing rules will be sufficient to deal with new technologies.",Nanotechnology,4
"moreover, the lack of legal actions from public authorities does not mean
that the use of the technology is not regulated.",Nanotechnology,4
"according to lessig, there are
four modalities that could regulate it: legal norms, social norms, markets and
‘‘architecture”.",Nanotechnology,4
"if legal regulations do not provide an adequate legal response
for the new reality created by the emerging technology, other modalities will take
the primary role.",Nanotechnology,4
"lessig claims that social norms regulate the reality and are
enforced by a community.",Nanotechnology,4
markets regulate people’s behavior by price.,Nanotechnology,4
"the last
modifier that could operate in the absence of legal regulations is ‘‘architecture”.",Nanotechnology,4
"the ‘‘architecture” of the physical world has an impact on how technology is
used.",Nanotechnology,4
"for example, it can make the application of the technology more common,
encourage people to use it and build trust in it.",Nanotechnology,4
how can these modalities be relevant to the case of nanotechnology?,Nanotechnology,4
"first of
all, the market could regulate the use of nanoproducts by their price.",Nanotechnology,4
"this would
mean that if nanoproducts are cheaper than products which do not contain
nanoparticles, people are encouraged to buy more nanoproducts.",Nanotechnology,4
"on the other
hand, if the price of nanoproducts declines too far, consumers might start
thinking of nanoproducts as being cheaper, less reliable and poorer quality
replacements of regular products.",Nanotechnology,4

the level of consumers’ knowledge of this technology.",Nanotechnology,4
"a society which is well-
informed about nanoproducts can make a conscious decision and generate
norms about whether, and how, it wants to use nanoproducts.",Nanotechnology,4
the most challenging task is to apply ‘‘architecture” to nanotechnology.,Nanotechnology,4
"it
should be noted that lessig’s concept of modalities refers primarily to new
technologies with relation to cyberspace.",Nanotechnology,4
"taking into account the nature of
nanotechnology, which is a highly advanced and scientific field, and that
nanoparticles are imperceptible by the regular user, the ‘‘architecture” modality
will probably have a limited application to this technology.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, it can
apply to the physical design of nanoproducts, especially their packaging.",Nanotechnology,4
"the
package informing the user that nanomaterials are used in a production process
can encourage or discourage people to buy the nanoproduct, depending on a
current consumer fad.",Nanotechnology,4
"furthermore, the amount of safety information a label
contains can result in gaining or losing consumers’ trust in a product.",Nanotechnology,4
"all the modalities expressed by lessig could have some impact on the
manner that nanotechnology is regulated.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, their importance decreases
when we take into account the need to establish a proper level of safety for
nanoproducts, and the possibility for redress when damages are caused by
nanoproducts.",Nanotechnology,4
"neither social norms, the market, nor ‘‘architecture” can fully or
effectively regulate for product safety and ensure sufficient protection from the
risks nanotechnology involves and thus they will play minor roles.",Nanotechnology,4

requirements are an emerging issue related to nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4

policy-maker is thus to balance the necessity of ensuring an adequate level of
protection while using nanotechnology (if the benefits outweigh the risks) to
provide more advanced research and to foster innovation.",Nanotechnology,4
"the lack of knowledge
about the long-term health effects of using nano-products causes difficulties in
establishing one precise standard that can be applied to public authorities that
are seeking to craft regulations that attempt to balance both health and safety
considerations with the creation of conditions in which innovation in the
nanotechnology area can thrive.",Nanotechnology,4
"generally, it can be claimed that the standard
should correspond to the safety level that the users are entitled to expect, based
on the current state of knowledge, but also including justified predictions.",Nanotechnology,4
"those
expectations should be assessed from the normal and prudent user’s
perspective.",Nanotechnology,4
"even though nanotechnology is usually operated by a specific
group of users (e.g.",Nanotechnology,4

"v. problems with european product liability law
so far, little attention has been devoted to the issue of liability with respect to
nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"although nanotechnology generates new risks, there is no
separate liability regime, which means that the traditional rules of existing tort
law have to be applied in the case of injuries caused by nanomaterials.",Nanotechnology,4
"from the
user’s perspective, liability rules might be as important as health and safety
regulations.",Nanotechnology,4
"this is because the safety rules are addressed mainly to the
companies, and consumers are not directly identified by such regulations.",Nanotechnology,4
"the
regulation of compensation for damages caused by products which do not meet
certain safety requirements might be thus more interesting for the users of
nanoproducts.",Nanotechnology,4
"this area is regulated by tort law, more precisely by product
liability law, and its role in connection with the development of new technologies
should primarily be users’ protection.",Nanotechnology,4
"unfortunately, existing regulations in force in the eu member states
regarding liability for damage caused by defective products, implemented under
the product liability directive, is not a fully adequate legal response to the risks
connected with nanoproducts and fails to ensure appropriate levels of safety for
users of this technology.",Nanotechnology,4
"first of all, the directive limits the scope of its application to ‘‘tangible”
goods.",Nanotechnology,4

"also, a product shall not be considered
defective for the sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into
circulation.",Nanotechnology,4
"the phrase, ‘‘the safety which a person is entitled to expect”, shows
that the directive regime is based on a consumer expectation model.",Nanotechnology,4
"the crucial
element of this model, however, is the necessity that consumers are well-informed
so that they can make an informed decision as to whether or not they would like
to use nanoproducts.",Nanotechnology,4

about the risks associated with the use of nanoproducts, e.g.",Nanotechnology,4
labelling issues remain controversial.,Nanotechnology,4

"it often results from false, selective, or
misinterpreted information about a new technology, as well as conflicting reports

the stigmatization effect can also be seen in case of gmos.",Nanotechnology,4
"although new
technologies are usually introduced to the market under the assumption that they
will be beneficial and bring improvement to existing technologies, they are
sometimes rejected by the potential users for above mentioned reasons.",Nanotechnology,4

case, labelling can magnify the effect of distrust and resistance, which can be seen
in the social approach to gmo in the eu.",Nanotechnology,4

that these processes are riskier than other methods of processing food.",Nanotechnology,4

actually even safer.",Nanotechnology,4
"consumers are more aware of the existence of gmo food,

not know that the product contains nanomaterials, they have a limited ability to
benefit, for example, from the protection provided by tort law.",Nanotechnology,4
"accurate
information enables users to make an informed decision about whether they
want to use potentially dangerous technology and expose themselves to the
possibility of harm.",Nanotechnology,4
"apart from labelling, users could also be informed about risks by the media
or public campaigns.",Nanotechnology,4

might not present themselves for a long period of time, a -year limitation
period from the date on which the producer put the product into circulation

the traditional concept of a product liability regime and concentrates not on

. justifying regulation of public authority liability
one may ask why policy-makers should be liable for taking any regulatory
action.",Nanotechnology,4
"the decision on whether or not to regulate a new technology depends
almost entirely on the vision of a particular policy-maker.",Nanotechnology,4
"regulations are
supposed to reflect the societal interactions and needs, as well as attitudes,
existing in a society which usually expresses traditional, regional and cultural
diversity.",Nanotechnology,4
"policy-makers have the freedom to make decisions concerning the
scope and form of regulations.",Nanotechnology,4
"this can help explain why gmo technology is
regulated differently in the us and the eu.",Nanotechnology,4
"one of the concerns around regulating for public authority liability with
respect to new technologies is the excessive burden this would place on public
authorities to foresee the effects of the legislative solutions that are adopted.",Nanotechnology,4
"this leads to the more fundamental question of who should bear the risk of
regulatory policy, and why.",Nanotechnology,4
"first, it seems justifiable to assume that public
authorities should be aware of the consequences of their decisions.",Nanotechnology,4
"the policy-makers’
decision also has an impact on whether and how technology will be used by
companies, and how products will be introduced to the market.",Nanotechnology,4
"companies thus
rely on legal regulation and adjust their production processes to the existing legal
framework.",Nanotechnology,4
"on the other hand, there is a threat that the users will bear all the
costs of introducing technology to the market.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is clear that policy-makers are also the risk-taking actors when introducing
new technologies into public use.",Nanotechnology,4
"in the discussion on the role of government in
the innovation industry, one may find opinions such as the following, that:

innovations flourish thanks to government action is exaggerated, one has to
notice that policy-makers can have a real impact on the technological reality.",Nanotechnology,4
"while mazzucato stops her arguments at proving why the government is an
active actor on the innovation field, thus explaining why companies should
contribute to public funds, it is possible to go a step further.",Nanotechnology,4
"the contribution of
public authorities to technological development can support the liability they
should bear for their policy decisions.",Nanotechnology,4
"the next argument for regulating public authority liability is that it can
create incentives for policy-makers to take more effective and more
precautionary actions in order to ensure adequate levels of user protection.",Nanotechnology,4
"before making a legally binding decision on a regulatory policy, policy-makers
can, for example, commission more research on the potentially detrimental
effects of the technology to be regulated.",Nanotechnology,4

influence the effective exercise of power.",Nanotechnology,4

authority is not subject to basic economic assumptions, such as the assumption
of maximizing profits, public authority liability can create incentives for policy-
makers.

economic perspective, the higher costs of production resulting from overly strict
legal requirements, or the more serious and real possibility of paying monetary

"the other solution for balancing health and environmental risks against the
commercialization of nanotechnology, which was proposed in the literature,
concerns mandatory private-public insurance schemes.",Nanotechnology,4

fact that public-private insurance could possibly balance the risks posed by

that the eu, as an entity with a legal personality, bears for damage caused by its
institutions or by its servants in the performance of their duties, found in article
() treaty on the functioning of the eu(tfeu), gives an illustrative
example.",Nanotechnology,4
"according to article ()(f) tfeu, consumer protection is one of the
areas where the eu and the member states share their competencies, which
means that eu institutions can regulate nanotechnology from the perspective of
consumer protection.",Nanotechnology,4
"in the first place, it should be noted that article () tfeu does not
provide the specific prerequisites of liability, which are to be determined on the
basis of the general principles common to the member states.",Nanotechnology,4
"the formulation of
the conditions of non-contractual liability lies with the court of justice of the
european union (cjeu), which is the only body that is competent to adjudicate
complaints for damages.",Nanotechnology,4
there is uncertainty around this provision.,Nanotechnology,4
"both the
general formulation of article () tfeu and the diversification of liability
rules in the member states result in the cjeu having wide discretion in setting
the rules for claiming damages.",Nanotechnology,4
"to some extent, this generality could be treated
as an advantage, as it creates flexibility.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, cjeu judgments in many
cases are inconsistent, often devoid of plausible justification, and the accepted
jurisprudence is often not continued in subsequent cases.",Nanotechnology,4
"as a consequence, the
liability of the eu is not predictable and cannot fully secure consumers’ rights

"the probable origin of the disease was
a change in the preparation of cattle feed, which contained proteins derived from
sheep infected with scrapie.",Nanotechnology,4
"transmission of the disease came about mainly
through the ingestion of feed, in particular, meat-and-bone meal containing the
infectious agent that had not been eliminated.",Nanotechnology,4
"the applicants contended that
the european council and european commission persistently and deliberately
favoured the interests of traders on the market in beef and veal to the detriment
of the health of consumers when they assessed and managed the risks linked to
the disease.",Nanotechnology,4
"the applicants claimed that there were wrongful omissions on the
part of those institutions in carrying out their duties and obligations in the area
of animal and human health and that they adopted insufficient, incorrect,
inadequate or belated standards and measures to deal with the risks resulting
from ‘‘mad cow disease”.",Nanotechnology,4

actions and omissions of the council and the commission cannot be considered
to be a definite and direct cause of the infection.",Nanotechnology,4

result, the court concluded that there was no causal link between the damage

of the statute of the court of justice of the european union, proceedings
against the eu in matters arising from non-contractual liability shall be barred
after a period of five years from the occurrence of the event giving rise thereto.",Nanotechnology,4

"first, the beginning of the limitation period is counted from the materialization
of the damage, not from the moment of awareness of the damage.",Nanotechnology,4

there is no detailed regulation addressing postponement, which would facilitate a
significant extension of the running of the limitation period.",Nanotechnology,4

sufficient legal response.

"as mentioned in part iv, the non-legal regulatory mechanisms on their own,
which are the market, social norms and ‘‘architecture”, cannot guarantee a
sufficient level of protection with respect to the nanotechnology phenomenon.",Nanotechnology,4
"the arguments discussed in part iv remain relevant while analyzing the public
authority problem.",Nanotechnology,4
"it should be noted that the liability for damage caused by acts or omissions
committed by a public authority is a common principle in european legal

response to the risks created by nanotechnology results in law losing its function
as a regulatory mechanism for social relations.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, there are some
problems related to public authority liability.",Nanotechnology,4
"the uncertainty in determining the
proper standard of care is a challenge, and could cause liability to be blurred, or
create ineffective stimuli.",Nanotechnology,4
"where liability is imposed excessively, a decreased level
of activity on the part of authorities could result.",Nanotechnology,4
"conversely, if liability is
excessively tempered, an increase in the abuse of authority could result.",Nanotechnology,4
"secondly, liability will have an impact in terms of the costs of indemnification.",Nanotechnology,4
"public authorities paying compensation may also lead to a deterioration in state
budgets and increase the fiscal burden imposed on citizens.",Nanotechnology,4

scope of regulation will be restricted to a defined political area.",Nanotechnology,4
"first, the
development of non-contractual liability is to a great degree different in
individual countries.",Nanotechnology,4
"second, public authority liability will refer by nature to a

do the benefits of regulation justify the costs?,Nanotechnology,4
"undoubtedly, any regulation will create some costs.",Nanotechnology,4
"as noted above, in the
case of public authority liability these are mainly the costs of the compensatory
process.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, the proposed solution does not affect companies directly, so it
will probably not hinder technological development, which is always a serious
concern when regulating technologies.",Nanotechnology,4
"the government, on the other hand, will
not be left alone with the burden of the compensatory process if a general
‘‘innovation fund” is created.",Nanotechnology,4
"companies will thus contribute to the
compensatory process and public authorities will not have look for additional
funding, for example, in the form of a tax increase.",Nanotechnology,4

enabled the court to make at a very early stage the finding concerning
convergence of those legal systems in the establishment of a principle of
liability in the case of unlawful action or an unlawful omission of the

position as regards the possible existence of a principle of liability in the

compensation from the company, s/he will not have a right to sue the public
authority.",Nanotechnology,4
"the claim against the public authorities, however, could be a recourse
claim, meaning if the company provided the compensation and the injury is the
result of inadequate regulatory measures, the company could make a claim in
restitution for the public authority to return the previously paid compensation.",Nanotechnology,4
"furthermore, with regard to nanotechnology, subjectively understood fault
should be replaced with objective criteria such as the infringement of the legal
rules and/or precautionary principles, and move from fault-based liability to
strict liability.",Nanotechnology,4
"in extreme cases, when the damage is unpredictable and has
enormous scope, compensation should be granted even if the actions of public
authorities were lawful.",Nanotechnology,4
the next element is that of causal link.,Nanotechnology,4
"case, proof of a
direct causal link can be a serious obstacle when seeking compensation.",Nanotechnology,4
"furthermore, european law contains a general principle that the party which
makes a claim bears the burden of proof regarding that claim.",Nanotechnology,4
"this is also
applicable to a defence.",Nanotechnology,4
"in the case of nanotechnology, the injured party
usually does not have a real possibility of gathering all the detailed information
on the causal link or exact source of damage.",Nanotechnology,4
"creating presumptions or changing
the burden of proof will mitigate the barriers posed by the current process of
proving causality.",Nanotechnology,4
"this would mean that the policy-maker will have to prove that
it has not infringed precautionary principles.",Nanotechnology,4
"with this change in the burden of
proof, the injured party will receive a real chance of obtaining compensation.",Nanotechnology,4
"taking into account the fact that the long-term consequences of
nanotechnology are mostly unknown, the limitation period plays an important
role in regulating public authority liability.",Nanotechnology,4
"the length of the limitation period in
the case of the eu liability is now five years from the moment of the event giving
rise to liability.",Nanotechnology,4

of that claim.",Nanotechnology,4

certain steps which need to be taken to optimise the data, for example, eliminating duplicates by 
obtaining patent data with the dwpi (derwent patent index) and preparing categories and groups for 
analysis.",Nanotechnology,4
"for this, the tda is used as it performs 
multidimensional statistical analysis to identify clusters and relationships among nodes.",Nanotechnology,4
"each cluster 
is represented by nodes, the size of a node representing the number of patent documents that belongs 
to it, while its centrality represents how often that particular node occurs with other nodes.",Nanotechnology,4

used.",Nanotechnology,4

can be indicated with tall or small peaks and the distance between peaks sheds light on the 
relationship between content, as peaks that are located closer to each other have more closely related

"the region of low share and low rta 
reveals countries allocating relatively fewer resources to technology or science and having less

is difficult to identify and varies depending on various dimensions such as the countries or region 
considered, innovation process analysed, national requirements etc.",Nanotechnology,4

has been chosen in order to accommodate all countries in such a way that a proper comparison of their 
technological or innovation performance can be made.",Nanotechnology,4

appropriate search terms so that the data set includes the relevant patents and excludes unnecessary 
patents, thus increasing the validity of the research.",Nanotechnology,4

levels of academic involvement.",Nanotechnology,4
"in china’s case, interviews with key experts in the chinese academy 
of sciences and tsinghua university were conducted and it was found that this is mainly due to state 
policy on funding: academia is allotted the largest funding share and there are relatively few sources

showed that boundaries of interactions are not limited to the national level and there are interactions 
between different types of organisations, so it is not possible to limit this field into certain sectors.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, an identified weakness is that the linkage between the science pole and market pole is not 
strong enough in terms of innovation processes.",Nanotechnology,4
"there are some strong linkages, such as between 
tsinghua-foxconn, but these types of linkages are rare overall.",Nanotechnology,4
"the weakness in collaboration 
between the science and market poles may be why the nanotechnology field is not in its highly 
commercialised stage and one of the reasons can be related to its collaborative innovation process.",Nanotechnology,4
"this is because there are many radical level patented inventions that are owned by academic actors 
but the majority of these technologies have not yet transferred to industry.  
. implications and future research 
the implications of this study are the following:  
) the substantial increase in patent generation by asian organisations leading to their catching up 
major players such as the us, especially south korea and china, is having a great impact in the 
nanotechnology field.  
)",Nanotechnology,4
"mapping of mature and emerging technologies within the nanotechnology field indicates future 
commercial applications.  
)",Nanotechnology,4
"even though some nations such as the us are strongly involved in the nanotechnology field in 
general, it was very apparent that the key capabilities of each country and various organisations were 
widely divergent.",Nanotechnology,4
"this implies that nations and organisations should provide and have targeted funds 
and r&d to accelerate development in this field.  
)",Nanotechnology,4
governments should encourage (i.e.,Nanotechnology,4
"by funds, special policies and targeted intermediaries) their 
active or potentially active organisations to become involved in the nanotechnology field to gain 
 
 
competitive advantage and help establish clusters or networks to adapt and develop nanotechnology 
rapidly.  
)",Nanotechnology,4
"active or potentially active organisations should become involved in this field to gain competitive 
advantage.  
)",Nanotechnology,4
"management in intermediaries and fund providers should focus on linking academic and industrial 
organisations together and the majority of funds for innovative activities should be targeted towards 
collaborative research.",Nanotechnology,4
"to take this study further, there are many other relationships that could be looked at within the sub-
fields of nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"future studies could look at specific technology domains, such as 
nanomaterials, nanodevices and nanofabrications.",Nanotechnology,4
"as was mentioned above, there are some 
organisations and inventors that hold a high number of patent documents, but the question is whether 
they are highly influential patents in terms of citations, commercial potential and quality.",Nanotechnology,4
"interviews 
and surveys collected from academic and non-academic organisations could be used to gain a more 
in-depth understanding of the topic.",Nanotechnology,4
"a statistical analysis of the relationships pertaining between 
commercialised patents and the latest patents granted could be carried out to examine various 
relationships between inventions and innovations.",Nanotechnology,4
"innumerable 
scientific studies in several areas of knowledge were made since nanoscale 
emergence, carrying their contribution to the nanoscience development, 
leading to a great development of technical and scientific knowledge but 
also raising numerous problems in the ethical field.",Nanotechnology,4

nanotechnology is discussed both in terms of ethics and in terms of borders

introduction 
 
bearing in mind that nanotechnology is the skill to work at the atomic, 
molecular and supramolecular levels (at a scale of approximately  –  
nm), the enormous possibilities raised by the work of nanomaterials can be 
easily understood.",Nanotechnology,4

technology, allowing that researches lead to the transformation of biological 
systems, to the extent that biology provides models and bio-assembled

a framework for ethical analysis in nanotechnology is presented and this 
work finish with a concluding remarks section.",Nanotechnology,4
"in the end a short 
bibliography on these subjects is presented.",Nanotechnology,4
"ethics and nanotecnology  
 
computers have brought an increase in the ability to type and made 
handwriting more and more superfluous, even obsolete.",Nanotechnology,4
"mobiles and their 
miniaturization brought the ability to generally communicate from anywhere 
with anybody, making more and more useless the traditional phones.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanotechnology, because of the negligible dimension of devices this 
technology proportionate, will spread the use of devices that now are 
nuisance.",Nanotechnology,4
"for instance, the pacemaker that presently is used like a “last 
resource”, certainly soon will be used in a much larger scale because it is 
hopeful that will be possible to design it at a nanoscale level.",Nanotechnology,4
"however ethical questions quickly rise with the development of 
nanotechnology: 
 
 what are the borders for this kind of progress?",Nanotechnology,4
 until where it is admissible and wise to go?,Nanotechnology,4
" what are the implications in a later phase of development – 
obviously unknown - of these technologies?",Nanotechnology,4

"then considering that neurotechnology – a rapidly  
 
manuel alberto m. ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
growing field in the intersection between nano and biotechnology – can 
affect moral capacities of the brain, she suggests that ethics itself may be 
affected by nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"and she leaves as open the question of a co-
construction of ethics and bionanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"in short: new approaches 
must be considered, but which ones?",Nanotechnology,4
"in freitas () it is affirmed that the society should be “able to muster 
the collective financial and moral courage to allow such extraordinarily 
powerful medicine to be deployed for human betterment, with due regard to 
essential ethical considerations”.",Nanotechnology,4

very environmental friendly as well as already seen.",Nanotechnology,4

forthcoming generations and for the environment.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, there are risks, 
as well.",Nanotechnology,4
but in truth there are incredible potential advantages.,Nanotechnology,4
"and the 
discussion is all over the place.",Nanotechnology,4
"that borders must be considered is, of 
course, evident and there has to be an achieved balance between the path 
found to the new dimension of knowledge and the contours specific for the 
problem.",Nanotechnology,4
"the rub of the question is exactly in what measure criticisms may 
have into account the technology potential.",Nanotechnology,4
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
ethical human dignity 
 
despite the high feasibility for the economy and the environment, there 
are some considerations regarding the ethical, human dignity and moral 
borders on nanotechnology that should be taken into account.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is interesting to have a look to the definition of human dignity and its 
connection to moral conveyed in the “opinion of the european group on 
ethics in science and new technologies to the european commission”, , 
when discussing the ethical aspects of information and communication 
technologies (ict) implants in the human body.",Nanotechnology,4
"the group makes allusion 
to the eu’s draft treaty that establishes a constitution for europe, stating 
that “human dignity is inviolable.",Nanotechnology,4
"it must be respected and protected” 
(article ii-), and goes on to explain that “the dignity of the human person 
is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis of 
fundamental rights” (declaration concerning the explanations relating to the 
charter of fundamental rights).",Nanotechnology,4
"this group declares yet that this 
explanation does not strictly define human dignity and that many writers 
have attempted to fill this gap.",Nanotechnology,4
"one such attempt suggests that human dignity 
is defined as follows: “the exalted moral status which every being of human 
origin uniquely possesses.",Nanotechnology,4
"human dignity is a given reality, intrinsic to 
human substance, and not contingent upon any functional capacities which 
vary in degree.",Nanotechnology,4
"(…) the possession of human dignity carries certain 
immutable moral obligations.",Nanotechnology,4
"desires, challenges but also concerns are always present… 
what are the consequences?",Nanotechnology,4
are humans creating a new being?,Nanotechnology,4
"are humans prepared to get 
different, biologically and to become another thing?",Nanotechnology,4
"are humans creating 
further “nano-digital devices” between humans that have access to these 
advanced technologies and humans that have not access?",Nanotechnology,4
"this discussion is 
recognized but probably the ethical discussion has not been enough 
promoted.",Nanotechnology,4
"and possibly no one is enough prepared to participate effectively 
and wisely on it.",Nanotechnology,4
"much reflection, study and information is still needed.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanotecnology and environment 
 
in the long term, which are the consequences that nanotechnology has 
in the environment?",Nanotechnology,4
"is it possible to predict that less damage in nature can 
be done if nanomaterials are considered instead of large equipment are used?",Nanotechnology,4
"besides, once the need of inputs to produce these devices is lesser, probably 
there is an additional advantage on this perspective for nature preservation.",Nanotechnology,4
but what is the reverse of the medal?,Nanotechnology,4
"let’s have a look on the following situation: 
 
 there is a growing consensus today that it is considered priority 
should be given to the development of alternative energies over the 
classical energies.",Nanotechnology,4
"it turns out that the classic energies price of 
production is cheaper than that of the alternative energies.",Nanotechnology,4
"in this case, this difference in costs can be compared with 
the environmental damage caused by the construction of dams.",Nanotechnology,4
"and 
even with the damage due to the pollution produced by the operation 
of the fuel oil plants.",Nanotechnology,4
"there is here an ethical problem in which one 
balances between paying a little more and preserving the 
environment or paying less and destroying it, in which the interests 
installed with the classical energies will hardly abdicate their 
positions without struggle, see (ferreira et al., ).",Nanotechnology,4
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
really, the implications and directions of nanotechnology need 
further discussion.",Nanotechnology,4
"the consequences of avoiding the discussion 
may be severe for society, considering rejection or fear of the 
effects.",Nanotechnology,4
"so it is pertinent to ask:  
 is there a need for a regulatory authority?",Nanotechnology,4
" which kind of mechanisms are needed to regulate the 
nanotechnologies developments area?",Nanotechnology,4
"ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace 
 
a theme urgently needing study and reflection concerns the potentially 
harmful effects on workers’ health due to their exposure to nanoparticles in 
companies dealing with nanotechnology.",Nanotechnology,4
"indeed, very little, to say nothing, 
is known about these harmful effects.",Nanotechnology,4
"in similar situations the harmful effects on workers’ health were only 
identified after long periods of activity, with the occurrence of real disasters 
in sanitary terms.",Nanotechnology,4
"one has to learn from history and try to avoid situations 
such as, for example, atomic energy in which, only relatively late, the 
harmful effects of radiation have been noticed.",Nanotechnology,4
"and only then were the 
necessary preventions taken, after the damage to health occurred in the 
workers of the plants and in the neighboring populations.",Nanotechnology,4
"and today 
humanity, in general, is not very confident on those preventions.",Nanotechnology,4
"however, 
atomic energy was initially used for war purposes which helps explain, but 
by no means excuse, this late reaction.",Nanotechnology,4
"the same is not true for  
nanotechnology, so it is natural that the attitude towards the problem is 
different.",Nanotechnology,4
"thus, in the absence of scientific knowledge on the potentially negative 
health effects of workplace exposure to nanoparticles, it is necessary to 
establish guidelines for decision making regarding risks and controls.",Nanotechnology,4
"identifying the ethical issues involved certainly helps with proper 
decision-making.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is therefore imperative for the decision-makers, 
particularly the employers, the workers, the investors, and the health 
authorities, to be aware of these issues.",Nanotechnology,4
"ethical issues involve the independent and impartial determination of 
risks, implacability, autonomy, justice, preservation of privacy, and 
promotion of respect for people.",Nanotechnology,4
"their identification and implementation 
will make the options for decision-makers more evident.",Nanotechnology,4
"and company-wide 
discussions on the workplace hazards of nanotechnology can be reinforced 
by a special emphasis on small businesses and the adoption of a global 
perspective.",Nanotechnology,4
"ethical questions about nanotechnology in the workplace arise from the 
state of knowledge about the dangers of nanomaterials and the hazards and 
risks they may pose to workers’ health.",Nanotechnology,4
"as this knowledge is still incipient, 
it is imperative to carry out a provisional assessment of the hazards and risks.",Nanotechnology,4
"workers can exercise their autonomy only if the processes leading to hazard 
identification and risk assessment are transparent, comprehensible, and 
credible.",Nanotechnology,4
"framework for ethical analysis  
in nanotechnology 
 
a methodology for conducting an organized and coherent discussion 
about ethics in this subject is to subdivide it by the following topics of 
analysis (see mnyusiwalla et al., ): equity, privacy, security, 
environment, and metaphysical when discussing the relationship in the 
human-machine binary.",Nanotechnology,4
"about each one of them some considerations may 
be made.",Nanotechnology,4
"so, assuming these topics, and trying to go as far as possible in the 
analysis: 
 
 
equity 
 
the classical dichotomy of developed and developing countries raises a 
new topic for discussion.",Nanotechnology,4
"indeed, technology and development are closely 
correlated.",Nanotechnology,4
"examples of great worries for developing countries are: 
 
 people poverty reduction,  
 energy problem,  
 water problem, 
 health problem, 
 biodiversity maintenance.",Nanotechnology,4
"nanotechnology would help these countries to better conditions of 
population health and way of life.",Nanotechnology,4
"but it is costly to implement any project 
in this area and more often there are no financial resources available.",Nanotechnology,4
"developing countries will be lesser benefited with these advances than 
manuel alberto m. ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
developed countries.",Nanotechnology,4
"the main problem happens with the access to the 
benefits of technology considering the poorest and the richest people inside 
any country.",Nanotechnology,4
"who may effectively reach the advances of science and take 
benefit from them?",Nanotechnology,4
"anyway, it is true that poor people, whatever they are, 
may benefit, in some measure, from these advances.",Nanotechnology,4
"it may depend on the 
will of politicians and on the investments capacity (one way of overcoming 
countries’ lack of investment capacity is their indebtedness which, as many 
current cases show, is nevertheless a generator of future and sometimes very 
serious financial problems)of some of these countries, for example.",Nanotechnology,4
"a result 
would be lower needs for energy and a cleaner energy production as well as 
other environmental benefits: a safer drug delivery, the improvement on 
health through for example better prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",Nanotechnology,4
"privacy 
 
at this level, it is to consider the enormous innovations which can be 
reached, by improving surveillance devices or other devices that restrict 
human privacy.",Nanotechnology,4
"an individual may be facing situations of “invisible” 
microphones and cameras.",Nanotechnology,4
"this is a real problem if privacy is intended to be 
assured.",Nanotechnology,4
"wireless monitoring provides healthcare providers and patients to 
be mobile and being able to exchange data when needed.",Nanotechnology,4
"but there is the 
reverse of the medal: privacy violation?",Nanotechnology,4
"it is true that wireless 
communication and new physiological sensors bring enormous implications 
in e-health.",Nanotechnology,4
"one point needed is about the necessary discussion on privacy 
and security.",Nanotechnology,4
"security 
 
surely new powerful weapons will be available very soon, as far as 
“invisible” microphones and cameras will be available.",Nanotechnology,4
"will this ensure new 
ways of security or will be added to a potential “arsenal of bio-terrorism and 
techno-terrorism or even nano-terrorism?” (see mnyusiwalla et al., ).",Nanotechnology,4
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
mnyusiwalla et al.,  also ask “who will regulate the direction of 
research in defensive and offensive military nt [nanotechnology]?",Nanotechnology,4
"how 
much transparency will be necessary in government and private nt 
initiatives to avoid misuses?",Nanotechnology,4
"there are also very interesting legal questions 
involving monitoring, ownership, and control of invisible objects”.",Nanotechnology,4
"environment 
 
this topic was already approached above in the section 
“nanotechnology and environment” due to extreme importance of the 
subject there considered: the production of electrical energy through 
nanophotovoltaic panels versus the production through classical means.",Nanotechnology,4
obviously this does not exhaust the subject.,Nanotechnology,4
"so, going on, new materials 
(fullerenes, carbon nanotubes) are now available.",Nanotechnology,4
"no one knows what will 
be the precise effects when this kind of nanomaterials goes into the 
environment (and also the effects on health).",Nanotechnology,4
"where 
are they put in the end of their mechanical lives?",Nanotechnology,4
"will some medical devices 
be kept inside human body?",Nanotechnology,4
"or will be given 
another destiny to them?",Nanotechnology,4
"is it possible to predict any kind of effects caused 
to the environment?",Nanotechnology,4
"jacobstein () refers that it is important to make an 
analysis on the risks associated to passive compounds in the less than  
nanometer size range.",Nanotechnology,4
"there is the possibility, for example, of being 
introduced inadvertently in human bodies.",Nanotechnology,4
"there is in fact the concern with 
their ability to be inhaled,  
 
 
absorbed through the skin, or to pass through biological compartment 
barriers such as the blood brain barrier.",Nanotechnology,4
"this kind of dangers pose a real 
range of potential health and environmental risks that are associated to their 
potential toxicity or mutagenicity in their interactions with biological 
systems (note the analogy of this situation with the considered above in 
“ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace”).",Nanotechnology,4
"while the range of effects 
vary, most of the risks may be addressed by advanced industrial hygiene and 
manuel alberto m. ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
environmental health practices and techniques that seek to characterize the 
specific risks, exposure patterns, and control methods and enforce them 
through a combination of practitioner education, industry self-regulation, 
monitoring and government regulation.",Nanotechnology,4
"this is an important emerging field 
in the environmental and health sciences, since most of the existing 
legislation on environmental, safety, and health risks may cover particulates, 
but do not take the change in physical and biological properties at the 
nanoscale into account.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is reasonable to assume that passive nanoscale 
particle risks, although potentially serious if not addressed, will be 
characterized and addressed systematically under new versions or 
extensions to existing occupational, industrial hygiene, environmental, and 
medical regulations.",Nanotechnology,4
"metaphysical 
 
the incorporation of implants in human body, this is, the incorporation 
of artificial materials or machines into human systems may conduct to a 
concern around the human values and principles; will a human being be 
more than a human being?",Nanotechnology,4
"what kind of being 
and what kind of consequences.",Nanotechnology,4
"how this process may be controlled and 
accessed?",Nanotechnology,4
"one of the main issues is the “autonomy” of nano-bots, that is: 
robots whose components are at or near the scale of a nanometre 
(−meters), if they are able or not to move and to take decisions 
autonomously.",Nanotechnology,4
"are they able to communicate each other and with the 
external environment?",Nanotechnology,4
"how can human beings ensure to “retire” them at the 
end of their “missions”?",Nanotechnology,4
this is a very demanding question.,Nanotechnology,4
"the 
modification made on human bodies and living systems may create new 
realities.",Nanotechnology,4
"this is already a very real concern on the society, being in general 
the society often very skeptic about developments in this area.",Nanotechnology,4
"catherine 
larrère, see citation in bensaude-vincent (), discusses “the recent 
trends in nanoethics which anchor ethics in metaphysics or theology by 
emphasizing the emergence of new relations of men to nature and to god.",Nanotechnology,4
"it 
is defended that the moral issue raised by the project of enhancing human 
ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
performances does not really lie in going beyond the boundary of human 
knowledge and condition.",Nanotechnology,4
"it is more a question of the moral choice 
underlying this new form of hubris”.",Nanotechnology,4
"now in another although similar recording, nano-bots, or in general the 
“convergence” of bio-nano-info-neuro technologies, requires a new contract 
between science and society; society should not be seen as an afterthought 
only for making technology assessments, for social acceptability, etc.",Nanotechnology,4
"rodotà & capurro () show the limitations on ict implants in the 
human body as deriving from an analysis of the principles contained in 
various legal instruments.",Nanotechnology,4
"they say that they should be assessed further by 
having regard to general principles and rules concerning the autonomy of 
individuals, which takes the shape of freedom to choose how to use one’s 
body, “i am the ruler of my own body”, freedom of choice as regards one’s 
health, freedom from external controls and influence.",Nanotechnology,4
"manuel alberto m. ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
conclusion 
 
ethical, legal and social implications in this context show the 
importance of nanotechnology to the society and the consequences that the 
development of nanotechnology possibly will bring to mankind in the future.",Nanotechnology,4
"the irreversibility and long-term impact of these new developments enforce 
to have in mind that it is necessary to take into account also the rights of 
future generations and the planet (like hans jonas’ “principle of 
responsibility”).",Nanotechnology,4

the innovations are going fast and sprout from everywhere.,Nanotechnology,4
"and 
although the endemic crisis, mainly economic but also social and politic, 
will bring some restrictions to the investments in health and research areas 
in many countries, new developments in this area will prevail and many 
discoveries will be made.",Nanotechnology,4

lubricated: innovations are growing and development is there, as much as 
the will to go faster and further in many domains of scientific investigation.",Nanotechnology,4

forthcoming occasion, to analyze some data in order to detect and study the 
impact of the actual crisis on nanotechnology and mainly on applications to 
medicine and industry.",Nanotechnology,4

strong will to face the challenges and a new beginning is there.",Nanotechnology,4

considering nanotechnology in general and applied to medicine (where these 
concerns assume usuallya more dramatical aspect) also need a new research 
to be developed next.",Nanotechnology,4

regarding the application of nanotechnology may be also enlarged in order 
to have a study of the impact into telemedicine and e-health.",Nanotechnology,4

"hybrid computing systems
we broadly define hybrid computing systems as a class of
abstract machine models that combine different computational
paradigms.",Quantum computing,5
"however, we specialize our analysis to the case of
realizable architectures that integrate a conventional classical
turing machine with a quantum turing machine.",Quantum computing,5
"research into
these different machine models has clarified that they are not
equivalent with respect to computational power [], and we
address some of the unique considerations that arise by using
the conventional model to program and control the quantum
model.",Quantum computing,5
"fig. . a hybrid computing infrastructure that integrates classical systems of
boolean logic into the control of quantum dynamics requires an interface for
input-output (io) based on the transmission and reception of physical fields
finput(t) and foutput(t).",Quantum computing,5
", the two-way interaction between a
classical and a quantum machine model imposes a constraint
that requires the machines to share a common understanding
of language.",Quantum computing,5
"in practice, this language is expressed as the
physical fields that define the operations issued by the conven-
tional model and implemented within the quantum domain [].",Quantum computing,5
"electric, magnetic, and optical fields are prominent examples
by which the current technology controls the quantum physical
systems.",Quantum computing,5
"it is notable that this description is inherently ana-
log due to the continuity of the time-dependent schrodinger
equation.",Quantum computing,5
"translation between the system of boolean logic
characterizing the conventional turing machine into the analog
fields is necessarily limited by the available computational
power.",Quantum computing,5
"in practice, this amounts to constraints imposed by
the available digital-to-analog converters and the range of the
arbitrary waveform generators as well as the speed at which
the logical network can be processed and the connectivity of
the control system.",Quantum computing,5
"the outstanding concern for programming such a hybrid
computing system is the controllability of the conventional and
quantum machines [], [].",Quantum computing,5
"that is to say, for those scenarios
in which the quantum machine must execute a series of issued
instructions, how accurately are these instructions realized and
how precisely does the result reflects the effect of the intended
instructions?",Quantum computing,5
"a. client-server model for hybrid computing systems
current state-of-the-art hybrid computing systems integrate
existing cpu-based clients with qpu-based servers [], [].",Quantum computing,5
"the latter represent the online availability of a programmable
infrastructure to access the field generators that drive the
control of a quantum physical device.",Quantum computing,5
"the applied fields
are shaped and scheduled to control the dynamics of an
addressable array of quantum physical subsystems, which for
convenience we denote generically as the quantum register.",Quantum computing,5
"similarly, the response fields emitted by the register elements
are collected and discriminated to generate binary representa-
tions that characterize the state of the register.",Quantum computing,5
"a qpu-based server often includes conventional cpus for
purposes of parsing the digital programming instructions that
generate the shape and timing of the control fields as well
as the detection and discrimination of the response fields.",Quantum computing,5
"access to the qpu-based server requires an interface that may
adhere to conventional logic, for example, as found in modern
networking communication technology, to accept instructions
from and return results to a cpu-based client.",Quantum computing,5
"currently, the
conventional client-server model shown in fig.",Quantum computing,5
"dominates
the access method to qpu systems due in large part to the
experimental nature of these machines.",Quantum computing,5
"within the client-server model for hybrid computing sys-
tems, the qpu represents a layer of language parsers that
translate the boolean logic of the client to the control fields
required to drive the quantum register.",Quantum computing,5
"as detailed elsewhere
[], the qpu is partitioned into a control unit, execution
units, and the register itself.",Quantum computing,5
"the control unit parses the client
instructions received by the server into the local instruction
set architecture for generating and applying control fields.",Quantum computing,5
"application of the fields are carried out by the execution units,
which in practice represent waveform generators for electric,
magnetic and optical fields.",Quantum computing,5
"a similar signal flow occurs for
detecting output fields and generating a digital response.",Quantum computing,5
"fig. . currently, most hybrid computing systems rely on a cpu-based client
interacting with a qpu-based server over a network.",Quantum computing,5
"the qpu-based server
presents a classical control interface to the client that can be customized to a
variety of programming styles.",Quantum computing,5
"internally, the qpu-based server must parse
these instructions into a local representation that carries out the requested
sequence of control fields.",Quantum computing,5
"b. programming and execution model
the client-side api for the hybrid computing system dic-
tates how users access the quantum physical devices, while
the functionality of the qpu-based server is restricted to the
local interpretation of these transmitted instructions.",Quantum computing,5
"in this
programming model, a client may select which instructions
to send from a predefined instruction set for the qpu.",Quantum computing,5
"the
international conference on rebooting computing, may  
instruction set architecture (isa) defines the functionality of
the qpu and the language for the control unit [].",Quantum computing,5
"these in-
structions are generally transmitted as character strings that are
mapped by the qpu-based server into pre-compiled functions
that execute the instruction.",Quantum computing,5
"calls to these libraries initiate
the cascade of logic required to trigger the execution units,
which subsequently apply the necessary fields to the register
elements.",Quantum computing,5
"fig. . components in a qpu-based server include a control unit that
expresses the instruction set architecture (isa), multiple execution units that
translate instructions into applied fields, and the quantum register which stores
the computational state.",Quantum computing,5
"this layered, hierarchical structure provides a natural
separation of concerns but introduces challenges to programming near-term,
noisy qpus.",Quantum computing,5
", the two-way information flow within the
qpu-based server provides a natural separation of concerns
for device programming.",Quantum computing,5
"the logic dictating computational
functionality is isolated within the control unit and determined
by programs expressed within the isa.",Quantum computing,5
"similarly, the execution
unit hosts the translation of individual instructions into the
fields that carry out the intended logical transformations on
the register.",Quantum computing,5
"the information unique to the implementation of
either layer is notionally not required in the opposing layer.",Quantum computing,5
"however, as we explore in the subsequent section, this design
of the current qpu-based servers leads to several challenges
for application programming.",Quantum computing,5
"programming challenges for noisy qpus
despite the natural separation of concerns that arises in
a hybrid computing system using a qpu-based server, this
design presents a number of challenges when programming
currently available noisy quantum processors.",Quantum computing,5
"advances in
our understanding and engineering of qpus have enabled
demonstrations with register capacities up to  addressable
elements, yet these realizations still demonstrate a non-trivial
amount of noise relative to the underlying decoherence rates,
greatly limiting the depth of quantum circuits with even
modest reliability.",Quantum computing,5
"this raises a need for repeated sampling of
the circuit execution, but existing client-server access models
hamper this interaction and greatly limit the overall utility and
accessibility of the qpus.",Quantum computing,5
"code portability is also a growing concern as many qpu
vendors trend toward standalone programming frameworks
that interact with their tightly controlled and proprietary isa.",Quantum computing,5
"these barriers to portability impede efforts to perform veri-
fication of software and benchmarking of hardware as well
as methods to validate hardware behavior using numerical
simulation.",Quantum computing,5
"finally, the individual workflow steps required to
program, compile, and execute hybrid applications with near-
term qpus are tightly coupled.",Quantum computing,5
"the lack of inter-operability
across available software and hardware platforms raises a
concern that the users programming hybrid computing systems
will face artificial barriers to adoption and performance.",Quantum computing,5
"we provide a more detailed description of each of these
challenges with an analysis for how hybrid computation is
affected.",Quantum computing,5
"because moore’s law is merely an observation, and not a physical law, this

reached, stagnation in the computer industry is inevitable.",Quantum computing,5
"the rapid advancement of the past few 
decades will continue to slow as creating faster and more efficient technologies using current 
methods climbs in difficulty.",Quantum computing,5
"with these problems becoming more prominent every year, the 
computer industry faces a unique challenge that it has not faced since the inception of transistors.",Quantum computing,5
"effectively, the industry is back at square one, and must create an entirely new approach or fester 
in an era without innovation.",Quantum computing,5
"taking these major issues into account, it is reasonable to state 
quantum computing will be a viable alternative to the classical computers of today.",Quantum computing,5
"research design 
research was conducted using a variety of science and technology databases to find relevant 
sources that pertained to the computer field.",Quantum computing,5
"specifically, i considered peer reviewed journal 
articles, as they provided the most reliable and up to date information.",Quantum computing,5
"additionally, these peer 
reviewed journal articles were from  or later since this technology is a relatively new topic.",Quantum computing,5
"the databases that i used to find these articles included ieee xplore, scopus, acm digital 
library, and google scholar.",Quantum computing,5

and provided relevant results that strengthened my research paper.",Quantum computing,5
"i searched these databases 
using terms such as quantum computing, applications of quantum computing, moore’s law, and 
classical vs. quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5

the physics of quantum mechanics were ignored.",Quantum computing,5

astonishing.",Quantum computing,5

this innovative era is near.",Quantum computing,5

known as moore’s law.",Quantum computing,5

factors that constrict development.",Quantum computing,5

of moore’s law that illustrates the limits of physics and what is possible using current methods.",Quantum computing,5
"they go on to say that to deliver better performance and grow in a variety of new markets, a new 
approach must be developed.",Quantum computing,5
"while these startling facts suggest a bleak future for computers and 
electronics, the moore’s law hurdle can be conquered with new emerging technologies.",Quantum computing,5
"this 
only further strengthens the argument for pursuing quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"cumming and his team’s assertion on moore’s law is shared by robison, another 
prominent researcher in the field.",Quantum computing,5
"robison indicates that “although the marginal cost of 
producing a single silicon chip has remained stable or decreased over time as the number of 
components per chip has exponentially increased, the cost of research and development and of 
manufacturing infrastructure has increased exponentially, in what has been dubbed moore’s 
second law” (robison , ).",Quantum computing,5
"robison’s research demonstrates that physical limits are not 
the only thing holding innovation back.",Quantum computing,5
"economic limits are just as important, and rising costs 
for development of technologies will also slow innovation.",Quantum computing,5
"robison () further indicates that 
to progress past the age of silicon, new emerging technologies such as quantum or molecular 

king: viability of quantum computing
published by scholars' mine, 
computers must arrive.",Quantum computing,5
"with the rising cost of development for microelectronics, it is easy to see 
that further progress will be limited.",Quantum computing,5
"all research seems to indicate that quantum computing 
could be the breakthrough needed to overcome moore’s law.",Quantum computing,5
"while there are other technologies, 
such as molecular computing, quantum computing is the most attractive option as there has 
already been concrete research and prototypes developed.",Quantum computing,5
"quantum computing versus classical computing 
as the era of classical computing begins to slow, viable alternatives must be examined to 
compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two.",Quantum computing,5
"one of the main advantages quantum 
computing has is its exponential increase in processing power.",Quantum computing,5
"biswas indicates in his research 
that “the proposed quantum computer can exponentially speed-up the processing capabilities of 
the processors over that of the classical computing capabilities of the existing processors” 
(biswas , ).",Quantum computing,5
"the significantly improved processing power of quantum computers 
allows it to process data at a much faster rate than even supercomputers currently available.",Quantum computing,5
"using this processing power to solve some of the best-known algorithms gives quantum 
computing a massive advantage over classical computers.",Quantum computing,5
"svore and troyer () note that quantum computers can solve a range of problems 
exponentially faster than even the most famous classic algorithms.",Quantum computing,5
"this is because quantum 
computers can use quantum algorithms, which use superposition and are superior to classical 
methods in terms of speed and efficiency.",Quantum computing,5
"these significantly faster quantum algorithms can 
solve many issues including database searching, finding periodic functions, solving linear 
systems, sampling from a distribution, and probability distribution (svore and troyer ).",Quantum computing,5
"with improved processing power and algorithms, these proposed quantum computers can run 
simulations and calculations much faster.",Quantum computing,5
"use of calculations and simulations are vital to 

missouri s&t’s peer to peer, vol.",Quantum computing,5
"engineering and science fields, and quantum computing could fundamentally change how 
scientists analyze and manipulate data.",Quantum computing,5
"biswas and svore and troyer all highlight the advantages of quantum computing over 
classical; however, other prominent researchers in the field, such as moller and vuik, doubt that 
it could be a viable option.",Quantum computing,5
"moller and vuik’s research illustrates that “a common challenge of 
most of today’s quantum devices is the need for extremely low operating temperatures near 
absolute zero, which suggests quantum computing as a cloud service as most promising business 
model to bring this technology to the end-users” (moller and vuik , ).",Quantum computing,5
"the current need for 
extreme cooling solutions presents a unique challenge for the development of quantum 
computers that its classical counterpart has already solved.",Quantum computing,5
"moller and vuik () go on to say that the immense costs of development may 
discourage researchers from pursuing development if the costs outweigh the benefits.",Quantum computing,5
"the high 
cost and unconventional cooling requirements may give classical computers an advantage here, 
but quantum computers are very much still early in their development and have room for 
improvement.",Quantum computing,5
"perhaps quantum computers will not be available for consumer use at first, but 
they could realistically be used in large data centers and still have immense benefits.",Quantum computing,5
"as with any 
new emerging technology, the initial cost of development is high.",Quantum computing,5

development and research will drive the cost of production down as quantum computing

published by scholars' mine, 
lots of different uses for quantum computers ranging from medicine to artificial intelligence, 
researchers are mostly interested in its ability to decrypt data and simulate models.",Quantum computing,5

quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers, which is one among several quantum algorithms

"because quantum computers can potentially decrypt much better than 
classical computers, governments and military agencies are pushing for development to use this 
power to hack into sensitive enemy information and learn more about securing important data.",Quantum computing,5

know it.​ ​in order to understand quantum computing, one must understand how a classical 
 
 
computer operates.",Quantum computing,5
"a classical computer is binary, such that every operation is done with a bit 
which can have a value of either  or .",Quantum computing,5
"a classical computer implements operations on these bits 
using gates.",Quantum computing,5
"all operations in a classical computer are comprised of a combination of these gates 
[]​.",Quantum computing,5
a quantum computer works differently than a classical computer.,Quantum computing,5
"instead of using classic 
bits, a quantum computer uses qubits.",Quantum computing,5
"the state of a qubit is more complex in that, a qubit can 
have more than two states, and is often represented as a bloch sphere as in figure .",Quantum computing,5
"figure : a bloch sphere representing a qubit [] 
given its property to hold multiple states, a qubit can store much more information than a 
classical bit.",Quantum computing,5
"however, extracting meaningful information from a qubit is perhaps one of the 
biggest challenges in quantum computation.",Quantum computing,5
"there are two key properties that make quantum computing different from classical 
computing: superposition and entanglement.",Quantum computing,5
superposition is a linear combination of states [].,Quantum computing,5
"this means that if a qubit is in superposition, there is an equal chance of these states being 
measured as  as there is of being measured as .",Quantum computing,5
"this can be described effectively with a visual 
quantum circuit, as described in figure .",Quantum computing,5
"figure : quantum circuit with one  qubit in superposition and one hadamard gate 
 
in figure , a quantum score is created using a single qubit.",Quantum computing,5
"this qubit is then put into 
superposition using a hadamard gate, and measured  times, as quantum scores often are [].",Quantum computing,5
"the output is in figure  and shows that there is a nearly  percent chance of the qubit being in 
either state  or state .",Quantum computing,5
"this result showcases one of the most powerful properties of quantum 
computing.",Quantum computing,5
"figure  quantum score for one qubit in superposition after  measurements 
 
the other key property of quantum computing is entanglement.",Quantum computing,5
"qubits have the ability to 
become entangled, and this is where much of their computing power comes from.",Quantum computing,5
"in its most 
simplistic and abstracted form, entanglement means that while each part of a system is acting 
randomly, the actions of the entire system are predictable.",Quantum computing,5
"the behavior of one qubit can be 
predicted based on the behavior of another qubit.",Quantum computing,5
"however this property doesn’t exist until the 
 
 
qubits are measured [].",Quantum computing,5
"each part of a system may act randomly, but when measured, the two 
parts are strongly correlated.",Quantum computing,5
"this is explained visually in figure , which shows the quantum 
score of a  system of two qubits put in superposition and then entangled.",Quantum computing,5
"figure : quantum circuit with two qubits in superposition and entangled 
 
if just one qubit is measured, the output is random, similar to the output of the circuit 
shown in figure  where half the time the result is zero, and half the time the result is one, as 
shown in figure .",Quantum computing,5
"figure : output for quantum entanglement measuring one qubit 
 
 
however if both qubits are measured at the same time, the qubits show a strong 
correlation as shown in figure .",Quantum computing,5
"this result indicates that while still independently random, both 
qubits are either  or , which is due to the qubits being entangled.",Quantum computing,5
"this property is unique to 
quantum, and there is no understandable reason for two things that seem totally unrelated to act 
this way.",Quantum computing,5
"figure : output for quantum entanglement measuring two qubits  
 
in quantum computing, gates are used to manipulate bits, just as in classic computing.",Quantum computing,5
"these quantum gates are powerful as they do operations on qubits in superpositioned states, 
while using significantly fewer bits than a traditional computer would.",Quantum computing,5
"these quantum gates are 
the result of matrices multiplied together.",Quantum computing,5
"a base matrix represents the original state of the qubit, 
and the gates are set matrices that can be multiplied by the original matrix in order to get a 
particular output.",Quantum computing,5
these quantum gates are strung together into a quantum circuit.,Quantum computing,5
"all of the 
operations are calculated and then the state is measured, smashing this information down into a 
single one-dimensional state; the output is a quantum score [].",Quantum computing,5
"because of this property, 
quantum systems can only be measured once, at the end of a program.",Quantum computing,5
"additionally, this 
 
 
measurement will likely be different each time it is taken due to noise in the quantum system.",Quantum computing,5
"to 
overcome this limitation, quantum scores are usually measured multiple times, and graphed on a 
bar plot to indicate the probability of each output [].",Quantum computing,5
"quantum computing takes advantage of the current understanding that very small 
particles exist as both a wave and a particle.",Quantum computing,5
"this means that very small amounts of matter must 
be measured and understood in order to represent qubits.",Quantum computing,5

to create a qubit, for example the polarization of a photon, or the spin of an electron ​[]​.",Quantum computing,5

zero, or approximately −.",Quantum computing,5

outperform our current supercomputers.",Quantum computing,5
"ibm also has a  - qubit quantum computer available 
 
 
for public use.",Quantum computing,5
"this means that quantum technology is accessible to the general public through 
the cloud, thus creating opportunities for more research and learning [].",Quantum computing,5
"another important potential advancement for quantum computing is in the time 
complexity of certain algorithms.",Quantum computing,5

instruction manual for a computer to solve a problem.",Quantum computing,5
"algorithms are categorized based on their 
“time complexity,” or  the rate at which they speed up with respect to the size of the input.",Quantum computing,5

quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5

"this speed up 
indicates  that certain types of encryption can now be broken with quantum computation, and 
because of this capability, we will have to look into alternative ways to encrypt data in the future

"another algorithm that takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum computers is 
grover’s algorithm​.",Quantum computing,5
"in its most simple form, grover’s algorithm manipulates the amplitudes of 
numbers in a quantum register in order to find a number in a list of numbers.",Quantum computing,5

"this speed up is very√n  
significant, and has potential to change database searching drastically.",Quantum computing,5

real neuron is then determined by the internal integrated
cell potential, or mathematically by the signal function
and the internal firing threshold.",Quantum computing,5
"for real neurons, as
action potentials and cell potentials change much faster
than changes in synaptic efficacies, neuron activations
are a fast process, while the changes of synaptic efficacies
are a slow one.",Quantum computing,5
"in classical neural networks, the change
of synaptic efficacies is implemented by a “learning
algorithm” [, ] during a learning process in response
to stable patterns of activity.",Quantum computing,5
"however, in the context of our current quantum neuron
model, the above remarks should be looked from a
different angle.",Quantum computing,5
"here a learning process is realized by
a “quantum learning algorithm” (see, e.g., ref.",Quantum computing,5
"[] for
a review), i.e., a specific temporal pattern of quantum
operations wij(t) depending on the states of input
neurons.",Quantum computing,5
"by using various quantum learning algorithms,
the quantum neuron model opens a door to quantum
manipulations of real neurons, artificial intelligence, and
ultimately, the human brain.",Quantum computing,5
"by sharp contrast, the
existing quantum neural networks [] model neurons
as qubits in pure states and connection weights as
usual quantum logic gates.",Quantum computing,5
"however, the human brain
is a highly open and decohering system.",Quantum computing,5
"it is very
unlikely to model the human brain as a well isolated
quantum system.",Quantum computing,5
"in our model, the human brain is
neither a classical computer (soft or hard) nor a standard
quantum computer, but something in between, namely,
a soft quantum computer.",Quantum computing,5
"by modeling neuron nodes
as qubits in mixed states and their connections as
connection superoperators, we are left to see to what
extend our model could simulate and understand the real
functioning of the human brain.",Quantum computing,5
we used the superprojectors p|s〉 in eq.,Quantum computing,5
"() to
select the computational basis as the input to the jth
neuron.",Quantum computing,5
"in doing so, we have actually implicitly assumed
certain environment-induced decoherence [] naturally
occurring in the cell body to choose the preferred basis,
namely, the computational basis.",Quantum computing,5
"to be consistent for our
quantum neuron model, we have to determine the output
sj of the jth neuron in the same way.",Quantum computing,5
"the final state of
the jth neuron can be obtained by tracing out all the
input states, namely, ρoutj = tr{i}ρ

the probability of |〉i within ρini .",Quantum computing,5
"the output state is
then
ρj = (p|〉j + p|〉j )ρoutj .",Quantum computing,5
"()
in other words, the output signal sj of the jth neuron is
sj =
{
 with probability pj()
 with probability − pj() ()
this completes the specification of our quantum neural
network model as a soft quantum computer.",Quantum computing,5
"in-
terestingly, the above prescriptions on the input and
output states in the preferred computational basis tacitly
assumed each neuron in our model as a quantum self-
measuring meter.",Quantum computing,5
"this eliminates the ambiguity of
designating signal functions of various forms in classical
neural networks [].",Quantum computing,5
"physically, one could regard each input dendrite as
a quantum channel [], which carries out a quantum
manipulation wij if and only if si = .",Quantum computing,5

case.",Quantum computing,5
"for the two neurons in the initial states ρin =

"is

can be quantified by the
quantum discord [].",Quantum computing,5
"any bipartite state is called fully
classically correlated if it is of the form []
ρ =

i,j
pij |i〉 〈i| ⊗ |j〉 〈j| ; ()
otherwise, it is quantum correlated.",Quantum computing,5
"here |i〉

and
|j〉

are the orthonormal bases of the two parties, with
nonnegative probabilities pij .",Quantum computing,5
"obviously, for the two-neuron state ρout

in eq.",Quantum computing,5
"()
the first neuron becomes correlated with nonorthogonal
states of the second neuron as far as w(ρin ) and ρin
are nonorthogonal [–], namely, ρout has quantum
correlations.",Quantum computing,5
"[, ] show the
creation of discord, from classically correlated two-
qubit states, by applying an amplitude-damping process
only on one of the qubits; for the phase-damping
process, see ref.",Quantum computing,5
"() is
the classical-quantum state, as dubbed in ref.",Quantum computing,5
"[]—
while for measurements on neuron- the discord is zero,
measurements on neuron- in general lead to non-zero
discord.",Quantum computing,5
"thus, we reveal the first important feature of our
neural network (a soft quantum computer).",Quantum computing,5
"namely,
the neural network can develop quantum correlations
although only mixed initial states and very noisy
operations are available.",Quantum computing,5
"consequently, if soft quantum
computing does mimic the working mechanism of the
human brain, the brain is certainly quantum as there
are quantum correlations among the neurons therein.",Quantum computing,5
now let us consider the three-neuron case.,Quantum computing,5
"we
are interested in two particular examples, where two
controlled kraus operations o and o are performed
in different orders, namely, ρout

= oo(ρin ⊗ρin ⊗ρin )
and ρ′out = oo(ρin ⊗ ρin ⊗ ρin ).",Quantum computing,5
"assuming ρin =
p |〉 〈| + ( − p) |〉 〈| and ρin = p |〉 〈| + ( −
p) |〉 〈| yields
ρout

= p(− p) |〉 〈| ⊗ |〉 〈| ⊗w(ρin )

+ pp |〉 〈| ⊗ |〉 〈| ⊗ ρin + (− p)
× (− p) |〉 〈| ⊗ |〉 〈| ⊗ww(ρin ).",Quantum computing,5
"()
meanwhile, it is easy to check that ρ′out can be obtained
from ρout

only by reversing the orders ofw andw in
the last term of eq.",Quantum computing,5
"if (− p)(− p) = , then for
noncommutative w and w the resulting states ρout
and ρout

are different from each other.",Quantum computing,5
"the importance
of the quantum operation orders is a quantum feature,
which remains in our quantum neural network model.",Quantum computing,5
"using the national representative surveys (gallup polls)
and laboratory experiments, a recent result [] reported
an evidence supporting a quantum model of question
order effects for human judgments.",Quantum computing,5
"whether or not our
quantum neural network model is a quantum mechanical
foundation for such a result is certainly an interesting
future problem.",Quantum computing,5
"open quantum systems have been considered for
various applications in quantum information processing
by engineering environment [, ] and in particular, for
mixed-state quantum computing [–] or dissipative
quantum computing [, ].",Quantum computing,5
"while soft quantum
computing is no more powerful than the unitary circuit
model as implied by the “dissipative quantum church-
turing theorem” [], there does exist a mixed-state
quantum computing model (with a collection of qubits
in the completely mixed state coupled to a single control
qubit with nonzero purity), proposed by knill and
laflamme [] and known as deterministic quantum
computation with one qubit (dqc), which provides
exponential speedup (for estimating the normalized-
trace of a unitary matrix) over the best known classical
algorithms.",Quantum computing,5
"the possible role of quantum discord was
considered, e.g., in refs.",Quantum computing,5
"[, , ], as a figure of
merit for characterizing the nonclassical resources present
in the dqc, which itself is a special soft quantum
computer.",Quantum computing,5
"thus, it is reasonable to expect that soft
quantum computing has computational power between
classical computation and usual quantum computation.",Quantum computing,5
"finally, we give a brief remark on the physical
implementation of soft quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"above
discussions focus mainly on a special form of the
conditional dynamical evolution as in eq.",Quantum computing,5
"(); more
general forms can of course be envisioned.",Quantum computing,5
"a physical
realization of oij is simple: the superprojectors p|s〉
i
correspond to a von neumann measurement on neuron-
i along the computational basis; conditionally on the
measurement results, an identity operation iˆ or wij(t)
is acted upon neuron-j.",Quantum computing,5
"such a conditional dynamical
evolution is experimentally friendly to implementation
based on any quantum computing systems under current
investigation, such as linear optics, superconducting
qubits, atoms/ions, and quantum dots.",Quantum computing,5
"to summarize, we have proposed soft quantum
computing as nonclassical computation using real world
quantum systems with naturally occurring decoherence
and dissipation induced by environment.",Quantum computing,5
"a mathe-
matical model of quantum neural network is suggested
to illustrate soft quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"even using
very simple and noisy operations [the controlled kraus
operations in eq.",Quantum computing,5
"()], the quantum features, such as
the presence of quantum discord and non-commutability
of quantum operations, remain in our model.",Quantum computing,5
"as an
experimentally friendly model, the neural network as
proposed mimics as much as possible the realistic human
brain and thus, paves the way to quantum artificial
intelligence and to better understanding the working
mechanism of the human brain.",Quantum computing,5
"if the human brain
does be a soft quantum computer, it utilizes quantum
laws in such a fundamental way that it forms certainly
a quantum correlated entity.",Quantum computing,5
"this might be the reason
why the human brain is much more powerful for certain
tasks than classical computers, although we have to know
more consequences and applications of the model to
arrive at a conclusive result.",Quantum computing,5
"while the soft quantum
computer is much easier to build than the standard one,
we need to do more works to understand what kinds
of computational tasks it can execute and to find the
corresponding efficient algorithms.",Quantum computing,5

ing components in terms of the practical operation.",Quantum computing,5
"for
example, we have to prepare a quantum algorithm de-
composed into individual gates instead of only the dom-
inant part of a quantum algorithm.",Quantum computing,5
"second, the above
components have to be properly integrated with a target
quantum computer system architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, we
have to find a path for qubit movements (or braiding) on
the target system architecture without raising any con-
flicts with other paths.",Quantum computing,5
"by doing so, the quantity of qubit
movements which cannot be considered in the statistical
analysis can be exactly measured, and therefore we can
say that the analysis results are realistic.",Quantum computing,5
"in this work, to perform the integrated analysis more
efficiently, we propose and develop a quantum computing
framework composed of three functional layers (compile,
system and building block), where each layer has a well-
defined role for a quantum computing as follows.",Quantum computing,5
"• compile: decomposition of a quantum algorithm
into a sequence of quantum gates called a quantum
assembly code
• system: integration of a quantum algorithm and
building blocks under a quantum computer system
architecture
• building block: implementation of logical qubits
and gates according to a quantum error-correcting
code and a fault-tolerant scheme
with the proposed framework, we can conduct the anal-
ysis in the most fine-grained manner.",Quantum computing,5
"for example,
we even count a qubit movement one by one, and the
quantity of physical qubits based on the provided quan-
tum computer architecture and the ancilla qubits re-
quired for error correction and magic state.",Quantum computing,5
"further-
more, the framework examines the performance and the
resource with the criterion, % fidelity quantum com-
puting [].",Quantum computing,5
"by doing so, we can provide full quantum
resource and compare various quantum computing con-
figurations fairly.",Quantum computing,5
"the objective of this work is to estimate the most ac-
curate quantum computing performance and quantum
resource by the help of the framework we developed.",Quantum computing,5
"for
that, we first need to configure a quantum computing
by choosing specific protocols and device properties.",Quantum computing,5
"by
doing so, as mentioned above, we can see the quantum
resource and the performance of a quantum computing
based on most of quantum computing components from
algorithm to hardware.",Quantum computing,5
"besides, it is also possible to see
which component affects a quantum computing most se-
riously by applying realistic technology from the top layer
to the bottom layer gradually.",Quantum computing,5
"in this regards, we can see
that a theoretically optimal protocol really leads to opti-
mal quantum computing or instead works suboptimally
in composition with other components.",Quantum computing,5
"by exploiting the accurate analysis function, we can
show numerical data for some theoretical conjectures in
the fault-tolerant quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"in steane code
based quantum computing, increasing a concatenation
level makes it possible to achieve more reliable quantum
computing, but we guess that the more does not lead to
the better all the time because a higher concatenation
level requires more quantum resource and longer execu-
tion time.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, it is reasonable to guess that there
may exist a trade-off between the reliability and the per-
formance (resource).",Quantum computing,5
"in this work, we show there exists
such trade-off, and in surface code based quantum com-
puting too.",Quantum computing,5

analysis based on more quantum computing components
than before.",Quantum computing,5

of logical operations, the properties of physical device, time
and fidelity, have to be considered.",Quantum computing,5
"then, based on the physi-
cal device property and the fault-tolerant quantum computing
scheme, logical operations with a specific performance will be
generated.",Quantum computing,5
"b. configuration of quantum computing
we describe how to configure a quantum computing
with the proposed framework.",Quantum computing,5
"as mentioned above, it is
possible to configure a quantum computing by selectively
choosing specific protocols or the properties of physical
device.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, you can configure a steane code
based fault-tolerant quantum computing to run shor al-
gorithm.",Quantum computing,5
"for that, through compile you generate a quan-
tum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
"logical building blocks are built
up based on the chosen quantum error-correcting code,
quantum device and the size of the quantum algorithm.",Quantum computing,5
"the next task is to determine a quantum computer archi-
tecture of a certain physical and/or logical qubit layout.",Quantum computing,5
"the architecture depends on the chosen fault-tolerant
quantum computing scheme.",Quantum computing,5
"note that it is also possible
to choose a physical non-fault-tolerant quantum comput-
ing by assuming high-fidelity quantum computing device
(see section viib).",Quantum computing,5
"in table ii, we show some options our framework cur-
rently supports.",Quantum computing,5
"in the table, the compile type and the
mapping type (with qubit layout) completely depend on
the type of a quantum assembly code, a structured code
and a non-structured code.",Quantum computing,5
"a structured quantum as-
sembly code is processed by a structured system mapping
for a structured quantum computer architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"simi-
larly, a non-structured quantum assembly code is taken
by a non-structured system mapping based on a simple
qubit layout such as a regular - or -dimensional lattice.",Quantum computing,5
"the details of the structured and non-structured quan-
tum assembly codes will be described in section iva.",Quantum computing,5
"in
sections vi and vii, we configure quantum computings
with such options and analyze the performance and the
quantum resource.",Quantum computing,5
"with the proposed framework, a quantum comput-
ing can be configured as follows.",Quantum computing,5
"the first step is
to determine the type of a quantum computing, a
fault-tolerant quantum computing or a non-fault-tolerant
physical quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"in general, such deter-

list of protocols and layouts currently supported by the framework.,Quantum computing,5
"in the compile layer, we choose a compile
type and a target gate set.",Quantum computing,5
the compile type is the format of a quantum assembly code.,Quantum computing,5
"the compile type is closely related
to the mapping type and qubit layout.",Quantum computing,5
a specific qubit layout can be chosen within a selection.,Quantum computing,5
"in the building block layer,
the scheme for a fault-tolerant quantum computing is determined.",Quantum computing,5
"according to the scheme, the protocol of logical operations
are fixed.",Quantum computing,5
"the larger quantum algorithm requires the more reliable
qubits and gates.",Quantum computing,5
"if you decided a fault-tolerant quan-
tum computing, you need to choose a quantum error-
correcting code.",Quantum computing,5
"our platform supports [[, , ]] steane
code and a surface code now.",Quantum computing,5
"according to a quantum
algorithm and the reliability (error rate) of physical de-
vice, the concatenation level for steane code or the code
distance for a surface code will be determined.",Quantum computing,5
"the choice of the quantum computing type affects a
succeeding quantum compile step.",Quantum computing,5
"exactly, target quan-
tum gates for a compile completely depends on the cho-
sen quantum computing type.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, rz(θ) gate
for a rotational angle θ is very exploited in a quantum
algorithm, but its logical version is not generally imple-
mented in a fault-tolerant manner.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, to realize
a fault-tolerant quantum computing, you have to decom-
pose such rz(θ) gate into a sequence of h , s and t
gates those are fault-tolerantly implementable.",Quantum computing,5
"on the
other hand, since the physical rz(θ) gate can be easily
performed on physical qubits, there is no problem with
quantum gates including the rotational gate for a non-
fault-tolerant physical quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"the second step is to make a quantum computing pro-
gram and compile it into a quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
"as
mentioned above, for the compile, you have to exploit
target quantum gates determined in the previous step.",Quantum computing,5
"the proposed framework exploits open-source program-
ming language scaffold and compiler scaffcc.",Quantum computing,5
"you can
see how to make a scaffold program in ref.",Quantum computing,5
"[] and how
to use scaffcc compiler in ref.",Quantum computing,5
"in section iva,
we show a simple example of a scaffold program and the
associated quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
"note that scaffcc
decomposes an arbitrary one-qubit gate into a sequence
of h , s and t by exploiting gridsynth [] or sqct [].",Quantum computing,5
"the third step is to choose a quantum computing archi-
tecture, in particular a qubit array.",Quantum computing,5
"the proposed plat-
form takes not only a simple regular - or -dimensional
lattice, but also a hierarchically structured qubit array.",Quantum computing,5
"a
communication bus also should be considered to make an
efficient interaction over distant qubits.",Quantum computing,5
"shows an
example of a hierarchically structured quantum comput-
ing architectures.",Quantum computing,5
"in case of steane code quantum com-
puting, the structure of a qubit array seriously affects a
quantum computing due to the limited local qubit inter-
action.",Quantum computing,5
"we will show such limitation raises highly non-
trivial temporal overhead in section vic.",Quantum computing,5
"on the other
hand, surface code quantum computing scheme is fun-
damentally established based on local qubit interaction
on the -dimensional lattice.",Quantum computing,5
"shows a quantum
computing architecture for a surface code quantum com-
puting.",Quantum computing,5
"if the configuration is completed, we can perform the
system synthesis.",Quantum computing,5
"during the system synthesis, the quan-
tum algorithm is reformulated for the target quantum
computer architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"c. analysis of quantum computing
we briefly mention what performance are evaluated by
the framework, but the detailed analysis method will be
described in section v. the framework first inspects the
quantities of qubits and gates.",Quantum computing,5
"those figures are usually
analyzed by a quantum compile without considering a
quantum computer architecture [, ].",Quantum computing,5
"but, our frame-
work examines such quantities with the consideration for
a quantum computer system architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"in the system
synthesis, a fault-tolerant quantum computing scheme in
particular a magic state factory is taken into considera-
tion.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, it is possible to estimate the temporal
and spatial overhead caused by factors those are veiled
in a quantum algorithm, and therefore we believe our es-
timation nearly coincides with the resource to perform a
real quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"the framework examines the expected quantum com-
puting execution time (circuit depth, fidelity, kq and
so on) of a quantum algorithm based on quantum com-
puter architecture, fault-tolerant protocol and physical
device.",Quantum computing,5
"by applying the properties of physical device
and fault-tolerant protocol, we deduce the performance
of logical gates and quantum error correction.",Quantum computing,5
"besides,
by conducting a system integration, we are able to obtain
the single-round execution time of a quantum algorithm
by applying the performance of logical gates and error
correction above.",Quantum computing,5
"our framework goes further for more
detailed analysis.",Quantum computing,5
"during the system integration, as men-
tioned above, the fidelity of a quantum computing can
be calculated.",Quantum computing,5
"by reflecting the fidelity, it is possible to
estimate the execution time for a quantum computing
achieving a fidelity %.",Quantum computing,5
"in doing so, we fairly compare
fault-tolerant quantum computing and non-fault-tolerant
quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"the quantity of qubits is also based
on this performance criterion.",Quantum computing,5
"besides the above-mentioned, the framework can gen-
erate various performance data.",Quantum computing,5
"based on the data, we
can estimate the temporal and spatial overhead of a
quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, as mentioned above
limited local interaction between nearest neighbor qubits
sometimes requires additional qubit movements to per-
form -qubit cnot gate.",Quantum computing,5
"the quantity of such qubit
movements corresponds to the temporal overhead.",Quantum computing,5
"the
platform evaluates such temporal overhead as a ration of
swap gates to total quantum gates.",Quantum computing,5
"as will be shown
in section vic, a quantum computing requires highly
nontrivial temporal overhead.",Quantum computing,5

a. compile layer
a quantum compile is a process that decomposes a
quantum algorithm into a sequence of quantum gates.",Quantum computing,5
"here a quantum algorithm is in entirely programmed
form by using a high-level abstract programming lan-
guage.",Quantum computing,5
"it is well known that an arbitrary quantum algorithm
can be decomposed into a combination of -qubit rota-
tional gates and -qubit cnot gate [].",Quantum computing,5
"the target
quantum gates for a compile can be varied according to
situation.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, the set of h , t , and cnot
is de facto standard for a universal fault-tolerant quan-
tum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"but, to reduce the complexity in com-
pile or to provide a flexibility to a programmer, one
usually add more quantum gates to target gates.",Quantum computing,5
"fur-
thermore, according to specific quantum mechanical sys-
tem, physically implementable quantum gates slightly
differ [, ].",Quantum computing,5
"the difference between
both is rz(θ) gate.",Quantum computing,5
"as mentioned before, since the rota-
tional gate for an arbitrary rotational angle θ can not be
implemented in the fault-tolerant manner, the first set
is exploited for a physical quantum computing and the
second is used for a fault-tolerant quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"the output of the quantum compile, the sequence of
quantum gates, is called a quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
"a
quantum assembly code is a list of quantum instructions
that is a combination of a quantum gate and its tar-
get qubit(s).",Quantum computing,5
"it is an intermediate representation of a
quantum algorithm between a mathematical description
and a physical machine instruction description [, , ].",Quantum computing,5
"there is not any standard for a quantum assembly code,
and therefore a specific representation and a structure of
which slightly differ according to literature.",Quantum computing,5
"for exam-
ple, a quantum instruction to apply a hadamard gate
to a qubit q is represented as “hadamard q” or “h(q)”.",Quantum computing,5
"besides, a certain quantum assembly code has its own
special structure.",Quantum computing,5
"in the present work, we hire open-source quantum
compiler scaffcc [, ].",Quantum computing,5
"it compiles a quantum com-
puting program written in quantum computing program-
ing language scaffold [].",Quantum computing,5
"a scaffold program consists of
one main module and multiple sub-modules (see fig.",Quantum computing,5
"a module generally seems like a function or a procedure
of conventional programming languages such as c/c++,
python and so on.",Quantum computing,5
"the module is composed of instruc-
tions calling quantum gates and/or other modules.",Quantum computing,5
"the
execution of a scaffold program begins with the first in-
struction of the main module, and terminates by conduct-
ing the last instruction of the same module.",Quantum computing,5
"during the
execution of the main module, other sub-modules may
be called.",Quantum computing,5
"previously, we mentioned that some quantum assem-
bly codes have unique feature in their structure.",Quantum computing,5
"the compiler generates a hier-
archically structured quantum assembly code, in which
a quantum algorithm is composed of multiple modules.",Quantum computing,5
"a module consists of performing quantum gates and/or
other modules.",Quantum computing,5
"in the previous paragraph, we also men-
tioned that a scaffold program consists of modules.",Quantum computing,5
"to
avoid any ambiguity, we need to distinguish both.",Quantum computing,5
"a
module in a scaffold program is completely defined and
written by a programmer, and through a compile it is
converted to a module in a quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, both are technically identical.",Quantum computing,5
"shows
an example of a module in a quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
we need to say why we exploit scaffcc in this work.,Quantum computing,5
"as mentioned above, a quantum assembly code is a list
of quantum instructions.",Quantum computing,5
"as the size of a quantum algo-
rithm increases, the size of a quantum assembly code non-
trivially increases.",Quantum computing,5
"it completely follows the complexity
of a quantum algorithm.",Quantum computing,5
"obviously, the size of meaning-
ful quantum algorithm in reality is beyond the capability
of conventional super-computing.",Quantum computing,5
"parameter qubits passed
from external modules are clearly specified at the beginning.",Quantum computing,5
"a module is defined by the preparation of local qubits and
classical bits, calling quantum gates and other sub-modules,
and measurement of local qubits.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, the size of a quantum assembly code
of shor algorithm to factorize  bit integer is around
 tb (see fig.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, we have had trouble in
generating and managing such a huge code with a clas-
sical computing system.",Quantum computing,5
"we could not even attempt to
generate more larger-sized quantum algorithm than the
algorithm above due to the lack of classical storage and
memory.",Quantum computing,5
"on the other hand, it is believed that the hierar-
chy provided by scaffcc can suppress the scalability.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, to perform a composite quantum opera-
tion of n gates as much as m times, a normal (non-
structured) quantum assembly code requires mn quan-
tum instructions (#gates × #iteration).",Quantum computing,5
"however, the
hierarchical assembly code requires only m +n instruc-
tions (#gates + #iteration) by defining the operation
as a module.",Quantum computing,5
"by doing this, the hierarchical quantum
assembly code is much smaller than the non-structured
code as shown in fig. . to the best of our knowl-
edge, only scaffcc supports such hierarchically struc-
tured quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5

whey we exploit scaffcc in the proposed platform.",Quantum computing,5

ple of a scaffold program to make a -qubit cat state

"b. system layer
a quantum algorithm (quantum assembly code) is a
logic of how to solve a given problem.",Quantum computing,5
"it is based on ideal
physical situation where noiseless physical gates and arbi-
trary long qubit interaction are allowed.",Quantum computing,5
"in other words,
a quantum algorithm is developed without considering
any physical implementation.",Quantum computing,5
"on the other hand, a quantum computer where a quan-
tum algorithm is executed has a certain logical and phys-
ical architecture such as a qubit layout.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, to
run a quantum algorithm on such quantum computer,
we need to reformulate the algorithm to be compatible
with the given quantum computer architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"for ex-
ample, real quantum computing devices in ibm quan-
tum experience [] have very limited qubit layout and
allow only one-directional cnot.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, the quan-
tum assembly codes shown in fig.",Quantum computing,5
"can not be directly

indicates a qubit, and an edge with a direction implies that
the application of a controlled-cnot gate is possible, where
the control qubit and the target qubit are the root and end
of the arrow.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, as you see no bi-directional cnot
is allowed on the ibm qx.",Quantum computing,5
"(b) the recasted assembly code
from fig.",Quantum computing,5
"since the instruction “cnot data,data“
is not allowed directly on the ibm qx, hadamard gates, “h
data” and “h data”, have to add before and after of the
instruction.",Quantum computing,5

datak.",Quantum computing,5

cancelling out those gates, the circuit depth can be reduced
from  to .",Quantum computing,5

. quantum computer architecture
we discuss a hierarchically structured quantum com-
puter architecture for the proposed framework.",Quantum computing,5
"in (a), the qubits a and even are
parameter qubits passed from other modules, and the qubit
scratch is a local qubit locally used within the module.",Quantum computing,5
"in (b),
the dark grey cells are for the parameter qubits, the white cells
are for the local qubits and the light grey cells are just empty
space or null qubits not working anything.",Quantum computing,5
"while the size
of the parameter qubits a and even are not specified in the
module definition, it can be determined by tracing all modules
that calls the module.",Quantum computing,5
"eral, there is no restriction to the architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"in other
literature, a regular - or -dimensional lattice is usually
exploited.",Quantum computing,5
"but, in this work we assume that it is hier-
archically structured.",Quantum computing,5
"a quantum computer is composed
of several computing regions called a module and a com-
munication bus connecting to the modules.",Quantum computing,5
"by assuming
such structured architecture, the system mapping with a
hierarchically structured quantum assembly code can be
done efficiently.",Quantum computing,5
"a computing region is completely associated with a
module in a quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
"it consists of mul-
tiple cells for logical (or physical) qubits described in the
module.",Quantum computing,5
"some cells are allocated for parameter qubits
passed from other modules, and others are allocated for
local qubits which are temporarily used within a module.",Quantum computing,5
"additional space may be sometimes required to form the
rectangular shape of a module.",Quantum computing,5
"shows an ex-
ample of a module in a quantum assembly code and its
associated computing region.",Quantum computing,5
"shows examples of the above-mentioned quan-
tum computer architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"the box labelled mi,j (mi)
indicates a module (computing region).",Quantum computing,5
"we call the ar-
rangement of modules a global layout and the arrange-
ment of qubits within a module a local layout.",Quantum computing,5
"all mod-
ules communicate with each other via a communication
bus.",Quantum computing,5
"in the figure, the bus is depicted as a white space
outside of modules.",Quantum computing,5
"we will discuss the bandwidth of the
communication bus in section v.
qubit that resides inside a module supports universal
quantum operation.",Quantum computing,5
"the logical qubit is composed of
data qubits for holding data and ancilla qubits for error
correction and logical operations.",Quantum computing,5

rection and logical clifford operations.",Quantum computing,5

"tlogical qubits of different
color play different role in a module; parameter qubits (dark
grey), local qubits (white) and dummy qubits (light grey).",Quantum computing,5
"composition of logical qubits for a communication bus
can be differ from that for modules according to a quan-
tum error-correcting code and a fault-tolerant quantum
computing scheme.
. system mapping
fig.",Quantum computing,5
"shows that all data are collected in the sys-
tem layer and the performance of a quantum computing
is evaluated there.",Quantum computing,5
"in this section, we will describe the
system mapping in terms of the gate reformulation for
the target quantum computer structure and the perfor-
mance evaluation.",Quantum computing,5
"a specific mapping process definitely
depends on the type of quantum instructions.",Quantum computing,5
"quantum
instructions in the hierarchically structured quantum as-
sembly code are classified into three types: -, -qubit
gate and module.",Quantum computing,5
"the set of -qubit gates includes x , z, h , s (s†), t
(t †), rz(θ) and a preparation and a measurement in the
z basis.",Quantum computing,5
"the mapping process for such gates is straight-
forward and can be done independently.",Quantum computing,5
"suppose that a
hadamard gate is applied to a qubit q. if the application
of a certain quantum operation to the qubit was sched-
uled previously, the application of hadamard gate will be
performed after the previous operation.",Quantum computing,5
"if the previous
operation was over at time t(q), then hadamard opera-
tion will start at t(q) and finish at t(q) +ht, where ht
is the execution time of the gate.",Quantum computing,5
"this is everything for
the mapping of an -qubit gate.",Quantum computing,5
"note that the execution
time and fidelity of a quantum gate is provided from the
building block layer.",Quantum computing,5
"the present work deals with a cnot gate only for a
-qubit gate.",Quantum computing,5
"even though there is a case when a swap
gate is required, it is possible to implement a swap gate
with three cnot gates.",Quantum computing,5
"we deal with a cnot gate as a
local gate acting on two qubits located in nearest neigh-
bor.",Quantum computing,5
"suppose that a cnot gate is applied to qubits qa
and qb.",Quantum computing,5
"then, to execute the gate, both qubits have to
be in temporary and spatially ready status.",Quantum computing,5
"if the are
apart, we have to move both qubits to be in neighbor
via swap operations.",Quantum computing,5
"if one qubit is being manipu-
lated by other operation, we have to delay the cnot
operation until both qubits are in idle status.",Quantum computing,5
"then, the
cnot operation definitely begins at max{t(qa), t(qb)},
and finishes at time max{t(qa), t(qb)} + cnott.",Quantum computing,5
"note
that max{t(qa), t(qb} is the time both qubits become idle
status, and cnott is the execution time of a cnot
gate.",Quantum computing,5
"the third type quantum instruction, a module, seems
like a multi-qubit composite quantum operation.",Quantum computing,5
"there-
fore, on the surface, it seems that the mapping of a mod-
ule is very similar with the mapping of a -qubit cnot
gate.",Quantum computing,5
"for the mapping of a module, argument qubits for
a module should be temporally and spatially ready.",Quantum computing,5
"the
critical difference from the case of a cnot gate is that
a distinguished physical space is allocated for a module.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, to perform the mapping of a module, we have
to consider qubit movements between a present module
and a target module.",Quantum computing,5
"suppose that a module a is being mapped now, and
we have to treat a quantum instruction “m (qa, qb, qc)”
that calls a module m with argument qubits qa, qb and
qc.",Quantum computing,5
"then, we have to move the argument qubits to the
designated area of the module m . the qubit movements
are achieved by swap operations through a communica-
tion bus.",Quantum computing,5
we call this movement a forward qubit passing.,Quantum computing,5
"after the forward qubit passing, the qubits will be placed
at the parameter qubit section of the module m . please
see fig.",Quantum computing,5
"quantum instructions of the module
m will then be executed.",Quantum computing,5
"if it is faced with a quantum
instruction calling other module, then some qubits in the
module m will be passed to the designated space of the
newly called module and manipulated there by following
the quantum instructions of the module.",Quantum computing,5
"after executing
all quantum instructions of the module m , the passed
qubits have to be back to the original module a. we
call this returning movement a backward qubit passing.",Quantum computing,5
"shows the module operation including the for-
ward and backward qubit passings.",Quantum computing,5

scribed before.",Quantum computing,5

"we perform the mapping for all modules sequentially
as they appear in a quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
"for that,
we have to keep two lookup tables, a global lookup ta-
ble and a local lookup table.",Quantum computing,5
"for each module, we first
initialize a local lookup table for all qubits, and update
the manipulation time of each qubit as we process each
quantum instruction.",Quantum computing,5
"after processing all instruction of
a module, we determine the execution time of the mod-
ule by picking up the maximum time among all qubits.",Quantum computing,5
"the performance of a module is recorded in the global
lookup table.",Quantum computing,5
"during the mapping of a module, if a mod-
ule which was already mapped is called then we can refer
the performance information of the called module from
the global lookup table.",Quantum computing,5
"after mapping all modules, we can determine the ex-
ecution time of a quantum algorithm as the maximum
time among the qubits in the main module.",Quantum computing,5
"(a), the execution time of the algorithm
is prepzt + fpmain→makecat + bpmain←makecat +
makecatt, where makecatt = ht + cnott.",Quantum computing,5
"note
that fpmain→makecat (bpmain←makecat ) is the time
for the forward (backward) qubit passing.",Quantum computing,5
"the execu-
tion time of the qubit passing depends on the distance
between modules.",Quantum computing,5
"so far, we have described a system mapping algorithm
for a hierarchically structured quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5
"by the way, the presented algorithm can be applied to
a non-structured quantum assembly code.",Quantum computing,5

there are two types of quantum instructions: - and -

be enough.",Quantum computing,5

puting program (see fig.",Quantum computing,5
"), and the arrangement of the
modules on the architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"in general, the d global
layout is a better architecture in terms of a qubit com-
munication when the number of modules is very large.",Quantum computing,5
"on average, the arrangement of the modules on the d
global layout can reduce the distance between modules
than the d global layout.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore the communication
cost of the qubit passing is less than the d global layout.",Quantum computing,5
"shows that a ground state esti-
mation algorithm [, , ] works better on a quantum
computer architecture with d global layout.",Quantum computing,5

tens of thousands modules, but the program of shor algorithm
consists of thousands modules.",Quantum computing,5

of the surface code quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"the quantum
computer architecture for a surface code quantum com-
puting is shown in fig. . in the error rate −, as the
input size increases, the required code distance is raising
,  and  to satisfy the objective fidelity.",Quantum computing,5
"in the fig-
ure, we also show the quantity of physical qubits to run
a magic state factory that supplies |al〉 states during
the quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"as shown in the figure, in this
work, the capacity of a magic state factory stays almost
the same regardless of the input size of shor algorithm.",Quantum computing,5
it increases as much as the code distance.,Quantum computing,5
"[], the authors estimated the surface code
quantum computing execution time of shor algorithm
for factoring a -bit integer.",Quantum computing,5
"they did the estima-
tion only by focusing on the quantity of the sequential
toffoli gates in the modular exponentiation circuit.",Quantum computing,5
"by
following their estimation method, the quantum comput-
ing time to factorize a -bit integer will be only .",Quantum computing,5

"however, as shown in the figure, our estimation
shows .",Quantum computing,5
"×  hours are required for the same task
when the physical error rate is −.",Quantum computing,5
"the algorithm exe-
cution time, as shown in section vii b, is reduced as the
physical error rate decreases.",Quantum computing,5
"we believe the reasons for such enormous gap between
both estimations are as follows.",Quantum computing,5
"first, our analysis is
based on all quantum gates included in shor algorithm
but their analysis focuses on the toffoli gates only.",Quantum computing,5
"in
our estimation, the proportion of transversal gates takes
about  % (# transversal gates/# total gates), in other
words, their estimation ignores the execution time by
such huge transversal gates and the involved error cor-
rection.",Quantum computing,5

"in (b), we also show the required physical qubits for a magic state factory.",Quantum computing,5

"third, while they
used an efficient decomposition of a toffoli gate, we have
used the de facto standard decomposition [].",Quantum computing,5
"fourth,
they might assume that braiding operations for parallel
cnot gates can be performed in parallel without any
path conflicts, but we applied a braiding operation at
a time to avoid conflicts between other braiding paths.",Quantum computing,5
"please note that for shor algorithm of n = m, m cnot
gates can be performed in parallel in ideal case.",Quantum computing,5
"fifth, we
have considered architecture related issues such as qubit
passing over distant modules, but they do not.",Quantum computing,5
"lastly,
we have applied d round quantum error correction where
the code distance d is determined based on the physical
error rate, but they did not.",Quantum computing,5
"one of the reasons why a surface code has attracted
much attention is it requires relatively less overhead.",Quantum computing,5
"in
what follows, we simply compare the steane code and
surface code in light of quantum resource without con-
sidering their theoretical foundation.",Quantum computing,5
"for the fair com-
parison, we assumed the error rate of physical device is
− for both cases.",Quantum computing,5
"shows the quantum com-
puting time and qubits to run shor algorithm.",Quantum computing,5
"as we
mentioned before, the performance of the steane code
quantum computing completely depends on a quantum
computer architecture.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore to focus on the differ-
ence in quantum resource only by a fault-tolerant quan-
tum computing, we also compare the situation where a
non-local qubit interaction is allowed.",Quantum computing,5
"as shown in the
figure, in the small input size, the steane code quantum
computing requires less time and qubits than the surface
code quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"this is because of the non-
locality of multi-qubit operation.",Quantum computing,5
"but, as the input size
increases, the surface code quantum computing shows
the better performance than the steane code quantum
computing even non-local qubit interaction is allowed.",Quantum computing,5

within three measurement operations.",Quantum computing,5

to design and analyze a quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5

gards, in this section, we show how to use it for analyzing
previously proposed high performance quantum comput-
ing methods with realistic quantum computer.",Quantum computing,5
"the first
is an efficient compile (section vii a), and the second is
an improved physical gate (section vii b) and the last is
the strategy for the fault-tolerance (section vii c).",Quantum computing,5

authors proposed an efficient decomposition algorithm
for a controlled-rn gate [].",Quantum computing,5
"by hiring an ancilla qubit,
they achieved that the total number of quantum gates
{h,s, t } is reduced to from  (ref.",Quantum computing,5
"we
show how the proposed decomposition affects the execu-
tion time of shor algorithm.",Quantum computing,5
"even though the proposed
compile algorithm itself requires more qubits, by reduc-
ing the algorithm execution time and increasing the fi-
delity of a quantum computing simultaneously, in total
less qubits are required.",Quantum computing,5
"shows the performance improvement by the
efficient compile in the steane code quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5

of the performance improvement depends on the input
size.",Quantum computing,5

the required concatenation level lowers by applying the
proposed decomposition, the performance improvement
is remarkable.",Quantum computing,5
"shows the performance improvement by the ef-
ficient compile in the surface code quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"the quantum computer architecture for the steane code quantum computing is
the d global layout and the d local layout because as shown in fig.",Quantum computing,5
"the architecture shows the best performance in this
work.",Quantum computing,5
"we also compare the steane code quantum computing with non-local qubit interaction because the performance of the
steane code quantum computing significantly depends on the quantum computer architecture.",Quantum computing,5

"this is be-
cause there always exists the difference in the code dis-
tance.",Quantum computing,5

distance lowers to , ,  from , ,  respectively.",Quantum computing,5
"b. accurate quantum gates
previously, we basically assumed that physical error
rate is − for steane code quantum computing and
− for surface code quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"in this sec-
tion, we show what happens in a quantum computing if
we have more accurate quantum device.",Quantum computing,5

the performance evaluations based on the physical error

and based on the physical error rates over − ∼ −.",Quantum computing,5

"we
also compare a physical quantum computing to those
fault-tolerant quantum computings at the physical er-
ror rate −.",Quantum computing,5
"the performance improvement by low-
ering the error rate from − to − is highly non-
trivial because the required concatenation level is re-
duced from  and  to  in both case respectively.",Quantum computing,5
"but,
lowering the error rate more does not lead to the bet-
ter fault-tolerant quantum computing performance.",Quantum computing,5
"in
other words, the fault-tolerant quantum computing in
the physical error rate − does not show any advan-
tage against the quantum computing in the physical er-
ror rate −.",Quantum computing,5
"this is because as the physical error
rate lowers the fault-tolerant quantum computings with
the same concatenation level achieves very high fidelity
(> .).",Quantum computing,5
"if both quantum computings are performed with
the same concatenation level, both have the same single
round quantum computing time.",Quantum computing,5

no big difference between fidelities, the average quantum
computing tavg will be very similar.",Quantum computing,5

"shows the performance improvement in the
surface code quantum computing over physical error

"in the figure, we also compare the
required code distance.",Quantum computing,5
"as shown in the figure, as the
physical error rates lowers, the required code distance
decreases and therefore the performance increases.",Quantum computing,5
"but,
since the code distance is already too low,  or , there
is not enough room for the performance improvement as
the gate is improved more.",Quantum computing,5
"c. degree of fault tolerance

quantum device of physical error rates below a threshold,
it is possible to achieve an arbitrary long quantum com-
putation is possible.",Quantum computing,5
"by applying a recursive concate-
nated coding [], we can lower the effective error rate to
where a reliable quantum computing is possible.",Quantum computing,5
"as we
increase the concatenation level, the fidelity of a quan-
tum computing also definitely improves.",Quantum computing,5
"but, the dura-
tion of a quantum computing is also increased by raising
a concatenation level.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, the higher concatena-
tion level does not always make the better quantum com-
puting possible.",Quantum computing,5
"shows that there exists a rec-
ommendation for the concatenation level in the steane
code quantum computing, in particular for a quantum
computing time.",Quantum computing,5
"the number of qubits unconditionally
becomes larger as the concatenation level increases.",Quantum computing,5
"in case of a surface code quantum computing, the per-
formance completely depends on the code distance.",Quantum computing,5
"the
code distance is determined to satisfy the objective fi-
delity of a quantum computing, but in most case the
accuracy of the quantum computing by the chosen code
distance exceeds than the target fidelity.",Quantum computing,5
"in this regards,
on considering the averaged quantum computing time
tavg, the chosen code distance may not bring the best
quantum computing performance as shown in the steane
code case.",Quantum computing,5
"shows that the surface code quantum comput-
ing has the best performance with a code distance ,
but the code distance determined by the equation is .",Quantum computing,5
"even though the code distance determined from the tar-
get fidelity .",Quantum computing,5

to find an exact answer, not a probable answer.",Quantum computing,5

plying the code distance , we can reduce the quantum
computing time as much as  days than the case of
the code distance  at the cost of qubits.",Quantum computing,5
"discussion
we have proposed an integrated method for analyzing
the performance and the resource of a quantum comput-
ing.",Quantum computing,5
"in particular, by considering practically running a
quantum algorithm on a quantum computer hardware
of a specific system architecture, we have obtained the
most realistic performance and resource where the ef-
fects by all of fully decomposed algorithm, fault-tolerant
scheme and system architecture are involved.",Quantum computing,5
"for that,
we have proposed and developed a quantum comput-
ing framework composed of three functional layers where
each layer plays a definite role of a quantum comput-
ing.",Quantum computing,5
"by exploiting the framework, we can configure a
quantum computing model by selecting specific proto-
col and/or properties.",Quantum computing,5
"by doing so, we can analyze not
only the performance and resource of a quantum com-
puting, but also the impact of specific components on
the entire quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
(a) the algorithm execution time and (b) the required qubits.,Quantum computing,5
"at the error rate −, as shown in this figure, a fault-tolerant
quantum computing is not required.",Quantum computing,5
"discussed optimal concatenation level and code distance
of fault-tolerant quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"we believe such
discussion was possible due to the proposed framework.",Quantum computing,5
"the analysis results completely depend on the proto-
cols and properties of physical device we employed.",Quantum computing,5
"as
shown in the figures, the quantity of the required qubits
is too enormous and the execution time is too long.",Quantum computing,5
"the
feasibility of a quantum computing seems too bad from
our analysis results.",Quantum computing,5
"however, we need to emphasize that
the very those figures are not so important now.",Quantum computing,5
"readers
need to see the tendency of the analysis results as the in-
put size of a quantum algorithm increases.",Quantum computing,5
"as quantum
computing components are being improved, the analysis
results will be better than the shown in this work, but
the tendency may be stayed.",Quantum computing,5
"as mentioned above, the objective of the present work
is to provide the most realistic performance and resource
of a quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"on the other hand, we believe
the proposed software framework can play a significant
role in practically running a quantum computing with a
real quantum computing hardware later if some compo-
nents are added (see fig.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, components
to control a real quantum device have to be added in the
building block layer.",Quantum computing,5
"the system layer also requires func-
tions that execute a quantum algorithm and a quantum
error correction efficiently.",Quantum computing,5

nents have to be improved as much as possible.",Quantum computing,5

the central idea underlying our approach for finding answers for these ques-
tions is as follows: in order to build various qas into a software application
a software architect (in)directly leverages (or mitigates) the characteristics of
the target computing platform for which the software application is being built.",Quantum computing,5
"consider this example: building the performance qa into an application often
demands exploiting parallelism present in a problem/task.",Quantum computing,5
"however, if the tar-
get computing platform does not offer multiprocessing (e.g.",Quantum computing,5
"if it has only one
single-core cpu) then the application will not be able to truly realize the qa
of performance.",Quantum computing,5

teristics of a computing platform affect different qas for an application, and ii)
how are the qas affected.",Quantum computing,5

the quantum computers.",Quantum computing,5
"though a detailed treatment of theoretical underpin-
ning of quantum phenomenon and computing is available in standard quantum
computing texts such as [], we present quantum computing concepts that are
necessary for our discussion.
. what makes quantum computing different
a classical computer stores and processes information in the form of binary
bits ( and ).",Quantum computing,5
"at a physical level a bit is realized using suitable properties
(e.g.",Quantum computing,5
"an n bit memory cell in
a classical computer can potentially represent n different symbols, but at any
moment it can represent only one of these n possibilities.",Quantum computing,5
"information on a
quantum computer is represented/stored using quantum bits (or qubits).",Quantum computing,5
"these
qubits are physically realized via suitable physical phenomena that obey the
laws of quantum mechanics.",Quantum computing,5
"examples of such phenomena can be: the spin of a
single electron or the configuration of an individual ion.",Quantum computing,5
"a qubit can be observed
in one of the two basis states which are labeled as |〉 or a |〉.",Quantum computing,5
"normally, the
qubit state |〉 corresponds to classical bit , and |〉 to classical  bit.",Quantum computing,5
"one of the
remarkable properties of qubits, which makes quantum computers much faster
than classical computers, is the number of possible states in which the qubit
can exist (different from its observable state, which can be only one of the basis
states).",Quantum computing,5
"at any instant one qubit can be in a |〉, a |〉 state, or any quantum
superposition[] of the two.",Quantum computing,5
"in other words, the basis states |〉 and |〉 and their
linear combinations x |〉+ y |〉 describe the possible states of a single qubit.",Quantum computing,5
"in
contrast, one classical bit at one time can be only in one of the two possible
states: a  or .",Quantum computing,5
"another quantum property that is exploited by quantum computing is en-
tanglement of qubits.",Quantum computing,5
"two or more individually independent quantum objects
are said to be entangled when: a) their individual behavior is random, but at the
same time b) it is too strongly correlated despite each object being independent
from the other.",Quantum computing,5
"a multi-qubit state that cannot be expressed as a list of the
individual constituent qubits is an entangled state.",Quantum computing,5
"consider the bell state[]
qq := (|〉+ |〉)/
√
.",Quantum computing,5
it is an example of an entangled two-qubit state.,Quantum computing,5
"there
is no way of expressing it as a list of one-qubit states.",Quantum computing,5
"suppose you measure
(along some axis) one of the qubits, say q, that comprise this entangled state.",Quantum computing,5
it will behave randomly: in this case q can be |〉 or |〉 with equal probability.,Quantum computing,5
suppose you measured q to be |〉 then value of q will certainly be |〉.,Quantum computing,5
"that is,
you can predict exactly how the other qubit, q, would behave if measured along
the same axis.",Quantum computing,5
"no unentangled state exhibits this type of perfect correlation with
perfect individual randomness.",Quantum computing,5
"the above two properties – quantum superposition and quantum entangle-
ment – are thus very useful resources in quantum computing.
. general architecture
physical quantum computing machinery of today (reminiscent of early classical
computers of s) are big in size[].",Quantum computing,5
"it requires special physical environment
and conditions for operating correctly.",Quantum computing,5
"the general architecture of a qcp can
be depicted as shown in fig. . it comprises of five layers three of which contain
purely quantum hardware and circuitry and two consist of classical hardware
and software:
.",Quantum computing,5
"quantum layers[,,] one can think of these layers as comprising the
quantum processing unit (qpu).",Quantum computing,5
"(a) physical building blocks – includes quantum hardware which typically
makes use of superconducting loops for physical realization of qubits.",Quantum computing,5
"in addition, it also contains the physical qubit coupler/interconnect cir-
cuitry among other elements which are needed for qubit addressing and
control operations.",Quantum computing,5
"(b) quantum logic gates – physical circuitry[, §.]",Quantum computing,5
"that makes up quan-
tum logic gates[].",Quantum computing,5
"(c) quantum-classical interface – it includes the hardware and software
which provides interfacing between classical computers and a qpu.
. classical layers[,,,]
(a) quantum programming environment – it provides items such as: i) quan-
tum assembly language necessary for instructing a qpu, ii) the program-
ming abstractions needed for writing quantum programs in a high-level
programming language and iii) simulator support as well as ides etc.",Quantum computing,5
"(b) business applications – quantum software applications written to cater
for business requirements.",Quantum computing,5
fig. . architecture of quantum computing platform.,Quantum computing,5
"developing quantum software applications
in preceding section we introduced the two fundamental properties – quantum
superposition and quantum entanglement – which make a quantum computer
much faster than classical computers at solving certain types of problems.",Quantum computing,5
"nature
of these two properties inherently make quantum computation to be mostly
probabilistic in nature.",Quantum computing,5
"thus, implying that quantum programs are likely to be
probabilistic or randomized in nature.",Quantum computing,5
"as such, expressing the logic or algorithm
which is to be executed on a quantum computer requires special techniques and
programming model.
. quantum algorithms – the key to harnessing power of qcps
usefulness of quantum programs lies in their ability to exploit the fundamental
characteristics (superposition and entanglement of qubits) of a quantum com-
puter.",Quantum computing,5
"over the past few decades quantum computing researchers have developed
a handful of techniques[] that exploit the characteristics of quantum computers
for quickly solving certain problems that take much longer to solve on a classical
computer.",Quantum computing,5
"some of these techniques and example algorithms that exploit them
are shown in table-.",Quantum computing,5
"there are several algorithms available today which exploit these techniques
to solve variety of computing problems much faster than a classical computer.",Quantum computing,5
"in order to derive benefit from the capabilities of quantum computer one must
map the problem at hand to one of the problems for which a quantum algorithm
is known.",Quantum computing,5
"techniques used by quantum algorithms
technique examples of target problem(s)
amplitude amplification[] quantum counting/search (grover’s
algorithm[]).",Quantum computing,5
"quantum fourier transform[] discrete logarithm problem and the integer fac-
torization problem in polynomial time (shor’s al-
gorithm), and so on.",Quantum computing,5
"phase kick-back[] estimating gauss sums[]
quantum phase estimation[] estimates the phase that a unitary transformation
adds to one of its eigenvectors.",Quantum computing,5
"quantum walks[,] element distinctness problem, triangle-finding
problem, formula evaluation, group commutativ-
ity
fig. . an example quantum circuit and corresponding python code.",Quantum computing,5
"quantum circuits[] is one of the common models for representing quan-
tum computation.",Quantum computing,5
"similar to digital logic gates which are employed by classical
computers, quantum gates are used to compose a quantum circuit.",Quantum computing,5
"in this model
the steps of a quantum algorithm can be expressed as a sequence of quantum
logic gates.",Quantum computing,5
"each quantum logic gate transforms the input qubits in a well de-
fined manner, typically expressed a operations on matrices and vectors.",Quantum computing,5
"ibm
q-experience[] takes this approach to expressing quantum computations.",Quantum computing,5
"we observe that a quantum program typically comprises of parts some of
which execute on a classical cpu and some on a quantum processing unit
(qpu).",Quantum computing,5
"creating such quantum programs mainly involved the following tasks:
.",Quantum computing,5
"the steps are repeated suitable number of
times to get a reliable measurement of the outcomes.
. measure the output qubits state (measuring a qubit forces it to collapse into
a classical bit) and transfer it to the classical bits.",Quantum computing,5
"a suitable high-level programming api or instructions[,,] are typically
used for composing the quantum programs.",Quantum computing,5
"based on these observation a quan-
tum programming model as shown in fig.",Quantum computing,5
"we also checked
the adherence to this programming model by manually examining the sample
quantum programs that are supplied by different qcps we considered.",Quantum computing,5
"quantum software architecture
.",Quantum computing,5
"characteristics of a quantum computing platform
in order to understand the effect of qcps on software architecture it is necessary
to identify all those characteristics of a qcp which can affect the development,
deployment, operation and management of quantum software.",Quantum computing,5
"some such characteristics of the qcps of today are:
.",Quantum computing,5
"platform heterogeneity – the published technical details of different
qcps[,,,] that are available today show the heterogeneous nature of
the qcps.",Quantum computing,5
"considering certain limitations such as various no-go theorems[,]
that quantum phenomenon obey, dependency on classical hardware/software
is inevitable.",Quantum computing,5
"thus, the qpus are expected to be inherently heterogeneous
in nature.",Quantum computing,5
"that is, both classical as well as quantum hardware and software
are involved.
. physical environment – the quantum hardware requires a completely dif-
ferent type of physical environment.",Quantum computing,5
"most of the existing implementations[,,,]
of quantum hardware circuitry make use of superconducting loops requiring
ultra-low temperatures.",Quantum computing,5
"achieving and maintaining such physical conditions
necessitates very specialized environment for reliable operation of a qcp.
. large form factor – due to requirement of special physical environment,
quantum computers of today are very large in size.",Quantum computing,5
"for instance, the main
box of d-wavetmq system measures[] roughly ’x’x’.
. energy efficiency – energy consumption can be looked at from two main
aspects: energy consumed by the qpu itself, and secondly the energy re-
quirements for cooling and other ancillary circuitry which make up a quan-
tum computer.",Quantum computing,5
"it has been observed that a quantum computer spends[]
most of its energy on cooling.",Quantum computing,5
"a qpu by itself, however, consumes much less
energy[].",Quantum computing,5
as the computation speeds grow to exascale (i.e.,Quantum computing,5
"petaflops),
the energy consumption of a qpu is not expected to increase as fast as that
of a cpu/gpu.",Quantum computing,5
"experiments conducted with d-wave’s -qubit system
showed[] overall energy efficiency improvements of the order of x in
comparison to state-of-the-art classical computing servers when considering
pure computation time for running specialized algorithms.
. lower level of the programming abstractions – the programming
abstractions offered by qcps of today[,,,] are of a low level.",Quantum computing,5
"that is,
a programmer has to work at the level of quantum logic gates (usually via
a high-level language representation of it) when expressing computational
steps that he/she wants to execute via a qpu.
. remote software development and deployment – programming tools
such as ides, debuggers, simulators etc.",Quantum computing,5
"that a software developer can use to
create quantum software are invariably cloud based[,].",Quantum computing,5
"only a very limited
portion[,] of the quantum programming tools stack can be deployed
and used on a programmer’s local machine.",Quantum computing,5
"for development and testing of
production-ready quantum software a programmer typically requires access
to a remote qcp environment.
. dependency on quantum algorithms – to exploit the real potential
of quantum computers a programmer has to express the logic of his/her
software using quantum algorithms.",Quantum computing,5
"a computing task where one is looking
to gain speedup by running it on a qcp is typically mapped to or broken
into another task(s) for which a quantum algorithm(s) is known.
. limited portability of software – quantum computing platforms are
themselves in their infancy, though under rapid growth.",Quantum computing,5
"as such there is lack
of standards that are necessary for developing quantum programs which can
be executed transparently on different qpus.",Quantum computing,5
"as such practical quantum
software which depends on availability of a reliable quantum network would
be hard to achieve.
. lack of native quantum operating system – the quantum processors
are still controlled via classical computing operating systems[].",Quantum computing,5
"we do not
yet have mature multitasking and multiprocessing capabilities available for
quantum processors.",Quantum computing,5
"most existing qcps[,,,] expose the quantum
gates and qubits for direct manipulation by programmers.",Quantum computing,5
"mature protocols
and apis that implement, for example, practical timesharing of a quantum
processing unit (qpu) are not available yet[].",Quantum computing,5
"similarly, quantum algo-
rithms which may exploit multiple qpus in parallel is yet to be explored.
. limited multitasking and multiprocessing – this follows from the lack
of native quantum operating systems.",Quantum computing,5
"a programmer has to rely on classical
computer’s os for achieving any type of multitasking and multiprocessing
on a given set of qpus.
. fundamentally different programming model – as discussed in §,
quantum programs are inherently probabilistic.",Quantum computing,5
"a programmer looking to
harness power of a qcp must identify or design suitable quantum algorithms
which are can solve the problem at hand.
. dependency on classical storage – though limited time storage of entan-
gled qubits is feasible[,], long term persistence of qubits in passive media
is still not possible.",Quantum computing,5
"besides, it is not feasible to store arbitrary non-entangled
qubits due to different no-go theorems such as no-teleportation[, page ],
no-cloning[] and no-deleting[] theorems.",Quantum computing,5
"thus, permanent persistence of
critical data in quantum programs still requires classical storage devices.
. effect on quality attributes
quality attributes (qa) may be described as the factors which have system-wide
impact on an application’s architecture, implementation as well as operation[].",Quantum computing,5
"the qas that are of concern for a majority of applications may be categorized
depending on whether they affect design-, runtime-, system- or user- qualities of
the application[,].",Quantum computing,5
"the overall design and quality of a large majority of software applications can
be considered good when the applications possess a reasonable level of at least
the following qas[,,]: performance, reliability, scalability, security and
usability.",Quantum computing,5
"however, based on our experience, we considered a slightly expanded
list of qas when examining how they are affected on a qcp:
.",Quantum computing,5
"usability
in subsequent paragraphs we discuss only those aspects of a qa that are rel-
evant for identifying how the qa is affected by various characteristics of qcps.",Quantum computing,5
we take each of the qcp characteristics identified in §.,Quantum computing,5
"in turn and discuss how
it affects various qas under consideration.",Quantum computing,5
"a characteristic may be considered
favorable, unfavorable or neutral for building a qa into an application.",Quantum computing,5
"summary
of the qa impact of various characteristics of qcps is shown in table-.",Quantum computing,5
"platform heterogeneity: heterogeneity makes it difficult to implement
high cohesion in software.",Quantum computing,5
"therefore, qas such as maintainability, reliabil-
ity, robustness, reusability, and understandability get adversely affected due
to low cohesion.",Quantum computing,5
"heterogeneous environment also means more number of dis-
parate elements (software and hardware) to managed thus adversely affecting
manageability and testability of the system.
. special physical environment: a highly specialized physical environment
needed by a qcp is difficult to create, maintain and operate.",Quantum computing,5
"effect of am-
bient noise/interference is more pronounced in case of qpus than it is on
cpus.",Quantum computing,5
"such properties have adversely affect on the qas such as availability
 a detailed description and properties of individual qas is readily available in stan-
dard software architecture literature such as [,,] etc.",Quantum computing,5

. large form factor: most of the qas, except scalability, remain unaffected
by this property of qcps.",Quantum computing,5
"working at such low levels of abstractions is not easy and increases complex-
ity of the code.",Quantum computing,5
"moreover, there are not many (as of today at least) expert
quantum programmers.",Quantum computing,5
"this in turn adversely affects qas such as maintainability, testability, relia-
bility and availability.
. remote software development and deployment: a major implication
of qcps on testing and debugging arises due to the non-local nature of
a real quantum computer.",Quantum computing,5
"the development tools/environment used for a
qcp are sort of distributed.",Quantum computing,5
"the decentralized (typically, offered via a cloud
based ide) and heterogeneous nature of the development environment will
make programing, testing and debugging of quantum programs slower and
tedious[].",Quantum computing,5
"this adversely affects maintainability and testability.
. dependency on quantum algorithms: probabilistic nature of quan-
tum computations and the results they produce adversely affect testability
and interoperability (with classical software).",Quantum computing,5
"synthesizing realistic pairs of
〈input, expected output〉 for test case scenarios as well as reproducing the
defects that one wants to debug requires special approaches.",Quantum computing,5
"moreover, there are very few[] – only about a dozen – quantum algorithms
known for different types of problems.",Quantum computing,5
"software engineers have to map their
problems to one of the existing few quantum algorithms.",Quantum computing,5
"this adversely
affects the ability to perform enhancement and corrective maintenance.
. limited portability of software: quantum computing, though rapidly
evolving, is still in its infancy.",Quantum computing,5
"it lacks standardization in several areas rang-
ing from high-level programming apis to low-level hardware.",Quantum computing,5
"for example,
a quantum program written using rigetti’s quantum isa[] may not be ex-
ecutable on open qasm[] supported by ibm.",Quantum computing,5
"as such the portability of
software is adversely affected on qcps.",Quantum computing,5
"lack of portability in turn adversely
affects availability, interoperability, maintainability and scalability.
. limited quantum networking: a reliable quantum network is necessary
for building reliable and high-performance quantum software.",Quantum computing,5
"quantum net-
works not yet production ready [,].",Quantum computing,5
"thus, the performance, scalability,
reliability and, in turn, availability will be adversely affected.
. lack of native quantum operating system: a native operating sys-
tem helps in harnessing full potential of a hardware in a secure and effective
manner.",Quantum computing,5
this is lacking[] in case of qcps.,Quantum computing,5
"it prohibits, for instance, practi-
cal timesharing of a qpu.",Quantum computing,5
"thus, the performance, manageability, reliability,
scalability and security will be adversely affected.
. fundamentally different programming model: quantum programs are
inherently probabilistic and requires a fundamentally different approach to
programming (please see §.",Quantum computing,5
"this affects the ease of use of the underly-
ing technology and in turn the code complexity both of which are important
factors that influence[] development and maintenance of dependable soft-
ware.",Quantum computing,5
"as such a qcp adversely affects maintainability, interoperability, security
and testability qas.
. dependency on classical storage: for durably persisting critical data
the quantum programs depend on classical storage devices due to different
no-go theorems such as no-teleportation[, page ], no-cloning[] and
no-deleting[] theorems.",Quantum computing,5
"on a qcp this adversely affects manageability,
performance and scalability.
. threats to validity
quantum computing is a fast evolving area of technology.",Quantum computing,5
"the characteristics of
qcps that we have identified are based on the study of currently available state-
of-the-art quantum hardware and software.",Quantum computing,5
"we expect advances in quantum
computing will invalidate at least few of these characteristics in coming years.",Quantum computing,5
"for example, the production-ready native quantum operating systems are likely
to be feasible in the years to come.",Quantum computing,5
"further, the list of characteristics that we have given is not an exhaustive list.",Quantum computing,5
"it is quite likely that there are additional qcp characteristics which, taken to-
gether, may be of significance in specific software development scenarios.",Quantum computing,5
"another
point that we would like to highlight is that our findings are derived from: a) pub-
lished information about qcps and b) experimental programming on the qcps
accessible to us.",Quantum computing,5
"it is likely that there are unpublished features/information about
those qcps which can affect the software architecture of quantum software ap-
plications.",Quantum computing,5
"next, we have not covered every qa which is relevant for a wider
set of application types.",Quantum computing,5
"there may be qas such as auditability, distributability,
extensibility etc.",Quantum computing,5
which are relevant and may be affected by the qcps.,Quantum computing,5
"lastly,
our own experience and know-how as software architects has influenced to some
extent what we identified as the effect of different qcps on various qas.",Quantum computing,5
"conclusions
programmers’ interest in applying quantum computing has surged in the recent
past.",Quantum computing,5
"leveraging this technology in solving general purpose business problems
requires deeper understanding of important characteristics of qcps, particularly
those which are relevant for software development.",Quantum computing,5
"we have shown that the key characteristics of a qcp make it different from
a classical computing platform.",Quantum computing,5
"for instance, availability and know-how of quan-
tum algorithm(s) for solving a task at hand are a hard requirement for devel-
oping quantum programs.",Quantum computing,5
"such characteristics of a qcp affect various quality
attributes (qas) of the quantum application software.",Quantum computing,5
"the qcp characteristics
such as limited portability of quantum programs, lack of native quantum oper-
ating system services, dependency on quantum algorithms and so on, adversely
affect the ability to realize various qas such as scalability, portability, testability
and maintainability etc.",Quantum computing,5
of the quantum application software.,Quantum computing,5
"the qas that are
favorably impacted by qcp characteristics include performance and scalability.",Quantum computing,5
"overall, the specialized nature of qcps appears to have a significant impli-
cation: it limits the use of qcps for very specialized application areas where
performance qa is of chief importance.",Quantum computing,5
"however, because the quantum com-
puting is undergoing rapid development we expect that the evolution of this
technology will likely introduce additional concerns and factors which may af-
fect the architecture of quantum software applications.",Quantum computing,5
"to make blind quantum computing protocols verifi-
able, mainly two different types of techniques have been
used.",Quantum computing,5
"the first type is so called the trap technique [, ].",Quantum computing,5
"alice hides some isolated qubits, which are called “trap
qubits”, in the register, and later checks that trap qubits
are not disturbed by bob.",Quantum computing,5
"since bob does not know the
place of each trap qubit, he will disturb a trap qubit
with high probability if he deviates from the correct pro-
cedure.",Quantum computing,5
"if the quantum computation is encoded with
a quantum error correcting code, the probability that
bob can change a logical state without changing any trap
qubit becomes exponentially small [].",Quantum computing,5
"(if bob wants to
change the state of a logical qubit, he has to change more
than d qubits, where d is the code distance.",Quantum computing,5
"it increases
the probability of he touching a trap qubit.)",Quantum computing,5
"the second type of the technique is called the stabilizer
test [, , , ].",Quantum computing,5
"in the mf protocol, bob generates
graph states and sends each qubit one by one to alice.",Quantum computing,5
"al-
ice randomly choses some of graph states and checks the
correctness of them by measuring stabilizer operators of
the graph state.",Quantum computing,5
"such tests can be done with only single-
qubit measurements of pauli operators [, , , ].",Quantum computing,5
"[, , , ] that if alice passes
the stabilizer test, a remaining state is close to the ideal
graph state on which she can do universal measurement-
based quantum computing.",Quantum computing,5
"in this way, delegated quantum computing has two
important properties, the blindness and the verifiability.",Quantum computing,5
relations between them are still not clear.,Quantum computing,5
"for example,
the blindness was believed to be necessary to achieve the
verifiability, but recently the belief has turned out to be
wrong, since a protocol that is verifiable but not neces-
sarily blind has been found [].",Quantum computing,5
"another open problem is whether any blind protocol
can always be made verifiable or not.",Quantum computing,5
"the bfk proto-
col [] can be made verifiable (fitzsimons-kashefi (fk)
protocol []), and the mf protocol [] can also be made
verifiable (hayashi-morimae (hm) protocol []).",Quantum computing,5
"how-
ever, the ways of making these blind protocols verifiable
are protocol specific, i.e., structures of the blind proto-
cols are exploited to make them verifiable.",Quantum computing,5
"if someone
finds a completely new blind protocol never seen before,
can we always make it verifiable?",Quantum computing,5
"in this paper, we solve the open problem affirma-
tively.",Quantum computing,5
"we propose a “plug-in” that makes any universal
blind quantum computing protocol automatically verifi-
able.",Quantum computing,5
our idea is based on the post hoc verification [].,Quantum computing,5
"in the posthoc verification, the prover sends the verifier
the solution of a problem, and the feynman-kitaev his-
tory state [] corresponding to the quantum circuit that
solves the problem or its complement circuit [].",Quantum computing,5
"the
verifier can verify the correctness of the solution by mea-
suring the energy of a local hamiltonian on the history
state.",Quantum computing,5
"measuring energy of local hamiltonians can be
done with only single qubit measurements of pauli op-
erators [].",Quantum computing,5
"our idea is that alice generates the two
history states corresponding to the solving circuit and
the complement circuit by using the given universal blind
quantum computing protocol, and asks bob to send them
to alice.",Quantum computing,5
"she can learn the solution and verify its cor-
rectness at the same time by measuring their energies.",Quantum computing,5
"a
more precise description of the procedure will be given
later.",Quantum computing,5
"we will also see that our verification technique is
different from and simpler than the two existing tech-
niques (i.e., the trap technique and the stabilizer tech-
nique) explained above.",Quantum computing,5
"energy test.— before explaining our procedure, we re-
view the energy test [], which is an essential ingredient
of our protocol.",Quantum computing,5

shown by noticing the facts that bqp is in qma, the
local hamiltonian problem is qma-hard [], and bqp

learning motivation in robotics 
 
the hands-on nature and materials in the elementary engineering lab seem to provide sufficient motivation to some 
students (petre & price, ).",Robotics,6
"however, researchers continually turn to instructional methods that involve a problem, 
meaningful units, and are cross-curricular in order to motivate and engage other students (blumenfeld et al., ).",Robotics,6
"the role of facilitator becomes critical in robotics projects to 
help sustain student motivation and promote the desired higher level learning (blumenfeld et al., ).",Robotics,6
"when students 
have the necessary collaborative provisions in order to create a supportive classroom environment during robotics 
projects, the results can positively impact student learning motivation (yuen et al., ).",Robotics,6
"student motivation 
contributes to successfully learning and retaining the content (mohr-schroeder et al., ).",Robotics,6
"the use of robotics in the 
classroom has the potential to motivate students to learn, however, it must be noted that the introduction of robotics 
alone does not guarantee positive student impacts (eguchi, ).",Robotics,6
"indeed, the teacher must shift to a new role and 
implement appropriate instructional practices in order to support the learning process, collaboration, and to promote 
the benefits of student learning and motivation (blumenfeld et al., ; yuen et al., ).",Robotics,6
"with teachers taking on new roles as facilitators in the shifting learning environment, students are also asked to take 
on new roles as collaborators.",Robotics,6
"the new roles allow students to take a more active role in their own knowledge 
development when participating in constructivist and problem-based learning, which increases motivation (barker &

"not only do students have the opportunity to be active learners, they also have the potential to positively impact student 
learning and motivation through peer collaboration (blumenfeld et al., ; eguchi, ; robinson, ).",Robotics,6
"small 
group settings for robotics necessitates social and peer interaction.",Robotics,6
"with scaffolding and direction for students on 
successful collaboration, robotics has the potential to promote quality social interactions which support successful 
collaboration and increase motivation (denis & hubert, ; hwang & wu, ).",Robotics,6
"if the nature of robotics is not 
motivating enough for students, the collaborative nature of robotics projects, constructivist learning, and problem-
based learning may offer social interactions that support and maintain student motivation (slangen et al., ; yuen 
et al., ).",Robotics,6
"the collaborative robotics projects in the elementary engineering lab integrate characteristics of 
constructivist and problem-based learning that have been shown to motivate student learning and engage students in 
the learning process.",Robotics,6
"collaborative problem solving in robotics 
 
while there are opportunities in the elementary engineering lab to practice problem solving individually, the fourth 
and fifth grade robotics projects rely heavily on collaborative problem solving.",Robotics,6
"collaborative problem solving is 
defined by mills et al.",Robotics,6
"() as a process where peers construct new knowledge together that neither of them had 
prior knowledge of before working together.",Robotics,6
"by practicing collaborative problem solving in real world applications 
with peer and teacher support, students may improve their problem solving skills and possibly transfer learning across 
content areas (jordan & mcdaniel, ; mills et al., ; petre & price, ).",Robotics,6
"utilizing 
the design process for identifying a problem and developing a robotic solution can increase students’ use of critical 
thinking and problem solving skills (barak & zadok, ; barker & ansorge, ; castledine & chalmers, ; 
jordan & mcdaniel, ).",Robotics,6
"in addition, researchers argue that acquiring problem solving and critical thinking skills 
is essential for students’ futures (castledine & chalmers, ).",Robotics,6
"nelson () emphasized there is more than content 
preparation needed to implement robotics projects, some of which are less tangible.",Robotics,6
"if these less tangible preparations 
are addressed through the implementation of effective strategies, additional student benefits can be achieved with 
skills-transfer (nelson, ).",Robotics,6
"understanding the characteristics of collaborative problem solving will assist in determining what scaffolds, less 
tangible preparations, would best support student learning.",Robotics,6
"since collaborative problem solving is a form of problem 
solving requiring peer interactions (mills et al., ) students need to ask questions, gather information, and reflect 
on what they have learned in order to solve a problem (somyürek, ).",Robotics,6
"though the process may seem simple 
enough, it requires complex skills (somyürek, ).",Robotics,6
"in fact, problem solving is a complex phenomenon that utilizes 
both conscious and unconscious processes as well as combinations of explicit knowledge and intuition (barak & 
zadok, ).",Robotics,6
"however, the process can be simplified for students by breaking problem solving into a series of steps 
(mills et al., ).",Robotics,6
"another potential support for collaborative problem solving is the use of language to promote the 
collaboration and the development of newly co-constructed knowledge (mills et al., ).",Robotics,6
"the potential benefits for 
collaborative robotics projects to facilitate groupwork, problem solving, and critical thinking may be supported 
through language scaffolds (hwang & wu, ; mills et al., ).",Robotics,6
"while collaborative problem solving may prove 
to be a challenge for students because of the complexities, experiences with collaborative problem solving allow 
students to develop group solutions to meet the common group goal (denis & hubert, ; jordan & mcdaniel, 
; mills et al., ).",Robotics,6
"however, the uncertainties of collaborative problem solving may also create barriers to 
students’ development of solutions (jordan & mcdaniels, ).",Robotics,6
"jordan and mcdaniels () determine that teacher 
and peer support is critical for managing the uncertainties of collaborative problem solving.",Robotics,6
"students’ ability to reflect 
on and relate problem solving strategies in relation to real world contexts could boost confidence levels in the subject 
area (castledine & chalmers, ).",Robotics,6
"students may need the boost in confidence to feel comfortable sharing ideas and 
assisting with the project.",Robotics,6
"the collaborative problem solving and the group work required with robotics projects may also make it more difficult 
to identify individual student progress.",Robotics,6
"teachers must closely monitor individual students, their understanding, and 
their performance in order to support successful projects (eguchi, ).",Robotics,6
"papert () identifies ways in which to 
guide student thinking, but cautions that problem solving cannot be as simple as memorizing a procedure, such as a 
math algorithm, because the variety of problems are always changing.",Robotics,6

students do not have to give up old methods to learn new ones.",Robotics,6

integration.",Robotics,6

robotic instruction is developed.",Robotics,6

to focus student learning on engineering (bers, ; jordan & mcdaniel, ; petre & price, ; ringwood et 
al., ; yuen et al., ).",Robotics,6

can easily combine science and engineering in addition to creating connections between the elementary engineering 
lab and the general classroom.",Robotics,6
"these skills are applicable and valuable for 
engineering, science, and the general classroom setting.",Robotics,6
"in addition to the identified three main skills, benitti () 
noted robotics activities required the use of thinking skills and scientific reasoning.",Robotics,6
"furthermore, sullivan () 
maintained that an appropriate open-ended instructional approach, in conjunction with the use of robotics promotes 
the use of thinking and science process skills, as well as increased systems understanding.",Robotics,6
"science requires students to use language as a component of critical thinking and is necessary in order to understand 
and identify solutions for problems (mills et al., ).",Robotics,6
"sullivan () suggests that the process of debugging a 
program is an ideal format for teaching science process skills.",Robotics,6
"students generate hypotheses about what would work 
in the program, test it, and receive immediate feedback.",Robotics,6
"the feedback starts as an iterative cycle of observation, 
hypothesis generation, testing of the hypothesis, and evaluation of the solution (sullivan, ).",Robotics,6
"this is not only an 
appropriate format for teaching science process skills, but also emphasizes the real-world process scientists engage, 
while offering a different exposure to science, since typical classroom lessons do not have the iterative feedback loops 
(sullivan, ).",Robotics,6
"sullivan () makes clear connections between the scientific process and the engineering design 
process by arguing that students must control variables and change only one variable at a time.",Robotics,6
"this is key in the use 
of the scientific method and science process skills.",Robotics,6
"a study by somyürek () indicates that during robotics 
instruction, students learn by designing and programming robots to solve problems.",Robotics,6
"they use scientific skills such as 
making predictions, generating a hypothesis, conducting experiments or tests, and presenting their results.",Robotics,6

discussions and information gathering .,Robotics,6
"in recent years, many educational institutions
have begun to realize the importance robotics has in the world today and have started
to integrate robotics programs into their curriculum.",Robotics,6
"in  our university, worcester
polytechnic institute, was the first ever to offer a bachelor of science in robotics engineering
[].",Robotics,6
"through robotics programs and industry, the field continues to grow and develop, but
these are not the only ways the field has advanced.",Robotics,6
another way the field has advanced over the years is through robotics competitions.,Robotics,6
"competitions cultivate a competitive and challenging environment that drive the innovation
and creativity necessary to develop new technologies.",Robotics,6
"while most robotics competitions have
the intention of fostering creativity and innovation, particularly at the collegiate level, not
all of them are successful and sustainable.",Robotics,6
"many collegiate robotics competitions have faced
problems that have led to renewal delays or even cancellation.",Robotics,6
"these problems in part come
as a result of the rapid pace of technological advancement where challenges quickly become
obsolete.",Robotics,6
"this interactive qualifying project delivers a proposal for a successful and sustainable
collegiate robotics competition hosted by worcester polytechnic institute (wpi).",Robotics,6
"we have
studied the successes and failures of other competitions and have gathered information from
potential participants, sponsors, and wpi stakeholders.",Robotics,6
"we have developed this competition
to increase opportunity for undergraduate involvement in cutting-edge innovation and to
elevate wpi’s peer-to-peer recognition amongst other institutions.",Robotics,6
"in the pursuit of our goals, we have researched and discussed a broad range of general
questions and considerations.",Robotics,6
"each of these hurdles have been addressed during the course
of our iqp:
• what do we define as a ‘successful’ collegiate robotics competition?",Robotics,6
• what causes some collegiate robotics competitions to fail while others succeed?,Robotics,6
• what do successful collegiate robotics competitions have in common?,Robotics,6
• what do failed collegiate robotics competitions have in common?,Robotics,6
"• what do events outside of the academic world, or even outside of the world of tech-
nology, do to be successful?",Robotics,6
"are any of these design aspects transferable to the kind
of event we are planning?",Robotics,6
"• how can we grow the scale of interest in this competition beyond people already active
in similar ones?",Robotics,6
• how do we get potential sponsors interested in our competition?,Robotics,6
• what can we do to encourage concrete undergraduate involvement in this competition?,Robotics,6
• how will our competition interest peer institutions?,Robotics,6
• what resources will be required to host our competition at wpi?,Robotics,6
"by comprehensively answering these questions using effective methodology, and by learn-
ing from the triumphs and failures of others, we have created a presentable roadmap for a
realistic, implementable, and impactful collegiate robotics competition hosted by wpi.",Robotics,6
"background
in order to develop a successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competition at worcester
polytechnic institute (wpi) it is important to understand the background of the school,
its robotics engineering program, and other collegiate robotics competitions.",Robotics,6
"it is also
important to understand why a collegiate robotics competition hosted by wpi is relevant to
the interests of the school, and the benefits that a collegiate robotics competition hosted by
wpi can provide.
. about worcester polytechnic institute
worcester polytechnic institute, founded in , was established to provide the masses with
an exceptional science and engineering education.",Robotics,6
"it was not until the late ’s that wpi
adapted its signature “plan,” combining both theory and practice.",Robotics,6
"doing this arms each
student with the ability to carry a wide range of theoretical knowledge mixed with industry
experience [].",Robotics,6
"wpi’s curriculum structure is designed to foster teamwork rather than
harbor competition.",Robotics,6
"part of this is wpi’s innovative robotics engineering program which
began in  and was the first of its kind [].
. about wpi’s robotics engineering program
the robotics engineering program began in , offering just two courses.",Robotics,6
"now it has grown
to include more than twenty courses, combining the disciplines of computer science, electrical
and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering.",Robotics,6
"it awarded its four bachelor’s degrees
in  to students who had switched majors into the program.",Robotics,6
"in  the program awarded
 undergraduate degrees in robotics engineering, adding to the total  bachelor’s degrees
awarded to date.",Robotics,6
"in recent years the program has also expanded to the graduate level and
awarded  master’s degrees and  phds this past academic year [].
. previous and existing collegiate robotics competitions
the following section conveys research into the most relevant collegiate robotics competitions
today, providing insights into the resources needed for a collegiate robotics competition, the
potential impacts of such an event, and the potential benefits.",Robotics,6
"this section also discusses
the factors that can attribute to a collegiate robotics competition’s success and provides the
groundwork for later sections where we use this information to present a solution to the
problems asserted in the introduction.",Robotics,6
".. first
the first robotics competition (frc) began in  when  teams from around new
england came together for the first frc season.",Robotics,6
"since then frc has seen tremendous
growth and today has , teams in  countries with over , students [].",Robotics,6
"although
it is a high school competition, it is worth mentioning as it is the largest robotics competition
in the world [].",Robotics,6
"frc tasks high school teams to design and build robots in six and a half weeks to play
a field game.",Robotics,6
"the rules and game change every year but still fall within certain parameters,
allowing teams to reuse base robots each year and only requiring designing and building
specific components.",Robotics,6
".. vexu
the vex robotics competition started in  by innovation first international to help
promote their stem education product line [].",Robotics,6
"compared to the already existing first
robotics competition that was also available to high school students, the robots were much
smaller and the rules varied considerably.",Robotics,6
"for example, for the first robotics competition
robots could be a maximum of  lb and individual parts could be sourced from multiple
suppliers as long as each individual part did not exceed $ in cost [, ].",Robotics,6
"this differed
from the vex competition rules where there was not a weight limit and robots could not
be a larger than an xx inch cube at the start of the match only using vex brand
parts.",Robotics,6
"this new competition found a home with many high school students as it was far less
expensive than first but more sophisticated than first lego league.",Robotics,6
"unlike first,
the participants in vex were not limited to a six-week build season, allowing them to spend
more time working on their robot designs and going to competitions.",Robotics,6
after the vex robotics competition’s first year the program continued to grow.,Robotics,6
"a new
non-profit organization, recf or the robotics education and competition foundation, was
created in order to help organize competitive events.",Robotics,6
"this allowed for the competition to
expand to middle school and internationally, with more than , teams from more than
 countries competing in the various programs.",Robotics,6
"starting in , the vexu division was formed out of the existing vex competition.",Robotics,6
"this new division was created specifically for college and university students with rules nearly
identical to the high school and middle-school level vex competitions, but with greater
customization and flexibility.",Robotics,6
"additionally, this competition offered teams the ability to
work on real-world problems and engineer robotic solutions.",Robotics,6
"through our research, we have identified these factors that contribute to the success of
the vexu competition:
• compared to most competitions the vexu competition is less expensive to participate
in since most teams spend a maximum of $ per robot their first year.",Robotics,6
– since the parts can be reused the cost of participating each year can decrease.,Robotics,6
"• the competition grows every year with more teams and qualifying events from around
the world.",Robotics,6
"for example in the upcoming - there will be a new vexu quali-
fying event in singapore.",Robotics,6
• the field is small (xft) and easy to set up it makes running events simple.,Robotics,6
"through our research we have also identified the following drawbacks to the vexu compe-
tition:

• unlike the high school and middle school vex competitions, vexu allows for sensors
supplied by outside vendors and d printed parts which allow for some creativity, but
teams are still limited to vex brand parts for mechanical and structural components
which puts a cap on what is possible by teams.",Robotics,6
"• the dynamics of the vexu competition are generally similar to that of a sports match
and have less relation to solving real-world problems.",Robotics,6
".. robomasters
the robomasters competition is one of the newest competitions we have researched, having
only started in  by dji, a worldwide quadcopter company based out of china.",Robotics,6
"for the
first two years of the competition only chinese universities could compete, but it was still a
huge success, drawing in over  teams from more than  universities in its first year.",Robotics,6
"its
rapid growth is largely due to dji, who gave each team two kit-bots which was the minimum
required to compete in the competition, lowering the barrier to entry [].",Robotics,6
"the field is much
larger (x meters) than other robotics competitions and each team is able to field up
to four robots and one quadcopter at a time.",Robotics,6
"another major difference with robomasters
compared to most competitions is that each robot has a health bar and armor plates.",Robotics,6
"if
these armor plates are hit by the opposing teams pellets then the health of the robot can
decrease and even disable it if the health of the robot is depleted.",Robotics,6
"the structure of the
competition makes its dynamic similar to that of an esports event and brings in fairly large
online audiences in the tens of thousands.",Robotics,6
"its international popularity has even produced a
japanese anime based on the competition.",Robotics,6
"although the robomasters competition is the newest we have researched, we consider
it as one of the most successful for the following reasons:
• in its short run it has expanded from a chinese national competition to an interna-
tional competition with more than  teams from more than than  countries.",Robotics,6
"this
shows the competition only continues to grow.",Robotics,6
"• dji assistance through two free kit-bots and other various parts makes it easy for new
teams to join robomasters.",Robotics,6
"• its interesting competition structure and dynamic brings elements popularized in es-
ports to attract media attention.",Robotics,6
"through our research we have also identified the following drawbacks to the robomasters
competition:
• robomasters competition events only occur in china which can make participation
difficult for international teams.",Robotics,6
"• besides the fully autonomous base-bot, the competition does not heavily focus on
autonomous robots or real-world applications as part of the competition.",Robotics,6
"• although dji supports teams by supplying two kit-bots, most teams still spend up-
wards of $, which can make participation in robomasters difficult for some or-
ganizations.",Robotics,6
".. robocup
robocup is a non-profit organization led by a board of trustees, a president and vice
presidents as well as a combination of committees designed to fill specific organizational
needs.",Robotics,6
"robocup has hosted international robotics competitions annually since it was founded
in  [].",Robotics,6
"robocup started as a competition for robots to play soccer against each other as
a demonstration of artificial intelligence capabilities and to inspire innovation in the industry.",Robotics,6
"since then, it has evolved to include more advanced challenges such as search and rescue,
open industrial challenges and humanoid assistant competitions.",Robotics,6
"it is clear that robocup aims to promote innovation and research in artificial intelli-
gence through five different levels of the competition: robocupsoccer, robocuprescue,
robocup@home, robocupindustrial and robocupjunior.",Robotics,6
"each league has a different tar-
get demographic allowing for robocup to draw in a larger audience from primary school
students making dancing robots in the robocupjunior league to college students tackling
research and industrial challenges.",Robotics,6
"within the robocupsoccer division there are further
divisions: small, middle size, standard platform, humanoid, and simulation.",Robotics,6
"this allows
organizations that choose to compete in robocup divisions that fit with their resources and
goals.",Robotics,6
"robocup also promotes innovation and research by providing a database of publications,
presentations and research from leading scientific journals and conferences in artificial intel-
ligence.",Robotics,6
robocup currently indexes  research articles from  authors.,Robotics,6
"this provides
participants with accredited sources of information and research on which to base their de-
signs and strategy.",Robotics,6
"on their website they state that their database is “constantly updated
and [they] estimate to reach about , papers” [].",Robotics,6
"robocup also takes into consideration their public image via a “news” section on their
website for the press.",Robotics,6
"they hold databases of promotional newsletters, announcements,
images and videos for public and press use in order to promote their brand.",Robotics,6
"robocup also
live-streams their events with commentary for international viewers that earn, on average, a
few thousand views per stream [].",Robotics,6
"through our research we have identified the following factors for robocup’s success:
• robocup has developed many divisions of multiple levels and interests in order to
make the competition available and appealing to a wide range of organizations.",Robotics,6
"• robocup events have been held annually since its inception in  showing that
the competition has been sustainable.",Robotics,6
"it is also the longest running competition we
researched.",Robotics,6
"• the competition has consistently had around  teams from over  countries over
the course of the last decade.",Robotics,6
"through our research we have identified the following the following drawbacks to the robocup
competition:
• the robocupsoccer competition does not change its rules often, making it possible
for teams with successful designs to continue to achieve, while newer teams struggle to
compete on the same level.",Robotics,6
"• even robocupsoccer small league requires a significant amount of resources to par-
ticipate in.",Robotics,6
"many teams spend upwards of $, for this division alone.",Robotics,6
".. robonation
robonation is a robotics community founded by the association for unmanned vehicle
systems international (auvsi) that offers multiple educational competitions and programs
[].",Robotics,6
"their mission is to allow middle school to graduate students to apply their stem and
robotics knowledge outside of the classroom through the various competitions they have to
offer such as:
• robosub - autonomous robotic submarines fully built by students must complete
a difficult series of visual and acoustic-based tasks.",Robotics,6
"these tasks simulate the work
required of robotic subs in many facets of underwater activity [].",Robotics,6
"in  robosub
saw significant participation at  registered teams [].",Robotics,6
"• roboboat - student teams design autonomous, robotic boats to navigate and race
through an aquatic obstacle course.",Robotics,6
"the behaviors demonstrated by these boats mimic
tasks that are being developed for coastal surveillance, port security and other types
of oceanographic operations [].",Robotics,6
"• maritime robotx challenge - this international competition is designed to evolve
into a multi-platform competition that will include maritime, aerial and submersible
tasks.",Robotics,6
"currently the competition is primarily focused on autonomous surface vehicle
platforms and sensors [].",Robotics,6
"• the national seaperch challenge - a high school and middle school competition
geared towards the construction and operation of remotely operated underwater vehi-
cles to complete certain tasks.",Robotics,6
"most of these vehicles are actually constructed from
kits as part of the educational program associated with the challenge [].",Robotics,6
"• igvc (intelligent ground vehicle competition) - for this competition under-
graduate and graduate students compete to design, power,and construct an intelligent
ground vehicle that can follow lanes, detect obstacles, and follow waypoint navigation
[].",Robotics,6
"• suas (student unmanned air systems) - students research, design, integrate,
and demonstrate an unmanned aerial system that is capable of autonomous flight and
navigation, remote imaging and communication, and execution of a specific set of tasks.",Robotics,6
"these tasks can include sensing, detecting, and avoiding obstacles [].",Robotics,6
"• iarc (international aerial robotics competition) - the longest-running colle-
giate aerial robotics challenge in the world, iarc advances autonomous aerial robotic
behavior through competition.",Robotics,6
"for iarc international teams must create fully au-
tonomous flying robots that demonstrate behaviors never before demonstrated while
completing missions with real world applications [].",Robotics,6
"each competition is held annually with the same technological focus, however they are
given different objectives which allow teams to maintain similar designs from year to year.",Robotics,6
"each of the challenges mentioned have real world applications which holds relevance to the
competitors and companies in the industry of that respective competition.",Robotics,6
"based on our research we have identified feel the following reasons attribute to the success
of robonation:
• robonation consists of multiple competitions which allow organizations to participate
in the competitions that suit their interests.",Robotics,6
"• since only the tasks/objectives change from year to year teams can use the same
design for their robot every year.",Robotics,6
"this also allows newer teams to draw inspiration
from previous participating teams.",Robotics,6
• all competitions have real world applications and are research based.,Robotics,6
"through our research we have identified the following the following drawbacks to the robon-
ation competitions:
• robonation as a whole has not grown as the number of teams competing in challenges
has not increased in the last five years.",Robotics,6
"• because of the scale and nature of the maritime robotx challenge it happens every
 years which is not ideal for many college organizations.",Robotics,6
".. nasa robotic mining competition
the nasa robotic mining challenge began in  as competition for undergraduate and
graduate students to develop a mining robot designed to navigate and operate on the martian
surface [].",Robotics,6
"since then the competition has been held annually at the kennedy science center
and has consistently hosted - teams.",Robotics,6
"through our research we have found that the following factors can be attributed to the
nasa robotics mining competition’s (rmc) success:
• the robotics mining competition features both undergraduate and graduate level
competitions.",Robotics,6
"• in its first year, rmc offered teams $, need-based grants for travel expenses and
supplies.",Robotics,6
"• teams can win judge’s awards based on innovation and efficiency within their team
and design [].",Robotics,6
"• rmc maintains event-specific social media pages to promote their competition and
draw in viewers.",Robotics,6
"• rmc live streams the events in order to reach a wide audience and potentially inspire
other students to join.",Robotics,6
"through our research we have also discovered the following drawbacks to the nasa robotics
mining challenge:
• the competition does not seem to have grown in size from year to year.",Robotics,6
"• travel and material costs are high as teams are coming from around the country,
making it difficult for lower budget colleges to enter.",Robotics,6
".. sae collegiate design series
the sae collegiate design series is a set of college competitions held by the society of
automotive engineers.",Robotics,6
"the competition is designed to provide participants with an oppor-
tunity to improve their engineering and project management skills outside of the classroom
[].",Robotics,6
"students who participate have a chance to show their engineering skills to companies
in the automotive industry, land internships and even earn scholarships.",Robotics,6
"the most popular
of these competitions are formula sae and baja sae.",Robotics,6
"• formula sae - for this competition, students are contracted by a fictional manu-
facturing company to develop a formula-style race car.",Robotics,6
"the cars are evaluated as a
potential production item.",Robotics,6
"the cars are targeted at non-professional weekend autocross
racers.",Robotics,6
"each team is expected to design, build and test a prototype.",Robotics,6
"within the for-
mula division, teams can choose to build various types of cars for different events.",Robotics,6
"for
example, teams have the option to build combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles,
or hybrids and compete in the respective events for those divisions.",Robotics,6
"the nature of
the events can change from year to year, but the most consistent events include timed
races and endurance races to test how long the vehicles can last [].",Robotics,6
"• baja sae - students are expected to build a single-seat off-road vehicle that will
survive the harshness of rough terrain.",Robotics,6
"all vehicles are powered by the same  hp
engine from briggs stratton.",Robotics,6
"the baja competition is not as large as the formula
sae competition, but it is able to draw a different crowd to sae competitive events
[].",Robotics,6
"through our research we have found that the following factors can be attributed to the
success of the sae collegiate design series:
• baja sae gives each team an engine, allowing students to focus on the durability of
the car as well as lowering the cost of entry.",Robotics,6
"• event locations on both the east and west coast of the us as well as international
events allow for more colleges to participate.",Robotics,6
"through our research we have also discovered the following drawbacks to the sae collegiate
design series:
• due to the nature of automotive engineering, the cost of entry is very high, making it
difficult for colleges with lower budgets to join.",Robotics,6
"• the space required for this event makes it one of the hardest logistically to hold of the
competitions we have researched.",Robotics,6
"• since teams work with car sized vehicles it can also be difficult to travel to competitive
events with all of the ideal equipment needed to maintain their vehicles.",Robotics,6
"methodology
this sections outlines the methodology used to complete this iqp.",Robotics,6
"each of these steps cover
a specific area in the development of a robot competition to be hosted at wpi.
. background research
as part of our development process we spent much of our time researching previous and
existing collegiate robotics competitions.",Robotics,6
"this research allowed us to better understand
several key topics:
• the resources necessary to execute a collegiate robotics competition.",Robotics,6
• what makes collegiate robotics competitions appealing to participants and sponsors.,Robotics,6
• the benefits of a collegiate robotics competition for the host.,Robotics,6
• the potential impact a collegiate robotics robotics competition hosted by wpi.,Robotics,6
"• the factors that attribute to successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competi-
tions.",Robotics,6
"the background research on various collegiate robotics competitions can be found in
section .",Robotics,6
"of this report.
. interview and discussions
in order to develop a successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competition at wpi it is
important to have discussions with parties that would be involved in the event.",Robotics,6
"these par-
ties include wpi stakeholders, potential participants from other universities, and potential
sponsors.",Robotics,6
".. wpi stakeholders
before work began on designing a robotics competition to be held at wpi, interviews were
conducted of key stakeholders at the school who would be instrumental in making it a reality.",Robotics,6
"the main stakeholders would be those who would have direct involvement in running the
competition and those who would benefit from the exposure.",Robotics,6
"these stakeholders would be
directly involved in the execution of the event:
• the robotics engineering program
• the robotics resource center
• corporate engagement
• touchtomorrow
the stakeholders that would potentially benefit from the event would be:

• admissions
• marketing
• pre-collegiate outreach
• touchtomorrow
... wpi robotics engineering program
the robotics engineering program is the most obvious benefactor and stakeholder of a colle-
giate robotics competition at wpi.",Robotics,6
"the robotics engineering program faculty had valuable
insight on hosting such a collegiate robotics competition and on which key individuals we
should be speaking with.",Robotics,6
"... wpi robotics resource center
the robotics resource center at wpi is responsible for running every competitive robotics
event on campus such as first robotics competitions and formerly the nasa centen-
nial challenge.",Robotics,6
"their relevance to such events makes them a primary stakeholders for our
proposed event, so it was critical for us to have discussions with them.",Robotics,6
"the robotics engineering program would also have direct involvement in the event as
they could serve as a source of funding and volunteers in the form of students and professors.",Robotics,6
"the robotics resource center and touchtomorrow would be the primary organizer of the
event and as such is a primary stakeholder.",Robotics,6
"... wpi admissions office
the nature of the wpi admissions office is to review students and admit them into wpi, so
we decided to meet with them as we felt they had relevant information pertaining to student
statistics and interests.",Robotics,6
"... wpi office of pre-collegiate outreach
another benefactor of a robotics competition held at wpi would be pre-collegiate out-
reach.",Robotics,6
"pre-collegiate outreach designs programs for middle school and high school students
designed to help them explore the stem field and to ultimately get them inspired to choose
wpi when it’s time to apply to colleges.",Robotics,6
"... wpi office of corporate engagement
it was very important to have a discussion with the office of corporate relations as they
are the point of contact for many wpi benefactors and they should have a relevant opinion
on the subject of our iqp.",Robotics,6
".. potential participants
a competition is not a competition without participants, which is why we conducted inter-
views with representatives from  universities in order to better understand their interests.",Robotics,6
"we wanted to find out what they would want to get out of a robotics competition as well
as how to make the competition as inclusive as possible.",Robotics,6
"when finding interviewees from
each university we made sure they were representatives of a relevant stem organization
or involved in stem related activities on campus.",Robotics,6
"because of this, the representatives we
interviewed had a deep understanding of the resources available to students at their univer-
sity and a relevant opinion on the kind of robotics competition their university would be
interested in participating in.",Robotics,6
"while developing our competition we wanted to both make it interesting to peer insti-
tutions with a reputation in robotics as well as universities that are new to the field.",Robotics,6
"in
order to gain diverse range of opinions on the subject we planned to contact and interview
representatives from the following universities in relevant stem organizations:

• what is the annual budget of your organization?,Robotics,6
• does your organization have membership fees?,Robotics,6
• is competition travel covered by your school?,Robotics,6
• do students have access to fabrication resources?,Robotics,6
• what is your ideal frequency for the competition?,Robotics,6
• how often do you feel the rules should change?,Robotics,6
• what is your ideal date for a competition to take place?,Robotics,6
• do you prefer an indoor or outdoor challenge?,Robotics,6
• should there be robot to robot interaction?,Robotics,6
• should there be a multi-robot aspect to the competition?,Robotics,6
"• if you answered yes, how many robots should there be?",Robotics,6
• if you answered yes to a multi-robot competition then should those robots be different?,Robotics,6
• should there be any legged robots?,Robotics,6
• should there be any underwater robots?,Robotics,6
"• should robots be fully autonomous or should there be an autonomous portion to the
challenge?",Robotics,6
"• if you answered yes to a multi-robot competition then how many robots should be
fully autonomous?",Robotics,6
".. potential sponsors
another important aspect of developing a collegiate robotics competition at wpi is con-
tacting potential sponsors for the event.",Robotics,6
"through discussions with sponsors we gained an
understanding of how to make our competition appealing to potential sponsors, how to form
relationships, and eventually partnerships with them.",Robotics,6
"throughout the course of the iqp we contacted the following companies in order to
understand what should be included in our event to properly incentivize sponsors:
• irobot
• uber atg
• symbotic
• massrobotics
• new stone soup, llc

.",Robotics,6
"development and drafting
through our research, we developed a proposal and plan of action for a collegiate robotics
competition hosted by wpi.",Robotics,6
"we have developed severial documents for this iqp: this report,
which contains our findings as well as conclusions on them, a rules handbook, targeted
towards potential participants and includes details on each competition and a tentative
schedule, and a logistics document, which contains details on the resources necessary to host
this event.",Robotics,6
"in developing a proposal for this event we have identified several main decision and
development points:
• potential event dates
• potential competition locations
• proposed event schedule
• logistics plan
• sponsorship packages
• proposed competitions
• selected competitions
as part of this report we provide details for each of these points.",Robotics,6
"findings
the following section describes the results of executing the methodology outlined in section
three of this report.",Robotics,6
"it begins with an overview of our discussions with wpi, potential
participants, and potential sponsors.",Robotics,6
"it then concludes with our work on a proposal for a
collegiate robotics competition to be hosted by wpi.
. discussions and information gathering
this section summarizes the information gathered over the course of the iqp.",Robotics,6
"it begins with
details on discussions with wpi stakeholders, continues with details on discussions with
potential participants, and concludes with details on discussions with potential sponsors.",Robotics,6
".. discussions with wpi stakeholders
before work began on designing a robotics competition to be held at wpi, interviews and
discussions with key stakeholders at the school were conducted to identify event requirements.",Robotics,6
"these stakeholders are the people and offices who would be directly involved in running the
event and those who would need to give approval for it.",Robotics,6
"... robotics engineering program
over the course of this iqp we had many discussions with key figures of wpi’s robotics
engineering program.",Robotics,6
"many of these discussions were with two of our advisors for this iqp,
professors nicholas bertozzi and brad miller during weekly meetings and outside discus-
sions.",Robotics,6
"they consistently provided valuable insight due to their knowledge of the industry
and experience with mentoring competitive robotics teams.",Robotics,6
"the competitive robotics teams
they have mentored have participated in competitions such as the first robotics com-
petition and the vex robotics competition.",Robotics,6
"because of their experience and position as
robotics faculty, our frequent discussions with them were extremely helpful in drafting the
competition.",Robotics,6
"these discussions also kept the project on track by ensuring that the vision of
the competition stayed in the best interest of all parties involved.",Robotics,6
"we also had several productive and insightful discussions with professor david cyganski,
the interim director of wpi’s robotics engineering program.",Robotics,6
"professor cyganski had been
involved with the program since its inception and had a good understanding of how to
represent the wpi robotics program well.",Robotics,6
"professor cyganski advised that cost would be
a huge consideration when attempting to execute our event and that it would be best to
couple the event with a large existing wpi event such as touchtomorrow.",Robotics,6
"this would
prove advantageous as both events could enhance each other in a variety of ways if hosted in
conjunction.",Robotics,6
"he added that with since the nasa sample return challenge has ended and
is no longer a part of touchtomorrow, adding a new competitive robotics event could be of
benefit for all parties involved.",Robotics,6
"professor cyganski received the idea of having a collegiate robotics olympics with multiple
events positively.",Robotics,6
"of his major opinions on the dynamic of the event was that he felt that
we should stray from having events such as combat robotics if we wanted all events to be

academic, but he did admit having those as one of the events had the potential of bringing
a maker and hobbyist type of crowd.",Robotics,6
"professor cyganski felt that having events that were
directly related to real world applications would represent wpi well.",Robotics,6
"some examples of
these events would include a legged robotics challenge, an underwater robotics challenge,
and an item sorting challenge.",Robotics,6
"he made it clear that if we were to have events like that
there proper planning was necessary in order to make it feasible for an event like that to
be executed successfully.",Robotics,6
"the events would also have to be designed to be as accessible to
other universities as possible, but should also remain fair to all potential participants.",Robotics,6
"his
concern was that if undergraduate, graduate, and phd students were allowed to compete in
this competition then undergraduate students might be at a disadvantage.",Robotics,6
"this is because
some graduate or phd students may have developed technology associated with a certain
event over the course of several years.",Robotics,6
"his last major point in these discussions was that it
would be of high interest to wpi to market this sort of event to peer u.s institutions in
order to draw more domestic students into wpi’s graduate programs.",Robotics,6
"... robotics resource center
over the course of our iqp we had many discussions with colleen shaver, the associate
director of the robotics resource center and one of the advisors for our iqp.",Robotics,6
"as the as-
sociate director of the robotics resource center, colleen is in charge of the planning and
execution of many large robotics competitions hosted on wpi campus.",Robotics,6
"such robotics com-
petitions include one of the first lego league championships, an annual first robotics
district event, battlecry, and the nasa sample return challenge.",Robotics,6
"throughout the iqp
her knowledge and experience on running robotics events on wpi campus proved to be ex-
tremely valuable in reaching our goals for this iqp.",Robotics,6
"she consistently gave valuable insights
and feedback on the information we gathered and the competition proposal could not have
been drafted without her.",Robotics,6
"... wpi admissions office
as a benefactor of the potential outreach, admissions materials created in the form of pic-
tures and videos, and the increased attention given to wpi from any robotics competition
held, admissions was an important stakeholder in the event.",Robotics,6
"we met with ashley johnson
and katie phung, both assistant directors of admissions.",Robotics,6
"ashley specializes in robotics
applicants and katie specializes in minority outreach.",Robotics,6
"during the meeting, various strategies were discussed on what what interests potential
high school applicants when it comes to robotics.",Robotics,6
"due to the complicated and visual nature
of the subject, videos were brought up as being an important tool.",Robotics,6
"they allow high schoolers
to get excited when they see it for themselves.",Robotics,6
"they saw a robotics competition held at wpi
as a great way of generating content for these videos as well as a mechanism for outreach to
potential domestic graduate students.",Robotics,6
"they mentioned that the admissions office in general
would love a spectator element combined with interactive parts for potential high school
applicants.",Robotics,6
"... wpi office of corporate engagement
our main discussions with the office of corporate relations were with rachel leblanc, the
vice president of corporate engagement.",Robotics,6
"as mentioned in section ..., we thought it
was very important to meet with this office as they are the point of contact to many of
the companies and organizations associated with wpi.",Robotics,6
"rachel leblanc also sits on the new
england board of the association for unmanned vehicle systems international (auvsi).",Robotics,6
"auvsi is an entity that heavily supports the advancement of robotic technologies and hosts
several robotics competitions and conferences.",Robotics,6
"similar to david cyganski, rachel felt that
auvsi and other potential sponsors would be heavily interested in a robotics competition
hosted at wpi.",Robotics,6
"a robotics competition with different focused events would have the potential
of drawing in specific sponsors for each event.",Robotics,6
"for example bluefin robotics, an underwater
drone company, may be interested in sponsoring an underwater drone challenge.",Robotics,6
"hosting
challenges with real world applications would provide wpi with a good amount of peer to
peer recognition with similar universities.",Robotics,6
"overall, our discussions with rachel proved productive in connecting with potential spon-
sors for our event and she felt that at a high level our proposed event was executable and
would provide many benefits for all parties involved.",Robotics,6
"... wpi office of pre-collegiate outreach
discussions primarily took place with sue sontgerath who guided us through the three main
avenues in place to direct middle school and high school students towards the school:
• through parents
• through educators
• direct contact with students
in general the first two were far more effective than the third for off-campus outreach.",Robotics,6
"she stressed that using “multiple touchpoints” is important because it brings pre-collegiate
students to the campus and wpi-hosted events as often as possible so that they associate
the the school with college when it comes time for them to apply.",Robotics,6
"the event touchtomorrow
is one of the largest examples of this.",Robotics,6
"the event brings thousands of students, as young as
, from around new england to the campus and gets them introduced to the school and
the types of things undergraduates get to do.",Robotics,6
"discussions also circulated around female inclusion in the event and the types of things
that work for that.",Robotics,6
"sue mentioned that most of the research surrounding this says that
women have heavy interest in helping and improving people’s lives.",Robotics,6
"the following universities were interviewed:

• massachusetts institute of technology
• harvard university
• olin college
• stanford university
• duke university
• rice university
• university of pennsylvania
• pennsylvania state university
• purdue university
• california state polytechnic university
• colorado school of mines
• southern methodist university
• university of texas at austin
• university of texas at dallas
• texas am
• university of houston

"these were both for vexu and at
ut austin and ut dallas.",Robotics,6
"is competition travel covered by
your school?",Robotics,6
"responses ranged from “no” to “sometimes” with %
of the answers being the latter.",Robotics,6
"do students have access to
fabrication resources?",Robotics,6
most universities have access to fabrication resources.,Robotics,6
"these range from small makerspaces to full-fledged
machine shops.",Robotics,6
"only % of the universities
interviewed do not have access.",Robotics,6
"since these representatives would be potential participants of our competitive event we
felt it was important to ask their opinions on how the competition should be structured.",Robotics,6
"the questions we asked every representative and a summary of those question responses can
be found in the table below:
table .",Robotics,6
": potential participant opinions
question response summary
what is your ideal frequency for
the competition?",Robotics,6
"all interviewed representatives preferred annual
frequency.",Robotics,6
"this is because students are only in college
program for four years so an annual competition would
keep students engaged in the competition.",Robotics,6
"how often do you feel the rules
should change?",Robotics,6
"every representative felt that the rules of the
competition should change annually in order to keep
the competition interesting and engaging.",Robotics,6
"what is your ideal date for a
competition to take place?",Robotics,6
"all representatives felt a date during the summer
would be the best timing.",Robotics,6
"most had a preference for
the beginning of the summer(late may/early june)
do you prefer an indoor or
outdoor challenge?",Robotics,6
"all representatives felt that an indoor competition was
preferable.",Robotics,6
"some felt that an outdoor competition is
interesting, but did not like that it would be reliant on
the weather.",Robotics,6
"should there be robot to robot
interaction?",Robotics,6
"with the exception of a few representatives, most felt
that robot to robot interaction should be a part of the
competition.",Robotics,6
"should there be a multi-robot
aspect to the competition?",Robotics,6
"about % of representatives felt that there should be
a multi-robot aspect to the competition.",Robotics,6
"if you answered yes, how many
robots should there be?",Robotics,6
"about % of representatives felt that  robots would
be a good number to a multi-robot competitions.",Robotics,6
"the
other % felt fewer or more robots was ideal.",Robotics,6
"if you answered yes to a
multi-robot competition then
should those robots be different?",Robotics,6
"all representatives that felt there should be a
multi-robot competition said that the robots should be
different types.",Robotics,6
"should there be any legged
robots?",Robotics,6
"about % of representatives were interested in seeing
a legged robot competition.",Robotics,6
"should there be any underwater
robots?",Robotics,6
"all representatives were interested in an underwater
robotics challenge.",Robotics,6
"should robots be fully
autonomous or should there be
an autonomous portion to the
challenge?",Robotics,6
"about % of representatives felt that there should be
an autonomous portion of the challenge rather than
fully autonomous robots.",Robotics,6
"if you answered yes to a
multi-robot competition then
how many robots should be fully
autonomous?",Robotics,6
"about % of representatives who were interested in a
fully autonomous robot thought all robots should be
autonomous while % felt only at least one robot
should be autonomous.",Robotics,6
"only about % of representatives were interested in a
competition with alliances.",Robotics,6
"most felt that if there were
alliances in the competitions it should not be
multi-robot.",Robotics,6
"the full interviews of each representative(including representative details) can be found
in the appendix section of this report.",Robotics,6
"based on the interviews we have made several conclusions that are fully outlined in
the section .",Robotics,6
"these representative interviews were extremely helpful in
understanding the capabilities of most universities and how to design the competition in a
way that will attract competitors and satisfy their interests.",Robotics,6
"... uber atg
one of the potential sponsors we were able to contact was the uber advanced technologies
group.",Robotics,6
"uber atg is the autonomous vehicle development division of uber, based out of
pittsburgh, pennsylvania.",Robotics,6
"because of their mission to advance autonomous vehicle tech-
nology we felt it was important to contact them about potentially sponsoring our event.",Robotics,6
"we were able to contact alan nuttle, a senior engineer at uber atg.",Robotics,6
"allan had previous
experience partnering with the first robotics competition and was heavily interested in
the prospect of sponsoring a collegiate robotics event.",Robotics,6
"we felt that it would be best if uber
was a title sponsor for an autonomous navigation challenge and alan agreed.",Robotics,6
"uber would
be interested in sponsoring a specific event and providing volunteers support in the form of
judges.",Robotics,6
"... irobot
we were able to reach out to lisa freed, a public relations representative from irobot.",Robotics,6
"through our communications with lisa we discovered that irobot does not sponsor com-
petitive events monetarily.",Robotics,6
"according to lisa, irobot is focused more on participants rather

than the actual competition.",Robotics,6
"if they were to assist in a competition at wpi they would
provide volunteers that would mentor or judge competitors of the competition.",Robotics,6
"irobot feels
that as long as the competition is giving students the opportunity to find their passion, be
it building, coding, team leadership or some other area of the stem fields, it would be of
value to them.",Robotics,6
"one last way irobot might participate in our event that lisa mentioned
would be by having a booth in an exhibition area for recruiting purposes.",Robotics,6
"... massrobotics
massrobotics is a robotics startup accelerator in the boston seaport district that was
founded less than two years ago.",Robotics,6
"despite being so young, massrobotics has made a large
impact in the robotics community and has more than a dozen different robotics companies
residing in their offices.",Robotics,6
"because of their nature we felt that it was important to talk with
them and the companies they house as these parties could be potential sponsors of our
event.",Robotics,6
"most of our communications were with joyce sidopoulos, one of the directors of
massrobotics, mainly in charge of their community programs.",Robotics,6
"as a parent, joyce was
interested in the prospect of a competition that would be in collaboration of touchtomorrow
and felt that the timing of the competition would be ideal for many.",Robotics,6
"as an organization
massrobotics would be interested in having exhibition space for their multiple companies
and providing judges for the event.",Robotics,6
"joyce also gave helpful competition design suggestions
such as gearing an underwater robotics challenge towards aquaculture, a challenge their
company hydroswarm is trying to tackle.",Robotics,6
"one of massrobotics’s residents is american
robotics, an agriculture robotics company that utilizes drones to actively track crops.",Robotics,6
"joyce
brought up the idea of this event to them and they were interested in seeing an outdoor
autonomous drone challenge that utilized computer vision to actively track some sort of
target.",Robotics,6
"... rita vasquez torres
over the course of this iqp, we had several discussions with rita vasquez torres, ceo
of engineering consulting company, new stone soup.",Robotics,6
"rita’s background and experience
provided a lot of insight while developing our competition.",Robotics,6
"since rita had partnered with
the army and research institutions such as natick labs on many occasions she was confident
that our intent to have competitive events with real world applications was the best approach.",Robotics,6
"overall she was satisfied with the initial proposal for our event and felt it would be successful,
but she wanted our event to emphasize more than the technical aspect of things.",Robotics,6
"in her
experience she felt that many bright engineers she had worked with lacked fundamental non-
technical skills that are just as important as technical ones.",Robotics,6
"she felt that it was important
to foster a business and entrepreneurial mindset in engineers so she suggested adding an
entrepreneurial aspect to our event.",Robotics,6
"this event should emphasize real technology rules and
regulations currently set in place so that students will understand how to properly bring
technology to market and how to commercialize it.",Robotics,6
"... symbotic, llc
symbotic, llc is a warehouse robotics company based in wilmington, ma.",Robotics,6
"as of fall ,
this company started a small collegiate competition of their own.",Robotics,6
"this competition is struc-
tured to be more like an engineering project, but has increased their interest in working
with universities for future competitions.",Robotics,6
"to discuss this topic we met with maggie weeks,
symbotic’s marketing communications specialist, and taylor smith, one of symbotic’s cor-
porate recruiters.",Robotics,6
"through this discussion, we learned that symbotic would be interested in
sponsoring a robotics competition of any kind and that they would most likely be available
to provide both monetary and volunteer support, but more specific details about the final
event will be required.",Robotics,6
"if symbotic were to sponsor an event they would like for the event
to focus on engineering undergraduate students and for students to have opportunities to
develop mechanical engineering, hardware engineering, and software engineering skills.",Robotics,6
"from
a recruiting standpoint they see it as an opportunity to groom potential employees and see
what those potential employees have to offer.",Robotics,6
"from a marketing standpoint they simply feel
that by being involved it would be a good opportunity, especially since symbotic is starting
to become more public.
. competition development
through our information gathering and discussions with stakeholders at the school, potential
sponsors, and participants we developed a proposal for a robotics competition to be held at
wpi.",Robotics,6
"this section outlines this proposal and includes:
• potential dates
• potential locations
• a proposed schedule
• general logistics requirements
• sponsorship
• initially proposed challenges
this section ends with a decision matrix to determine which proposed challenges should
be hosted in the first year of the event.",Robotics,6
".. potential dates
choosing a potential date for a robotics competition hosted at wpi was challenging as there
are a lot of factors to take into account.",Robotics,6
"first, the school year for wpi goes from april th to
may st, with commencement on the th.",Robotics,6
"any event in the summer would need to happen
after this date as the whole campus is reserved to that event.",Robotics,6
"additional factors include
the dates that participating colleges adjourn for the summer and students start internships.",Robotics,6
internships typically start at the beginning of june and go until mid august.,Robotics,6
"through talking with potential participants and wpi stakeholders we concluded that the
ideal date for the competition would be late may to early june with the event starting friday
morning and ending saturday evening.",Robotics,6
"this would make the event accessible to participants
with internships, even by those traveling from outside of new england, as it would allow
them to take thursday and friday off and return on sunday.",Robotics,6
"late may to early june is also ideal for wpi as it would be after commencement and the
quad would no longer be in use.",Robotics,6
"after we determined this time frame was the ideal date,
we realized that having an event in conjunction would touchtomorrow would be ideal as it
typically takes place in early june and was originally created to be hosted in collaboration
with nasa’s centennial challenge in  and still has a strong theme of robotics even now
that the challenge is over.",Robotics,6
".. potential locations
if this competition were to be in collaboration with touchtomorrow then the following
locations that would be available for use:
• harrington auditorium
• recreation center robot pits
• recreation center swimming pool
• riley commons
• wpi football field
• wpi rooftop field
• institute park
we had discussions with meredith merchant, the assistant recreation director and fa-
cilities director, to determine if use of facilities, such as the swimming pool in the recreation
center, for a competitive robotics event would be possible.",Robotics,6
"meredith was open to the idea
as long as the varsity swimming coach approved as well.",Robotics,6
institute park would also be available for the event.,Robotics,6
"for example, the nasa centennial
challenge was held there and the entire park was fenced off.",Robotics,6
"in order to organize this, the
worcester parks and recreation center would need to be contacted in order to make sure
that the park was available for our desired event dates.",Robotics,6
"the fees associated with renting the
park were fairly low and the it would be possible to fence it off.",Robotics,6
".. proposed competition schedule
through discussions with potential sponsors, participants, and wpi stakeholders we gath-
ered information on what should be included in a robotics competition schedule.",Robotics,6
"we also
determined that this event would be executed best if it occurred over the course of two days
to provide enough time to execute everything that should occur in such an event.in this

schedule there are several important parts that differ from most collegiate robotics compe-
titions.",Robotics,6
"first, we decided it was important to include networking events for participants.",Robotics,6
"these events would be an opportunity for college students studying engineering with experi-
ence in robotics to gain connections within industry.",Robotics,6
"these connections would be especially
helpful for rising seniors when seeking out jobs during the coming school year.",Robotics,6
"second,
there will be keynote speakers at the provided lunches.",Robotics,6
"these speakers will be experts from
industry discussing a relevant topic in the field of robotics.",Robotics,6

.. general logistics requirements
behind every successful event lies extensive organizational planning.",Robotics,6
"we decided to create a
logistical plan to outline where, when and how the events would be run in conjunction with
touchtomorrow.",Robotics,6
"we first identified the required resources to run this competition:
• volunteers
• event space
• event materials
• audio and video

the competition will require a wide variety of volunteers to operate smoothly.",Robotics,6
"each
challenge will follow the same volunteer structure.",Robotics,6
"the volunteer structure outlines the
expected tasks for each position and is as follows:
• standard volunteers
– misc.",Robotics,6
- volunteer positions that are to be determined to help with event flow.,Robotics,6
"– a/v crew - in charge of lighting and audio/video for challenge venues and
would be provided by lnl (wpi’s a/v club).",Robotics,6
– challenge reset - assists in challenge venue maintenance.,Robotics,6
"– queuing - maintains time flow of each challenge by directing teams to necessary
destinations.",Robotics,6
– referee - assists in upholding event challenge rules.,Robotics,6
"– challenge admin - who teams check-in to and an informational guide for the
event.",Robotics,6
"• judges
– robot/safety inspector - inspects robots and confirms if they comply to
event/challenge standards, makes sure that event is up to safety standards, and
able to restrict teams from competing if they are in violation of safety standards.",Robotics,6
"– technical judge - scores posters and the designs of team’s robots and evaluates
robot performance.",Robotics,6
– scoring judge - maintains scoring of challenges.,Robotics,6
"• key volunteers
– head referee - oversees all the referees for all challenges.",Robotics,6
– head inspector - oversees all the inspectors for all challenges.,Robotics,6
– head judge - oversees all technical judging for all challenges.,Robotics,6
– emcee - master of ceremonies and narrator of challenges.,Robotics,6
– field supervisor - in charge of field maintenance.,Robotics,6
– volunteer coordinator - organizes and oversees volunteers for a challenge.,Robotics,6
– challenge coordinator - also organizes and oversees volunteers for a challenge.,Robotics,6
"the majority of the potential sponsors we contacted expressed intent to provide vol-
unteers to help run the event.",Robotics,6
"between our sponsors as well as volunteers from the wpi
volunteers we anticipate to have enough sponsors to staff our selected challenges.",Robotics,6
one of the most important resources required would be funding.,Robotics,6
"the main costs for
running the event would be materials for field construction as well as audio and video pro-
duction for the event.",Robotics,6
"all of the fields will be constructed out of basic materials such as
cardboard and plywood.",Robotics,6
"below are the materials costs for the selected challenges:

• indoor drone challenge - $,
• warehouse swarm challenge - $,
• miniature fire fighting challenge - $,
audio and video production will be provided by the student run club, lens and lights
(lnl).",Robotics,6
"they have provided price estimates for each challenge location:
• harrington auditorium - $,
• riley commons - $
• robot pits - $
based on our positive feedback from potential sponsors, we believe that we can generate
the funds needed solely through sponsorship.",Robotics,6
"this would allow the event to be cost neutral
to the school.",Robotics,6
".. sponsorship
in order to host a successful event it is vital to recruit sponsors that can provide resources
that will enhance the event.",Robotics,6
"sponsors can provide support in the form of both monetary and
volunteer capacities.",Robotics,6
"therefore, in order to entice sponsors of different sizes we developed
sponsorship tiers based on what a sponsor provides for the event.",Robotics,6
"these tiers were developed
in collaboration with colleen shaver, one of our iqp advisors.",Robotics,6
"a sponsor is considered within
a sponsorship tier if they provide at least one of the bullets under the following sponsorship
tiers:
• standard
– donation of $,
–  standard volunteers provided

.. proposed challenges
through discussions with potential participants we learned several key things about what
types of competitions they were interested in.",Robotics,6
"first, we learned that different schools with
were interested in different types of competitions of varying sizes.",Robotics,6
"because of this, we decided
that instead of designing one specific robotics competition we would propose designing and
hosting multiple.",Robotics,6
"that way, universities with different interests and resources could choose
which events they would want to compete in and still participate in the event as a whole.",Robotics,6
"this would also allow us to ask potential contributors to sponsor a specific event relevant
to them.",Robotics,6
"for example, symbotic, a warehouse automation company, could sponsor an item
sorting challenge and could be entitled the “symbotic item sorting challenge”.",Robotics,6
"another
important item we learned was that both potential participants and sponsors were interested
in competitions based on real-world problems.",Robotics,6
"they felt that working on solutions to these
would provide students with relevant experience and make it easier to get sponsors.",Robotics,6
"taking all of what we learned into consideration we went back to potential participants
and sponsors with numerous ideas for competitions and asked for their opinions.",Robotics,6
"the fol-
lowing is list of the competitions that stood out:
• underwater robotics challenge

each of these competitions are based on current real-world problems that sponsors we
have been in contact with are currently working on.",Robotics,6
"... underwater robotics challenge
with the increasing demand for fish and the reduction of fish populations around the world,
the aquaculture industry has grown to account for half of the world’s seafood.",Robotics,6
"despite its
large success, the aquaculture industry still face many problems today.",Robotics,6
"for coastal aquaculture farms, nets require constant inspection as they have a tendency
to break, causing thousands of fish, often non-indigenous, to escape into local waters.",Robotics,6
"this

causes both substantial losses to the farm and untold ecological problems.",Robotics,6
"every aquaculture
farm also faces the problem of diseased fish.",Robotics,6
"since there are no current systems to identify
and separate diseased populations, farms have suffered heavy losses.",Robotics,6
"this challenge was created in order to foster the development of technologies that solve
these problems as well as create a competition for universities interested in underwater
robotics.",Robotics,6
"teams are tasked with building a robot to autonomously find and identify items
underwater.",Robotics,6
these items could be waste or escaped fish.,Robotics,6
"robots could also be tasked with
finding tears in a fish farm net.",Robotics,6
"specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules
handbook.",Robotics,6
"... all-terrain robotics challenge
for this challenge, teams must build robots that are capable of traversing a variety of terrain.",Robotics,6
"this is meant to simulate real life exploration and navigation problems as well as foster
technology geared for disaster relief.",Robotics,6
"points will be rewarded based on how far each robot
travels.",Robotics,6
"robots will not be required to complete each terrain track, but an additional bonus
will be awarded.",Robotics,6
there will also be an additional assessment task conducted by each robot.,Robotics,6
specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules handbook.,Robotics,6
"... item sorting challenge
to accommodate the growth of ecommerce and demand for more efficient sorting and dis-
tribution, warehouse automation has grown to be one of the largest industries in the world.",Robotics,6
with the advancement of automated technologies it only continues to grow.,Robotics,6
"for this chal-
lenge teams must build and design robots that will be able to pick and sort different objects
that might be found in a typical warehouse such as boxes and containers.",Robotics,6
"specific details on
this challenge can be found in the rules handbook.",Robotics,6
"... miniature fire fighting challenge
fire fighting is one one of the most dangerous professions today.",Robotics,6
"in order to foster the
development of technology that can complete fire-fighting tasks without a human individual,
this challenge was created.",Robotics,6
"for this challenge teams must construct robots that autonomously
navigate an “indoor maze” and extinguish a candle that is somewhere in the arena.",Robotics,6
"the
rules for this challenge drew inspiration from the trinity firefighting challenge and specific
details on these rules can be found in the rules handbook.",Robotics,6
"... autonomous vehicle challenge
due to recent advancements, the autonomous vehicle industry is currently experiencing rapid
growth and as such the demand for engineers in this field is growing.",Robotics,6
"for this challenge,
teams will build vehicles that will autonomously complete a small track and avoid obstacles.",Robotics,6
specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules handbook.,Robotics,6
"... warehouse swarm challenge
swarm robotics is an active area of research in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence.",Robotics,6
"it is based on the principle of emergent behavior seen in social insects, such as ants and bees,
were the actions of each individual are heavily influenced by those around them.",Robotics,6
"swarms in
nature make use of many redundant separate entities to accomplish tasks that would have
been difficult to complete alone.",Robotics,6
"this challenge will give college students the opportunity
to develop multi-robot systems on a hardware and software level as well as specific software
skills such as computer vision and environment navigation.",Robotics,6
"details on the competition are
in the rules handbook.",Robotics,6
"... indoor drone challenge
the market for unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) is rapidly growing.",Robotics,6
"companies like ama-
zon, who is working on uavs to deliver packages from warehouses directly to consumers
in minutes, and uber, who is working on uavs to transport people from place to place
on demand, are spending millions of dollars on development [, ].",Robotics,6
"this challenge tasks
teams to build a miniature autonomous drone to navigate within a mock city and transport
packages from a pickup location to a destination.",Robotics,6
"specific details on the competition can be
found in the rules handbook.",Robotics,6
"... existing competitions
based on feedback, to augment the new robotics competitions we are proposing, we decided
to add an already existing competition.",Robotics,6
"this would allow participants of these competitions
to enter their already-built robot a second time for another chance to compete.",Robotics,6
"the following
are competitions we have considered:
• trinity fire fighting robotics challenge
• sparkfun autonomous vehicle challenge
• drone racing
• vex robotics competition
• smart mouse maze competition
.. engineering design judging
for each event we decided there should be a judging section to augment the performance
of the robot in the competition.",Robotics,6
"for this, teams will have the opportunity to present their
engineering design process and their overall approach to the challenge they competed in.",Robotics,6
"we
outlined the following topics for teams to demonstrate for this judging:
• understanding - define the problem
• define - determine solution specifications

• ideas - generate concept solutions
• prototype - learn how your concepts work
• choose - determine a final concept
• refine - improved design
• implement - implement the detailed solution
• test - does the solution work?",Robotics,6
• iterate - are there changes between iterations?,Robotics,6
"based off our research of other competitions and discussions with relevant parties we
decide that the best way for teams to demonstrate the factors listed above would be in the
form of a technical paper and a poster that would be reviewed before and during the event
respectively.",Robotics,6
additional details are available in the rules handbook.,Robotics,6
".. competition survey results
as mentioned before, our research and initial discussions with teams led us to discover
there was interest in a variety of competitions.",Robotics,6
"in order to accommodate these interests we
decided to create proposals for each.",Robotics,6
"however, if this event were ever to be hosted it would
be unrealistic to host all of the challenges we created in the first year, so we decided to choose
only three of them.",Robotics,6
"this decision was made with our advisors and was intended to focus
our proposal for a competitive robotics olympics.",Robotics,6
"in order to determine which three of the
competitions we should focus on we created a rubric that compared each of the challenges
we created.",Robotics,6
"this rubric considered the following factors:
• potential cost to competitors
• interest of potential participants
• resources required to host event

 conclusions and recommendations
this section outlines the conclusions and findings of this iqp.",Robotics,6
"it begins with an overview of
our conclusions based off the background research on other collegiate robotics competitions,
discussions with potential participants and sponsors, and interviews with key stakeholders
at wpi.",Robotics,6
"next we will give an overview of our selected competitions based off feedback from
interviews and survey results on drafted competitions.",Robotics,6
"we conclude by explaining how this
proposal fits within the greater wpi ecosystem and recommendations for future work.
. what we discovered
through background research on popular collegiate robotics competitions, discussions with
potential participants and corporate sponsors, and stakeholders at wpi we discovered several
key points about hosting a robotics competition:
• based on our research we identified that successful competitions typically have been
around for many years, are audience friendly, and are based on real-world problems.",Robotics,6
"• our initial interviews showed that potential participants had a wide range of interests
prompting us to develop proposals for several competitions in the context of hosting
them at wpi.",Robotics,6
"• after developing these proposals and discussions with wpi stakeholders, such as the
robotics resource center, we decided it was unrealistic to host all seven of the chal-
lenges we initially proposed.",Robotics,6
"• surveying potential participants on each of these proposed events helped to determine
which were both the most popular and feasible, for both the competing university,
students, and sponsors.",Robotics,6
"as
such, three of the seven proposed challenges in section .. were selected:
• indoor drone challenge
• warehouse swarm challenge
• miniature fire fighting challenge
these challenges provide a good balance between feasibility and the resources required
for wpi to host, potential participant interest, and the resources required to enter.",Robotics,6
"they
also help develop skills that are highly relevant in the robotics industry, and experience with
them would put participants at an advantage when seeking a job.",Robotics,6
".. indoor drone challenge
the first of the selected challenges is the indoor drone challenge.",Robotics,6
"this challenge would task
participating teams to build a miniature autonomous drone to transport packages from a
pickup location to a destination.",Robotics,6
"this is designed to simulate tasks that companies like uber
and amazon are building full-sized drones for.",Robotics,6
"this miniature scale of this competition is
important because it means that:
• low cost to host - one of the largest benefits of an indoor drone challenge is the
low cost to host.",Robotics,6
"the resources required to host this competition are as follows: a 
by  by  foot indoor netted space, cardboard boxes to be used as obstacles, and a
grid on the floor made from tape and plywood.",Robotics,6
"• low cost of entry - for those looking to enter this challenge, the cost to entry is
relatively low due to the high availability of parts.",Robotics,6
"it is estimated that teams would
have to spend between $ and $, on hardware, depending on the size of the
drone, the compute modules chosen, and selected sensors.",Robotics,6
"• marketable skills - for this challenge, the skills developed are mostly software-based.",Robotics,6
"these skills include computer vision, obstacle avoidance, and advanced autonomous
navigation.",Robotics,6
"mechanical skills are also developed, such as designing impact-resistant
systems and with general computer aided design.",Robotics,6
"• spectator value - highest among all selected challenges is the spectator value of
drones.",Robotics,6
"for example, drone racing has grown to become highly popular in the last
few years with it expected to keep growing as companies such as espn beginning to
broadcast it [].",Robotics,6
".. warehouse swarm challenge
the warehouse swarm challenge would task participating teams to create both a hardware
and software platform for five robots to interact with a miniature warehouse and pick up
and deliver packages from and to specified locations.",Robotics,6
"this challenge was chosen because:
• low cost to host - as with the indoor drone challenge, the warehouse swarm challenge
also has a low cost to host.",Robotics,6
"the resources need are as follows: up to  by  foot
indoor space and several boards with miniature packages and shelves to simulate the
warehouse.",Robotics,6
"• low cost of entry - again like the indoor drone challenge, this challenge has a low
cost of entry for participating teams.",Robotics,6
"the hardware required are all fairly simple, with
components readily available.",Robotics,6
"it is estimated that teams would have to spend between
$, and $, on hardware, depending on the complexity of mechanisms, sensors,
and compute modules.",Robotics,6
"• multi-robot challenge - this challenge satisfies the interest we had for a multi-robot
competition with the potential of collaboration with other teams possible.",Robotics,6
"• marketable skills - skills developed through participation in this challenge are both
mechanical and software based.",Robotics,6
".. miniature fire fighting challenge
the miniature fire fighting challenge would task participating teams with creating robots to
seek out and extinguish a flame on a small table-top field.",Robotics,6
"it was primarily chosen because it
would allow existing participants of the trinity fire fighting competition have their robots
compete for a second time.",Robotics,6
"this challenge would also have the following benefits:
• low cost to host - as with the other two proposed challenges, the miniature fire
fighting challenge has a low cost to host.",Robotics,6
"the resources required to host this competi-
tion are as follows: a  by  foot indoor space and several boards with the layouts
described in the rules handbook.",Robotics,6
• low cost of entry - this challenge has a low cost of entry for participating teams.,Robotics,6
"the hardware required are all fairly simple, with components readily available.",Robotics,6
"it
is estimated that teams would have to spend between $ and $, on hardware,
depending on the complexity of mechanisms, sensors, and compute modules.",Robotics,6
"• low difficulty - this challenge was originally targeted at high school students, so the
expected technical difficulty is low.",Robotics,6
"• marketable skills - skills developed through participation in this challenge are both
mechanical and software based.",Robotics,6
"the actual execution of our proposed competition was not in the scope of
this iqp so an actual committee should be formed to execute the event for the first time.",Robotics,6
"this
committee would ideally include key members from offices of touchtomorrow, corporate
engagement, the events office, and the robotics resource center as well as professors from
the robotics program who are experts in the technical and educational aspects robotics.",Robotics,6
"the earliest this event could happen would be during touchtomorrow , with the rules
and competition being announced no later than june of .",Robotics,6
"this would give universities
enough time to form teams, get funding, and build a competing robot.",Robotics,6
"i have always strived to complete all tasks in my life by embracing the 
firm promise from god that “i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me” 
(philippians :, king james version).",Robotics,6
"having faith in my divine creator and heavenly father 
has made this process come to fruition and may he receive all the praise and glory for giving me 
the strength to be successful.",Robotics,6
"next, i would like to recognize my father and mother (farley wayne and linda caroline 
neece) for always being a pillar of continual encouragement and support in my life.",Robotics,6
"i cannot put 
into words my sincere appreciativeness for them always being there to meet my every need and 
influencing me to strive to work hard to reach my full potential.",Robotics,6
"i would like to extend my thanks to dr. kurt michael, the chair of my dissertation 
committee, for seeing my potential and guiding me to completion of my doctoral journey.",Robotics,6
"i have 
been blessed by his upbeat and enthusiastic personality as he has motivated me to do my very 
best work and continually stay encouraged until the very end.",Robotics,6
"i also thank dr. travis bradshaw, 
my committee member, for his encouragement and support throughout this process.",Robotics,6
"also, i thank the 
staff of the svcc upward bound program (i.e.",Robotics,6
"karen hudson, terri mosley, stephanie 
breeding, mark england, jeff vanhoozier, and george and jane rasnake) for believing in me to 
attain my educational potential.",Robotics,6
i would also recognize dr. sexton burkett for his assistance.,Robotics,6
"the scenarios highlighted in this work 
illustrated how costs play a role in protection using knowledge as a countermeasure and 
found the most cost-effective solutions using the same model used by ponemon().",Social engineering,7
"v 
 
this analysis may help companies develop efficient ways to protect themselves from 
social engineering attacks while efficiently managing resources in the social engineering 
realm.",Social engineering,7
"this arises from the impact of such operations, 
whether it has improved or worsened the life of the people in the community.",Social engineering,7
"but sadly, this is less practised in the delivery of construction projects.",Social engineering,7
"pavez 
and alarcon () observed that most construction management methods 
focus more on the contract and project with little or no concern on the social 
elements that relate to the people and the community.",Social engineering,7
"globally, there are now laws and regulations encouraging the built 
environment sector to move towards social value creation.",Social engineering,7
"for instance, in the 
usa, we have the energy policy act of  and the energy independent and 
security act of ; in the uk, the inequality and diversity act of  and the 
public services (social value) act ; within the eu, there is the sustainable 
procurement directive  among others.",Social engineering,7
"even with these, the current 
understanding and conceptualisation of social value, especially in the context of 
delivering a construction project, still remains unclear.",Social engineering,7
"for instance, the term 
corporate social responsibility (csr) and shared value are sometimes used to 
mean social value.",Social engineering,7
"although georgeson, () criticised such narrow 
perception on social value, it shows the concept is not yet well understood in the 
construction industry sector.",Social engineering,7
"it has been reported in the uk, australia and the usa that construction is 
the sector showing the least commitment to social value creation (villeneuve-
simth and chung, ; kernot and mcneill ; barraket et al., ; clark 
and ucak, ).",Social engineering,7
"however, loosemore () argues that the construction 
industry is well positioned for delivering social value objectives from its 
operations.",Social engineering,7
"for example, the construction industry is the world’s largest 
employer; largest employer of youths and it has the capacity to create local jobs 
in the communities of operation (loosemore, a).",Social engineering,7
"despite these 
opportunities, the concept of social value is yet to receive attention from 
construction management researchers (loosemore, a).",Social engineering,7
"according to 
dreveland and lohne (), lack of clear understanding of value (and its 
associated concepts such as social value) could make detailed discussion on it 
difficult, and invariably, its application and practice would be limited.",Social engineering,7
"in recent times, the lean construction approach has shown to be a viable 
means of creating value and minimising waste on construction projects 
(bertelsen, ; koskela, ).",Social engineering,7
"previous studies have also explored and 
shown links between lean construction and sustainable practices (johnsen and 
dreveland, ; fuenzalida et al., ; maris and parrish, ; wu and 
wang, ; huovila and koskela ).",Social engineering,7
"however, very limited studies have 
explored the role of lean construction approach as a means to creating ‘social 
value’ in the built environment.",Social engineering,7
"also, there is generally less discussion on social 
value in construction management literature (loosemore, ), and recent 
reports indicate that social value awareness is still low (burke and king; ; 
social value act, review, ).",Social engineering,7
"this study was therefore undertaken to unravel the current knowledge 
surrounding social value through a critical literature review.",Social engineering,7
"the study presents

findings from a review of the literature on the current knowledge surrounding 
‘social value' and its drivers.",Social engineering,7
"it discusses the relationship between social value, 
csr and shared value.",Social engineering,7
"additionally, this study aims to show how the lean 
production concept of ""customer"" could be used to support social value 
realisation in the delivery of construction projects.",Social engineering,7
"the key research questions 
addressed are:  
() what is the current understanding surrounding social value delivery?",Social engineering,7
"() how can lean approach support the realisation of social value delivery 
on construction projects?",Social engineering,7
"this paper extends the on-going debate around social value from construction 
management and lean construction perspectives and contributes to the literature 
on social value in construction management.",Social engineering,7
"more importantly, it creates a new 
insight into how social value can be realised in construction project delivery 
using lean production philosophy.",Social engineering,7
"the paper is structured thus; the first section 
discusses the current knowledge surrounding social value.",Social engineering,7
"the section examines 
the concept of social value, the need for social value, its current drivers and the 
relationship between social value, shared value and csr.",Social engineering,7
"the second section 
examines the role of lean approaches in delivering social value on construction 
projects.",Social engineering,7
"research method 
the use of literature review in understanding current knowledge and creating 
new insight for future research agenda is growing in medical sciences, 
management sciences and more importantly in construction management 
research (naoum and egbu, ; tranfield et al., ; gant and booth, 
).",Social engineering,7
"in order to explore the current knowledge around social value and 
provide an insight into the on-going debate from construction management and 
lean construction perspectives, a critical literature review approach was adopted.",Social engineering,7
"grant and booth, () confirmed that critical literature review allows for the 
synthesis of materials from different sources, allows for a degree of analysis and 
conceptual innovations, provides a conceptual contribution to existing body of 
knowledge and serves as a launch pad for new research.",Social engineering,7
"these attributes of 
critical review align with the focus of the current study.",Social engineering,7
"however, critical review approach has been viewed to be unsystematic 
(grant and booth, ).",Social engineering,7
"to overcome this in the current study, a review 
strategy was developed.",Social engineering,7
"purposive and snowballing sampling approach was 
adopted in selecting studies included in the review (bryman, ; sanders, 
).",Social engineering,7
"purposive sampling approach enables the researcher to select the 
population (articles or studies) that are relevant in answering the research 
questions.",Social engineering,7
"the goal here is not in the quantitative or statistical analysis of the 
studies, rather it is in the interpretative analysis of the study included.",Social engineering,7
"this 
means the focus of the literature search would not be rigid as in systematic 
reviews (tranfield et al., ).",Social engineering,7
"this approach allows a search of as many 
sources as possible and to identify relevant materials that answer the research 
question.",Social engineering,7
"grant and booths, () argued that the essence of a critical review 
is not in quality assessment of the studies, but to interpretively analyse the 
studies included and provide a conceptual contribution.",Social engineering,7
"the focus of the current 
study is to make a conceptual contribution to the current knowledge around

social value from construction management and lean construction perspectives 
through interpretive analysis of the studies included in the review in order to 
answer the research questions.",Social engineering,7
"additionally, sanders et al., () show that 
the snowballing approach is used when it is difficult to identify the members of 
the proposed population for the study from the onset.",Social engineering,7
"in this study, snowballing 
approach was used to identify other relevant articles and materials through a 
close examination of the reference lists and bibliographies of already identified 
relevant studies.",Social engineering,7
"the population for the study was literature that focuses on social value and 
lean in mainstream management science, construction management and lean 
construction.",Social engineering,7
"in achieving this, a robust literature search protocol that selects 
publications based on source and its relationship to the study research question 
was developed.",Social engineering,7
"this includes combining key terms from the study and 
subsequently searching on databases, perusing of the identified paper abstract 
and snowballing of relevant study reference lists and bibliographies.",Social engineering,7
"through this 
process, relevant materials that align with the research question were identified 
and critically reviewed.",Social engineering,7
"a search of the literature was done using online databases; emerald, 
elsevier, scopus, google scholar, willey online, taylor and francis online.",Social engineering,7
"in 
addition, peer review articles from the international group for lean group for 
lean construction (iglc) publications and relevant materials that answer the 
research questions were identified.",Social engineering,7
"the search was conducted between january 
and december .",Social engineering,7
"a number of terms and combination of terms that align 
with the topics were used in the search.",Social engineering,7
"the articles reviewed were those published in 
english language and that align with the topic.",Social engineering,7
"however, it emerged from the search that not much had been documented 
on the social value on some of these databases and journals especially in 
relation to construction project delivery.",Social engineering,7
"for instance, a purposive search on the 
term ""social value"" in the journal of construction management and economics 
revealed only  papers.",Social engineering,7
"again, this confirms that the concept of social value is 
still at an infant stage in construction management literature (loosemore, 
a; ).",Social engineering,7
"as a consequence, the search was extended to include 
government reports, technical reports and website materials on social value.",Social engineering,7
"this was done to gain an in-depth understanding of the current debate around 
social value and to ensure no available relevant materials were omitted.",Social engineering,7
"a total 
of  studies were critically reviewed.",Social engineering,7
"current knowledge surrounding social value 
the concept of social value 
there is a lack of absoluteness in the definition of ‘social value’.",Social engineering,7
"according to 
choi et al., () social value is complex to define due to its intricate and 
subjective nature.",Social engineering,7
"nevertheless, various reports and research publications have 
page  of 

engineering, construction and architectural management

attempted to offer definitions and explanations on the concept of “social value” 
as presented in table .",Social engineering,7
"the table presents the definitions of social value and 
the emerging themes found from the several definitions.",Social engineering,7
"the publications in 
table  are categorised into two; government publications (non-research 
publications) and research publications.",Social engineering,7
"analysis of the definitions and emerging 
themes from both government and research publications show that in order to 
create social value, every business should consider how its operation would 
improve the social, economic, and environmental well-being of the communities 
where they execute their business.",Social engineering,7
"applying this to construction, loosemore and 
hoggin, () reiterate that the goal of construction firms, therefore, should 
not only be to make profits and improve productivity for its stakeholders, but it 
should include engaging and improving the communities where they build.",Social engineering,7
"notwithstanding, table  confirms the previous assertions that there is no 
absolute definition of social value (loosemore, ; choi et al, ).",Social engineering,7
"for 
instance, from the government publications, it can be seen that social enterprise 
uk (seuk) views social value as ‘thinking' on how scarce resource should be 
used, which is too broad.",Social engineering,7
"on the other hand, the social value definition provided 
by hmrc was definite on three elements (social, economic and the environment) 
as the focus of creating social value.",Social engineering,7
"it is worth remarking that the need for sv 
measurement was highlighted in most of the research publications' definitions.",Social engineering,7
"but this was not clearly mentioned in government publications' definitions of 
social value.",Social engineering,7
"this could be due to the empirical nature of the research 
publication studies and the increasing understanding of the need for measuring 
the social impact of an organisation's operations.",Social engineering,7
"in addition to social value 
measurement, some authors argued in their definitions that social value is 
beyond compliance with csr by organisations (loosemore, ; a).",Social engineering,7
"the 
emphasis on the need for measuring social value from the research publications 
shows that it is not sufficient to just include the social value in a contract; 
strategies for measuring it should also be put in place.",Social engineering,7
"furthermore, table  reveals that, despite the current understanding on 
social value, there is still no clear or single criterion for measuring social value 
(retolaza et al; ; loosemore and hoggin, ; choi et al, ).",Social engineering,7
"this 
means the criteria to be used in measuring or identifying social value and the 
additional benefits to be created as stated in some of the definitions of social 
value in table  could differ for different context and audience.",Social engineering,7
"it is no surprise 
choi et al., () assert that social value is very elusive compared to economic 
value as there is lack of objective approach to measuring its outcomes.",Social engineering,7
"according to burke and king, (), subjectivity in social outcome could limit 
objective measurement in social value, as situations and events could change in 
the process.",Social engineering,7
"this implies that there should be no prescriptive approach in defining the 
supposed additional benefits mentioned in the definition of social value above, 
rather, the nature of the stakeholders in the community, context, and situations 
should define the additional benefits expected from the process.",Social engineering,7
"the implication 
of this for construction organisations in the delivery of its project is that; the 
page  of 

engineering, construction and architectural management

social values to be created on a project should not be pre-determined outside 
the project environment, rather they should be identified through direct 
engagement with the stakeholders in the community.",Social engineering,7
"however, this is less 
practised by construction organisations.",Social engineering,7
"georgeson, () observed that 
traditionally, organisations use a top-down approach to decide what to provide 
for a community as part of their csr.",Social engineering,7
"however, this is contrary to the bottom-up 
approach advocated in social value practice.",Social engineering,7
"the need for delivering social value 
the need for delivering products and services with regard to the impact on the 
economy, the environment and social well-being of the community is increasing 
in every sector (choi et al., ; fernandes et al., ).",Social engineering,7
"according to ghazali, 
() organisations that do not care for the environment or contribute to the 
wellbeing of the community could have their services and products boycotted 
and image degraded.",Social engineering,7
"this suggests that companies can engage in the creation 
of social value to increase or improve their social image in the eyes of 
stakeholders.",Social engineering,7
"however, it has been observed that the commercial sector is 
reluctant to practice social value, as it is usually seen as a separate entity from 
an economic value (choi et al., ).",Social engineering,7
"this view is also supported by the 
separation theory (friedma , ), where companies are seen only as a 
contributing engine to the economic function with less attention to their social

"shared value is defined as ""policies and 
operati g practice that enhances the competitiveness of a company while 
simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities 
in which it operates"" (porter and kramer, ).",Social engineering,7
"both definitions show the 
intention to contribute to the economic and social conditions of the communities 
of their operations.",Social engineering,7

may not occur simultaneously as expected in shared value practice.",Social engineering,7

value has been viewed as an extension of csr (georgeson, ).",Social engineering,7
"social value, 
on the other hand, has been referred to ""as a wider non-financial impact of 
programmes, organisations, and interventions including the wellbeing of 
individuals and communities, social capital and the environment"" (wood and 
leighton ).",Social engineering,7
"the key difference between the two earlier definitions and social 
value is that social value is not directly tied to the financial gain that would 
accrue from the process.",Social engineering,7
"this implies that even when there is no obvious financial benefit, a social 
value could still be delivered, although this does not mean that social value does 
not result into financial benefits (pasquire and salvatierra-garrido, ).",Social engineering,7

instance, an organisation or corporation could reduce or abandon their 
commitment to csr and shared value practice if it is observed that the final 
outcome does not align with the company’s business model.",Social engineering,7

shared value have been criticised as a top-bottom approach to delivering 
community good (georgeson, ).",Social engineering,7

"however, delivering social value is a bottom-up 
approach.",Social engineering,7

the social value to be created.",Social engineering,7

from the product right from design through to the manufacturing or production 
stage.",Social engineering,7
"however, shah and ward, () cautioned that lean production should 
not be viewed as waste elimination alone, but, rather as an integrated process 
that considers both the product and the processes involved in developing the 
product.",Social engineering,7

product, but also on the processes that culminate in the development of the final 
product.",Social engineering,7
"sadly, this view is less upheld in the delivery of construction projects.",Social engineering,7
"according to kagioglou et al, () construction project delivery focuses more 
on the final product than on the processes involved in delivering it.",Social engineering,7
"the social 
value, on the other hand, emphasises the need for every construction project to 
critically consider the processes involved in the delivery of its final product with 
the goal of creating a positive influence on stakeholders in the community, the 
local economy and on the physical environment.",Social engineering,7
"in the toyota production 
system (tps), this entails recognising the problem that would impede flow in the 
production and incorporate it as a task in the production process (spear, ).",Social engineering,7
"this implies understanding the impact of a construction project on the local 
community, the local economy and the environment, and integrating them into 
the project execution process would support better value delivery from the 
construction project.",Social engineering,7
"from the foregoing, it could be argued that the lean production approach or 
view has more potential to support the achievement of social value delivery on 
construction project compared to the current traditional view that dominates 
construction project delivery.",Social engineering,7
"this is because the latter focuses more on the 
product than the process involved in delivering it (farag et al, ; ballard and 
howell; ; kagioglou et al, ).",Social engineering,7
"however, the view of likening the 
manufacturing industry (lean production) to the construction industry projects is 
not accepted by all.",Social engineering,7
"for example, gann, () opined that construction 
products are usually large and immobile; this implies that construction products 
are created at the point of consumption, unlike manufacturing where materials 
are fully produced in the factory before sending it to the market.",Social engineering,7

systems that use processing points and hand over partially completed work to 
the next customer.",Social engineering,7

the goal is to satisfy the next customer.",Social engineering,7
"however, the current understanding of a 
“customer” in construction project delivery focuses more on the paying client

and this view is too narrow.",Social engineering,7
"but in lean production, the customer also includes 
people who are on the production line.",Social engineering,7

delivery could be widened to include the local communities, the local economy 
and the physical environment where the project is undertaken.",Social engineering,7
"for instance, 
salvatierra-garrido and pasquire, () challenged the construction industry to 
move away from the project based context to a more global context that 
adequately considers the impact of construction operations on the wider 
customer or community.",Social engineering,7
"furthermore, spear and bowen, () from their 
study that explores the dna of the tps show the importance of identifying the 
customers on the production line so as to design the production system to suit 
them.",Social engineering,7
"this helps in the maintenance of a smooth flow in the production system 
and also shows the essence of considering the wider customer a construction 
project could impact.",Social engineering,7
"this view is also supported by an earlier call by ofori 
() that the construction industry should include consideration for the 
environment as the fourth objective of measuring project performance in 
addition to cost, quali y, and time.",Social engineering,7
"this entails embedding the culture of caring 
for the environment and people living in the environment.",Social engineering,7
"similarly, close and 
loosemore, () called on the construction industry to view the communities 
where they operate as an asset rather than a liability.",Social engineering,7

social value from a lean production perspective, the community and physical 
environment should be viewed as customers.",Social engineering,7
"despite this call, the construction 
industry has not really changed its approach to project performance 
measurement indicators.",Social engineering,7
"it could be argued that the non-consideration of social 
value as an activity that contributes to the achievement of project goals, could 
have contributed to lack of sv delivery on construction projects (porter and 
kramer, ).",Social engineering,7

argued that to deliver viable value in the built environment, effort should be 
extended to improve the social, economic and environmental well-being of the 
inhabitants during the design and delivery process.",Social engineering,7
"the importance of paying 
attention to the above-mentioned factors in construction project delivery cannot 
be over-emphasised as its absence usually leads to what awakul and ogunlana,

"interface conflict is a conflict that occurs between 
the internal project group and those outside the project such as the 
communities, and ngos situated around the project.",Social engineering,7

time overruns and even suspension of the project.",Social engineering,7

positive impact on community wellbeing, the loyalty of stakeholders, resource 
saving, and reduces resource depletion among others.",Social engineering,7

the production process.",Social engineering,7

local communities and physical environment as ""customers' in the delivery of 
their services so as to create value.",Social engineering,7

approach of construction project management (paz and alarcon, ; ballard 
and howell, ), which in no doubt limits social value creation.",Social engineering,7

transformation activities (input and output), with little or no attention on flow 
and value generating activities.",Social engineering,7

view focuses on the customer (koskela and howell, ).",Social engineering,7
"the tfv model 
provides a unique approach to support social value delivery on construction 
projects.",Social engineering,7
"the flow (f) in the tfv model means consideration for the flow in the 
production or construction process.",Social engineering,7
"according to koskela and ballard, () proper management of the 
relationships between these “process flows” is essential for the smooth running 
of the production system on site.",Social engineering,7
"in the delivery of social value on a construction 
project, various activities are interlinked and the relationships between these 
activities must be identified and managed for smooth flow.",Social engineering,7

condition and people are among “the process flow” conditions identified in the 
“flow view” for smooth workflow on construction projects.",Social engineering,7
"using the “flow view” 
lens for sv delivery, the “external condition” and “the people” could mean the 
physical environment and the people living in the community where the project 
is undertaken.",Social engineering,7
"studies have shown that construction activities have an impact on the 
external environment and people and as such, they should be adequately 
considered for successful project delivery (salvatierra-garrido and pasquire,

"this means to support the smooth flow of activities on 
the project, engagement and consideration for (this process flow conditions- 
external conditions and people) are essentials.",Social engineering,7
"this could entail identification 
with the stakeholders in the community to better understand where the project 
would best contribute to their social, economic and environmental needs.",Social engineering,7
"there 
is evidence that early engagement of the project team with the communities 
around the project to identify with their social, economic and environmental 
needs prevents disputes and conflicts from the communities around the project

planned on construction projects (ballard and howell, ).",Social engineering,7
"in practice the 
“push” approach could lead to site congestion, accident and pollution of the 
environment, thus reducing the achievement of social value delivery on the 
project.",Social engineering,7
"however, the “pull” approach which is the focus of “the process flows”, 
allows delivery of materials and commencement of tasks based on the real-time 
situation on site.",Social engineering,7
"this supports just-in-time delivery, thus reducing congestion 
on site.",Social engineering,7
"this means the ""pull"" approach has the potential to support sv delivery 
on a construction project as it helps in reducing congestions on site and 
environmental pollutions.",Social engineering,7
"the focus of the (v) “value generation view” in the tfv model is to create 
value from the customer’s perspective (koskela, ).",Social engineering,7
"it must be noted that 
the term customer as used here is not limited to the paying client alone who is 
seen as the internal customer, rather, it includes both the internal customers 
(client) and external customers (local community and the environment).",Social engineering,7
"although, the concept of value generation from the customer perspective has 
been in production for many decades (shewhart, ); the construction 
industry is yet to embrace this concept in its practices.",Social engineering,7
"one of the key principles 
in the “value generation view” is to ensure customer requirements are satisfied 
(koskela, ).",Social engineering,7
"according to koskela and howell, (), the decision-making 
process that supports value generation view should be decentralised and all the 
stakeholders in the development process should be given a clear say.",Social engineering,7
"this 
means, in adopting the “value generation view” to support social value delivery 
on construction projects, the management of the construction process should 
include consideration both for the internal and external customers by engaging 
them in some of the decision making process.",Social engineering,7
"georgson, () asserted that 
social value is built on ""bottom-top"" approach so as to allow the customers make 
an input in the decision process.",Social engineering,7
"this clearly aligns with the “value generation 
view” in the tfv model.",Social engineering,7
"this means the value generation view in the tfv model 
could empower the local communities where construction projects are 
undertaken to make an input by identifying activities that would improve the life 
of the people around the project.",Social engineering,7
"in reality “the bottom top approach” requires 
construction organisations to consult with the community (customer) in the 
design and delivery of its operations so as to create high impact social value.",Social engineering,7
"however, koskela and vrijhoef, () found that the ""bottom-top"" approach is 
absent in construction project management and this hinders innovation in 
construction project delivery.",Social engineering,7
"also, the “value generation view” empowers those doing the work to 
contribute to the production process on site as advocated in the last planner 
system (lps) (ballard, ).",Social engineering,7
"in the lps, each trade in the construction process 
is viewed as a customer and allowed to make an input to the production process 
on site (ballard and tommelein, ).",Social engineering,7
"according to ballard, (); ballard and 
tommelein, () the lps process contributes to the development of a reliable 
and predictable plan.",Social engineering,7
"however, its implementation is still fragmented and recent 
studies tend to report that its crucial elements are not fully implemented on 
construction projects (daniel et al., ).",Social engineering,7
"nevertheless, the use of the lps in 
managing project production on construction projects is on the increase due to 
its capacity to manage complex relationships and develop a predictable plan 
through collaborative planning (lci, ; daniel et al., ; ballard and 
tommelein, ).",Social engineering,7
"fernandez-solis et al, () found that the lps has been

implemented on over  projects with on-time delivery of construction projects.",Social engineering,7
"it could be argued that the on-time delivery of construction projects through the 
use of lps will not only benefit the client and main contractor, but also the local 
community around the project, the environment, and the local and national 
economy.",Social engineering,7
"for example, the environmental pollution, noise pollution, road 
congestion etc.",Social engineering,7
"that could arise from such construction activities would be 
eliminated quickly.",Social engineering,7
"this shows that the application of lps; a lean construction 
approach, would support the achievement of sv delivery on a construction 
project.",Social engineering,7
"search in lean principles 
womack and jones, () found that in delivering products and services based 
on lean principles, identification of value from the customer perspective should 
be among the core principles to be observed.",Social engineering,7
"the lean production approaches for 
delivering value identified in womack and jones, () include: () identify 
customers and specify the value () identify and map the value stream () 
create flow by eliminating waste () respond to customer pull () pursue 
perfection.",Social engineering,7
"from the lean principles above, to identify customers in the context 
of construction project delivery could mean to identify the elements that make 
up the communities with a view to specifying the value from their perspective.",Social engineering,7
"delivering value from lean project production perspective supports the reduction 
of non-value adding activities; improves transparency and collaboration 
(johnsen and dreveland, ; fuenzalida et al., ; maris and parrish, ; 
wu and wang, ; huovila and koskela ).",Social engineering,7
"additionally, responding to customer “pull” as advocated in lean production 
could mean the customer/communities receive what they require at the right 
time, in the right quality and quantity.",Social engineering,7
"this would certainly curtail the 
emergence of interface conflict on projects (awakul and ogunlana, ); thus, 
supporting the social value delivery of projects.",Social engineering,7
"the pull principle that supports continuous improvements, offers opportunities 
for construction organisations to reflect on the feedback received from the 
communities on the social value delivered.",Social engineering,7
"through such feedbacks, the social 
value created can be improved upon in the future.",Social engineering,7
"table  further shows the link 
between lean principles and social delivery in a construction project.",Social engineering,7
"insert table  here: 
 
 one of the key goals of lean is to satisfy the stakeholder or customer 
requirement (shah and ward, ; koskela, ).",Social engineering,7
"it is worth noting that 
stakeholders, as used here, refer to both internal and external stakeholders 
(awakul and ogunlana, ).",Social engineering,7
"however, the best approach to achieving the 
stakeholder requirement as advocated in lean is by consulting with the 
stakeholder.",Social engineering,7
"khodeir and othman, () observed that this lean principle of

encourages consultation with the local people community (external stakeholder)

improving the quality of life in the local communities where they operate and 
those of its employees.",Social engineering,7
"however, this is often overlooked (womack and jones, 
).",Social engineering,7
"additionally, khodeir and othman, () pointed out that providing 
equal job opportunities and future job prospects for the employees (internal 
stakeholders) would enhance the achievement of social value with regard to the 
meeting the requirements of the internal stakeholders.",Social engineering,7
"the use of standardised processes and lean techniques supports the 
achievement of social value delivery (govindan et al, ; faulkner and 
badurdeen, ; piercy and rich, ; tezel et al, ).",Social engineering,7
"piercy and rich, 
() showed that the use of visual management (vsm) a lean technique 
support the better working condition which contributes to the achievement of 
high health and safety performance.",Social engineering,7
"similarly, tezel et al, () found that 
vsm and s enhance communication on construction site and improve health 
and safety practice in projects.",Social engineering,7
"this implies that a carefully planned production 
process and the application of lean construction techniques would contribute to 
the health and wellbeing of both internal and external stakeholders (govindan et 
al, ; faulkner and badurdeen, ; piercy and rich, ).",Social engineering,7
"in practice, 
the vsm could be used to communicate with the local community about future 
work notices that may cause some disturbance, road diversions, and planned 
road closures among others.",Social engineering,7
"this would reduce the impact of such activities on 
the social and wellbeing of the people in the community, thus contributing to 
social value delivery.",Social engineering,7
"also, the s would improve working condition of the 
workers on site through better ergonomics which could reduce stress.",Social engineering,7
"leon and 
amodio, () observed that lean principle improves working environment 
which in turn reduces stress.",Social engineering,7
"according to govindan et al, () and nahmens 
and ikuma, () standardised process not only reduces non-value adding 
activities, but it also supports social improvement on the workers.",Social engineering,7
"as shown in table  the lean principle of reducing cycle time and variability in 
the production process contribute to the achievement of sv delivery in 
construction projects (khodeir and othman, ).",Social engineering,7
"in order to reduce cycle time 
in material delivery and in sourcing for labour, these could be sourced locally 
from the local community.",Social engineering,7
"however, in reality, this practice not only reduces 
cycle time but it also; create job opportunity for the locals and contributes 
directly to the local economy; reduces pollution on the environment, as a result 
of the reduction in transportation of people and materials.",Social engineering,7
"all of these are 
evidence of sv generated as a result of the application of lean principles of 
reducing cycle time.",Social engineering,7
"finally, using the lean principle of reducing variability in the production process 
would support the use an integrated supply chain which would, in turn, minimise 
variability issues in the workforce and in the product and services delivered.",Social engineering,7

the aim of this paper is to explore the existing knowledge around social 
value and to evaluate how lean production philosophy could support the 
realisation of social value in construction project delivery.",Social engineering,7
"the study found that: 
 social value emphasises the need to critically consider and create a 
positive influence on the individual stakeholders in the community and on 
the physical environment.",Social engineering,7
"it connotes a shift from the traditional goal of 
getting the lowest cost or price to the goal of delivering satisfactory 
service/product to both the individual in the community and the physical 
environment in the community-especially in executing construction 
projects.",Social engineering,7
" freeman’s () integration theory shows that creation of social value 
should not be a separate operation from the economic value, rather, both 
should be incorporated and delivered as a system with the goal of 
influencing the society at large.",Social engineering,7
" the low commitment to the creation of social value by construction firms 
could have been influenced by the so-called ""separation theory"" 
postulated by friedman .",Social engineering,7
" the case for delivering social value is not with the legislation and 
regulation alone, rather, it includes other elements such as the business 
sense of it, global interest, and social value market opportunities among 
others that could support both private and public sectors (construction 
organisations) in delivering businesses in a more efficient way.",Social engineering,7
" the key difference between social value, csr and shared value is that, 
while csr and shared value use a top-bottom approach in delivering 
community good, social value uses a bottom-up approach.",Social engineering,7
" lean production philosophy supports the achievement of social value 
objectives in construction project delivery, as it helps construction 
organisations to conceptualise the communities and physical environment 
where they operate as their customers, rather than mere people and 
place.",Social engineering,7
"  the ""flow"" and ""value"" in the tfv support smooth workflow in the 
construction process and development of reliable construction programme 
through the application of the lps principles- a lean construction 
approach.",Social engineering,7
"conclusions 
the purpose of this study was to determine the current knowledge surrounding 
social value and to evaluate the role of lean production philosophy in achieving 
social value objectives in construction project delivery.",Social engineering,7
"the study establishes 
that the current level of awareness on social value is still low and there is a 
dearth of scholarly publications on social value, especially in construction 
management literature.",Social engineering,7
"the study found that there is still no clear or single 
criterion for measuring social value delivered.",Social engineering,7
"this means the criteria to be used 
in measuring or identifying social value could differ for different contexts and 
audiences.",Social engineering,7

"the lean production approach enables construction organisations to 
conceptualise the community and the physical environment where they operate 
as their customers, rather than mere people, places and things.",Social engineering,7
"this further 
encourages their commitment to the delivery of social value to the local 
community and physical environment around their construction projects.",Social engineering,7
"additionally, the “flow” and “value” views in the tfv model support smooth 
workflow in the construction process and in the development of reliable 
construction programme.",Social engineering,7
"this contributes to the on-time delivery of construction 
projects through the application of the lps principles, thus, enhancing the 
positive contribution of a project to the society, the environment and economy.",Social engineering,7
"the tudy reveals that the separation theory propagated by friedman, 
(), tends to separate social value from economic value, thus making 
organisations care less about delivering social value.",Social engineering,7
"however, this view was 
challenged by freeman, () in his integrated theory.",Social engineering,7
"this implies that 
construction organisations should not view the creation of social value as a 
separate operation from the economic value, rather, both should be incorporated 
and delivered as a system with a goal of influencing the society at large.",Social engineering,7
"the 
results of this investigation show that the current driver for social value delivery 
is not only the legislation but also, its business imperative, the global interest in 
social value, the opportunities for social investment and the business sense in 
delivering social value.",Social engineering,7
"this implies the commitment to the delivery of social 
value on construction projects or organisations should not be seen as a tick box 
exercise that is compliance driven since there are other benefits such as the 
business sense of doing it.",Social engineering,7
"the investigation confirms that there is a relationship between csr, shared 
value and social value.",Social engineering,7
"however, csr and shared value are not the same as 
social value.",Social engineering,7
"the study found that while csr and shared value use a top-down 
approach in making decisions on the nature of support to be provided for the 
community, social value decisions are made based on the customers' perspective 
(the communities) through an all-inclusive conversation and engagement with 
stakeholders.",Social engineering,7
"the study concludes that conceptualising the community and 
physical environment around the construction project using the lean concept of 
customer and tfv model would support social value realisations in the delivery 
of construction projects.",Social engineering,7
"this study is based on literature review evidence and 
the findings serve as a foundation on which future studies can be built upon.",Social engineering,7
"obtaining empirical evidence on social value practice with the aim of developing 
an approach for evidencing social value in construction project delivery will form 
the next stage of the research by the authors.",Social engineering,7
"while hackers target loop holes in 
technology, social engineers manipulate humans to access information that cannot be easily accessed.",Social engineering,7
"social 
engineers exploit human feelings and thoughts through fear, curiosity, greed and sympathy (alexander, ).",Social engineering,7
"they capitalize on the psychology of people’s expect and tendency to help others (jones, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"se attacks 
come in various forms ranging from telephone calls and email requesting personal information from what appears 
to be a legitimate source or text message (parrish jr, bailey, & courtney, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"there are two main types 
of se attacks, the targeted and target of opportunity (bullée, montoya, pieters, junger & hartel, ).",Social engineering,7
"a targeted 
attack is the one in which the attacker is very specific in terms of the victim while a target of opportunity attack is 
the one in which the attacker distributes to a lot of people hoping to get response from as many victims as possible.",Social engineering,7
"se usually involves two stages, the location, and the psychological method used.",Social engineering,7
"the location is where the attack 
takes place.",Social engineering,7
"this could be online, at work place or over the telephone.",Social engineering,7
"the second phase involves using different 
psychological methods to manipulate a victim.",Social engineering,7
"it includes exploitation of asserted authority, people’s commitments 
and strong relationships.",Social engineering,7
"the exploitation can come in form of manipulating people’s tendency to help, 
reciprocation, liking and similarity (jones, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"irrespective of the method used, the goal of a social engineer 
is to gain access to desired information by manipulating the victim without the victim’s awareness.",Social engineering,7
information is of great importance to governments and organizations.,Social engineering,7
"there has been a rise in information security 
violations with attempts to get sensitive information by illegal access.",Social engineering,7
"organizations invest a lot in technical 
solutions to prevent information theft.",Social engineering,7
"humans often react to emotions which makes them more 
vulnerable than machines (mouton, et al., , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"mouton also noted that an organization’s biggest threat 
is not technical protection but the people working in the organization.",Social engineering,7
"attackers find it easier to gain unauthorized 
access through people rather than penetrating the security system (mouton, leenen, et al., , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"several 
organizations tend to use training solutions and raising awareness through warnings about social engineering 
attacks.",Social engineering,7
"these methods have generally been proven to be ineffective (junger, montoya, & overink, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"proceedings of the th australian information security management conference () 
this is likely because most training around social engineering are based on detecting electronic threats such as the 
phishing attack and avoiding malware downloads which can be easy to manage.",Social engineering,7
"however, the human-based social 
engineering attack which has been neglected poses more threats to the organization (hadnagy, ).",Social engineering,7
"in this paper 
we report exploratory pilot study research into personality type as an antecedent for human behaviour and adopt 
the research question “what individual’s personality traits is more susceptibility to social engineering attacks?” 
the following propositions were developed from the literature reviewed.",Social engineering,7
"p: each personality trait of the big five model are susceptible to different types of social 
engineering attack.",Social engineering,7
p: a user’s personality trait will increase the user’s susceptibility to social engineering attack.,Social engineering,7
"background literature 
orgill et al.",Social engineering,7
"investigated user’s susceptibility to se attacks by posing as a computer support engin eer 
from the organization asking for personal information such as username and passwords with the disguise 
of performing vulnerability auditing on the network.",Social engineering,7
"it was discovered that % of the people gave their 
username and % provided their password (orgill, romney, bailey, & orgill, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"also, the  
result showed that isolated users were easier to manipulate than those in groups.",Social engineering,7
"furthermore, the effect 
of peer pressure and authority had significant influence on the likelihood of user’s suscepti bility to se.",Social engineering,7
"conducted an e-mail based social engineering attack study to raise awareness and assess 
the threat of social engineering attacks on it systems (bakhshi, papadaki, & furnel l, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"an 
experimental website was created and email with embedded link to website was sent out to employees.",Social engineering,7
the result indicated that about  percent of the employees followed the link.,Social engineering,7
"a similar study by jagatic 
et al.",Social engineering,7
focused on phishing on social networks.,Social engineering,7
"the research was done on university students and the 
result indicated that the students were highly susceptible to fishing attack.",Social engineering,7
the result of these studies shows how vulnerable an organization can be to social engineering attacks.,Social engineering,7
"one of the ways to deal with social engineering attacks is to understand why individuals fall for this 
attack and then to provide training as a countermeasure.",Social engineering,7
"a successful se attack can be determined by 
the extent to which the victim is able to resist manipulation or be able to detect the attack (uebelacker 
& quiel, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"one of the ways of understanding what qualities makes people more susceptible 
to se attacks more than others is in using behavioural or personality models.",Social engineering,7
"personality models help 
to understand what makes people think and respond the way they do.",Social engineering,7
"personality from a psychological 
perspective is defined as a state when a person’s thoughts, feelings and behavioural patterns are 
relatively stable (uebelacker & quiel, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"understanding the relationship between individuals 
and information security is particularly useful in forecasting an individual’s ability to maintain 
information security standards and policies (shropshire, warkentin, johnston, & schmidt, , p. 
).",Social engineering,7
there are multiple approaches to personality dimensions.,Social engineering,7
"several models have been developed 
to identify different types of personality traits such as the five factor model (the big five).",Social engineering,7
"the big five is 
coherent and scientific as it defines personalities along a continuum rather that in categories or types.",Social engineering,7
"it 
gives room for different types of behaviour in different circumstance.",Social engineering,7
"table  briefly 
describes the big five traits.",Social engineering,7
"test set up 
a researcher’s perspective and assumptions of what constitutes truth and knowledge constructs the way we see 
ourselves, other people and the society around us.",Social engineering,7
"these views and beliefs are referred to as a paradigm (cypress, 
).",Social engineering,7
"schwandt defined paradigm as a shared world view that represents the beliefs and values in a discipline 
and that guides how problems are solved.",Social engineering,7
"a paradigm can help clarify research questions and help in research 
design.",Social engineering,7
this research will employ a qualitative non-experimental method to answer the research question.,Social engineering,7
"the 
methods fit context-based research that will provide insight into and allow capturing other people’s perspective of 
real-life situations.",Social engineering,7
"a qualitative research approach is best suited for a study that serves the purpose of description, 
interpretation, verification, and evaluation of behaviour (peshkin, ).",Social engineering,7
"also, qualitative research generally seeks 
to answer the what, how and why question rather than how much or how many (cypress, ).",Social engineering,7
"this best suits 
this study where a constructivism approach has been chosen with the underlying view that there is no single reality 
to be found, and knowledge is gained interactively (chilisa & kawulich, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"data is collected through a purposive, semi-structured, expert interview.",Social engineering,7
"interview methods give voice to people, 
which allows them to freely present their life situations in their own words, and provide personal interaction 
between the researchers and their subjects (kvale, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"also, interview research methods are more 
powerful tools for obtaining narrative data that allows researchers to investigate people's views in greater depth 
compared to questionnaires and surveys.",Social engineering,7
"in particular, expert interview is concerned about the participant’s 
knowledge and experiences as a result of their actions, roles, responsibilities or obligations within a specific 
organization or institution (littig & vienna, ).",Social engineering,7
"expert interviews are more efficient and concentrated way of 
gathering quick quality data than using observation and surveys (bogner, littig, & wolfgang, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"an 
expert in this sense is a person with insight in aggregated or specific knowledge (albladi & weir, ).",Social engineering,7
"also an 
important consideration in qualitative research is determining the sample size.",Social engineering,7
"the determination of qualitative 
sample size is challenging one that is based on different study designs and contextual considerations (turner-
bowker et al., , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"contrary to a quantitative research approach where the sample size can be calculated 
using statistical techniques, qualitative sample size is calculated by the number of participants that will be needed 
to attain saturation (glaser, strauss, & strutzel, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"the concept of saturation emerges when no more 
data are being found.",Social engineering,7
"in this study the number five was chosen from participants who had experienced on social 
engineering attack, and hence were classed knowledgeable of the phenomena and hence a quicker saturation point 
was reached for the pilot study.",Social engineering,7
the thematic analysis was conducted using the nvivo software.,Social engineering,7
"results 
the interview and trait data was thematically analysed in nivo and is presented in the following two tables.",Social engineering,7
"table 
 presents an overview of the factors identified by participants that made them susceptible to se attacks based on 
their experience as a victim.",Social engineering,7
table  shows their personality traits.,Social engineering,7
"participant one 
believed the attack was successful because of a trusting relationship, love, or humour as a motivating factor.",Social engineering,7
"these 
findings are indications of extraversion and agreeableness traits which agrees with the participants personality 
result.",Social engineering,7
"participant two believed it was desperation of finding a job and trust in other people’s feedback that made 
the se attack successful.",Social engineering,7
these traits are indications of conscientiousness and agreeableness.,Social engineering,7
"however, the 
participant’s personality test result does not indicate that.",Social engineering,7
"the third participant believed it was the fear of being 
locked out of personal account and not having access to money as well as lack of training and proper education as 
at that time that made the se attack successful.",Social engineering,7
these traits are indications of agreeableness and neuroticism.,Social engineering,7
"the 
participant believes in compliance and being loyal as well as fearful of losing personal money.",Social engineering,7
"this does not totally 
agree with the personality result.",Social engineering,7
"the fourth participant believed it was pressure from authority, the ease and 
comfort as well as cost savings that made the se attack successful.",Social engineering,7
"these are indications of agreeableness and 
proceedings of the th australian information security management conference () 
conscientiousness.",Social engineering,7
this is also contrary to the result from the participant’s personality test.,Social engineering,7
"the last participants 
indicated that money, curiosity and trusting positive feedback from others that led to the successful se attack.",Social engineering,7
"these traits are indications of openness, extroversion and agreeableness which are in line with participant’s result.",Social engineering,7
"from this study and the scenarios examined, the findings indicate that personality traits can determine the 
likelihood of se attack and users with some type of personality are more susceptible than others.",Social engineering,7
"while people 
with high score in agreeableness and extroversion trait are likely to be more susceptible to se attack, the likelihood 
of a successful se attack is not only dependent on the personality trait, it depends on the user’s circumstance and 
the attack technique of the attacker.",Social engineering,7
"though some types of personality traits have the tendency to be easily 
manipulated, if the attacker does not motivate them, the chances of a successful attack is low.",Social engineering,7
"also, the result 
indicated that people that are more trusting will likely be more susceptible because once your trust level increases, 
your guard falls.",Social engineering,7
"overall, it is believed that se attack is usually a targeted attack, and people who score high in 
agreeableness and extroversion are likely to fall victims more than other personality traits.",Social engineering,7

in answer to proposition : one of the participants suggested that lack of training and education is the main factor 
enhancing user’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks.",Social engineering,7
"it was believed that if users understand the traits to 
look out for irrespective of the technique used, the likelihood of susceptibility to se attack will be reduced.",Social engineering,7
"two 
of the participants believed it’s the user’s motivating factor that matters irrespective of technique that is been used 
if the user is not motivated the trick will not work on them.",Social engineering,7
"two other participants supported that it’s a synergy of 
the user’s motivating factor, attacker’s technique and chance.",Social engineering,7
"all the participants believed that personality is one 
of the reasons why people fall victim of social engineering attack.",Social engineering,7
"considering social engineering attack is a 
targeted attack which means the social engineers knows the class of people they want which are likely to fall 
victim.",Social engineering,7
this brings in personality profile.,Social engineering,7
"drawing from the data analysis, it was stated that the factors which 
serves as the motivation can vary from time to time depending on the user’s situation, however, the user’s 
personality is expected to be relatively constant.",Social engineering,7
"as this study is focused on examining the personality trait that is 
more susceptible to se attack the personality test followed the interviews.",Social engineering,7
"after the participants each explained 
the scenarios where they’ve been a victim of a social engineering attack and why they think things made them 
susceptible.",Social engineering,7
then they were asked to take the big five personality test.,Social engineering,7
"social engineers build their attack scenarios 
based on personality profiles.",Social engineering,7
"several attempts have been made to prevent these attacks with the use of technical 
solutions and raising awareness through warnings about social engineering attacks.",Social engineering,7
"however, these methods have 
generally been proven to be ineffective (junger et al., , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"this purpose of this study was therefore to 
examine what personality trait makes users more susceptible to se attack.",Social engineering,7
"these data were gathered from 
experiences of participants who understand how social engineering works and have once been a victim of a se 
attack.",Social engineering,7
"several user’s motivating factors were identified and the personality traits with the likelihood of increased 
susceptibility determined.",Social engineering,7
"the result is intended to contribute to the body of knowledge by informing individuals 
and organizations the kind of personality trait that are more prone to se attacks, this in turn provides a basis for 
identifying possible se techniques and initiating effective solutions through the decision making of user’s who are 
more susceptible to social engineering attack.",Social engineering,7
"conclusion 
the field of social engineering clearly needs further research especially in identifying the user’s susceptibility and 
to aid effective countermeasures.",Social engineering,7
"as the social engineering techniques become more sophisticated and the incident 
rate increases, it is important to provide effective measures.",Social engineering,7
"one of the potential measures is in examining a user’s 
susceptibility.",Social engineering,7
"when the users are aware of their se vulnerability, organizations will be able to measure their risk 
to social engineering and employ effective measures to counter these attacks according to the distinct identified 
user’s weakness.",Social engineering,7
"several studies have focused on testing the rate of the user’s susceptibility through phishing 
techniques.",Social engineering,7
"however, most of these studies have not focused on what attributes makes the user act the way they 
act.",Social engineering,7
"while there is literature focusing on the relationship between the user’s personality traits and their 
susceptibility rate to se attack, there is a discrepancy in existing literature on what individual personality traits 
make users susceptible to attack.",Social engineering,7
"the results reported in this paper suggest that users with high scores in 
agreeableness and extroversion traits are likely to be more susceptible to social engineering attack than others.",Social engineering,7
"we 
also identified moderating variables that included emotional state, the environment and motivations.",Social engineering,7
"these results 
are a useful start for further research into the impact of different social engineering attacks on different personality 
types.",Social engineering,7
"this has been an exploratory pilot study that has located the variables and focus for a quantitative 
exploration of the issue.",Social engineering,7

"finally, along with establishing strong 
foundations for future research in studying generations susceptibility to social 
engineering, this thesis employ these findings in proposing a framework aiming to lessen 
millennial likelihood to social engineering victimization.",Social engineering,7
"the originality of this study lies 
on its overall approach: starting with an exhaustive literature review towards identifying 
factors impacting generations' susceptibility level, then statistically measuring their 
vulnerability, to finish with a solution proposal crafted to suit the observed generational

"develops their feelings toward their professional social responsibilities as engineers, and how 
these values change over time, have been examined.",Social engineering,7
"this chapter will highlight the array of 
opinions and recent research into these areas.
. social responsibilities of the engineering profession
the engineering profession has a variety of ethical responsibilities to society and the environ-
ment.",Social engineering,7
this field of inquiry has recently been termed macroethics [].,Social engineering,7
"but these professional 
social responsibilities may be in tension with the business side of engineering [].",Social engineering,7
"the major-
ity of engineers work for businesses, whose primary motivation is often profit and corporate 
stockholders, rather than societal impacts.",Social engineering,7
"luckily, this has begun to change based on move-
ment toward corporate social responsibility (csr) and realizations that companies can thrive 
economically while considering social and environmental impacts (the triple bottom line).",Social engineering,7
"csr means that companies commit to principles of accountability to community stakehold-
ers, customers, suppliers, employees, and investors.",Social engineering,7
"csr often embraces ideas of sustainabil-
ity, including human rights and environmental issues, as well as a chain of responsibility and 
duty of care.",Social engineering,7
"engineering-focused companies often make their commitments to csr publicly 
available (e.g., bechtel []).",Social engineering,7
the characterization of engineering as a profession is also somewhat in tension.,Social engineering,7
"individual 
licensing of engineers promotes the notion of profession, but industrial exemptions in the 
licensing laws somewhat erode this independence from employers [].",Social engineering,7
"zhu and jesiek [] also 
question whether engineering is a profession in china, based on the lack of an explicit ethical 
code.",Social engineering,7
"it becomes clear when exploring the engineering profession that it should not be viewed 
as homogeneous, but rather consider that there are distinct cultures in this regard among dif-
ferent sub-disciplines and among countries.",Social engineering,7
"this section presents a few sub-topics related to social responsibility in engineering: human 
safety, environmental protection and sustainability, pro bono work, social justice, and diver-
sity.",Social engineering,7
"the extent to which these elements are included in professional codes of ethics, bodies 
of knowledge, and requirements for educating engineers are considered to reflect commonly 
held beliefs related to the social responsibilities of the engineering profession.",Social engineering,7
"further, what 
a professor chooses to teach engineering students in regards to professional social respon-
sibility has been interpreted as endorsement of the relevance of the topic to the engineering 
profession.",Social engineering,7
"for some topics there is general agreement across engineering sub-disciplines and 
individuals, while other social responsibilities are being actively debated.",Social engineering,7
".. human safety
public trust in engineering requires that the profession considers its impacts on human safety.",Social engineering,7
"there is widespread consensus in the codes of ethics of engineering professional societies 
worldwide that engineering has a primary duty to protect public safety, health, and wel-
fare [].",Social engineering,7
"engineering-related failures or problems that result in injuries or death are often 
social responsibility
front-page news (e.g., levee failures in new orleans, interstate bridge collapse in minnesota, 
ignition switches in cars) [, ].",Social engineering,7
"it is of concern that the accumulated impact of frequent news-
worthy incidents may over time erode public trust in engineering.",Social engineering,7
"although generally “bundled,” health, safety, and welfare each have particular nuances.",Social engineering,7
"vesilind [] notes that there may be instances when these three elements differ, both in fact 
and among the perceptions of various groups within the public.",Social engineering,7
"further, the public should 
not be viewed as a monolith, but rather engineers need to be aware of “diverse publics” with 
different needs and goals [, ].",Social engineering,7
"health is generally characterized as being able to function physically without pain, and may 
also include mental soundness.",Social engineering,7
"promoting health is a direct goal of biomedical engineer-
ing.",Social engineering,7
"environmental and civil engineers are tasked with providing clean drinking water and 
preventing the spread of toxic chemicals via air, water, and soil.",Social engineering,7
"chemical engineering is 
involved in manufacturing medicines, as well as pesticides and other chemicals that may 
have toxic effects.",Social engineering,7
"thinking specifically about health-related issues is perhaps less prevalent 
in other engineering disciplines.",Social engineering,7
"one challenge is the uncertainty that surrounds what is in 
fact protective of human health, given incomplete toxicological information and difficulties 
evaluating chronic effects (e.g., cancer).",Social engineering,7
"different countries have different paradigms regulat-
ing the development, distribution, and use of new chemicals with regards to the information 
that is required on human health effects, with some taking a more precautionary approach 
[].",Social engineering,7
"further, us drinking water regulations take into account both human health and treat-
ment costs.",Social engineering,7
"overall, engineers may disagree on what conditions sufficiently protect human 
health.",Social engineering,7
"safety is associated being protected from physical injuries or death, again considering risks.",Social engineering,7
"thus, civil engineering infrastructure that will be safe in the face of hurricanes or earthquakes, 
construction engineering to protect on-site workers, mechanical engineering of cars to pro-
tect occupants during crashes, etc.",Social engineering,7
"other engineering disciplines are also critically impor-
tant to safety but as sub-systems may garner less attention (such as software engineering 
for computer controls or electrical engineering).",Social engineering,7
"however, public safety broadly applies to 
all engineering disciplines.",Social engineering,7
"the international education association knowledge profile for a 
washington accord program includes “comprehension of… the professional responsibility 
of an engineer to public safety” [].",Social engineering,7
"disciplinary differences within engineering in the extent 
that students are taught about safety in their courses were found in a study of engineering 
educators; among ~ survey respondents (% from institutions in the us), % taught 
engineering/computing students about safety in their courses.",Social engineering,7
"however, this varied from % 
in chemical engineering to % in computing [].",Social engineering,7
"safety is included explicitly as a cognitive 
“cross-functional” outcome within the chemical engineering body of knowledge [].",Social engineering,7
"welfare relates to overall well-being, potentially inclusive of happiness, health, material 
wealth, and feelings of security.",Social engineering,7
"thus, welfare is more subjective than health or safety, and is 
correspondingly harder to measure.",Social engineering,7
"while protection of human or public welfare is a com-
mon statement in us codes of engineering ethics [, ], this term is not included in some 
international ethics codes [–].",Social engineering,7
"the australia code uses the term “wellbeing” in place of 
professional social responsibility in engineering


welfare [].",Social engineering,7
"the royal academy of engineering’s (rae) statement of ethical principles 
[] includes “public good,” separate from the “health and safety” paramountcy clause.",Social engineering,7
"the 
chemical engineering body of knowledge [] lists “concern for public welfare” among its 
affective domain outcomes.",Social engineering,7
"it is clear that engineers may have different notions of welfare 
than individuals within the public.",Social engineering,7
"vesilind [] gives the examples of engineers reducing 
speed limits on highways to  miles per hour to provide increased safety, but having the 
majority of the public believe their overall welfare was better served by higher limits that 
enabled them to reach their destinations more efficiently.",Social engineering,7
"there has been a recent debate about how engineers can best serve this most basic mandate to 
protect human health and safety.",Social engineering,7
"one environmental scientist/engineer, sedlak, accused oth-
ers of “crossing the line” from dispassionate researcher to being activists [].",Social engineering,7
"sedlak (trained 
as an environmental scientist, but a professor of civil and environmental engineering for over 
 years) called into question prof. marc edwards (ms/phd civil engineering) and his involve-
ment in the flint, michigan, lead crisis, and daniel carder (bs/ms mechanical engineering) 
who helped expose the volkswagen emission problem.",Social engineering,7
"edwards and carder likely perceived 
it as their social responsibility as engineers to uphold the preeminent requirement to pro-
tect human health and safety [, ], and acted in compliance with the engineering codes 
of ethics to expose ethical wrong-doing (e.g., asce canon d []).",Social engineering,7
"in response to sedlak’s 
editorial, a number of individuals shared differing views on the professional responsibilities 
of environmental engineering and science as related to the public [–].",Social engineering,7
"an individual’s personal identity with respect to 
their profession may be significant in how they perceive their social responsibilities.",Social engineering,7
".. environment and sustainability
engineering codes of ethics include environmental protection among professional social 
responsibilities (table ), with the exception of some specialized sub-disciplines (biomedi-
cal and aerospace engineering).",Social engineering,7
"“comprehension of the impacts of engineering activity: … 
environmental” is one of the knowledge outcomes of a washington accord program [].",Social engineering,7
"environmental considerations in the engineering design process have also been explicitly 
required for accredited engineering degrees under abet (criterion , outcome  []).",Social engineering,7
"despite 
widespread inclusion in codes of ethics and professional education requirements, environ-
mental protection issues do not appear to be an equally prevalent focus of different disciplines 
within engineering.",Social engineering,7
"in a study of engineering educators, an average of % of the ~ sur-
vey respondents taught engineering/computing students about environmental issues, ranging 
from a high of % in environmental engineering to a low of % in computing [].",Social engineering,7
"among  
engineering educators in the study by romkey [], the average implementation of “i encour-
age students to consider the potential environmental impact of technology” was .",Social engineering,7
"(where 
 = sometimes and  = often on a – scale).",Social engineering,7
"internationally, commitments to environmental 
protection are generally considered to be somewhat stronger in the eu versus the us.",Social engineering,7
"social responsibility
engineers’ social responsibility for environmental protection may originate from different eth-
ical frameworks [].",Social engineering,7
"from an anthropocentric framework, one may simply understand that 
preservation of the environment is ultimately self-preservation for human life.",Social engineering,7
"alternatively, 
from a biocentric perspective one may recognize the intrinsic right to life of all organisms on 
the planet.",Social engineering,7
"the environment and ecology may be viewed to have distinct value, beyond that 
of maintaining human existence.",Social engineering,7
"a more limited sub-group of countries and engineering disciplines include sustainability 
and/or sustainable development within their code of ethics (table ).",Social engineering,7
"australia’s code shows 
a commitment to sustainability in the first sentence of the preamble statement, “use of knowl-
edge and skills for the benefit of the community to create engineering solutions for a sustain-
able future,” and “promote sustainability” is one of the four key statements of ethical practice 
[].",Social engineering,7
"in fact, the mandate to protect the “health, safety and wellbeing of the community” is 
placed under the heading of promoting sustainability.",Social engineering,7
"sustainability knowledge or abili-
ties are included as stand-alone outcomes within the bodies of knowledge for us chemical, 
civil, environmental, and professional engineers [, –].",Social engineering,7
"sustainable design and develop-
ment as a social responsibility of engineers has been endorsed by many scholars around the 
globe [–].",Social engineering,7
"one issue may be the lack of consensus on the meaning of the term sustainability or sustainable 
development.",Social engineering,7
"in general, sustainability includes considerations of both current conditions and 
future generations, crossing environmental, societal, and economic elements.",Social engineering,7

"professional social responsibility in engineering


is included in the educational requirements for engineers under the washington accord 
outcomes [].",Social engineering,7
"in contrast, sustainability is not explicitly required in engineering education 
under abet, which accredits the majority of the programs in the us and additional pro-
grams across  countries.",Social engineering,7
"sustainability is mentioned as a potential consideration in the engi-
neering design process under both the old abet ec criteria and the new requirements 
[, ].",Social engineering,7
"the new requirements do include considerations of “global, economic, environmental, 
and societal contexts” within the ethics outcome, but these considerations might be primarily 
immediate versus long term.",Social engineering,7
"interestingly, more faculty indicated that they teach engineer-
ing/computing students about sustainability (%) as compared to environmental impacts 
(%), ranging from % in environmental engineering to % in biomedical engineering [].",Social engineering,7
".. pro bono
the idea of pro bono work is that professions should donate some of their technical expertise 
to individuals or organizations unable to pay for those services.",Social engineering,7
"this can be providing services 
for free or at a reduced rate.",Social engineering,7
"while this is commonplace in professions such a law and medi-
cine [], the idea just seems to be starting to grow in engineering and is by no means uni-
versal [].",Social engineering,7
"the american society of civil engineers (asce) first approved a policy statement 
on pro bono services in  [], encouraging engineers as individuals to provide services to 
charitable causes and in emergency situations; however, its real purpose appears directed at 
liability issues and indemnification.",Social engineering,7
"the national society of professional engineers (nspe) 
has a policy statement pertaining to liability of “good samaritans” who volunteer their engi-
neering services upon request in times of crisis [].",Social engineering,7
"within the codes of ethics for engineering, hints of commitment to pro bono service can be 
found.",Social engineering,7
"the nspe code [] states that “engineers are encouraged to participate in civic affairs; 
career guidance for youths; and work for the advancement of the safety, health, and well-
being of their community”; a similar statement is found in [].",Social engineering,7
"the asce code [] states that 
“engineers should seek opportunities to be of constructive service in civic affairs and work 
for…their communities.” however, the mandate for pro bono activity is unclear.",Social engineering,7
"riley and lambrinidou [] suggest that pro bono service should comprise at least % of the 
employed hours of engineers.",Social engineering,7
"interviews with working engineers found that some engineer-
ing companies allow donating standard work hours to engineering service, such as to groups 
like engineers without borders (ewb)-usa [].",Social engineering,7
"moulton [] asserts, “an enormous amount 
of software development/support is done at low or no cost, for example, public help forums 
and much of the work toward open source/linux/gnu etc.” (p. ).",Social engineering,7
"in a study of pro bono engineering in australia in  [], a high demand for pro bono 
engineering, reasons for engaging in pro bono activities, benefits from pro bono activities, and 
challenges were documented.",Social engineering,7
"a sense of professional responsibility was identified among 
the motivations for participating in pro bono activities in engineering.",Social engineering,7
"while providing rich 
information and detailed case studies, the research left unanswered questions such as what 
percentage of engineering companies or individuals engage in pro bono activities, and to 
what extent (hours per year).",Social engineering,7
"social responsibility
in a small study (methods described in []), working engineers were asked in a survey to rate 
their agreement with the statement “engineering firms should take on some pro bono work.” 
among the  respondents, % disagreed, % were neutral, and % agreed; % of the 
survey respondents had recently graduated (within  to  years) with an engineering degree 
from a us institution and % of the respondents were members of ewb-usa.",Social engineering,7
"differences in 
opinions were found based on gender (females higher average agreement), discipline (environ-
mental higher agreement than mechanical), and years since earned bachelor’s degree (higher 
agreement for those who earned degree  or more years prior).",Social engineering,7
"thus, among both engineering students and 
professionals the majority agreed to some extent that engineering firms should take on pro 
bono work.",Social engineering,7
"in australia, the university of technology sydney studied the attitudes of their students 
toward pro bono engineering.",Social engineering,7

engineering to best fulfill its mandate to benefit society [, ].",Social engineering,7
"it is unclear if one of the social 
responsibilities of the engineering profession relates to employing the diversity of individuals 
in society.",Social engineering,7
"statements related to diversity in engineering codes of ethics are summarized in

(psrdm) [] was based on an ethic of care framework, and drew from schwartz’s [] altru-
istic helping behavior model, ramsey’s [] model for integrating social responsibility into 
the decision process of scientists, and the delve [] service learning model.",Social engineering,7
"the psrdm 
includes three realms: personal social awareness, professional development, and professional 
connectedness.",Social engineering,7
"the personal social awareness realm describes one’s personal feelings of a 
desire to help others, which is inclusive of the dimensions of awareness that needs exist, feel-
ings that one possesses the ability to help, and a connectedness that motivates one to action.",Social engineering,7
"separate from these personal feelings, an engineer should develop professionally.",Social engineering,7
"the three 
dimensions of this realm include one’s belief that a variety of base skills are needed for engi-
neers, feelings that engineering has the capacity to help address societal issues (professional 
ability), and an awareness that one should analyze the societal impacts of engineering and 
include stakeholders from the community in the engineering process.",Social engineering,7
"finally, it is anticipated 
that a person’s individual motivations to help will come together with their engineering pro-
fessional development, to inform their sense of professional connectedness.",Social engineering,7

vation to help others through application of one’s engineering skills can be fostered through 
a cycle of engaging in this helping behavior.",Social engineering,7

awareness of both the costs and benefits of helping and serving others through engineering.",Social engineering,7
"an input-environment-output type of model derived from wiedman [] was used by

engineering students.",Social engineering,7

ily influences and high school, etc.",Social engineering,7

determined to influence ideas of professional social responsibility.",Social engineering,7
"however, cech [] nota-
bly found that attitudes toward public service decreased among  engineering students 
attending four us institutions.",Social engineering,7
"this concerning trend was termed a “culture of disengage-
ment.” it is perhaps not surprising given that the majority of engineering studies focus on 
technical issues, and preference technical issues over the interactions of technology with soci-
ety.",Social engineering,7
"this technical:social dualism may reduce students’ focus on the impacts of their work as 
engineers.",Social engineering,7
"however, experiences during engineering studies may counter this decrease in 
engineering students’ ideas of socially responsible engineering.",Social engineering,7
"some engineering students 
cited courses as impactful to their views of social responsibility [].",Social engineering,7

work typically have corporate social responsibility statements which document their com-
mitments and contributions to sustainability in the form of their working conditions, the local

troubling findings are that an individual’s commitment to socially responsible engineering 
may actually decline over time, perhaps as they begin to separate their technical expertise from 
social commitments or feel that business interests outweigh broader social responsibilities.",Social engineering,7
"there are still a number of unanswered questions in regards to engineers’ beliefs of their 
professional social responsibilities, and factors that contribute to shaping these beliefs.",Social engineering,7

have earned additional graduate or other degrees.",Social engineering,7
"including all degrees, as we did above, offers a 
holistic picture of focus of study by discipline, but it also may skew the results toward subjects in 
which additional degrees were earned.",Social engineering,7
"it also makes comparisons with other data sets, both 
historical and contemporary, more difficult.",Social engineering,7
"for instance, based on the above data, librarians seem to over-represent humanistic disciplines.",Social engineering,7
"but perhaps humanistic courses of study are popular across the board, not just in librarianship.",Social engineering,7
"to determine whether or not the undergraduate degree subjects of librarians differ from the 
population at large, we compared the subjects of the undergraduate degrees in our data set to 
national data from the u.s. department of education’s integrated postsecondary education data 
  
system (ipeds).",Social engineering,7
"ipeds is a system of annual surveys conducted by the national center for 
educational statistics.",Social engineering,7
we took several steps to prepare our study data for comparison with national data from ipeds.,Social engineering,7
"first, all non-undergraduate degrees were removed from our data set as ipeds only collects data 
relating to post-secondary, non-graduate studies.",Social engineering,7
"next, each degree from our original coding 
scheme was checked against ipeds’ classification of instructional programs (cip) searchable 
site (nces, n.d.-b) in order to crosswalk our data.",Social engineering,7
"cip is the taxonomic scheme utilized by 
ipeds, a scheme that organizes degrees into fields of study and sub-fields.",Social engineering,7
"our data was 
crosswalked at the higher field level in order to compare it to national numbers reported in the 
digest of education statistics, an annual compilation of american educational statistical 
information with data drawn from many sources, including ipeds.",Social engineering,7
"our data set was then re-
coded to match the cip scheme.",Social engineering,7
"(nces, ) from the digest contains data for 
bachelor’s degrees conferred by all reporting institutions between - and -, the 
latter being the most recent year for which complete ipeds data is available.",Social engineering,7
"numbers for the 
-, -, and - academic years were aggregated across our data set and ipeds 
data for comparison purposes.",Social engineering,7
"these academic years were selected because complete data for 
these years was available across both data sets [it should be noted that data from one program 
was dropped for this particular comparison, since their data was provided to us in aggregate form 
and we were unable to isolate the years in question].",Social engineering,7
"our comparison shows a number of stark differences in patterns of undergraduate study (see 
table ).",Social engineering,7
"however, 
english language, literature and letters is also a large percentage (.%), and would likely be 
the highest percentage were history not conjoined with social sciences.",Social engineering,7
"in librarianship, .% and .% 
of mlis students earned undergraduate degrees in these subjects, respectively.",Social engineering,7
"there is 
obviously a significant disconnect in librarians’ representation of the population at large.",Social engineering,7
"although ipeds does not present a unified category for stem as an overall discipline, we can 
identify individual subjects representing the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
to present a more holistic picture.",Social engineering,7
"we identified the following ipeds-designated fields as 
stem-relevant fields (see table ): 
 
table .",Social engineering,7
"in contrast, 
the percentage of mlis students holding undergraduate degrees in computer & information 
science (.%) is twice as high as the overall rate (.%).",Social engineering,7
"this may be due to the inclusion of 
information science alongside computer science in the ipeds classification; mlis students 
often have undergraduate degrees in library and information science (lis).",Social engineering,7
"this could also be 
due to data from programs offering a broader graduate level degree in information with tracks or 
specializations for lis, computer science, information management, user experience (ux) and 
other cognate fields.",Social engineering,7
"ipeds does offer a separate category specifically for library science, and 
that is where we classified undergraduate lis degrees from our dataset.",Social engineering,7
"however, other non-
library information-related degrees, such as information administration and management were 
assigned to the ipeds category of computer & information sciences.",Social engineering,7
"computer science degrees 
may also be more highly represented due to the types of mlis programs that responded: several 
contemporary degree programs now admit students to a general information-based course of 
study, where students subsequently may select to pursue a specialization or track in library 
science and librarianship.",Social engineering,7
"therefore, some degrees in our dataset surely represent matriculated 
students who went on to pursue information degrees exclusive of the mlis.",Social engineering,7
a similar issue arises in the area of law.,Social engineering,7
"at least one of the mlis programs that contributed data 
offered a specialization in law librarianship, thus attracting people with previous experience in 
that area.",Social engineering,7
"although this may not be evident in the undergraduate data (.% in librarianship 
compared with .% overall), .% of all previous degrees (undergraduate, graduate, and 
post-grad) earned by incoming mlis students were in law.",Social engineering,7
"this likely reflects the fact that the 
juris doctor (jd), a degree earned only after already earning an undergraduate degree, is 
considered the first degree in law in the united states (law school admission council, n.d.).",Social engineering,7
"surprisingly, the percentage of mlis students with undergraduate degrees in mathematics and 
statistics is nearly identical to the overall rate (.% in librarianship vs. .% overall).",Social engineering,7
"the 
  
only other categories with similar distributions were architecture, communications/journalism, 
and multi/interdisciplinary studies.",Social engineering,7
"the ways in which this profile compares to previous studies 
 
librarianship clearly reflects a different distribution of undergraduate degrees than the u.s. 
population at large.",Social engineering,7
"to investigate whether this distribution is a new trend reflecting 
contemporary needs, or has remained constant over time, we compared undergraduate degree 
data from our dataset to similar data reported on in previous studies (see figure ).",Social engineering,7
"data from 
douglass (), white & macklin () and cain () were used for this comparison as 
they all offered a similar level of specificity to the ipeds classification of undergraduate majors.",Social engineering,7
"two of the studies gleaned data from questionnaire responses of undergraduate students 
(douglass and white & macklin) while cain relied on data from vita bank, an attempted census 
of practicing librarians.",Social engineering,7
"not all subject designations were reflected in each study; notably white 
and macklin did not specifically report library science, business, or arts undergraduate degrees as 
individual categories.",Social engineering,7
"totals do not add up to % due to additional subject area designations 
not consistently reported across all four studies, as well as accounting for other/miscellaneous 
degrees.",Social engineering,7
"it should be noted, as per the previous discussion of ipeds classification, history is 
categorized as a social science rather than with the humanities subjects.",Social engineering,7
undergraduate degrees across four studies.,Social engineering,7
"despite still comprising a near-majority, earning an undergraduate humanities degree prior to 
librarianship appears to be on the decline.",Social engineering,7
"social sciences are represented in higher numbers in 
more recent years, however this could possibly be attributed to a number of reason.",Social engineering,7
"the 
  
classification of history as a social science certainly affects these results in a significant way.",Social engineering,7
"but 
a higher number of social science undergraduates pursuing librarianship could also correspond 
with the evolutionary alignment of librarianship to information science, which is often positioned 
as a social science.",Social engineering,7
"or perhaps more options for social science degrees have become available in 
recent years.",Social engineering,7
"some professions, such as education, library science, and business, were called out individually 
in most of the studies, while other professions determined by our own original inductive coding 
were not.",Social engineering,7
"again, this may be an artifact of an evolving education space, which now includes 
degrees in subjects that were previously not offered in the academy.",Social engineering,7
"of the specific professions 
highlighted in three of the four studies compared here, education seems to have peaked in the 
s and declined since then.",Social engineering,7
"although librarianship is still often affiliated with an educational 
bent, especially when considering its historical foundations and core values, a decline in this 
focus has been noted as a result of the field’s alignment with information science (dali, ).",Social engineering,7
"when compared with the contemporary ipeds data, librarianship actually slightly lags the 
nation in undergraduate education degrees (.% nationally vs. .% in librarianship).",Social engineering,7
"business, on the other hand, has seen slight rise, from .% of undergraduate degrees in  to 
.% today, but as previously noted, this is starkly out of proportion from the national figure of 
.%.",Social engineering,7
"interestingly enough, degrees in the visual and performing arts appear to be on the rise, perhaps 
due to graduates of those degrees facing increased challenges in securing jobs in fields directly 
related to their studies.",Social engineering,7
"implications and conclusions 
 
this work set out to investigate the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary 
librarians, as well as to understand how these backgrounds compared to librarians of the past as 
well as the general population.",Social engineering,7
"unsurprisingly, we found that contemporary librarians, 
represented by mlis students on the cusp of their career so as to reflect the future landscape as 
much as possible, still hail predominantly from humanities backgrounds, especially english.",Social engineering,7
history is also a strongly represented area of study.,Social engineering,7
"the large number of people with humanities 
backgrounds may have made sense when libraries were focused on books, literature, and reading.",Social engineering,7
"however, by the time library education shifted to the graduate level in the united states, 
librarianship itself had also already begun the shift toward becoming the social science field it is 
considered today.",Social engineering,7
"yet the undergraduate backgrounds of people pursuing librarianship do not 
seem to have shifted at the same rate.",Social engineering,7
"this leaves library educators with the difficult task of 
training people with humanities backgrounds to do social science work--a fundamentally 
different approach that risks mismatches in disciplinary norms.",Social engineering,7
"while most students with 
humanities backgrounds are more than capable writers, their unfamiliarity with the research 
methodologies and genre conventions often found in mlis curricula, which is more closely 
aligned with the social sciences, leaves many of these students struggling to understand 
expectations.",Social engineering,7
"mandel () reports that this same skill set is especially valuable in post-mlis 
employment, where “the ability of library and information professionals to responsibly consume 
and competently produce research is critical to the growth of the field and to the way other 
disciplines view lis” (p. ).",Social engineering,7
"this is true for academic librarians who may be required to 
  
engage in primary research as part of their tenure obligations, and for librarians in the field in 
general, who are increasingly called upon to demonstrate the value and impact of their work 
through evidence-based practice (oakleaf, , p. ).",Social engineering,7
"the backgrounds of librarians are quite different from those of the college-educated american 
populace at large, where % of adults  years and older by age have bachelor’s degrees or 
more (united states census bureau, ), with especially noticeable differences in business 
and health fields, as evidenced in the most recently available ipeds data.",Social engineering,7
"additional emphases 
on stem in american society calling for increased research, resources, and education in these 
fields implies the needs for librarians to support these services.",Social engineering,7
"but the small number of people 
with stem backgrounds going into librarianship leaves a disconnect.",Social engineering,7
"for future librarians to 
serve patrons in these areas, mlis programs must recruit more people with undergraduate 
education in these areas, and/or integrate education regarding services for these populations in 
graduate level library education curricula.",Social engineering,7
"we are not claiming that stem librarians who have 
an undergraduate background in the humanities or social sciences are unqualified and unable to 
fulfill their professional duties, only positing that an increase of librarians with stem 
undergraduate education can help serve the profession’s increased need for stem support and 
contribute to more diverse perspectives in mlis education.",Social engineering,7
"although they are still a small percentage overall, librarians with undergraduate education in the 
arts are on the rise.",Social engineering,7
"undergraduate art education, especially the studio arts, explicitly offers instruction that fosters 
creativity (clarke & cripps ).",Social engineering,7
"undergraduate studio art education includes learning how to 
take risks, view topics from multiple and flexible points of view and appreciate various 
perspectives (salazar ).",Social engineering,7
"innovation--even in scientific fields--has long been linked with 
creative pursuits like the arts.",Social engineering,7
"for example, gurnon, voss-andrae and stanley () show how 
including visual arts in undergraduate science curriculum can help develop scientific 
imagination.",Social engineering,7
"such integration underlies the revision of stem to steam (science, technology, 
engineering, arts and mathematics), a movement encouraging the inclusion of art and design as 
integral aspects of stem (rhode island school of design, ).",Social engineering,7
"although skills derived from 
art and design are certainly used by librarians, clarke’s () historical research shows that 
they have been implicit and underdeveloped in american librarianship and have yet to be 
explicitly taught in library education.",Social engineering,7
"given the argument that library work is actually more 
aligned with the discipline of design than social sciences (clarke, , ), people with art 
and design backgrounds may be better equipped with the creative skills necessary for st 
century library careers.",Social engineering,7
"yet until mlis education embraces a design approach, these students 
may find themselves trapped in similar patterns as those mentioned for humanities students 
above, and risk the inability to apply the skills learned in their design educations to librarianship.",Social engineering,7
"these findings may be useful, but like all studies of this nature, they are not without flaws.",Social engineering,7
"despite our attempt to collect census data from all  ala-accredited degree programs, only 
seven cooperated.",Social engineering,7
"the schools from which we collected data varied in program structure, size, 
ranking, and other characteristics.",Social engineering,7
"some schools offered multiple degrees (both ala-accredited 
and not); some offered specific focus areas or concentrations that surely affected our findings.",Social engineering,7
hence our attempt to collect census population data.,Social engineering,7
"while we understand and respect the 
reasons why programs did not share their data, we remain unsatisfied.",Social engineering,7
"data on undergraduate 
degrees was systematically collected in the past for the alise statistical report until .",Social engineering,7
"we 
could find no reason for this decision and the motivation for no longer collecting such data 
remains a mystery, when it could surely assist with recruitment and outreach for a more 
educationally diverse profession.",Social engineering,7
"perhaps given some of the challenges faced by library 
programs in the late th century, such data became a kind of “competitive intelligence,” making 
sharing prohibitive and reflecting a change from the traditions of cooperation so commonly seen 
in librarianship to a more competitive landscape where mlis program sought various means of 
staying afloat.",Social engineering,7
"despite these limitations, this study still illustrates trends in librarians’ educational 
backgrounds in the st century, which can help shape mlis education in this contemporary 
evolving space.",Social engineering,7
several approaches to organize exploration can be considered.,Space exploration,8
"first, imitation learning can be used
to take advantage of observations of another agent acting on the environment [].",Space exploration,8
"while observing
the environment changing as a consequence of other agent’s actions can often be leveraged, there
are many cases where it is either impossible for other agents to demonstrate how to act, or for the
learner to observe the motor program used by the other agent.",Space exploration,8
"for these reasons, various forms of
autonomous curiosity-driven learning approaches have been proposed [], often inspired by forms of
spontaneous exploration displayed by human children [].",Space exploration,8
"some of these approaches have used the
framework of (deep) reinforcement learning, considering intrinsic rewards valuing states or actions
in terms of novelty, information gain, or prediction errors, e.g.",Space exploration,8
"however, many of
these approaches are not directly applicable to high-dimensional redundant continuous action spaces
[, ], or face complexity challenges to be applicable to real world robots [, ].",Space exploration,8
"another approach to curiosity-driven exploration is known as intrinsically motivated goal exploration
processes (imgeps) [, ], an architecture closely related to goal babbling [].",Space exploration,8
"the general idea
of imgeps is to equip the agent with a goal space, where each point is a vector of (target) features of
behavioural outcomes.",Space exploration,8
"during exploration, the agent samples goals in this goal space according to a
certain strategy.",Space exploration,8
"a powerful strategy for selecting goals is to maximize empirical competence progress
using multi-armed bandits [].",Space exploration,8
"this enables to automate the formation of a learning curriculum where
goals are progressively explored from simple to more complex, avoiding goals that are either too
simple or too complex.",Space exploration,8
"for each sampled goal the agent dedicates a budget of experiments to improve
its performance regarding this particular goal.",Space exploration,8
"imgeps are often implemented using a population
approach, where the agent stores an archive of all the policy parameters and the corresponding
outcomes.",Space exploration,8
"this makes the approach powerful since the agent is able to leverage each encountered
past experience when facing a new goal.",Space exploration,8
"this approach has been shown to enable high-dimensional
robots to learn very efficiently locomotion skills [], manipulation of soft objects [, ] or tool use
[].",Space exploration,8
"related approaches were recently experimented in the context of deep reinforcement learning,
such as in hindsight experience replay [] and reverse curriculum learning [] (however using
monolithic goal parameterized policies), and within the power play framework [].",Space exploration,8
learning disentangled representations of goal spaces.,Space exploration,8
"even if imgep approaches have been
shown to be very powerful, one limit has been to rely on engineered representations of goal spaces.",Space exploration,8
"a major challenge is how to
learn goal spaces in cases where only low-level perceptual measures are available to the learner (e.g.",Space exploration,8
"a first step in this direction was presented in [], using deep networks and algorithms such
as variational autoencoders (vaes) to learn goal spaces as a latent representation of the environment.",Space exploration,8
"in simple simulated scenes where a robot arm learned to interact with a single controllable object,
this approach was shown to be as efficient as using handcrafted goal features.",Space exploration,8
"but [] did not study
what was the impact of the quality of the learned representation.",Space exploration,8
"moreover, when the environment
contains several objects including a distractor object, an efficient exploration of the environment is
possible only if the structure of the goal space reflects the one of the environment.",Space exploration,8
"for example,
when objects are represented as abstract distinct entities, modular curiosity-driven goal exploration
processes can be leveraged for efficient exploration, by focusing on objects that provide maximal
learning progress, and avoiding distractor objects that are either trivial or not controllable [].",Space exploration,8
"an
open question is thus whether it is possible to learn goal spaces with adequate disentanglement
properties and develop exploration algorithms that can leverage those learned disentangled properties
from low-level perceptual measures.",Space exploration,8
discovering high-level controllable features of the environment.,Space exploration,8
"although methods to learn
disentangled representation of the world exist [, , ], they do not allow to distinguish features
that are controllable by the learner from features describing external phenomena that are outside
the control of the agent.",Space exploration,8
"however, identifying such independantly controllable features [] is of
paramount importance for agents to develop compact world models that generalize well, as well as
to grow efficiently their repertoire of skills.",Space exploration,8
"one idea to address this challenge, initially explored
in [], is that learners may identify and characterize controllable sets of features as sensorimotor
space manifolds where it is possible to learn how to control perceptual values with actions, i.e.",Space exploration,8
"where
learning progress is possible.",Space exploration,8
"unsupervised learning approaches could then build coarse categories
distinguishing the body, controllable objects, other animate agents, and uncontrollable objects as

figure : the imgep-mugl approach.",Space exploration,8
entities with different learning progress profiles [].,Space exploration,8
"however, this work only considered identifying
learnable and controllable manifolds among sets of engineered features.",Space exploration,8
"in this paper, we explore the idea that a useful learned representation for efficient exploration would
be a factorized representation where each latent variable would be sensitive to changes made in a
single true dregree of freedom of the environment, while being invariant to changes in other degrees of
freedom [].",Space exploration,8
"further on, we investigate how independently controllable features of the environment
can be identified among these disentangled variables through interactions with the environement.",Space exploration,8
"we study this question using β-vaes [, ] which is a natural extension of vaes and have been
shown to provide good disentanglement properties.",Space exploration,8
"we extend the experimental framework of [],
simulating a robot arm learning how it can produce outcomes in a scene with two objects, including a
distractor.",Space exploration,8
"in order to assess the role of the representation we use a two-stage process, which first
learns to see and then learns to act.",Space exploration,8
"the first stage consists of a representation learning phase where
the agent builds a representation of the world by passively observing it (events in the environment are
assumed to be produced by another agent in this phase, see [].",Space exploration,8
"in the second phase the agent uses
this representation to interact with the world, by sampling goals that provide high learning progress,
and where goals are target values of one or several latent variables to be reached through action.",Space exploration,8
this procedure was adopted for two reasons.,Space exploration,8
"for one, it is similar to the developmental progression
in infant development, where the infant first spends most of his time observing the world due to
limitations in motor exploration.",Space exploration,8
"secondly, it helps in understanding the impact of disentanglement
given the multiple components of the architecture.",Space exploration,8
"the first contribution we make in this paper is to study the impact of using a learned disentangled
goal space representations on the efficiency of exploration and discovery of a diversity of outcomes in
imgeps.",Space exploration,8
"to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the role of disentanglement is studied
in the context of exploration.",Space exploration,8
"precisely, we show that:
• using a disentangled state representation is beneficial to exploration: using imgeps, the
agents explores more states in fewer experiments than when the representation is entangled.",Space exploration,8
"• disentangled representations learned by β-vaes can be further leveraged by modular
curiosity-driven imgeps to explore as efficiently as using handcrafted low-dimensional
scene features, in experiments that include both controllable and distractor objects.",Space exploration,8
"on the
contrary, we show that representations learned by vaes are not sufficiently structured to
enable a similarly efficient exploration.",Space exploration,8
"the second contribution of this article is to show that identifying abstract independently controllable
features from low-level perception can emerge from a representation learning pipeline where learning
disentangled features from passive observations (β-vaes) is followed by curiosity-driven active
exploration driven by the maximization of learning progress.",Space exploration,8
"this second phase allows in particular to

figure : intrinsically motivated goal exploration process examplified.",Space exploration,8
"distinguish features related to controllable objects (disentangled features with high learning progress)
from features related to distractors (disentangled features with low learning progress).",Space exploration,8
"modular goal exploration with learned goal spaces
this section introduces intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes with modular goal spaces
as they are typically used in environments with handcrafted goal spaces.",Space exploration,8
"it then describes the
architecture used in this article where the handcrafted goal space is replaced by a representation of
the space that is learned before exploration and then used as a goal space for imgeps.",Space exploration,8
"the overall
architecture is summarized in figure .
. intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes with modular goal spaces
to fully understand the imgep approach, one must imagine the agent as performing a sequence
of contextualized and parameterized experiments.",Space exploration,8
"the problem of exploration is defined using the
following elements:
• a context space c. the context c represents the initial state of the environment.",Space exploration,8
"it corre-
sponds to parameters of the experiment that are not chosen by the agent.",Space exploration,8
"• a parameterization space θ. the parameterization θ corresponds to the parameters of the
experiment that the agent can control at will (e.g.",Space exploration,8
"• an observation space o. here we consider an observation o to be a vector representing all
the signals captured by the agent sensors during an experiment (e.g.",Space exploration,8
"• an environment dynamic d : c,θ → o which maps parameters performed in a certain
context, to observations (or outcomes).",Space exploration,8
this dynamic is considered unknown.,Space exploration,8
"for instance, as presented in figure , a parameterization could be the weights of a closed-loop neural
network controller for a robot manipulating a ball.",Space exploration,8
"a context could be the initial position of the ball
and an observation could be the position of the ball at the end of a fixed duration experiment.",Space exploration,8
"this algorithmic architecture uses the following elements:
• a goal space t . the elements τ ∈ t represent the goals that the agent can set for himself.",Space exploration,8
"we also use the term task to refer to an element of t .

• a goal sampling policy γ : t → [, ].",Space exploration,8
"this distribution allows the agent to choose a goal in
the goal space.",Space exploration,8
"depending on the exploration strategy being active or fixed, this distribution
can evolve during exploration.",Space exploration,8
"• a meta-policy mechanism (or internal predictive model) π : t , c → θ, which given a
goal and a context, outputs a parameterization that is most likely to produce an observation
fulfilling the goal, under the current knowledge.",Space exploration,8
"• a cost function c : t ,o → r, internally used by the meta-policy.",Space exploration,8
"this cost function
outputs the fitness of an observation for a given task τ .
when the environment is simple, such as for experiments presented in [] where a robotic arm
explore its possible interactions with a single object, the structure of the goal space is not critical.",Space exploration,8
"however, in more complex scenes with multiple objects (e.g.",Space exploration,8
"including tools or objects that cannot be
controlled), it was shown in [] that it is important to have a goal space which reflects the structure
of the environment.",Space exploration,8
"in particular, having a modular goal space, i.e.",Space exploration,8
"of the form t = ⊕ni= ti,
where the ti are different modules representing the properties of various objects, leads to much better
exploration performances.",Space exploration,8
"in that case a goal can correspond to achieving an observation where a
given object is in a given position.",Space exploration,8
"the algorithmic architecture works as follows: at each step, the exploration process samples a module,
then samples a a goal in this module, observes the context, executes a meta-policy mechanism to guess
the best policy parameters for this goal, which it then uses to perform the experiment.",Space exploration,8
"the observation
is then compared to the goal, and used to update the meta-policy (leveraging the information for
other goals) as well as the module sampling policy.",Space exploration,8
"the general idea of imgeps is depicted in
figure .",Space exploration,8
"depending on the algorithmic instantiation of this architecture, different meta-policy
mechanisms can be used [, ].",Space exploration,8
"in any case, the meta-policy must be initialized using a buffer
of experiments {ci, θi, oi} containing at least two different oi.",Space exploration,8
"as such, a bootstrap of several
random parameterization exploration iterations is always performed at the beginning.",Space exploration,8
"this leads to
algorithmic architecture .",Space exploration,8

precision of the meta-policy for fulfilling goals in ti, which is a form of learning progress called
competence progress (see [] and appendix .",Space exploration,8
for further details on the interest measure).,Space exploration,8
"the
second term of equation () forces the agent to explore a random module % of the time.",Space exploration,8
"the
general idea is that monitoring the learning progress allows the agent to concentrate on objects which
can be learned to control while ignoring objects that cannot.
. modular unsupervised goal-space learning for imgep
in [], an algorithm for unsupervised goal-space learning (ugl) was proposed.",Space exploration,8
"the principle
is to let the agent observe another agent producing a diversity of observations {oi}.",Space exploration,8
"this set of
observations is used to learn a low-dimensional representation which is then employed as a goal-space.",Space exploration,8
"in these experiments, there is always a single goal space corresponding to the learned representation
of the environment.",Space exploration,8
"however, if one wishes to use the algorithm presented in the previous section, it
is necessary to have different goal spaces: one for each module.",Space exploration,8
"in order to use a modular goal exploration strategy with a learned goal space, we propose algorithm
, which performs modular unsupervised goal-space learning (mugl) and is represented in
figure .",Space exploration,8
the idea is to learn a representation of the observations in the same way as ugl.,Space exploration,8
"the
modules are then defined as subsets of latent variables.",Space exploration,8
"for example, a module could be made of the
first and second latent variables.",Space exploration,8
"accordingly, goals sampled by this module are defined as achieving
a certain value for the first and second latent variables of the representation of an observation.",Space exploration,8
"the
underlying rationale is that, if we manage to learn a disentangled representation of the observations,
each latent variable would correspond to a single property of a single object.",Space exploration,8
"thus, by forming
modules containing only latent variables corresponding to the same object, the exploration algorithm
may be able to explore the different objects separately.",Space exploration,8
"after learning the representation, a specific criterion is used to decide how the latent variables should
be grouped to form modules.",Space exploration,8
"in the particular case of vaes and βvaes, the grouping is made by
projecting latent variables which have similar kullback-leibler on their respective subspace (see

"finally, the cost function ck(τ, o) is defined, using the distance between
the goal and the k-th projection of the latent representation of the observation.",Space exploration,8
the overall approach combining imgeps with learned modular goal spaces is summarized in figure .,Space exploration,8
"note that the algorithm proposed in [] is a particular instance of this architecture with only one
module containing all the latent variables.",Space exploration,8
"in this case there is no module sampling strategy, and only
a goal sampling strategy.",Space exploration,8
this specific case is here referred to as random goal exploration (rge).,Space exploration,8
"experiments
we carried out experiments in a simulated environment to address the following questions:
• to what extent is the structure of the learned representation important for the performance
of imgep-ugl in terms of efficiently discovering a diversity of observations?",Space exploration,8
"• is it possible to leverage the structure of the representation with modular curiosity-driven
goal exploration algorithms?",Space exploration,8
"• can the learning progress measure of goal exploration be used to identify controllable
abstract features of the environment?",Space exploration,8
"environment we experimented on the arm--balls environment, where a rotating -joints robotic
arm evolves in an environment containing two balls of different sizes, as represented in figure .",Space exploration,8
one ball can be grasped and moved around in the scene by the robotic arm.,Space exploration,8
"the other ball acts
as a distractor: it cannot be grasped nor moved by the robotic arm but follows a random walk.",Space exploration,8
the agent perceives the scene as a  ×  pixels image.,Space exploration,8
"for the representation learning phase,
we generated a set of images where the positions of the two balls were uniformly distributed over
[−, ].",Space exploration,8
these images were then used to learn a representation using a vae or a βvae.,Space exploration,8
"in order to
assess the importance of the disentangled representation, we used the same disentangled/entangled
representation for all the instantiations of the exploration algorithms.",Space exploration,8
"this allowed us to study the
effect of disentangled representations by eliminating the variance due to the inherent difficulty of
learning such representations.",Space exploration,8
"baselines results obtained using imgeps with learned goal spaces are compared to two baselines:

(a) small exploration noise (σ = .)",Space exploration,8
(b) large exploration noise (σ = .),Space exploration,8
figure : exploration ratio during exploration for different exploration noises.,Space exploration,8
"• the first baseline is the naive approach of random parameter exploration (rpe), where
exploration is performed by uniformly sampling parameterizations θ. in the case of hard
exploration problems, this strategy is regarded as a low performing one, since no previous
information is leveraged to choose the next parameterization.",Space exploration,8
"this strategy gives a lower
bound on the expected performances of exploration algorithms.",Space exploration,8
"• the second baseline is modular goal exploration with engineered features repre-
sentation (mge-efr): it corresponds to a modular imgep in which the goal space is
handcrafted and corresponds to the true degrees of freedom of the environment.",Space exploration,8
"in the
arm--balls environment it corresponds to the positions of the two balls, given as a point
in [−, ].",Space exploration,8
"since essentially all the information is available to the agent under a highly
semantic form, it is expected to give an upper bound on the performances of the exploration
algorithms.",Space exploration,8
"we performed experiments with both one module (rge-efr) and two modules
(one for the ball and one for the distractor) (mge-efr).",Space exploration,8
"results
to assess the performances of the mge algorithm on learned goal spaces, we experimented with
two different representations coming from two learning algorithms: β-vae (disentangled) and vae
(entangled).",Space exploration,8
"in each case, we ran  trials of , episodes each, for both the rge and mge
exploration algorithms.",Space exploration,8
"one episode is defined as one experimentation/roll-out of a parameter θ.
exploration performances the exploration performance of all the algorithms was measured
according to the number of cells reached by the ball in a discretized grid of  cells ( cells for
each dimension of the ball that can be moved; the distractor is not accounted for in the exploration
evaluation).",Space exploration,8
"not all cells can be reached given that the arm is rotating and is of unit length: the
maximum ratio between the number of reached cells and all the cells is approximately pi/ ≈ ..
in figure , we can see the evolution of the ratio of the number of cells visited with respect to all the
cells through exploration.",Space exploration,8
"first, one can see that all the algorithms have much better performances
than the naive rpe, both in term of speed of exploration and final performance.",Space exploration,8
"secondly, for both
rge and mge with learned goal spaces, using a disentangled representation is beneficial.",Space exploration,8
"one can
also see that when the representation used as a goal space is disentangled, the modular architecture
(mge-βvae) performs much better than the flat architecture (rge-βvae), with performances
that match the modular architecture with engineered features (mge-efr).",Space exploration,8
"however, when the
representation is entangled, using a modular architecture is actually detrimental to the performances
since each module encodes then only partially for the ball position.",Space exploration,8
"figure  also shows that the mge
architectures with a disentangled representation performs particularly well even if the exploration
noise is low whereas the rge architectures or mge architectures with an entangled representation
relies on a large exploration noise to produce a large variety of observations.",Space exploration,8
for examples of exploration curves together with exploration scatters.,Space exploration,8
"benefits of disentanglement and modules
the evolution of the interest of the different modules through exploration is represented in figure a.
first, in the disentangled case, one can see that the interest is high only for the modules corresponding

(a) disentangled representation (βvae) (b) entangled representation (vae)
figure : interest evolution for each module through epochs.",Space exploration,8
"in the case of a disentangled representa-
tion the algorithm shows interest only for the module which correspond to latent variables encoding
for the position of the ball (which is unknown by the agent, which does not distinguish between the
ball and the distractor).",Space exploration,8
to the latent variables encoding for the ball position.,Space exploration,8
"this is natural since these latent variables are
the only ones that can be learned to control with motor commands.",Space exploration,8
"in the entangled case, the interest
of each module follows a random trajectory, with no module standing out with a particular interest.",Space exploration,8
"this effect can be understood as follows: the entanglement introduces spurious correlations between
the observations and the tasks in every module, which bring the interest measures to follow random
fluctuations based on the collected observations.",Space exploration,8
"these correlations, in turn, lead the agent to sample
more frequently policies that in fact did not have any impact on the observation, making the overall
performance worse (see appendix .",Space exploration,8
"when the representation used as a goal space is disentangled, the modular approach is particularly well
suited in the presence of distractors.",Space exploration,8
"indeed, thanks to the projection operator, the noise introduced in
the latent variables by the random walk of the distractor is completely ignored by the module which
contains the latent variables of the ball.",Space exploration,8
"this allows to learn a better inverse model for modules which
ignore the distractor, which in turn yields a better exploration (see appendix .",Space exploration,8
"independently controllable features
as explained above and illustrated in figure a, when the representation is disentangled, the mge
algorithm is able to monitor the learnability of certain modules (possibly individual latent features,
see .",Space exploration,8
"), and leverage it to focus exploration on goals with high learning progress.",Space exploration,8
"this is illustrated
on the interest curves by the clear difference in interest between modules where learning progress
happens and those where it does not.",Space exploration,8
"it happens that modules that produce high learning progress
correspond precisely to modules that can be controlled.",Space exploration,8
"as such, as a side benefit of using modular
goal exploration algorithms, the agent discovers in an unsupervised manner which are the features
of the environment that can be controlled (and in turn explores them more).",Space exploration,8
"this knowledge could
then be used by another algorithm whose performance depends on its ability to know which are the
independantly controllable features of the environment.",Space exploration,8
"conclusion
in this paper we studied the role of the structure of learned goal space representations in imgeps.",Space exploration,8
"more specifically, we have shown that when the representation possesses good disentanglement
properties, they can be leveraged by a curiosity-driven modular goal exploration architecture and
lead to highly efficient exploration.",Space exploration,8
"in particular, this enables exploration performances as good as
when using engineered features.",Space exploration,8
"in addition, the monitoring of learning progress enables the agent to
discover which latent features can be controlled by its actions, and focus its exploration by setting
goals in their corresponding subspace.",Space exploration,8
the semantic mapping between latent variables and external objects is made by the experimenter.,Space exploration,8
the perspectives of this work are twofold.,Space exploration,8
"first it would be interesting to show how the initial
representation learning step could be performed online.",Space exploration,8
"secondly, beyond using learning progress to
discover controllable features during exploration, it would be interesting to re-use this knowledge to
acquire more abstract representations and skills.",Space exploration,8
"finally, as mentioned in the introduction, another advantage of using a disentangled representation
is that, as was shown in [], it evinces superior performances in a transfer learning scenario.",Space exploration,8
"both approaches are not incompatible and one could envision a scheme where one would learn
a disentangled representation in a simulated environment and use this representation to perform
exploration in a real world environment.",Space exploration,8

"however, using this approach in continuous state-action is difficult.",Space exploration,8
"exploration in continuous state-action space is conducted using some heuris-
tics.",Space exploration,8
intrinsic motivation is one of the approaches.,Space exploration,8
"this method activates ex-
ploration by adding another reward signal (exploration bonus) to the original
task reward.",Space exploration,8
the exploration bonus has various formats.,Space exploration,8
"one is the prediction
error of the state or action [].",Space exploration,8

inverse transition model in parallel with the policy.",Space exploration,8

novelty of the state using a pseudo-count of visitation with a probability density
function [].",Space exploration,8

the information gain of the transition model [].",Space exploration,8
"additionally, there is a style
that automatically generates the simplest tasks that are not achievable by a
current policy to support learning [].",Space exploration,8
"the intrinsic motivation approach can
perform structured exploration even in continuous state-action space.",Space exploration,8
"however,
as mentioned in [], adding an exploration bonus to the original reward can alter
the optimal solution to which the agent aims.",Space exploration,8
injecting noise is another exploration method.,Space exploration,8
"noise can be classified into
three types: -greedy, action space noise and parameter space noise.",Space exploration,8
"-greedy
performs exploration by taking a random action with probability .",Space exploration,8
"this method
is feasible in discrete state-action space, but infeasible in continuous state-action
space.",Space exploration,8
"action space noise is the most common method in recent deep rein-
forcement learning.",Space exploration,8
it perturbs the output of the policy at each step.,Space exploration,8
"action
space noise can be implemented straightforwardly for most reinforcement learn-
ing methods.",Space exploration,8
"additionally, it is used to implement a stochastic policy.",Space exploration,8
"however,
action space noise is less suited to tasks in which subtle positioning is essential be-
cause noise is injected at each step.",Space exploration,8
"parameter space noise performs exploration
by perturbing parameters of the policy.",Space exploration,8
"this noise enables agent consistent ex-
ploration because noise is injected at each episode and outputs the same action
in the same state, unlike action space noise.",Space exploration,8
"additionally, the perturbation of
policy parameters leads to a complex change of exploratory behavior.",Space exploration,8
"some re-
searchers have experimentally shown that parameter space noise performs better
exploration than action space noise [,].",Space exploration,8
"the evolution strategy (es) and genetic algorithm (ga) are highly related
to parameter space noise.",Space exploration,8
"recently, es and ga have been applied to deep re-
inforcement learning [,].",Space exploration,8
"the features of these methods were analyzed in
[,] and they were experimentally shown to be able to acquire a diverse and
robust policy.",Space exploration,8
"these methods have the benefit that they can be applied to a
broad range of problems for which the markov decision process (mdp) is less
suited.",Space exploration,8
"however, they are less sample efficient than the conventional rl algo-
rithm.",Space exploration,8
"these methods use only the final result, whereas the conventional rl
algorithm uses all step information in each episode.",Space exploration,8
"to summarize, parameter space noise has the benefit that it can manage con-
tinuous state-action space, does not alter the optimal policy, has the same sample
efficiency as the conventional rl approach and performs better exploration than
action space noise.",Space exploration,8

"a sparse
reward environment is a type of environment in which an agent cannot obtain any
rewards until it has achieved or almost achieves a task.",Space exploration,8
"in such an environment,
exploration is more critical.",Space exploration,8
"an agent with only σ cannot explore a sparse reward
environment because the variance of the noise distribution decreases rapidly.",Space exploration,8
"in
a sparse reward environment, an agent generally receives zero returns in the
environment.",Space exploration,8
"returns with the same value cause the same weights pk according
to ().",Space exploration,8
"the probability of generating a small noise is high because the noise
is generated from a zero-mean gaussian distribution.",Space exploration,8
"σ is updated by a large
population of small noises and the same weights using ().",Space exploration,8
"this process causes
a small variance of the next distribution and generates a small noise with higher
probability.",Space exploration,8
"by repeating this, the variance of the distribution of parameter space
noise decreases sharply.",Space exploration,8
"as a result, the policy is barely perturbed by the noise
and the agent cannot explore the environment.",Space exploration,8
"additionally, when all weights pk
have the same value and a bias emerges in the generated noise, the correlation
is accumulated per update, and then an agent can only perturb the policy in a
particular direction.

duct a certain amount of exploration despite the current policy parameters.",Space exploration,8

ditionally, this part of the covariance matrix is not biased because it considers

. switching the two types of exploration using α

switching the types using the difference between the acquired returns as a key
to overcome problem ():

to be effective when the direction and scale can be inferred by the difference
between the acquired returns.",Space exploration,8

ference between the returns is small.",Space exploration,8

exploration by σi are expected to be effective to determine a good direction
of exploration when returns have not been improved.",Space exploration,8

matrix also seems to be effective in a sparse reward environment to prevent the
variance reduction of σ.

optima.",Space exploration,8

agent can escape from local optima.",Space exploration,8

where n is the number of policy parameters.",Space exploration,8
"this parameter switches exploration types by
modifying the dominance between σi and σ. α= corresponds to an isotropic
exploration.",Space exploration,8
α= corresponds to directional and scaled exploration.,Space exploration,8
"the results are shown in fig.. in sparsecartpoleswingup, isotropic explo-
ration was dominant in the first stage of learning.",Space exploration,8
"the scale of noise was large at
the same stage.",Space exploration,8
"we believe the reason is that the policy parameters were still far
from the optimal policy, and more perturbation led to better performance.",Space exploration,8
"after
the middle stage of the learning process, σ became small.",Space exploration,8
"it is expected that the
policy matured, and a smaller perturbation led to a higher return.",Space exploration,8
"in sprsedou-
blependulum, σ had a tiny value and α= , except for the first few iterations.",Space exploration,8
"this environment did not seem to require exploration because it was shown in
[] that agents without exploration can learn the policy.",Space exploration,8
"in the sparsehalfchee-
tah environment, agents performed more exploratory behaviors.",Space exploration,8
"this environment may have required exploration because it had
larger state-action space than the other two environments.",Space exploration,8
"in some phases, α
had a small value and exploited the adaptivity of σ. this may have enabled an
agent to efficiently gather information that contained a high return and learn
faster.",Space exploration,8
"discussion
we experimentally demonstrated competitiveness in a dense reward environment
and an advantage in a sparse reward environment by comparing the proposed
method with a previous method.",Space exploration,8
"the proposed method managed the correlation
of parameter space noise, which was not used in previous works [,].",Space exploration,8

proach continuously switched isotropic exploration and directional exploration.",Space exploration,8

"in this paper, we
do not show that our approach acquired a better final policy than the previous
method because we terminated learning halfway because of time constraints.",Space exploration,8
"our approach can be trapped in local optima because it perturbs the policy
along the axis, where locally higher rewards are observed.",Space exploration,8
"however, it is possible
that our approach can eventually escape local optima.",Space exploration,8
"equation () activates
exploration when the return has converged in addition to when an agent cannot
obtain any return.",Space exploration,8
the limitation of our approach is a deceptive reward environment.,Space exploration,8
"the maze
task with a rat guard is one of the examples.",Space exploration,8
"the proposed method cannot escape
from such a trap because it uses a reward signal directly to determine the ex-
ploration strategy.",Space exploration,8
"in this environment, intrinsic motivation with an exploration
bonus performs better.",Space exploration,8
the computational complexity is another problem.,Space exploration,8
"the larger the network,
the faster the increase in the amount of noise to sample because noise is needed
for all weights and biases.",Space exploration,8
"in this case, the local reparameterization trick [] is
one of the solutions.",Space exploration,8
"this method can reduce the amount of noise to the number
of all neurons.",Space exploration,8
"conclusions
in this paper, we presented a new parameter space noise method for efficient
exploration in reinforcement learning.",Space exploration,8
"the proposed method switched isotropic
exploration and directional exploration using the differences of accumulated re-
turns as a key.",Space exploration,8
"the direction is determined by the correlations and scales of
noises which have led to higher returns in previous episodes.",Space exploration,8
"experiments in sparse rewards environments verified that our method could
learn better policy in those environments than plappert et al.’s method [].",Space exploration,8
"the
proposed method could proceed stable learning in the sparsecartpoleswingup
and sparsehalfcheetah environment which the previous method was difficult
to learn.",Space exploration,8
"our experiments also demonstrated that the proposed method did
not improve the performance in the dense reward environment, though it could
acquire competitive performance with the prior method.",Space exploration,8
"our analysis of exploration showed that our approach first executed explo-
ration with isotropic and large-scale noise and then switched exploration type
to directional and small-scale noise in sparsecartpoleswingup and sparsedou-
blependulum.",Space exploration,8
"in sparsehalfcheetah, although the noise had large values, an
agent used directional exploration in some phases.",Space exploration,8
"these results suggest that
biasing exploration is important especially in sparse reward environment to con-
tinuously obtain rewards and learn policy.",Space exploration,8
"our proposed method is one of the approaches to modify the strategy of
exploration automatically.",Space exploration,8

more structured exploration like using bayesian, which is closely related to pa-
rameter space noise, is future work.",Space exploration,8

short, the common heritage principles define four main principles to guide and be 
maintained by all states in their quest to conquer outer space.",Space exploration,8
"these are: a ban on the 
extension of state sovereignty claims over the moon and any celestial body, the 
redistribution of any scientific and economic benefit to all states, a demilitarized peaceful 
 
 
 
 
exploration, and a nuclear weapons free outer space.",Space exploration,8
"the aim of these principles is that, 
“all of humankind must benefit from sharing the natural resources that are subject to this 
policy.” the inclusion of the common heritage principles into the outer space treaties is 
the result of efforts by members of the non-aligned movement (nam) representing the

american “frontier” that is referenced across the outer space rhetoric.",Space exploration,8

space exploration.",Space exploration,8

 harvey, a brief history, .",Space exploration,8
"tsing’s description of the frontier is significant to the neoliberal expansion into 
outer space in two ways.",Space exploration,8
"first, frontiers are crafted and created, a result of a deliberate 
decision by the actors involved (namely, the state).",Space exploration,8
"declaring outer space as a “frontier” 
comes from a purposeful process of deregulation with the goal to enclose the ‘common’ 
land.",Space exploration,8
"outer space is not a part of the global commons, nor is its potential wealth.",Space exploration,8
"and 
second, the allure of claiming a piece of the frontier is a powerful motivator, especially 
under the “freedom” of private exploitation.",Space exploration,8
private property is key to market development.,Space exploration,8
"the united states argues such a maneuver does not 
extend state sovereignty, merely that it is creating a “free” market for its own companies 
to exploit unclaimed territory (a frontier).",Space exploration,8
"the united states is extending, at a minimum, its sphere of influence.",Space exploration,8
"american 
actors are legally authorized (under american law) to extract any outer space resource 
they can obtain.",Space exploration,8
"the american government has declared through national space security 
policies that the american government will act to defend its interests and citizens (aka 
commercial actors) in outer space.",Space exploration,8
"the american state is acting to protect private 
property claims, to keep outer space deregulated, and to extend “free” market principles 
into low-earth orbit.",Space exploration,8
"the american state is making deliberate choices to further neoliberal 
practices.",Space exploration,8
"deregulated markets become the focus, after all “the assumption that individual 
freedoms are guaranteed by freedom of the market and of trade is a cardinal feature of 
neoliberal thinking, and it has long dominated the us stance towards the rest of the 
world.” and, should a market not exist, then it must be created by the state.",Space exploration,8
"post-
, the american government is actively seeking to create a market in outer space.",Space exploration,8
"this is seen through the legislative requirement that the presidency consults the 
commercial outer space industry on favorable regulation and the desire to turn the 
international space station over to commercial enterprises - under the principles of a 
‘free’ market.",Space exploration,8
"a marxist examination of outer space privatization counters the realist claim of a 
natural, rational approach to international power politics.",Space exploration,8
"international action is instead a 
series of decisions made by individuals, communities, and organizations, which in turn 
influence the international system.",Space exploration,8

the foreign policy of the united states.",Space exploration,8

through the crisis of capital, showing how deregulation and market expansion subsumed 
the language of freedom.",Space exploration,8
"anna tsing argues how the declaration of a frontier plays into 
capital expansion.",Space exploration,8
the delineation of private property becomes key.,Space exploration,8
"private property is at the heart of the tension in the international outer space 
treaties and the common heritage principles.",Space exploration,8
"the united states, as a signatory to four of 
the five treaties and reiterated through congressional legislation, has agreed to the ban on 
unilateral sovereignty claims.",Space exploration,8
"however, allowing private entities to extract resources, 
claim them, and profit off of them raises questions of de facto sovereignty in light of 
declared american protection of its citizens (including its corporations).",Space exploration,8
"the realist 
theoretical approach can provide insight into surface reasons of why the american state 
signed and ratified the first four outer space treaties, cooperated with and depended on a 
former rival (russia) in outer space exploration following the cold war, and even why 
american private enterprises are allowed to launch their own equipment.",Space exploration,8
"but, the 
answers are surface and unsatisfying.",Space exploration,8
marxism fills the gap left by realism.,Space exploration,8
"marxism 
shows how the rise of neoliberalism directly influenced american domestic and foreign 
policy.",Space exploration,8
"the privatization shift in american outer space exploration was not a simple 
regulatory change to allow commercial actors to launch into outer space.",Space exploration,8
"the shift was a 
 
 
 
 
retreat of the state from the realm of outer space.",Space exploration,8
"it was the near complete deregulation of 
outer space in the specific interest of market expansion.",Space exploration,8
"the common territory of outer 
space was made open for private claim by american actors; the american state had 
become a neoliberal state.",Space exploration,8
"the american state has opened outer space to capitalist 
conquest (at the expense of human ownership) through privatization outer space 
exploration.",Space exploration,8
"chapter  
conclusion: privatization is a tool 
 
the story of american outer space exploration begins with the cold war and runs 
through the rise of the neoliberal practice of capitalism.",Space exploration,8
"the rhetoric of privatization 
emerged in the s under ronald reagan, as merely the next step in the retraction of 
the american state in favor of deregulation and corporate expansion.",Space exploration,8
"beginning in , 
us congressional legislation caught up with the presidential rhetoric, creating the 
necessary legal pathway for direct commercial entry into outer space.",Space exploration,8
"subsequent nasa 
authorization acts in addition to various acts such as the national space council act of 
, and the space act of  authorized private companies to launch their own 
equipment into outer space, required the federal executive to seek out commercial 
opportunities, and grants the legal ability to individual american citizens (including 
corporations) to extract thus own any resource in outer space.",Space exploration,8
"the story is incomplete without considering the international treaty system and 
the recent historical context.",Space exploration,8
"american efforts in outer space, reflected through the 
presidential rhetoric and congressional legislation, were focused on extending and 
protecting american hegemonic presence in outer space.",Space exploration,8
"prior to the privatization shift in 
the outer space rhetoric (that occurs in the s), the presidential rhetoric and related 
legislation spoke of scientific advancement and peaceful exploration for the betterment of 
all humanity, through the leadership of “free men” (the united states).",Space exploration,8
"this sentiment is 
more in line with the ethos of the five international outer space tries (including the failed 
 
 
 
 
moon treaty): the common heritage principles of humankind.",Space exploration,8
"the key aspects of the 
common heritage principles (as it relates to outer space law and discussed in the treaties) 
are: a ban on unilateral sovereignty claims, peaceful (demilitarized) exploration of outer 
space, and redistribution of the economic and scientific benefit.",Space exploration,8
"in short, the whole of the 
planet must benefit.",Space exploration,8
"the common heritage principles were initially proposed and long 
supported by member states of the non-aligned movement (nam).",Space exploration,8
"nam’s strong 
support for the common heritage principles was a response to the both cold war conflict 
and political decolonization.",Space exploration,8
"nam worked to represent and protect the interests of the 
third world (most of which were recently independent).",Space exploration,8
"within the bipolar balance of 
power struggles of the cold war, nam was a third voice.",Space exploration,8
"the common heritage 
principles (which were also applied to the deep see and antarctica, in their own forms) 
are part of an effort to constrain the two warring super powers (demilitarization) and 
protect out of reach resources for future generations (an attempt to slow the development 
gap).",Space exploration,8
"reagan’s introduction of commercialization into the outer space rhetoric began 
the movement further away from the common heritage principles in the treaty.",Space exploration,8
"the new 
paradigm focused on cost cutting, budget efficiency, deregulation, and the expansion of 
“free” markets (at the expense of discussing scientific, peaceful exploration for the 
betterment of humanity).",Space exploration,8
"by , congress declared that free market capitalism was the 
only route to successfully develop outer space.",Space exploration,8
"reagan and his successors’ language 
differed from that of their predecessors.",Space exploration,8
"eisenhower and kennedy established a 
framework dedicated to american leadership as the beacon of “free men.” eisenhower 
 
 
 
 
began with a warning of threats to such moral leadership while kennedy presented a 
grand vision of propelling american leadership literally to the moon.",Space exploration,8
"johnson presented a 
hope that the new international outer space treaties would contain the ravages of war to 
the planet, keeping outer space a realm of peaceful exploration, stating his hope that 
astronauts and cosmonauts would interact peacefully on missions of scientific discovery.",Space exploration,8
"reagan introduced privatization and the need for commercial development while 
highlighting the american space “victories” particularly focusing on being the first and 
only state to reach the moon.",Space exploration,8
"bush continued to emphasize this exception 
noting the only flag on the surface is the american flag.",Space exploration,8
"his son, george w. bush, and 
obama continued the privatization rhetoric.",Space exploration,8
"both of the bush’s followed a precedent 
established by previous presidents (such as kennedy) in connecting outer space 
exploration to the colonization of the american west.",Space exploration,8
"obama added legislative and policy 
strength to that endeavor by signing the space act of  and releasing the  
national outer space policy security document.",Space exploration,8
"the  policy document recommitted 
outer space to the national security of the us (which includes commercializing outer 
space through expanding the “free” market into orbit and beyond).",Space exploration,8
"the policy further 
stipulated that the american government will defend its national security interests in 
outer space including its own citizens and actors working to develop it (private 
companies).",Space exploration,8
"this steady progress of commercialization has led to the current 
administration announcement to sell the international space station to private operators.",Space exploration,8
"nearly thirty years after reagan introduced privatization into the outer space rhetoric, the 
 
 
 
 
goal is well on its way to completion: low earth orbit is being developed under free 
market principles.",Space exploration,8
"the marxist theoretical approach to international relations provided a more 
complete understanding of the causes of privatization of american outer space 
exploration.",Space exploration,8
"realist approaches explain the motivations only within the context of rigidly 
defined national security interests, the natural result of states operating in an anarchic 
international system.",Space exploration,8
"the united states chose to privatize its successful outer space 
endeavors because it no longer faced a geo-political rival for dominance; the cold war 
ended with the dissolution of the soviet union.",Space exploration,8
"the ratification of the outer space treaties 
was part of a balancing act with the soviet union while peddling influence with the non-
aligned movement.",Space exploration,8
"however, approaching privatization of outer space exploration as a 
simple matter of national security misses significant shifts in american foreign policy 
and domestic rhetoric.",Space exploration,8
"for example, reagan and his presidential predecessors added 
“free” and “open” markets (re: deregulation) to the definition of american freedom.",Space exploration,8
"the 
national security definition has been expanded to include liberal market extension and 
protection.",Space exploration,8
"this contrasts with the realist approach which presents a narrow definition of 
national security, focusing on hard power definitions: such as military and political 
strength.",Space exploration,8
"marxism, in the context of american outer space exploration, critiques the rise 
and dominance of neoliberal principles within the united states.",Space exploration,8
"neoliberal thought 
gained influence during the crisis of capitalism during the s and s (inflation, 
rising unemployment, opec embargo, etc..) and found political support in the reagan 
 
 
 
 
administration.",Space exploration,8
"reagan began and his predecessor’s continued deregulation of the 
american economy, opening of free trade routes, limits on government spending, and the 
promotion of neoliberal market practices.",Space exploration,8
"since the beginning of the neoliberal practice, 
the american federal government has reduced the nasa budget, shuttered the shuttle 
program, allowed commercial actors to directly launch into outer space, and transferred 
government obligations (such as the iss resupply missions) to commercial actors.",Space exploration,8
"further, american market practices have been extended beyond earth’s orbit with the 
space act of .",Space exploration,8
"neoliberal proponents seek to expand markets into new territory, 
creating new ones if necessary (under the marxist interpretation).",Space exploration,8
"private property, thus 
the enclosure of common land, is necessary for market expansion.",Space exploration,8
"the territory in 
question has to be opened to private enclosure.",Space exploration,8
"anna tsing argues that is what a frontier 
is: a label applied to a time and a place, that exists beyond regulation, though it is created 
by governments.",Space exploration,8
"under treaty, outer space is available to all humanity but free from 
unilateral sovereignty claims.",Space exploration,8
"the legal interpretation of the ban on sovereignty claims is 
in dispute with one side arguing the ban prevents any piece of outer space from being 
claimed.",Space exploration,8
"the united states supports the interpretation that resources removed from a 
celestial body can be claimed as private.",Space exploration,8
this interpretation is codified into us law.,Space exploration,8
"the 
american government has provided a domestic legal pathway for its citizens to claims 
resources in outer space.",Space exploration,8
"the american government has stated and codified into law that 
it will defend its interests and those of its own actors in outer space and defend against 
external interference.",Space exploration,8

outer space, stating it will defend it while supporting american commercial interests in 
 
 
 
 
reaching outer space.",Space exploration,8
"american control and influence is established in low-earth orbit 
with plans to extend to the moon and beyond (the laws are falling into place).",Space exploration,8
"privatization of american outer space exploration is a tool, a function, of 
expanding and protecting american hegemonic influence in orbit and beyond.",Space exploration,8

presidential and legislative rhetoric reveals a multi-decade support for american

race.” the degree of activity was higher than

activity was not sustained, because once people
landed on the moon the race seemed to have been
“won,” as though space exploration was akin to a
sports contest, and having been “won” it lost some
of its attraction and thus us government funding
decreased.",Space exploration,8

communication, and the effects of the
communication thus enabled on the evolution of the
current world order.",Space exploration,8
"unlike most space related
activities, satellites have a lot of commercial and
other practical applications.",Space exploration,8

efforts made to travel to extraterrestrial bodies with

following.",Space exploration,8
 technology forecasting of future space exploration.,Space exploration,8
"if a trend can be quantified based on historical data,
it could be extrapolated to make predictions about
future levels of space exploration activity.",Space exploration,8
" technology foresight of likely scenarios of future
space exploration.",Space exploration,8
"the future will always be fraught
with uncertainty.",Space exploration,8
"the concept of foresight is
distinguished from forecasting in that it is about
determining future possibilities rather than
predicting which one will occur.",Space exploration,8

inherent uncertainty about the future, foresight is a
reasonable approach to understanding the future of
space exploration.",Space exploration,8
" insight into effective national or corporate policy

in the future of space exploration (or other
technologies) is not just about what will eventually
happen.",Space exploration,8

we have collected data and performed exploratory
analyses.",Space exploration,8
"the ultimate goal, however, is to see if we can
extract an overarching trend that will permit
understanding of likely future levels of space
exploration.",Space exploration,8

moore’s law for computer chips and other exponential
curves describing technical performance over time for
various technologies.",Space exploration,8

make predictions about the future because it shows a
trend.",Space exploration,8

predictions hold when the data finally becomes
available.",Space exploration,8

basis for projection and thus does not support
technology forecasting.",Space exploration,8
"thus for forecasting purposes a
curve that shows a trend is better.",Space exploration,8
how can a trend curve be found?,Space exploration,8
"first, there must
be an underlying trend in order for a valid trend curve to
exist and be found.",Space exploration,8
"satellite
launches and visits to extraterrestrial bodies, which we
analyzed herein, are obvious candidates for model
components.",Space exploration,8
"it is not clear however if those components
are sufficient.",Space exploration,8
"other components that might need to be
accounted for are the following.",Space exploration,8
 the international space station.,Space exploration,8
"the space station
is not an astronautical body and, while a satellite, is
a much bigger part of the whole space exploration
picture than an ordinary satellite.",Space exploration,8
"most astronauts
currently go there, for example.",Space exploration,8
"if it were not for the
existence of the international space station (iss),
perhaps other exploration activity would be done
instead.",Space exploration,8
"activities related to the iss have
constituted a significant portion of space
exploration during the period of existence of the
iss.",Space exploration,8
 the us space shuttle program.,Space exploration,8
"like the iss, the us
space shuttle program made up a significant
fraction of the overall space exploration effort, but
is not represented adequately when focusing on
satellites or interplanetary missions.",Space exploration,8
"catlett ) exists that may support including the
space shuttle program in a model of space
exploration.",Space exploration,8
"to properly model space exploration activity,
various parameters must be defined.",Space exploration,8
"for example, does
a trip to the moon count less than a trip to mars?",Space exploration,8
"also different types of contact with the
destination need to be distinguished.",Space exploration,8
"for example, a soft
landing with a rover and a return trip should presumably
count more than a flyby.",Space exploration,8
"we have done this in an ad hoc
manner as described earlier.",Space exploration,8
"a principled approach to
inferring these numbers would be better, but it is not
clear what is the best way to do it.",Space exploration,8
"one approach to the parameter tuning problem
posed by the foregoing paragraph is to seek parameter
values that result in a space exploration trend curve that
is relatively smooth and extrapolatable.",Space exploration,8
"but is
determining parameter values that way fair?",Space exploration,8
"here, in a
nutshell, are the “no” and “yes” arguments.",Space exploration,8
"the counterargument to choosing
parameters that result in an extrapolatable curve is
simply that it looks too much like an attempt to force
fit the data to a curve.",Space exploration,8
"it appears to be the dual of the
overfitting problem in machine learning: instead of
finding an overly complicated curve that fits data
that might in fact be more noise than signal, this
approach involves finding a complicated
transformation of the data values to fit a simple
curve.",Space exploration,8
"a set of parameter values that results
in an extrapolatable curve is not, in itself, a claim
that the curve is a valid model for space exploration
activity over time.",Space exploration,8
"as just discussed it might be no
more than a force fit of the data with no predictive
value for future years.",Space exploration,8
"on the other hand, it might
turn out to have the desired predictive ability, and
thus be part of a useful model.",Space exploration,8
"only time can tell
which possibility applies, but one thing that can be
known immediately is that the parameter values
form a hypothesis.",Space exploration,8
"this hypothesis will be tested by
future events.",Space exploration,8
"if future events follow the resulting
curve’s extrapolation, that is corroborating evidence
for the hypothesis (i.e., the model and its parameter
values).",Space exploration,8
"if future events do not comply with the
extrapolation, that is evidence against the
hypothesis.",Space exploration,8
"different sets of parameter weights would provide
different hypotheses, and these each can be tested
against future events.",Space exploration,8
"if a set of parameter weights can
be justified by domain facts and historical context, the
hypothesis embodied by that set of weights gains
explanatory heft as well.",Space exploration,8
"ultimately a model of
advancement in space exploration over time may be
derived that, like the exponential and other laws shown
to be useful with various other technologies, will be
shown to predict future levels of space exploration
activity.",Space exploration,8

"accepting vr as another form of teaching and learning 
modality is inevitable based on the emerging current research about the pedagogical benefits of 
vr.",Virtual reality,9
"as the research is conducted, it will be important to consider: learning and teaching within 
d (virtual learning spaces); the affordances of vr; theoretical construction of learning; working 
models for practice; basic standards for the implementation of this modality; and guidelines that 
take into consideration issues of ethics and policy (fowler, ).",Virtual reality,9
"despite the advantages of virtual reality within k- education, there are several limitations for 
consideration which include: the cost factor; the need to balance pedagogy with technology; 
possible health and safety issues when engaging virtual reality encounters; gaps between the 
technological divide; and the acknowledgement that virtual reality will not replace the physical 
experiences.",Virtual reality,9
"the development of the virtual reality modality will require additional research and 
consciousness of those involved to recognize that this modality should not replace physical 
encounters.",Virtual reality,9
"what is needed for a low tech virtual reality experience 
 
historically, virtual reality systems have been extensive and financially out of reach for 
educational institutions on a budget.",Virtual reality,9
"recent product releases, as well as the prevalence of 
smartphones, has led to a new breed of virtual reality systems that allow for a low-cost virtual 
reality experience.",Virtual reality,9
the hardware involved in creating such experiences is relatively simple.,Virtual reality,9
"all 
that is needed to provide a virtual reality experience is a virtual reality headset and a device, such 
as a smartphone, that can be placed within the headset.",Virtual reality,9
"however, it should be noted that 
standalone headsets are being developed.",Virtual reality,9
"for a smartphone to operate, the user will need to 
download software to the smartphone.",Virtual reality,9

for free.",Virtual reality,9
"however, it is important to note that not all smartphones are compatible with the google 
cardboard app.",Virtual reality,9
"concerning standalone virtual devices, it should be noted that several manufacturers have 
released virtual reality headsets that are built from a variety of low-cost materials.",Virtual reality,9
"the cost 
ranges anywhere from single digit dollars to three digits or more depending on the quality of the 
unit.",Virtual reality,9
"the software varies, but most use an app that essentially splits the smartphone screen into 
two images.",Virtual reality,9
the smartphone is then attached to the virtual reality headset.,Virtual reality,9
"if the virtual reality 
experience includes sound, then headphones can be used as well.",Virtual reality,9
"as with most technologies, lower cost means limited capability when compared to high-cost 
systems.",Virtual reality,9
"even so, the low-cost experience can provide great benefits to students when added to 
learning experiences.",Virtual reality,9
there are also minimum technical requirements that should be considered.,Virtual reality,9
current compatibility is congruent with most of the upper level mobile operating systems.,Virtual reality,9
"however, there are phone size requirements, and some of the older mobile operating systems can 
cause the experience to be problematic or altogether inoperative.",Virtual reality,9

of a virtual environment called the void provides a look into the virtual reality pathway of the 
future.",Virtual reality,9

walk around while virtually navigating the environment.",Virtual reality,9

experiences, physical movement interacts with virtual movement to create a more complete 
immersive experience (ted ).",Virtual reality,9

the formulations according to physical properties.",Virtual reality,9
"• show the typical structure of inverse augmented reality systems
and present the proof of concept for iar.",Virtual reality,9

"dual-world structure
the proposed inverse augmented reality and the traditional aug-
mented reality, as shown in fig.",Virtual reality,9
", are under the unified dual-world
structure.",Virtual reality,9
"the traditional augmented reality (human-centered obser-
vation) is to augment the physical world with virtual objects, while
the inverse augmented reality (virtual agent-centered observation) is
to augment the virtual world with real objects.",Virtual reality,9
"there might be a misconception between the proposed “inverse
augmented reality” and another well-known concept called “aug-
mented virtuality”.",Virtual reality,9
"even though the two concepts are all describing
using real elements in the physical world to augment virtual ele-
ments in the virtual world, their positions are definitely different.",Virtual reality,9
"the augmented virtuality means that it is the human who can see a
scene where the virtual elements are augmented by real elements,
and the human himself is located in the real world.",Virtual reality,9
"conversely,
the inverse augmented reality means that it is the virtual agent who
can see a scene where the virtual elements are augmented by real
elements, and the virtual agent itself is located in the virtual world.
. mathematical model
take the visual ar and iar as the example, the formulation for ar
and iar can be as follows.",Virtual reality,9
"physical perspective of inverse augmented re-
ality
in this work, we emphasize the equivalence of the virtual world and
the physical world regarding the structure in physics.",Virtual reality,9
"the referred
physics here contains both the physical world and the virtual world,
i.e., the virtual world is treated as a kind of existence in physics,
which possesses the same structure with the physical world.",Virtual reality,9
"in this
way, iar has the same important role as the traditional ar.",Virtual reality,9
"we use
a definition called physical equivalence to elaborate the equivalence
of the physical world and the virtual world.",Virtual reality,9
"as a correspondence, the same structure applies
to inverse augmented reality.",Virtual reality,9
"concretely, inverse augmented reality
also contains three key components, i.e., the virtual character, the
programmable virtual world and the physical contents added to the
virtual world.",Virtual reality,9
"we emphasize the spatial structure rather than the
appearance, because the difference regarding appearance is obvious.",Virtual reality,9
"for example, all objects in the virtual world are data that are first
created by human and then develop independently.",Virtual reality,9
"though the
appearance is different, the spatial structure can be similar, especially
the physical roles and interaction ways.
. self development
as a common knowledge, the physical world we live in is keeping
developing all the time.",Virtual reality,9
"it seems to be driven by a kind of energy
with the form of physical roles.",Virtual reality,9
"meanwhile, humans are born with
intelligence, so they can actively interact with the physical world.",Virtual reality,9
"since the virtual world is expected to be developing by itself, it
should have two kinds of agents, i.e., the character agent and the
environment agent [].",Virtual reality,9
"the character agent can be treated as a
virtual human in the virtual world, while the environment agent
determines how the virtual environment can develop automatically.",Virtual reality,9
"the two agents are created by our physical world, then they construct
the virtual world and develop independently without being directly
controlled by the physical world.",Virtual reality,9
"the agents can not only learn from
physical world but also evolve by themselves.",Virtual reality,9
"notice that only the
character agents can observe things in the proposed framework of
inverse augmented reality.
. equal-status interaction
considering the traditional ar and the proposed iar, the physical
world and the virtual world are equal to each other regarding inter-
action.",Virtual reality,9
"as we often see in the traditional ar, a human can interact
with both real and virtual objects that have been observed by him.",Virtual reality,9
"similarly, the character agent in the virtual world can interact with
both virtual and real objects that have been observed by the agent.",Virtual reality,9
"and the
physical way to realize this physical effect is expected to be con-
trolled by the virtual agent.",Virtual reality,9
"this is surely very hard for the current
technology, but it is an essential part for iar to support an equal
interaction process compared with the traditional ar.",Virtual reality,9
"therefore, the
equal-status interaction may need to be further studied and realized
in the future.",Virtual reality,9

typical demonstration of iar using an office environment.",Virtual reality,9
"we add
a virtual cube floating above the table, which is located by a small
photo.",Virtual reality,9
"the small photo is fixed on the top of a table, which serves as
a bridge connecting the physical world and the virtual world.",Virtual reality,9
"after
the environment is constructed, two views from the different worlds
are shown in fig. . in the traditional augmented reality, the user
can see the physical environment and the virtual element (a cube
with the checkerboard pattern), and she can also interact with the
virtual element.",Virtual reality,9
"in the inverse augmented reality, a virtual agent
is constructed, and it can behave like a physical human.",Virtual reality,9
"though
what can be “seen” by the agent is absolutely some data, we can still

"in this paper, we propose the big framework of the traditional aug-
mented reality and the inverse augmented reality.",Virtual reality,9
"then we illustrate
the main properties of this framework.",Virtual reality,9
"under this framework, we
emphasize that the self-intelligence would play an important role in
the virtual world, which contributes greatly to building an inverse
augmented reality system.",Virtual reality,9
"we also present a typical implementation
of an inverse augmented reality system, which shows the inverse
augmented reality can be realized with most current techniques.",Virtual reality,9

mainly include three aspects:
() physical construction of virtual objects in the physical world.",Virtual reality,9
() specific design of virtual-to-physical bridges.,Virtual reality,9
() intelligence and knowledge for the self-driven virtual world.,Virtual reality,9

ivr into a more general framework in order to represent the reality
at a higher level than what we have done currently.",Virtual reality,9

the virtual agent could experience in both the virtual and the real
world can be well illustrated.",Virtual reality,9

instructional strategies-social stories.,Virtual reality,9
"the use of social stories can be done in 
classrooms to describe a social situation or social events.",Virtual reality,9
"it uses social cues and defines the 
responses that are appropriate for the social situation (gray & garand, ).",Virtual reality,9
"a social story is 
usually made up of different kinds of sentences, either descriptive, directive, or perspective

"they should be written from the perspective 
of the student and also written at the comprehension level of the student so vocabulary is at 
their ability level (gray & garand, ).",Virtual reality,9
"and social stories are most effective when written 
for specific students and with specific situations in mind (pankaskie & chandler, ).",Virtual reality,9
"a study done in  used social stories with three elementary students with a goal of 
increasing verbal initiations (delano & snell).",Virtual reality,9

"a third area of intervention that 
may be used are peer based strategies, which can include peer mentoring, buddy systems, and 
partner systems (salend, ).",Virtual reality,9
"this involves the increasing of social and/or academic 
interactions between students with and without disabilities.",Virtual reality,9
"it can be done in many different 
ways and in combination with other instructional strategies.",Virtual reality,9

impact it would have on students with autism who attended mainstream secondary schools.",Virtual reality,9
results of the study show several key points.,Virtual reality,9
"first, results showed a positive impact on self-
esteem levels, decreases in bullying, and increases in social satisfaction for the students with 
autism.",Virtual reality,9
"second, the peer mentors also had a positive impact on student’s social life and the 
feeling of being included.",Virtual reality,9
"third, there was an increase in the fact that students saw their peers 
as being a source of support.",Virtual reality,9
"and fourth, being a peer mentor increased the likelihood that 
students with autism recognized that they could be a source of support for their peers.",Virtual reality,9

behavior.",Virtual reality,9

of visual cues but did not clarify the effects of using the social stories alone.",Virtual reality,9
"an article by christine ogilvie () discussed the idea of using video models and 
peer mentors in social skills instruction.",Virtual reality,9
"again, the idea of combining the methods was 
addressed and the article stated that when using video modeling with peer mentoring, one can 
provide a “greater impact” (oglivie, ).",Virtual reality,9

modeling including video prompting, in-vivo modeling, video modeling and video self-
modeling.",Virtual reality,9
it also listed the ten steps to video modeling.,Virtual reality,9
"a key first step for teachers to create 
effective videos is making sure that the behavior that is being introduced or modified is 
identified.",Virtual reality,9
"the next step would then be to find out where the student’s skill level is for that 
behavior.",Virtual reality,9
"the third step would be to choose student peers who can help in creating the video 
models.",Virtual reality,9
then the task of creating the video is next.,Virtual reality,9
"once the video model is created, it is time 
to start the intervention.",Virtual reality,9
this is another time where peer mentors can be used.,Virtual reality,9
"together the 
students can review the video model and practice the skill.",Virtual reality,9
"this combination can be a very 
effective tool to use with asd students.",Virtual reality,9
one method is the use of virtual reality.,Virtual reality,9

"this study done by john woodward 
() stated that while the use of virtual reality is “seductive”, the reality is that the success

"another study done in 
 used virtual reality with asd students as a tool for learning.",Virtual reality,9

for this skill to generalize into the real world so that these students would be able to recognize 
real world safety signs.",Virtual reality,9

that the students were comfortable with navigating and using the vr equipment.",Virtual reality,9
"once they 
completed four training trials, the virtual café environment was used to work on daily skills.",Virtual reality,9
this environment was more complex than the training environment with a more realistic look.,Virtual reality,9
participants were given a checklist of tasks to perform while in the virtual café.,Virtual reality,9
"minimal 
prompting was given to students and when participants ask about upcoming tasks, they were 
directed back to the checklist that was provided.",Virtual reality,9
"some results from the study: for each task 
given in the virtual café, the asd group scored lowest (except for the card shift test) and the 
piq group scored the highest.",Virtual reality,9
"in general, the piq groups scored higher on tasks that either the 
asd group and the viq group.",Virtual reality,9
"overall, the piq group seemed to be quickest in the areas of 
completing trials and navigation while the viq group had an uneven profile and the asd 
group seemed to show improvements across the trials.",Virtual reality,9
"one finding that was discussed was 
that asd participants in this study, with lower iq’s, were more likely to err on tasks 
involving social judgement, which may suggest there is a link between social understanding 
and iq.",Virtual reality,9

those , eleven were chosen to participate in the next session, phase ii, which consisted of 
two longer vr experiences (about  minutes) which were more intense.",Virtual reality,9

"during both phases, all participants were 
willing and able to wear the hdm.",Virtual reality,9
"from the wasi, the participants were divided into two 
groups (iq’s less than or equal to , iq’s greater than or equal to ).",Virtual reality,9
"results showed that iq 
did not affect the acceptance of wearing and using the hdm.",Virtual reality,9
"this study revealed, from the 
questionnaires given and observations, that asd participants accepted the hmd and were 
willing to complete the vr experiences.",Virtual reality,9
"these findings were important because they provided 
initial evidence that for this group of asd participants, there was minimal negative effects 
using virtual reality devices 
 
 
from wearing a hmd.",Virtual reality,9
"these results help to shed light on how people with asd react to and 
accept the use of hdm.",Virtual reality,9
"all of the literature that was reviewed and discussed points to a 
conclusion.",Virtual reality,9
"this conclusion is that social skills intervention is needed for asd students and 
while there are many different methods that have been used, there are very few that have 
incorporated the use of virtual reality.",Virtual reality,9
"many of the studies showed a greater positive impact on students when using methods 
in unison with each other verses independently.",Virtual reality,9
