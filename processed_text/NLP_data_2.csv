"most construction organizations react negatively to ‘data 
sharing’ culture and shy upon the idea of data privacy and 
confidentiality",Big data
"while this conjures towards the understanding of data 
as a valuable commodity among construction stakeholders most 
quantity surveyors result towards capitalizing personal relationship to 
access data",Big data
"reflecting to this issue big data value is seen to derived 
upon data centralization benefit to quantity surveyors",Big data
"codes analysis 
further emphasize on alternative for data access whereby big data 
facilitate qs professionals to access data which were previously hard or 
seems impossible to access",Big data
"from the perspective of work process data 
centralization allows accessibility across time and geographical 
horizons",Big data
"hence analysis indicates that qs professionals are facilitated 
by early data access in addressing construction projects",Big data
"for instance a

project financial planning pursuance is limited up to delivery of 
construction building",Big data
"estimates rarely incorporate costings on building

"next detail analysis on ‘data centralization’ codes in emphasised 
consistent interpretation of national data standard",Big data
"big data enables qs 
professionals to have a national data standard",Big data
"a respondent code b 
had highlighted on the issues of inconsistent and data misinterpretation 
across construction stakeholders even within qs professionals",Big data
"based 
on the respondent’s experience as an academic as well as an industry 
practitioner the respondent observed differences on simple 
interpretation such as gross floor area gfa",Big data
"respondent b had further 
indicated that the value of big data can be understood through data 
centralization and standardization of data context managed throughout 
data processing stage",Big data
"this allows qs professionals as well as 
construction stakeholders to have a universal understanding 
encouraging smooth communication between those parties",Big data
"next detail analysis on ‘true reflection’ pattern coding interprets the 
understanding of big data allowing qs professionals to access data that 
are trustworthy free from perspective bias representing current 
industry context authenticity",Big data
"respondents were seen to describe this 
value in relation to the issue of current data access are of clouded 
genuinely",Big data
"with an experience working with a contractor and 
consulting firms respondent f had noticed bias between a quotation 
submitted to contractor and consultants by suppliers over the same 
materials or work items",Big data
"thus data received by qs professions 
perhaps depends on sector position influence and were not the true 
reflection of industry context",Big data
"however big data is supported by strict 
data processing and management ethics",Big data
"data management process 
allows standardization on data as mentioned above while data filtering 
process allow data context to address any ‘off’ data or data that do not 
conferred to the current data accumulation value or understanding",Big data
this allow insights generation to be free or with minimal bias,Big data
"other 
interviewees postulate similar respond where bias in data tempers qs

professionals can be further understood through improvement on 
analysis capability such as accessing contractor’s tendering strategy",Big data
"moreover genuine data helps constitute towards setting ‘par’ data 
values on construction resources believed to channel healthy 
competition culture in the construction industry",Big data

"codes were further addressed with ‘data 
driven decision making’",Big data
"analysis indicates that this value is 
consistently described along with ‘guesstimate’ issue highlighted by 
interviewees",Big data
"currently qs professionals are reported to practice 
‘guesstimate’ or several other terms such as rule of thumb’ ‘magic 
wand’ and ‘experience’ to manage or predict uncertainty as part of 
decisionmaking process prior to delivering services",Big data
"these terms 
express the understanding of qs professional practicing gutfeeling 
decision making",Big data
"consistently respondent d h m and f argue the 
need for this profession to skew away from ‘guesstimate’ as decisions 
are made based on personal opinion secluded upon grey areas of 
decisionmaking process",Big data
"‘guesstimate’ decision making implies risks 
towards service output such as advice to clients as decisions are derived 
based on dubious basis and desultory understanding",Big data
"the context of big data managing uncertainty further expanded with 
perspective of respondent i q b n and g the respondent’s 
understanding on uncertainty resides on ‘variables’ that differs 
according to project peculiarity constantly changing and are not within 
qs’s control during the process of decision making in completing job 
scope",Big data

 how blockchain works
the blockchain literally a “chain of blocks” made its first appearance in the research scenario in
 in the frame of the bitcoin initiative ",Blockchain
"the objective was to transfer online payments from
one party to another without relying on intermediaries",Blockchain
"in this context the blockchain was acting
as the underlying ledger recording bitcoin transfers and guaranteeing by means of cryptographic
operations the authentication and nonrepudiation of payments",Blockchain
even though bitcoin is by far the most famous cryptocurrency it is not alone,Blockchain
"in fact since 
more than  cryptocurrencies have been created  which are being used as exchange tokens in
many different blockchainbased applications",Blockchain
the core concepts behind the blockchain technology are reported in the following,Blockchain
" transactions each cryptocurrency transfer from one subject to another is represented as a
transaction from a to b cryptocurrency is neither a physical nor a software object but the result
of incoming and outgoing transactions",Blockchain
"for this reason the blockchain keeps track of all the
transactions occurred from its birth",Blockchain
 blocks transactions are grouped in blocks,Blockchain
"each block collects all the transactions occurring in
a given timeframe and keeps a reference to the preceding block that is where the concept of
“chain” comes from",Blockchain
"future internet     of 
 nodes instead of being stored in a centralized database the blockchain is spread over network
computers the “nodes” each containing a local copy of the entire blockchain",Blockchain
" majority consensus since a central authority is missing decisions on the network are made
according to a majority consensus",Blockchain
"each node modifies its local copy of the blockchain to make it
mirror the status of the majority of the network nodes",Blockchain
" mining nodes could either passively store a copy of the blockchain or actively take part to
the maintenance of the blockchain in the socalled “mining” process",Blockchain

"the above example should have allowed the reader to get better acquainted with the main
characteristics of the blockchain which make it a disruptive technology
 decentralized validation the validation of transactions is performed by network nodes without
the need of intermediaries
 data redundancy each network node has a local copy of the blockchain which prevents
data losses
 data immutability data stored in the blockchain could not be modified or deleted
 trust cryptography enables trust between parties since a transaction that has been validated
using user’s credentials cannot be repudiated
 transparency everyone could read the blockchain and the transactions stored in it",Blockchain
"though the example in figure  refers to a transfer of cryptocurrency application possibilities of
the blockchain are not limited to monetary assets but could encompass a wide variety of use cases",Blockchain
"among the early application scenarios that were explored for the blockchain it is worth recalling
the notarial context",Blockchain
"in fact since the blockchain is immutable and publicly available researchers
suggested using it for storing public records and attestations ",Blockchain
"another domain where the blockchain
has been recognized to be able to bring significant benefits is intellectual property protection",Blockchain
"in this
context blockchain technology could be used to provecertify the existence of a document at a given
time ",Blockchain
"in contexts where eg freedom of thought is threatened blockchain technology could be
used to store information in order to avoid censorship  in fact everyone can write information on
the blockchain and read it",Blockchain
"as time has passed researchers have realized that the blockchain could also be used to store other
kinds of assets including pieces of code",Blockchain
"it was the birth of “smart contracts” ie small programs
stored in the blockchain and programmed to autonomously behave in a given manner when some
conditions are met",Blockchain
"the idea of a smart contract has been known since the s  but it was only with the blockchain
technology—and in particular with the ethereum blockchain probably the most famous blockchain
after bitcoin—that smart contracts were able to unleash their full potential ",Blockchain
"with a smart contract a person could for instance encode hisher will in the blockchain in the
form of a set of rules",Blockchain
"in case of death the smart contract could then automatically transfer the testator’s
money or other kind of assets to the beneficiary",Blockchain
"the testator may also provide additional constraints
such as enabling the transfer only when the beneficiary reaches the age of majority when heshe
obtains a diploma etc",Blockchain
"since smart contracts’ conditions are based on data stored in the blockchain they need to rely
on external services which take data from the “real” world eg from death records and push them
to the blockchain or vice versa",Blockchain
these services are referred to as “oracles” ,Blockchain
"by considering
the testator’s example an oracle could inspect death records to identify whether the person passed
future internet     of 
away",Blockchain
"if so it could write this information on the blockchain eg by changing the value of a boolean
variable indicating whether the person is alive or not",Blockchain
"the smart contract then would trigger a
conditional statement based on the value of the variable and execute the block of code initiating the
money transfer",Blockchain
"based on the type of information collected and on the interaction with the external world oracles
have been grouped into “software”“hardware” oracles and “inbound”“outbound” oracles ",Blockchain
"software oracles are in charge of extracting information mainly from web sources whereas hardware
oracles are meant to extract information from the physical world eg through sensors",Blockchain
"inbound
oracles insert information in the blockchain whereas outbound oracles allow smart contracts to send
information to the external world eg letting hotels’ intelligent lockers unlock themselves as soon as
a person pays for a night",Blockchain
"oracles have a huge responsibility in the correct execution of smart contracts as the insertion
of wrong information could trigger a money transfer without possibility of refund",Blockchain
"thus there are
companies that have developed oracles that certify the authenticity of extracted data for a small
cost ",Blockchain
"in some cases it could be worth relying on more than one oracle eg by considering a
situation as “happened” if  out of  oracles confirm it ",Blockchain
"recently an even more complex application of smart contracts and oracles was proposed which
is associated to the concept of decentralized autonomous organization or daos ",Blockchain
"in this context
smart contracts are used to encode rules to govern an organization eg how decisions are taken
the weight of each member’s vote etc",Blockchain
"the advantage is that no external party is required to verify
that the organization is properly managed and underlying rules can be verified by the wider public
ensuring transparency and trust",Blockchain
"from the architectural point of view it is worth remarking that there exist different types of
blockchains which differ in terms of readwrite permissions",Blockchain
"“public blockchains” such as the bitcoin
blockchain are blockchains that could be readable and potentially writable by everyone",Blockchain
"“private
blockchains” are blockchains that could be written only by organization members",Blockchain
"read permissions
can be either restricted to the organization or made public",Blockchain
"in “consortium blockchains” a set of
selected nodes belonging to different institutions control validation and the blockchain is used to
share information among participant institutions",Blockchain
"public blockchains are particularly useful when
no central entity is available to verify a transaction and full decentralization is needed",Blockchain
"private
and consortium blockchains provide some advantages such as lower validation costs and shorter
validation times given the fact that because of the smaller number of nodes the mathematical problem
can be simplified reduced risk of attacks since nodes that validate transactions are known and
increased privacy as read permissions could be granted only to selected nodes",Blockchain
"furthermore in case
of errors or bugs in smart contracts private and consortium blockchains could extraordinarily modify
or revert previous transactions",Blockchain
"the choice of the type of blockchain to adopt should be based on the amount of decentralization
required and on timecost constraints ",Blockchain
"eventually some hybrid solutions exploiting crosschain
exchange layers between public and private blockchains could be exploited  eg by using a
private blockchain for a company’s backend activities and a public blockchain for receivingsending
money fromto customers",Blockchain
"finally it must be underlined that when selecting the blockchain to
use one should pay attention to avoiding decentralization for the sake of itself",Blockchain
"in fact a number of
companies’ processes are currently managed in a successful way using relational databases and the
switch to a private blockchain could not be worth the effort ",Blockchain
"with respect to private blockchains
versus centralized databases experts argue that “the biggest advantages of private blockchains in
comparison to centralized databases are cryptographic auditing and known identities",Blockchain
"nobody can
tamper with the data and mistakes can be traced back” ",Blockchain
"others suggest that a blockchain could be
a solution more suitable than a database only in case a company “plans to start privately and evolve
into a regular public blockchain for public crossverification as demandvolume grows” ",Blockchain
"blockchain applications in insurance selected use cases
as illustrated in the previous section advantages of blockchain are various",Blockchain
"a number of
enthusiasts already proposed using this technology in various sectors and contexts including
 government  to record in a transparent way citizens’ votes or politicians’ programs for
verifying if promises made have been kept or to enable autonomous governance systems 
 intellectual property  to certify the proof of existence and authorship of a document
 internet  to reduce censorships by exploiting the immutability of data stored in
the blockchain
 finance  to transfer money between parties without having to rely on banks
 commerce  to record goods’ characteristics as well as their ownership especially for luxury
goods thus reducing the market of counterfeitstolen items
 internet of things iot – eg by exploiting smart contracts to automatically process
data coming from sensors in order to let intelligent machines interact with each other  and
autonomously take actions when specific situations occur
 education  to store information on qualifications acquired by learners eg to reduce job
application frauds in this context multiple actors eg universities training institutions etc",Blockchain
"could write qualifications achieved by a person on the blockchain human resources staff could
then easily obtain information about when and where a given competency was obtained",Blockchain
"a rather comprehensive overview of applications developed in each of the above sectors can be
found in ",Blockchain
"what should be evident from the above list is that benefits deriving from the adoption
of blockchain technology are not limited to a single sectorscenario",Blockchain
"moreover even within a given
sector blockchain can have different impacts considering the various stakeholders operating in it their
business models their needs etc",Blockchain
"in the following the attention will be specifically devoted to the insurance sector where the
use of blockchain could positively affect different internal processes from customer acquisition
and management to frauds prevention etc",Blockchain
"and could even allow companies to reach new
markets ",Blockchain
"in particular a selection of use cases that could potentially benefit from blockchain
technology will be introduced",Blockchain
"for some use cases prototype implementations have already been
developed",Blockchain
in other cases the use of blockchain has been only analyzed from a theoretical point of view,Blockchain
for each use case advantages disadvantages and impact on the insurance domain will be discussed,Blockchain
" improvement of customer experience and reduction of operating costs
in this use case blockchain and smart contracts could be exploited to increase the speed of claim
processing as well as to reduce the costs and mistakes associated with the manual processing of
claims",Blockchain
"from this perspective a smart contract could encode the rules for enabling the transfer of
refund from the company to the insured",Blockchain
"a simple application could consist of triggering an automatic transfer of refund only if the
customer repairs the car at a certified mechanic with the mechanic sending a transaction to the smart
contract to prove its identity",Blockchain
more complex use cases could also involve oracles to gather information from the real world,Blockchain
"to make an example in crop insurance an oracle could periodically check weather data and push this
information in the blockchain",Blockchain
"a smart contract could then read these data and trigger a payment in
case of persistence of bad weather",Blockchain
these problems have been dealt with for instance in the prototype presented in ,Blockchain
"in this case
the focus is on travel insurances and the idea is to exploit a smart contract developed on the ethereum
blockchain for automatically refunding travelers if their flighttrain was delayed",Blockchain
"another interesting use case which could widely benefit from the increasing diffusion of sensors
is the exploitation of smart contracts in combination with iot",Blockchain
"for instance homes could be equipped
future internet     of 
with sensors that can directly notify a smart contract of a damage eg damp sensors could be used to
monitor damages on the roof ",Blockchain
"similarly smart appliances could automatically monitor their state
and initiate a claim or directly contact the repairer for a quicker assistance when needed",Blockchain
"solutions such as the ones envisioned above bring benefits to different actors to the insurance
company which could reduce the amount of resources normally devoted to claim processing but also
to customers who would receive money even before having become aware of the damage",Blockchain
another advantage would come from the fact that everyone could inspect the smart contract,Blockchain
"that is the customer undersigning a policy would get a clear idea of its contractual conditions even
though at the moment heshe should master some programming skills in order to understand
the smart contract code",Blockchain
consequently it would become easier for himher to compare policies,Blockchain
"furthermore the choice of a policy would no more based only on how much heshe trusts a given
company since trust would be implicitly guaranteed by the smart contract but on objective data",Blockchain
"despite these advantages it must be said that the scenario above could be adopted only for a
limited number of policies",Blockchain
"in fact the majority of claims processed by insurance companies still need
to be evaluated by an external expert before being settled",Blockchain
"in case of manual processing however
the customer experience could still be improved by managing payments in cryptocurrencies whose
transfer would be quicker than with traditional methods several seconds or minutes depending on
the blockchain used",Blockchain
"from the architectural point of view probably the most suitable choice is to adopt a combination
of private and public blockchains",Blockchain
"the private blockchain could be used to record policies and
claims data whereas the public blockchain could be used to trigger the refund in terms of tradable
cryptocurrencies such as ethers or bitcoins",Blockchain
"the private blockchain could be maintained by trusted
company’s computersnodes characterized by lower mining costs with regard to those of public
blockchains",Blockchain
"the public blockchain would be maintained by the wider public through the mining
incentives presented in section ",Blockchain
"alternatively the company could decide to exploit only a public
blockchain",Blockchain
"this choice could be successful in case the company needs to improve its own reputation
and obtain customers’ trust as the process would be fully decentralized but would imply higher
transaction costs",Blockchain
" data entryidentity verification
the cryptographic mechanism underlying the blockchain could be used to reduce the overhead
related to manual data entry and verification of new customers ",Blockchain
"with the blockchain customers would be identified by a unique address eg the one linked to
their wallet",Blockchain
"the first time they use a service a certified intermediary would verify their identity and
link it to their address",Blockchain
"from that time on every time they undersign a policy they would no more
need to provide an identification document rather they would only need to use their credentials",Blockchain
"benefits of this use case could be seen again in a reduced time and cost to gatherprovide
information",Blockchain
nonetheless this use case also has some relevant drawbacks the company should be aware of,Blockchain
a first drawback is related to the possible losssteal of credentials,Blockchain
"as said since the blockchain works
without intermediaries no one could reset users’ credentials",Blockchain
"a solution could be to rely on external
services which could store credentials and return them to the users in case of loss",Blockchain
"however using such
services would mean providing someone else access to one’s sensitive information",Blockchain
"another drawback
is linked to the fact that the current legal regulations should be modified to include blockchainbased
identification and some governments could refuse to approve this type of identification eg due to
mistrust in the technology",Blockchain
"from the architectural point of view companies deciding to exploit blockchainbased know your
customer kyc could rely on external services running on public blockchains",Blockchain
"in fact some kyc
services recently appeared offering some prototypes based on existing blockchains",Blockchain
"one example is
civic  based on the bitcoin blockchain and kyc legal  exploiting the ethereum blockchain",Blockchain
"future internet     of 
such companies already built a network of validators which receive a reward for each performed
validation and charge small fees to companies requiring their services",Blockchain
" premium computationrisk assessmentfrauds prevention
in this scenario the blockchain is used to let multiple certified intermediaries record information
related to a person by linking them to hisher address",Blockchain
"such intermediaries could be insurance companies eg to record previous claims police officers
eg to store criminal acts medical staffs eg to record a person’s injuries and treatments or even
smart wearable devices which could inject in the blockchain data about one’s physical activity",Blockchain
"a smart contract could read all the information linked to a person and automatically compute the
premium and perform risk assessment based on hisher physical health driving behaviors etc",Blockchain
another application scenario is represented by fraud prevention,Blockchain
"in this scenario a smart contract
could analyze collected data and identify frauds during claim processing eg by crossing data related
to a person’s previous claims",Blockchain
"a scenario such as the one depicted in the above examples however could be difficultly realized in
the short term",Blockchain
"in fact it implies that each person possesses a unique blockchain address as presented
in section ",Blockchain
" and requires the active involvement of different actors insurance companies police
officers medical staff etc",Blockchain
"as the quality of the results would be a consequence of the quality and
quantity of data stored in the blockchain",Blockchain
"privacy is another relevant issue especially for what it
concerns medical records",Blockchain
"in this view in the construction of such a system a thorough attention
should be devoted to let only selected actors link information extracted from the blockchain to
a person’s identity",Blockchain
"furthermore particular care should be devoted to the definition of common
standards to record the information in order to enable interoperability",Blockchain
the most suitable architecture for this use case is a consortium blockchain,Blockchain
"the blockchain would
be maintained by selected nodes of the consortium eg belonging to the different actors involved",Blockchain
the limited number of trusted nodes would increase security and privacy,Blockchain
"furthermore the blockchain
would keep track of the sender of each transaction",Blockchain
"finally being controlled by a small number of
nodes mechanisms to revert blockchain state in case of transactions erroneously made eg a driving
infraction notified to the wrong person could be devised",Blockchain
" payperusemicroinsurance
smart contracts and blockchainbased payments could enable new revenue sources such as micro
and payperuse insurances",Blockchain
"though in the past microinsurances were threatened by administrative
costs the exploitation of smart contracts could enable quick and cheap policy undersignment and
management even on mobile devices ",Blockchain
"similarly payperuse insurances could become a praxis
possibly in combination with iot solutions for automatic undersignment",Blockchain
"for instance gps data could
be used to automatically collect eg a travel premium only if the customer is abroad a car premium
only when the car is moving etc",Blockchain
"payperuse mechanisms could be exploited in services such as uber
or airbnb eg activating the service when a customer is picked up or hosted",Blockchain
"with respect to the other use cases described in the paper from the point of view of actors and
technology to be involved this is probably one of the quickest and easiest to be realized because of
the limited number of involved actors and because the feasibility of prototypal solutions has already
been demonstrated ",Blockchain
"moreover from the point of view of the insurance company introducing
blockchainbased payperuse insurances which could be even paid by using cryptocurrencies could
bring a competitive advantage especially attracting young technology enthusiasts",Blockchain
"concerning architectural choices companies aiming at addressing payperuse insurance could
rely on a public blockchain",Blockchain
"in this way a smart contract could collect money from customers eg
ethers or bitcoins keep them until a given date and transfer them to the insurance company if
no damage occurs",Blockchain
"being on a public blockchain everyone could inspect the smart contract code
increasing trust between parties",Blockchain
"future internet     of 
 peertopeer insurance
several peertopeer insurances already exist – though it must be said that at present
they are not “real” peertopeer models as they have a traditional insurance model or risk carrier
behind them supporting the heavy part of the insurance business",Blockchain
"in this context smart contracts could represent an important innovation as they would enable
the creation of daos where selfinsured groups’ functioning rules could be hardcoded",Blockchain
"a prototype solution named dynamis and based on the ethereum blockchain has already
been implemented ",Blockchain
"this solution aims to provide supplemental unemployment insurance for a
community of selfmanaged people in terms of underwriting and claims acceptance and processing",Blockchain
"even though in peertopeer insurance the blockchain could really become the key technology
from the insurance company’s perspective it must be underlined that the objective of peertopeer
insurance is the removal of intermediaries ie the insurance companies themselves",Blockchain
"hence a wise
choice insurance companies could make here is to recognize this risk and turn it from a threat into a
business opportunity eg by providing the infrastructure for peertopeer insurance",Blockchain
"from the architectural point of view since this scenario requires a high amount of decentralization
a public blockchain would be more suited",Blockchain
"it should be underlined however that the adoption of peertopeer insurance models by the wider
public is not imminent yet",Blockchain
"in fact apart from a small amount of technology enthusiasts who aim at
reducing insurance costs a high number of customers still considers the interaction with intermediaries
important and worth of extra costs 
 a swot analysis
the above discussion should have provided the reader with a broad overview of potential
applications of blockchain technology in the insurance sector",Blockchain
"as seen advantages appear to
be numerous",Blockchain
"nonetheless only a few prototypes exist so far and it has been estimated that
blockchainbased applications will be available to the wider public only in – years ",Blockchain
"starting from the considerations drawn in section  in the following a swot analysis
summarizing advantages and disadvantages of this technology is provided table ",Blockchain
"the objective
here is to abstract from the specific domain considered ie insurance and to perform an analysis
which could potentially be helpful in a variety of contextssectors",Blockchain
"the strengths of blockchain technology are mainly related to the technological aspects presented
in section ",Blockchain
"by removing intermediaries the cost of money transfers can be lowered eg bank
commissions cease to exist",Blockchain
"transfers can also be made faster as cryptocurrencies are directly moved
from a wallet’s address to another without intermediate steps as it usually occurs eg in overseas
bank transfers",Blockchain
smart contracts provide a high degree of automation,Blockchain
"transparency is guaranteed as
well as the blockchain could be accessed worldwide",Blockchain
"in addition since everyone could potentially
write on the ledger the blockchain could become the repository of a huge amount of information
which could be used for data analytics in different sectors not necessarily related to insurance and
finance such as medicine education etc",Blockchain
"the underlying cryptographic mechanism guarantees that
data are not modified and that transactions could not be repudiated",Blockchain
"finally the replication of the
blockchain on each network node ensures that the blockchain would survive to unexpected events",Blockchain
the most relevant weaknesses are related to scalability energy consumption and performance,Blockchain
"in fact at present the number of transactions that could be handled per second is extremely
low when compared to traditional systems mainly because of the computational power required to
validate new blocks",Blockchain
"if at the present time blockchainbased transactions are quicker than traditional
bank transfers on average they require few seconds to several minutes instead of – days for instant
payments and for other kinds of applications performance should not be adequate to needs",Blockchain
"in this
respect it is worth outlining that some blockchain platforms are changing the process of validating
blocks reducing the complexity of the mathematical problem to be solved and restricting the possibility
to perform mining only to a subset of trusted nodes",Blockchain
"apart from time space is also an issue since
future internet     of 
data are replicated on each network node",Blockchain
"to make an example the bitcoin blockchain requires more
than  gb of storage on each network node ",Blockchain
"in addition the amount of energy consumed
by network nodes and the cost of the hardware required to validate new blocks is extremely high
estimated around  per transaction  though it must be underlined that several initiatives to limit
the amount of consumed energy are currently under development ",Blockchain

the fact that once information is encoded in the blockchain it is immutable and accessible by
everyone is another weakness and could harm users’ privacy",Blockchain

check the amount of money owned by a person by analyzing hisher incoming transactions",Blockchain
"should
other types of information be stored in the blockchain eg medical records this issue would become
even more relevant",Blockchain

smart contracts could become “candy for hackers” ",Blockchain
"in fact hackers could exploit bugs in smart
contracts to steal money as it recently happened on the ethereum network where in the most famous
attack of this kind around  million were “stolen” in june ",Blockchain

are free of bugs some applications would still need external oracles to inject information in the

injecting in the blockchain wrong information could be partially mitigated by relying on more than
one oracle each getting information from different sources",Blockchain
apart from technical aspects discussed above other weaknesses affect blockchain usability,Blockchain
"first
of all the impossibility to receive assistance in case of credentials loss even though this weakness
could be partially removed by relying on trusted services as explained in section ",Blockchain
"another aspect
is cryptocurrencies volatility which could become a limitation to the adoption of blockchainbased
payments",Blockchain
"in fact given the fact that cryptocurrencies are subject of speculation and considering
future internet     of 
that technology is not fully mature yet and bugs frequently appear value of cryptocurrencies show
huge fluctuations",Blockchain
"another weakness is related to the fact that development tools are still in an early stage
and standards for developing blockchainbased applications have not been defined yet",Blockchain
"finally it is worth remarking that in some cases blockchain would not be the most suitable
technology to use as existing wellmastered alternatives would enable the achievement of comparable
results ",Blockchain
opportunities are mainly related to whether the market would embrace the technology or not,Blockchain
"at the present time interacting with the blockchain requires some technical skills eg mastering
the concept of blocks installing a wallet etc",Blockchain
"several efforts are currently carried out in order to
reducehide the complexity behind the technology eg the development of browser plugins which
let users easily inspect the ledger  the creation of userfriendly wallets  etc",Blockchain
"should the above
initiatives be successful companies providing blockchainbased applications and services and in the
insurance market companies offering blockchainbased policies could have a competitive advantage",Blockchain
"this advantage would become larger in case of an increasing diffusion of iot as smart contracts could
be coded to autonomously make decisions based on data acquired by sensors –",Blockchain
"another opportunity is related to the possibility to address new markets and create new types of
services mainly by leveraging daos and low transactions fees",Blockchain
"blockchain could be successfully used
to support the sharing economy from car and house sharing  to disk storage rental  and in an
insurance scenario to support micro ondemand and peertopeer insurances",Blockchain
"finally should a high number of actors write data on the blockchain innumerable new
applications could appear",Blockchain
"as a matter of example a person’s previous medical history could be easily
retrieved by doctors in case of urgency blockchain could become a repository of medical data which
could be used by research scientists blockchainbased supply chains could be more efficient as data
could be shared nearly instantaneously among heterogeneous involved actors in an insurance scenario
data could be used for frauds prevention policies personalization etc",Blockchain
"nonetheless the type and
impact of these applications would be a function of the amount and quality of information recorded",Blockchain
threats are linked to different external causes,Blockchain
"first of all there is still a risk that the market
distrusts this technology perceiving it as unsecure or unreliable due to bugs cryptocurrencies
volatility etc",Blockchain
"other actors could think that it is too complicated and the adoption rate on a worldwide
basis could be low",Blockchain
"as a countermeasure such actors should receive a suitable training to be made
aware of the advantages of this technology",Blockchain
"alternatively efforts could be carried out to hide the
underlying complexity",Blockchain
"particular attention should be paid to legal regulations which could threaten the adoption of
blockchain",Blockchain
"for instance the regulation of the use and jurisdiction of smart contracts is still under
debate",Blockchain
"to make some examples there could be situations in which the outcome of a smart contract
would not be considered as legal by a court under existing laws eg a smart contract regulating
transactions of illegal goods ",Blockchain
"similarly there could be situations where hackers exploit smart
contracts bugs to steal money",Blockchain
"some governments could consider blockchain and smart contracts too
“dangerous” thus resulting in a limitation of the adoption on a larger scale",Blockchain
"concerning practical aspects blockchainbased applications are a medium to longterm
investment and they could not be suited for integration in all the existing processes",Blockchain
"in fact
as previously discussed for the insurance sector some claims would still need to be manually processed
as not all the damages could be evaluated by sensors",Blockchain
"finally should blockchain technology become a praxis it could impact on companies’ relationship
with their customers",Blockchain
"first of all some customers could refuse to adopt it as they might still consider
the personal interaction important",Blockchain
"similarly companies that invested in human capital to offer a
good customer service could lose market share as the competition could be moved from the quality of
service provided to its price",Blockchain
"conclusions
blockchain is receiving an evergrowing attention from research and industry and is considered
a breakthrough technology",Blockchain
"the increasing enthusiasm reported in the media however could bias
an objective evaluation about whether to invest or not in this technology",Blockchain
"the risk is that a company
decides to embrace blockchain technology because it is fascinating without reflecting on whether it is
mature enough for an adoption in everyday activities and by a wider public",Blockchain
"to help companies reduce the risk of chasing decentralization for the sake of itself just because
blockchain is now under the spotlight in this paper we presented an overview of potential applications
and use cases of blockchain and smart contracts in the insurance sector",Blockchain
"we also drafted a more general
swot analysis of blockchain which could be potentially applied to a variety of other sectors",Blockchain
"we decided to focus on insurance because this is a sector where blockchain has not been fully
explored yet and in which blockchain could have a relevant impact on several processes and application
scenarios",Blockchain
"hence use cases in this sector could be helpful in identifying advantages and disadvantages
of the technology itself",Blockchain
"the considerations made throughout the paper helped us answer the key questions reported in
the introduction",Blockchain
"concerning question  “are there clear use cases exploiting blockchain technology and smart
contracts in the insurance sector” at the present time a number of use cases and prototype solutions
have been devised in this sector",Blockchain
"in particular blockchain and smart contracts could be successfully
used to speed up claims processing and reduce operating costs",Blockchain
"in this scenario a smart contract
could trigger reimbursements based on data acquired from physical sensors eg damp sensors
installed on roofs or from the web eg weather or flights delay data",Blockchain
"in another scenario
data entryidentity verification the blockchain could be used as the infrastructure to verify a person’s
identity",Blockchain
"people’s identities could be linked to a blockchain address then each time a person needs
to be verified eg to open a bank account heshe could send a signed transaction from hisher
address by proving heshe is the address’ owner",Blockchain
"in the context of premium computationrisk
assessmentfrauds prevention the blockchain could act as a shared ledger recording a person’s
previous history previous claims committed infractions medical history etc",Blockchain
"insurance companies
could rely on these data to identify frauds or to automatically compute the premium of a policy",Blockchain
"in the scenario of payperusemicroinsurance blockchain and smart contracts could be used to
automatically activatedeactivate policies and covers based on data collected by sensors",Blockchain
"finally
in the last identified scenario ie peertopeer insurance blockchain and smart contracts could be the
key technologies to enable a shift to a full decentralization eg supporting the automatic management
of selfinsured groups’ funds",Blockchain
"concerning question  “in case we want to adopt a blockchain what is the most suitable
blockchain architecture for our needs” as presented in section  the architectural solutions should
be chosen based on the company’s decentralization needs",Blockchain
"in general for the backend a private
blockchain may be sufficient",Blockchain
"private blockchains have been frequently demonized since using an
instrument originally born to foster decentralization in a fully centralized environment may seem a
contradiction",Blockchain
"nonetheless they have the advantage of keeping track of the sender of a transaction and
of all the previous occurred transactions reducing the risk of data tampering",Blockchain
"furthermore together
with smart contracts they could be used to increase the automatization of existing tasks",Blockchain
"in case
multiple institutions need to access data a consortium blockchain may be preferable",Blockchain
"this blockchain
could be maintained by nodes belonging to the different institutions of the consortium and could be
used as a shared ledger",Blockchain
"finally public blockchains could be useful to manage automatic payments
with existing cryptocurrencies or when there is the need to provide trust using an unmodifiable
ledger between parties",Blockchain
"concerning question  “is blockchain technology mature enough for insurance” while we
believe that blockchain is a tremendous invention that could have an impact similar to the world wide
web in the s we also think that this technology still needs several improvements before becoming
future internet     of 
mainstream",Blockchain
"the reasons behind this statement are various first of all a current limitation of existing
public blockchains is scalability",Blockchain
"in fact the number of transactions per second is low and the network
frequently suffers congestions",Blockchain
"in a payperuse insurance scenario these facts would translate into
long waiting times before the desired policy cover is actually activated and what if an accident occurs
while the transaction activating a cover was waiting for validation",Blockchain
second a winning blockchain is still missing,Blockchain
"that means that a company could develop an
application exploiting a given blockchain and discover after few years that the chosen blockchain is
no longer supported by the wider network",Blockchain
"using a public blockchain supported by few nodes could
increase the risk of attacks as few nodes could control the majority of the network",Blockchain
third the interaction with the blockchain is still complex for the “average user”,Blockchain
"mastering the
concepts of wallet transaction mining etc",Blockchain
requires some technical background,Blockchain
"at the same time
bitcoin has frequently been associated with a pyramid scheme or a fraud",Blockchain
"as a consequence there
is still a lot of misinformation on blockchain and people could still prefer “traditional” applications
rather than decentralized ones",Blockchain
"furthermore cryptocurrency volatility which sometimes is driven by
media news could scare the potential users of decentralized applications",Blockchain
finally the resources and best practices to develop a freeofbugs smart contract are still insufficient,Blockchain
smart contracts frequently experience attacks in some cases with disastrous consequences ,Blockchain
"this
aspect could especially threaten peertopeer insurances which would widely rely on smart contracts
for their governance",Blockchain
"for the above reasons we do not expect blockchainbased insurance applications to appear in the
very near future",Blockchain
"it must be said though that the blockchain community is devoting great efforts to improving the
above weaknesses",Blockchain
"regarding scalability lightning network for bitcoin  and raiden network
for ethereum  are currently under development",Blockchain
"both solutions are investigating how to mix
online and offline transactions in order to reduce mining costs and time",Blockchain
"concerning easing the
interaction with the blockchain some applications that let users easily interact with blockchainbased
applications using their browsers or mobile phones are currently under development ",Blockchain
"concerning smart contracts security bug bounties programs are more and more frequent and a
wide community of blockchain white hat hackers is currently being created ",Blockchain
"once the above initiatives are successful blockchain technology could be gradually inserted in
everyday lives",Blockchain
"in the meantime insurance companies are strongly suggested to start investigating it
by acquiring the required competencies and by creating some prototype solutions",Blockchain
"such prototypes
could be useful to evaluate how existing processes would be influenced and to what extent this
technology would be accepted by the staff or by customers",Blockchain
"what is clear already is that blockchain is bringing a radical transformation to the way we act and
think and we all should be prepared for this change",Blockchain
"author contributions the paper was prepared by all the five authors which were involved in a study of
blockchain technology in the insurance sector",Blockchain
all the authors equally contributed to the manuscript,Blockchain
"valentina
gatteschi focused on technical aspects related to blockchain and on state of art approaches and applications
under the guidance of prof fabrizio lamberti and prof claudio demartini who also provided assistance while
shaping and revising the paper",Blockchain
"chiara pranteda and víctor santamaría provided their knowledge of the insurance
sector and helped developing the discussion on insurancerelated use cases as well as revising the paper",Blockchain
conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflicts of interest,Blockchain
the work mentioned in this paper should be assessed accordingly by the readers,Blockchain
"further it is not possible to include all the companies and initiatives active in the field due to
the mere number of such initiatives",Blockchain
the companies and initiatives enlisted in this paper have been included just based on the ease of assessing the information from the given company or initiative,Blockchain
this review paper is in no way endorsing or promoting the products and offerings from the enlisted companies,Blockchain
"further our review here is also not a statement of the merit of work for the enlisted
companies compared to other works not included in the review",Blockchain

need for an information technology system that can remove the middlemen and cut costs while maintaining trust and
transparency",Blockchain
"the blockchain is a revolutionary technology which can assist in solving the challenges of healthcare by
providing decentralized trust",Blockchain
"blockchainenabled decentralization promises to minimize the problem of vendor lockin
that has plagued the healthcare industry",Blockchain
"patient data is scattered across different entities in the value chain of the healthcare industry referred to as data silos and
sharing of data is prone to a multilevel process of permission control",Blockchain
"because of this oftentimes crucial data is not
accessible and available at the time of urgent need",Blockchain
"blockchain can solve this issue with health information exchange
hie by serving as a basis for a trusted decentralized database",Blockchain
"it can enable onestop access to the entire medical
history of a patient across all healthcare providers",Blockchain
"access control system built using trust on blockchain puts patients
in control of their data they can grant consent and access rights to external parties like researchers to have access to all
or subset of their medical records",Blockchain
"this feature fits nicely with the patientcentric model of healthcare where blockchain
can act as a catalyst inducing trust",Blockchain
the records written on the blockchain are immutable and cannot be altered or deleted,Blockchain
"this characteristic of blockchain
provides primitives like data integrity and provenance which can be used to build solutions to prevent drug counterfeiting
and medical frauds",Blockchain
"for instance fraudulent results and removal of data in clinical trials which do not align with
researcher’s bias or funding source can be prevented by enforcing the integrity of data in blockchain",Blockchain
"in addition it
allows keeping an immutable log of subject’s consent in a clinical trial",Blockchain
"on a financial note blockchain could save
hundreds of billions for the pharmaceutical industry by defining a chainofcustody in the supply chain",Blockchain
"it is possible to write custom laws and rules forming contracts on the blockchain which are equivalent to realworld
contracts and can be legally binding",Blockchain
these contracts are referred to as smart contracts,Blockchain
"smart contracts can be used in
several processes within healthcare including billing and insurance which helps in automating the process and reducing
the costs",Blockchain
later in subsequent sections we see several companies leveraging the smart contracts to build solutions,Blockchain
"in this publication we discuss the problems in the healthcare ecosystem and how the right use of blockchain technology
may solve these problems",Blockchain
we begin by giving a brief introduction to inner workings of blockchain in chapter ,Blockchain
"in
subsequent chapters we review major use cases of blockchain in healthcare along with the projects pursuing these use
cases",Blockchain
"we have reviewed works in the field of healthcare data management pharmaceutical use cases like supply chain
and medication adherence billingclaims management analytics telemedicine and blockchain as a service",Blockchain
"these
fields though not allencompassing represent some of the major areas in the overall healthcare space",Blockchain
"in chapter  we
discuss the challenges in the adoption of blockchain based solutions in healthcare",Blockchain
"the final chapter concludes with
the overall discussion on the landscape of healthcare problems therein promises of the blockchain and the state of
blockchain based solutions",Blockchain
several other review papers have discussed the applications of blockchain in healthcare     ,Blockchain
"blockchain
blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin  an open peertopeer pp value transfer network that solved the
problem of double spending for the first time",Blockchain
"with the release of bitcoin cryptocurrencies became the first use case
of the blockchain",Blockchain
"cryptocurrencies are analogous to fiat money like usd or eur facilitating the exchange of value
but use cryptographic protocols as the basis for governance rather than depending on a central authority like banks",Blockchain
"in
recent years there has been increasing awareness that the blockchain has much more to offer than cryptocurrencies
blockchain can be an ideal tool for creating trust based solutions",Blockchain
"in bitcoin like cryptocurrencies a blockchain represents an appendonly linear chain of blocks or ledger replicated
across a network of computers a block is a group of validated transactions in the network and the two consequent
blocks are cryptographically linked",Blockchain
however in recent times we observe variations on how blockchain is defined,Blockchain
"often it is used as an umbrella term for the distributed ledger technology used in any pp network that tries to solve
problems like double spending",Blockchain
"in this publication we broadly consider blockchain as a pp distributed appendonly
ledger with immutable and tamperproof records",Blockchain
"it is important to understand the concept and life cycle of a transaction
to understand how blockchain works",Blockchain
in blockchain a transaction represents a change of state,Blockchain
"for instance a transfer of
coins from a sender to a receiver is a transaction where the account balance represents the state",Blockchain
"when a new transaction
is created it is broadcasted to the network where a miner node computer picks up the transaction and compose a block
by combining one or more transactions and broadcasts the block into the network",Blockchain
"each blockchain has a set of rules
that determine whether a block created by a miner is valid or not and only the valid blocks are added to the chain",Blockchain
"for
example a block is considered valid and mined in bitcoin if it has the correct cryptographic hash ",Blockchain
"these set of
rules form the basis of consensus in the blockchain",Blockchain
"a preprint december  
consensus
the consensus in a blockchain network is the mechanism on agreeing on a common version or state of the blockchain
which is considered to be the trusted truth of the blockchain",Blockchain
"the consensus mechanism prevents the double spending
as trying to double spend an already spent transaction causes a conflict with the existing state thereby the transaction
is rejected and will never be added to the chain",Blockchain
"a consensus protocol includes the rules for transaction validation
accepting the newly created block into the chain and selection of forkpartition in case of network partitions",Blockchain
"depending
on the context and the use case the need and requirement for the consensus could differ",Blockchain
"consensus mechanism can be
broadly classified as global or local
 in global consensus model the first block of the chain called genesis block is common for all nodes in the
network and every node agrees on the same state of the network and stores the complete chain to validate any
transaction",Blockchain
"most common examples of global consensus blockchain are bitcoin and ethereum
 in local consensus model every participant owns an individual genesis block and the consensus is only reached
among the parties involved in the transactions",Blockchain
"this local consensus reduces the storage requirements on
individual nodes and is generally more scalable than global consensus counterparts",Blockchain
"example blockchains are
trustchain  and nano ",Blockchain
most of the current blockchains use some version of the consensus protocol of bitcoin called nakamoto consensus ,Blockchain
"the nakamato consensus is a global consensus model it uses proof of work pow for accepting the new block and
dictates to choose the longest chain in case of network partitions",Blockchain
"in pow miners compete to find a cryptographic hash
that solves a computationally difficult problem and the block proposed by the miner with the correct hash is added to
the chain",Blockchain
proof of work is resource intensive and inherently nonscalable,Blockchain
"proof of stake pos is an alternative block
validation model where the creator of the new block is chosen in a deterministic way depending on its wealth also
called the stake ",Blockchain
pos is much more efficient in terms of performance and energy consumption,Blockchain
"we are observing a
shift from pow to pos or hybrid model in recent blockchains where ethereum remains a strong proponent",Blockchain
"smart contracts
a smart contract represents a selfexecuting selfverifying and tamperresistant piece of code with programmable
application logic which resides and executes on the blockchain",Blockchain
"it formalizes the transaction rules and relationship
among entities and assets in the blockchain and gives the flexibility to write custom application logic which becomes a
law enforced by the blockchain itself without any reliance on trusted intermediaries",Blockchain
"smart contracts form the basis for
trust in the application layer",Blockchain
"from the early days of bitcoin it supported a basic scripting language  that allowed people to write custom
logic to spend transactions",Blockchain
this language gave the people the flexibility to design primitive contracts,Blockchain
"for example
enforcing a transaction to spend only after a certain time or requiring a multiparty signature to spend a transaction
became possible",Blockchain
though bitcoin scripts provided a way to write contracts it was limited and restrictive,Blockchain
"then the
blockchains specifically designed to support the execution of custom code came into existence",Blockchain
"ethereum  is a
pioneer blockchain explicitly designed as the smart contracts platform",Blockchain
"with smart contracts realworld rules and laws
can be embedded and enforced into the blockchain and thus developing a decentralized trusted application dapp
became a lot easier",Blockchain
cryptocurrency token and digital assets became the most popular contract applications,Blockchain
"soon an
outburst of dapps was seen contributing to a worldwide blockchain hype",Blockchain
"prediction markets  and decentralized
exchanges  are some examples which demonstrate the real strength and flexibility of smart contracts",Blockchain
"apart from ethereum there are several other blockchain platforms supporting smart contracts nem  hyperledger
fabric  stellar  neo  etc",Blockchain
"types of blockchain
blockchain can be public or private depending on the permission level  but here we broadly classify it to three
different levels of granularity",Blockchain
"• public blockchain a public blockchain is permissionless and anyone can easily participate and validate the
transactions",Blockchain
transactions are public and anonymouspseudonymous,Blockchain
"the blockchain is maintained by the
public community so there is the highest level of decentralized trust",Blockchain
bitcoin is the pioneer public blockchain,Blockchain
bitcoin ethereum waves  dash  and bitshares  are few examples of public blockchains,Blockchain
"• federated blockchain a federated blockchain is a permissioned blockchain operating under the leadership of
a group often called the consortium",Blockchain
predefined consortium nodes control the consensus,Blockchain
"the transactions may
or may not be public",Blockchain
some examples includes r corda  ewf energy  and bi insurance ,Blockchain
"a preprint december  
• private blockchain a private blockchain is a permissioned blockchain centralized to one governing orga
nization",Blockchain
transactions are validated internally and may or may not be public readable,Blockchain
"private blockchains
usually have faster block times and can process higher transaction throughput",Blockchain
"however these are vulnerable
to security breaches",Blockchain
"the value of private blockchain can be seen as a trust transformer where trust is based on
an algorithm rather than an authority",Blockchain
"monax  hyperledger with sawtooth  private ethereum are a
few examples of private blockchains",Blockchain
"trust and traceability are the two basic promises of the blockchain obtained out of the box which solves the generic
trust problem on all public federated and organization levels",Blockchain
"however these traits are not always sufficient to
provide a complete solution which is why we often see blockchain paired with strong cryptographic protocols like
zeroknowledge proofs ",Blockchain
"this pairing ensures to provide trust traceability security and control which are the core
building blocks for critical solutions in several industries including health care and supply chain",Blockchain
"data recorded in the
blockchain cannot be changed or deleted without leaving a trace",Blockchain
"this immutability and traceability of the data is a
critical requirement for any health care system",Blockchain
thus the benefits of blockchain seem imminent,Blockchain
"here we list some of
the core issuesconcerns that need to be addressed in health care solutions and later show how blockchain could help in
solving them",Blockchain
"• secure storage and integrity protection
• privacy and ownership of data
• data sharing
• traceability and accountability of data
while each of these concerns can be addressed separately with the proper use of cryptography and privacypreserving
technologies the key concerns in such solutions have always been the governing trust model",Blockchain
"in such solutions
blockchain as a trustful decentralized ledger technology can act as a trust binding glue",Blockchain
"challenges  future
despite the massive potential there are limitations as of the current state of the blockchain",Blockchain
"currently every node in
the network processes the transaction which makes the blockchain rather slow and unsuitable to handle realworld
transactions which range in tens of thousands of transactions per second",Blockchain
"this disparity highlights the scaling issue that
blockchains have to overcome for wider adoption across all industries",Blockchain
"moreover with the growth in usage the size of
blockchain is increasing enormously making it difficult for normal users to keep the full copy of it",Blockchain
"on a positive note
with huge investment and research efforts invested into blockchain  a better scalable blockchain may evolve in the
future",Blockchain
"decentralization consistency and scalability dcs are the three desirable properties that blockchain platforms strive
to maintain",Blockchain
"a blockchain system can only simultaneously provide two out of three properties there will always be
a tradeoff",Blockchain
"platforms like bitcoin and ethereum are dc system where they provide sufficient decentralization and
consistency of data but lack scalability",Blockchain
"on the other hand hyperledger is an example of a cs system which ensures
data consistency and can scale above k transactions per second at the cost of losing decentralization",Blockchain
in the last decade we have observed the evolution of blockchain in three generations,Blockchain
"cryptocurrencies represented the
first ",Blockchain
generation which was primarily designed as an alternative payment system,Blockchain
"then decentralized applications
based on smart contracts dapps represented the ",Blockchain
"applications providing business logic abstraction and execution
on a trusted platform where safety and security of smart contracts is the key issue",Blockchain
"smart contracts which can be
validated and tested before deployment on a live blockchain prevents financial losses due to flaws in the code",Blockchain
"the third
generation is taking a pervasive multidimensional approach connecting internet of things iot machine learning and
different branches of science",Blockchain
"these different generations of blockchain are evolving simultaneously in their own pace
addressing the issues like scalability security and privacy along the way",Blockchain
"moreover projects like holochain  and
hashgraph  are developing scalable and general purpose platforms for agentcentric decentralized applications
traditional blockchains are datacentric making them difficult to scale",Blockchain
"we see more of these example use cases in the
following sections",Blockchain
"a preprint december  
 healthcare data management
the management of healthcare data which includes storage access control and sharing of the data is an important
aspect of the healthcare industry",Blockchain
"proper management of healthcare data improves healthcare outcomes by allowing
holistic views of patients personalized treatments and efficient communication",Blockchain
"it is also critical for operating
healthcare industry costeffectively and efficiently",Blockchain
"however managing healthcare data is a challenging task due
to its sensitive nature and subsequent trust issues",Blockchain
"and it is one of the main reasons why the healthcare system is
disconnected—healthcare data and services exist in disparate forms in several silos",Blockchain
"this disconnected system is a
culprit for several inefficiencies in healthcare and is a major hurdle for healthcare research",Blockchain
"healthcare professionals
generally do not have access to the complete data of patients thereby hampering the subsequent diagnosis and treatment
steps and researchers struggle to find the desired data for their studies thereby slowing down healthcare research",Blockchain
"blockchain may enable the efficient sharing of healthcare data while ensuring data integrity and protecting patient
privacy",Blockchain
"secure efficient costeffective and interoperable hie can be built with its right use alongside with other
technologies",Blockchain
"moreover the adoption of blockchain can push forward the movement of patientcentric healthcare
model where patients control their healthcare data",Blockchain
"the major hurdles behind datasharing in both patientcentric and
traditional models are lack of trust and lack of incentives to share",Blockchain
"the blockchain technology can solve both problems
by acting as a trust layer and introducing the incentive mechanisms such as rewarding crypto tokens for sharing data",Blockchain
"moreover blockchain can be the bridge for the integration of medical device data and healthcare internet of things the
healthcare and lifestyle data collected by wearable devices can be critical for correct diagnosis but are underutilized
since there is a lack of a proper way for a physician to access the patientgenerated data",Blockchain
"with blockchainenabled trust and incentive structure there is a promise for a global hie and a marketplace on top
of it",Blockchain
"but the lack of common healthcare data standards can be one of the major obstacles to overcome before the
development of an interoperable hie connecting multiple disparate data silos",Blockchain
"however there is a possibility that the
incentives introduced by blockchainbased data exchange may fuel the creation and the development of the open data
standards",Blockchain
"blockchainbased hie will be an interesting use case that requires the balance among privacy transparency
and efficiency",Blockchain
"moreover countryspecific regulations will be another obstacle for a hie connecting multiple regulatory
regions",Blockchain
"since patients have full ownership of their healthcare data in many countries blockchain enabled patientcentric
healthcare data model can be one fitting way to bypass these regulatory challenges
 blockchain based projects for healthcare data management

 supply chain and counterfeit drugs detection
the importance of the supply chain in the medical industry cannot be overstated",Blockchain
"right from the raw materials and
production to different stages of storage and distribution proper monitoring and tracking are required to ensure
optimal and intended usage",Blockchain
one of the growing concerns in recent years is that of counterfeit drugs,Blockchain
"there must be a
mechanism for the end users and all the stakeholders of the supply chain to verify the ingredients of a drug",Blockchain
"with lack of
a proper tracking mechanism there are ample weak links in the supply chain where the drug can be tampered with or a
counterfeit drug can be infused in the supply",Blockchain
"to address this growing concern new regulations have been brought forth
to have all stakeholders of the medicine supply chain provide a robust mechanism to track and trace the pharmaceutical
supplies that pass through them",Blockchain
"blockchain provides a perfectly fitting solution to this need for tracing and tracking
where this information has to be maintained in an open yet safe and tamperproof system accessible to multiple parties",Blockchain

practitioner that you had in the recent past which might be problematic for your current ongoing treatment at a hospital",Blockchain
"in the current system it is challenging to have these different data points in one place that is accessible to the patient and
this in turn could lead to undesirable incidents",Blockchain
"the solution from scalamed brings all the information about current
and past prescriptions into a central place which helps avoid situations causing crossreactions of the prescription drugs",Blockchain
"though several blockchain based solutions are being investigated for prescription management some centralized
conventional system could also provide a solution for certain markets where the involved parties are very few",Blockchain
"close

"billing claims management
financial aspects of medical care are inherently important in the healthcare landscape",Blockchain
"this area of financing aspect in
healthcare is rife with inefficiencies mostly related to the trust and transparency which can potentially be optimized by
the use of blockchain",Blockchain

 analytics
blockchain can have a huge positive impact on all three pillars of analytics data model and computation",Blockchain
"data
access to the right data is the key to better analytics",Blockchain
"data are more valuable than algorithms and this is especially true
in healthcare due to the sensitive nature of healthcare data",Blockchain
"with blockchainenabled hie researchers and analytics
companies can efficiently acquire the desired data for analysis",Blockchain
"also confidence in the quality and attribute of the
acquired data increases if its provenance is tracked by blockchain",Blockchain
"not only data but the analytics process for example
training and validation of prediction models can also be tracked using blockchain",Blockchain
"this tracking feature can increase the
confidence of healthcare professionals and regulatory entities such as fda on the prediction models thereby increasing
their probability of being used in the clinical setting",Blockchain
"model
multiple model predictions can be pooled using a blockchain network to create a final robust model prediction of
an ensemble of models is usually more correct than individual predictions",Blockchain
"also incentive features such as crypto
assets and reputation scores can be used to encourage participation and submission of better models",Blockchain
"for example
numerai  is a hedge fund which utilizes crowdsourced machine learning for financial predictions",Blockchain
"a similar
mechanism can be set up in health care for use cases such as early detection of cancer",Blockchain
"modelchain  has proposed
a framework for crowdsourced machine learning while preserving patient information inside a private blockchain
network participating sites share only model parameters which are used to build the final model",Blockchain
"in addition to the
prediction models the predictions can come from individuals where correct predictions are rewarded while incorrect
ones are penalized",Blockchain
"this mechanism can be utilized in public health for example to predict the outbreak of epidemic
diseases",Blockchain
"for example using augur  which is a decentralized prediction platform a bet has been created to predict
the spread of humanborne nipah virus in united states ",Blockchain
"computation
with the increase in data quantity and model complexity the demand for computing resources is rapidly increasing",Blockchain
"research centers and analytics companies either have inhouse computing servers or use computing services from
amazon google or microsoft",Blockchain
"with the introduction of the blockchain decentralized computation has become the
third option",Blockchain
"recently there has been few promising projects developing opensource pp computation platforms such as
golem  sonm  etc",Blockchain
"they have released some early products and have a consistent user base although a tiny
one",Blockchain
"one of the key challenges in decentralized computation is preserving data privacy while performing computation
on them and it is particularly important in healthcare",Blockchain
"companies such as enigma  and oasis labs  are
developing solutions for privacypreserving computation on blockchain",Blockchain
"compared to traditional cloud computing
services blockchain promises cheaper computation with greater data security and removes the need of vendor lockin",Blockchain
however the blockchainbased solutions are still in the early stages and need to prove their claims in practice,Blockchain
"telemedicine
telemedicine is another area in healthcare that can benefit from blockchain technology by introducing a trust layer
between patients and healthcare professionals",Blockchain
"blockchainbased telemedicine platform can validate professional
identity and data integrity ensure transparency and traceability and incentivize the players to act fairly by providing
incentive metrics such as reputation scores and crypto tokens",Blockchain
"successful development of such platforms may create a
global healthcare marketplace in the future effectively balancing the global supply and demand of healthcare resources
and needs",Blockchain
"in addition such a network can incorporate the software services such as artificial intelligence ai if the
ai models are properly validated regulated and their performance continuously quantified by some proxy measures",Blockchain
within telemedicine it is likely that the remote diagnostic services will be at the forefront of blockchain adoption,Blockchain
"it
can be expected that diagnostic services solely based on quantitative and qualitative interpretation of medical data in the
absence of a patient will be first to adopt blockchain technology successfully",Blockchain
"a large number of startups in this area
corroborates this anticipation",Blockchain
"and many of these startups are targeting the services where the diagnosis of a medical
condition is based on interpretation of patientgenerated imaging data such as dermatology",Blockchain
"we found the projects
focusing on skin images unusually high in number most probably due to its close relationship with the beauty industry
in addition to the abovementioned reasons",Blockchain
"see table  for a noncomprehensive list of projects working on blockchain
based telemedicine platforms",Blockchain

"recently together with instant access medical and healthcare
gateway it launched a blockchainsupported personal care record platform called mypcr ",Blockchain
"ssot health  is
developing a platform to create healthcare blockchains based in hyperledger",Blockchain
"challenges
although blockchain holds tremendous potential to improve and add value to the healthcare system and several
companies have already started testing it for specific use cases there are several challenges to be tackled before its
mainstream usage",Blockchain
there are various facets to the challenges on the mainstream adoption of the blockchain technology,Blockchain
"these facets are for example
• technical
• legal
• business
• trust issues
in this section we touch upon some of the challenges to be expected for the widespread usage of the blockchain
technology in the healthcare sector
 interoperability  integration with the legacy systems
healthcare space has a vast number of technologies devices and components not forgetting the personnel which
all come together to solve the current needs in the space",Blockchain
"there are large rooms for improvements with blockchain
technology providing a promise to cover up some of this room",Blockchain
"however the blockchain technology would still be
just one piece though likely very crucial of the puzzle",Blockchain
"the blockchain technology has to integrate well with existing
systems and the integration is going to be a challenging ordeal because of several reasons such as interoperability",Blockchain
"that
the healthcare space has multiple numbers of devices and device types make it even more difficult",Blockchain
"all relevant parties
and stakeholders should all come together to make the use of blockchain technology more pervasive in healthcare",Blockchain
"if
blockchain cannot be a catalyst for this cooperation between stakeholders and relevant parties then it probably does not
have much value above and beyond being a simple and useful tool to solve some issues around trust",Blockchain
"many of the other
issues around ecosystem building will still be there regardless of the blockchain",Blockchain
"an important aspect of this discussion
also relates to the training of healthcare it personnel",Blockchain
"these personnel might be needed to be retrained on blockchain
technology if the blockchain technology would enter into the healthcare space
 adoption and incentives for participation
as discussed adoption of blockchain technology in the healthcare space would require coordination and cooperation
of multiple stakeholders",Blockchain
"these stakeholders for example could be the hospital device manufacturers care personnel

a preprint december  
patients etc",Blockchain
"as the adoption of blockchain technology would require cooperation from multiple stakeholders with
some changes in each of these stakeholder’s current operational and business model it would be natural for these
stakeholders to expect some incentive to participate in the change process",Blockchain
"in order to manage these expectations new
business models must be explored that can provide fair incentives to all the stakeholders",Blockchain
"the provided incentives
should acknowledge the costs and efforts in deploying or adopting a blockchain based technologies along with any
underlying changes in the operational model that the deployed solution entails",Blockchain
"consider the solution for blockchain
based patient data management",Blockchain
"in this particular scenario a fair incentive scheme must be devised in a sustainable
business model that can be accepted by the patients device manufactures backend it solution providers hospitals etc",Blockchain
as this application is still evolving it would be some time before proven robust incentive models are aplenty,Blockchain
"in the
meantime any associated risk of a particular incentive model must be rigorously assessed and quantified as much as
possible
 uncertain cost of operation
while blockchain has promising features such as no need of central authority and hence no central point of failure
transparency and relatively fast settlement of transactions the cost of operating blockchain systems are not yet known",Blockchain
"today a significant amount of resources in healthcare is being spent on personnel time and money to build and manage
the current traditional information systems and data exchanges",Blockchain
"on top of that there is an overhead of continuously
updating the systems troubleshooting issues performing backups worrying about hacks and data breaches",Blockchain
"the
blockchainbased hie system could prove itself to be costeffective and more efficient compared to the traditional
hie system",Blockchain
this for example could come due to the enhanced security by design,Blockchain
"nonetheless the overall cost
factors involved in a blockchain technologybased healthcare services must be robustly assessed in a given business and
operational model of a healthcare organization
 regulation
a solution in the healthcare space needs to adhere to a various set of regulations as the patient’s health and even life
is at stake directly or indirectly",Blockchain
"further as it concerns health data the concerns regarding data privacy are also the
highest",Blockchain
"the blockchain technology being a new technological solution that is being adopted among the early users
one of the challenges remain on how the solutions on top of blockchain technology comply with existing regulations
and standards",Blockchain
"while existing hie systems have multiple years to evolve towards meeting the regulatory requirements
the blockchain technology might be still in the evolution phase to find the sweet landing spot within the healthcare
space where it can also adequately adhere to set healthcare standards and regulations",Blockchain
"to achieve this a number of pilot
deployments and rigorous test and validation of the underlying technological pieces must be considered by the solution
providers",Blockchain
"the requirements to adhere to regulations could also be an impetus for further technological advancements
in the blockchain technology",Blockchain
"the requirements from recently enforced general data protection rule gdpr is one of the cases which is leading
discussion and thoughts on how blockchain technology can further evolve to comply with set regulations",Blockchain
"blockchain
and gdpr has a dual relationship",Blockchain
"on the one hand gdpr as an example enforces provisions like the right to
erasureright to be forgotten giving a person data originator full right and control over his or her data which directly
conflicts with the immutable nature of blockchain",Blockchain
"healthcare data are generally stored offchain and only pointers
to the data usually its cryptographic hash is stored in the blockchain",Blockchain
"this approach provides a way to make a
blockchain application gdpr compliant",Blockchain
"however one can always argue that the cryptographic hash can still be
considered a form of the personal data which is a separate discussion in itself",Blockchain
"over time better tradeoffs are bound to
come where regulatory compliance feeds very well to only evolution and maturity of blockchain technology for even
more widespread adoption",Blockchain
"at this point it is wise to consider incorporating gdpr like regulations in blockchain
applications",Blockchain
"on the other hand from a decentralization perspective regulations like gdpr and blockchain are perfect
partners",Blockchain
"with the increasing awareness among users about their personal data and enforcement of privacy regulations
there has been a surge in the interest around the patientcontrolled health care data",Blockchain
"given the existence of userfriendly
applications for management of the personal data with proper security and incentive structures individuals can have
access and control to their healthcare data and can participate in pp global dataexchange required for healthcare
research and services all powered by blockchain
 governance
the basic premise of the distributed nature of blockchain helps to bring multiple parties into a trusted transaction
scheme without the need of any centralized authorities",Blockchain
"however if we consider how healthcare organizations operate
there can be several different operational models",Blockchain
"in certain operational models of blockchain based solutions it might

a preprint december  
be imperative to have a certain stakeholder assuming the role of a regulator to govern the overall operation of the
blockchain",Blockchain
this governing model might for example be needed to meet the regulatory requirements,Blockchain
"it is not yet clear
how such a governance structure can be managed properly in a system with multiple disparate parties",Blockchain
"this aspect of
governance will also have a tiein with the intended incentive schemes",Blockchain
"however as the adoption of blockchain based
solutions will evolve in the healthcare space we would see various solutions also to the requirements of governance
 scaling
not only in healthcare but any industry the underlying blockchain network has to be scalable for successful application
of any blockchainbased solutions",Blockchain
"it is likely that at least in the early phase several solutions in healthcare will use
semipermissioned blockchains which are scalable and have high transaction throughput at the cost of decentralization",Blockchain
however there will still be a need for public blockchains for communication among permissioned blockchain networks,Blockchain
besides a blockchainenabled global hie can only be possible with highly scalable public blockchains,Blockchain
"in current
form public blockchain networks like bitcoin and ethereum are not fast and cheap enough to host any decentralized
applications on a large scale",Blockchain
"however there have been several ongoing scaling efforts such as lightning network state
channels plasma chains sharding zksnarks etc",Blockchain
and some of them are already being adopted in practice,Blockchain
"in the future
it is likely that the public blockchains will be fast and cheap enough for their mass adoption",Blockchain
"conclusion
blockchain technology has the potential to solve several problems plaguing the healthcare industry today",Blockchain
"as a trust
mediator it can enable novel healthcare solutions and as an incentive machine it can enable novel business models
that may lead to a new dynamic among various healthcare stakeholders like patients and providers",Blockchain
"for example a
patientcentric healthcare model and a global hie might be realized by virtue of blockchain enabled decentralized trust
and incentive structures",Blockchain
"similarly blockchain based decentralized networkservices may minimize vendor lockin
problems in healthcare",Blockchain
"in this document we reviewed major use cases of blockchain such as healthcare data management supply chain
management in the pharmaceutical industry medication adherence billingclaims management analytics etc",Blockchain
"examples
of organizations developing blockchainbased applications for these use cases were also presented",Blockchain
"the proposed
applications range from moonshot projects trying to build a complete decentralized health care ecosystem to specific
applications such as data provenance counterfeit drugs identification consent management etc",Blockchain
"despite the immense potential of blockchain technology and an enormous amount of interest around it we found that
its impact on healthcare is minimal and is still in the early days",Blockchain
"most of the blockchain based healthcare solutions are
still in the form of novel concepts represented by whitepapers prototypes or only a very small number of working
products with a limited user base",Blockchain
"however the field is evolving rapidly we anticipate a significant positive impact
of blockchain in healthcare in the future",Blockchain
"challenges such as interoperability integration with the existing systems
uncertainty in cost technological and adoption barrier regulatory compliance and scaling have to be successfully
tackled to help blockchain make its mark in the healthcare industry",Blockchain

which contains all the posts of stack overflow",Blockchain
"the file contains  question 
posts which were posted from july  to march ",Blockchain
"we parse the file to obtain post 
metadata for example the post title the post body the tags and the score",Blockchain
with these data we extract the question posts in which “blockchain” is mentioned,Blockchain
"specifically we first remove all the code snippets and hyperlink text enclosed in a 
href“” html tags from the bodies of all the question posts",Blockchain
"then we go through 
the titles bodies and tags of all the question posts",Blockchain
"a question post is extracted as 
blockchain relevant if the string “blockchain” or “blockazchain” appears in at least 
one of these three fields where “az” represents a character but not a letter",Blockchain
"using 
these heuristics  question posts are identified as blockchain relevant",Blockchain
"evolvement of the blockchain relevant posts 
among all  question posts in stack overflow only  of them are 
blockchain relevant",Blockchain
"we suppose that blockchain is an emerging concept and going to 
rise",Blockchain
"to prove this idea we investigate the evolvement of the blockchain relevant 
question posts",Blockchain
"figure  presents the number of blockchain relevant question posts per 
month",Blockchain
"the stack overflow website was operative as early as july  but blockchain 
relevant question posts were not mentioned for a long time at the beginning",Blockchain
"the first 
blockchain relevant question was posted in january ",Blockchain
"the time span before that date 
is omitted in the figure",Blockchain
the data of march  is eliminated as it is not complete,Blockchain
we have two observations from the evolvement,Blockchain
"on the one hand blockchain is an 
ongoing topic in stack overflow programming practice",Blockchain
"the monthly number of 
blockchain relevant question posts shows a clearly increasing trend especially since 
january ",Blockchain
moreover the increasing speed tends to increase too,Blockchain
"that means more 
and more programming issues about blockchain are raised and discussed",Blockchain
"although the 
current number of blockchain relevant question posts is relatively small we believe that it 
could rise fast in the future",Blockchain
"on the other hand the application of blockchain is lagging 
behind the theory of blockchain",Blockchain
"the idea of blockchain was conceptualized in 

",Blockchain
"but only still  it emerged in stack overflow where blockchain is viewed in the 
application perspective",Blockchain
there is a time delay between theory and application,Blockchain
"however 
blockchain has attracted the attentions from programming communities and blockchain 
relevant questions are continuously growing",Blockchain
"a currently blockchain relevant questions only occupy a small part of all stack 
overflow posts but the monthly number is increasing over time figure ",Blockchain
evolvement of blockchain relevant question posts,Blockchain
"question types summarization 
 
posts categorization 
to give a summary of what tasks developers face with we categorize the blockchain 
relevant question posts into different types",Blockchain
"as the extracted question post set is not very 
large and for the sake of accuracy we do this work manually",Blockchain
"to make the results more understandable we do not focus on technical details but the 
demands of askers",Blockchain
"a question post is labeled with a unique type which reflects the main 
purpose of the asker",Blockchain
"for example in a post the asker writes “i want to query the 
blockchain to find the moment when an unconfirmed transaction comes through for a 
particular bitcoin address” ",Blockchain
"that is the asker wants to access the 
blockchain to obtain some information of transactions",Blockchain
"then we may label the post as 
“access”",Blockchain
"in another example “what’s the difference between distributed hashtable 
technology and the bitcoin blockchain”  the asker just wants to 
discriminate the two concepts but does not leak the practical requirements",Blockchain
"then the post 
could be labeled as “discussion”",Blockchain
"with this consideration we categorize the posts following the iterative process of 
mobile app reviews tagging",Blockchain
"specifically for each of the blockchain relevant question 
post we label it with an existing type",Blockchain
"if a question post does not match any existing 
types then we add a new type to the existing types and relabel the blockchain relevant 
question post from the beginning",Blockchain
"finally  types of blockchain relevant question posts 
are detected",Blockchain
"types of the blockchain relevant question posts 
for the  types of blockchain relevant question posts we summarize their substances 
and give a brief description and an example question post for each type",Blockchain
"the details are 
shown in figure ",Blockchain
"as a question post is labeled with a unique type the blockchain relevant question posts 
are grouped into  clusters",Blockchain
"if a large number of question posts belong to the same type 
then this type of issues are frequently encountered and should be paid more attention to",Blockchain
"the number of question posts a type involves cluster size reveals the popularity of this 
type",Blockchain
"to find the popular types we rank the  types according to the numbers of 
question posts and the results are displayed in figure  a",Blockchain
"the top three types are configuration deployment and discussion which account for 
more than  percent of all the posts",Blockchain
"questions of configuration are about how to 
configure the environment to work well",Blockchain
"many askers reported to get errors during the 
configuring process such as post error running custom blockchain 
hyperledger application with security enabled",Blockchain
"similarly deployment is about how to 
set up or install the blockchain system such as post how can i integrate 
etherium or waves platform wallet on my site",Blockchain
"among all the askers of these two types of 
questions a number of them are in the learning phase and do not have certain tasks",Blockchain
"askers of  question posts declared that they tried to follow the steps provided in the 
tutorials",Blockchain
questions of discussion are related to more general topics,Blockchain
"the askers may 
want to talk about the ideas eg are there already other practical uses for blockchain",Blockchain
 understand the mechanisms eg where are chaincodes executed,Blockchain
" resolve their puzzles eg bitcoins how can someone receive much less 
than have spent",Blockchain
" or verify their thoughts eg is blockchain a decentralised 
 
 
database",Blockchain
"these facts imply that the application of blockchain is still in the 
initial phase",Blockchain
"many developers are confused with the principles of blockchain and many 
developers have set out to work with blockchain",Blockchain
the  types of blockchain relevant question posts,Blockchain
then we evaluate the  types in another perspective,Blockchain
"a question post can be evaluated 
with different metrics",Blockchain
"for example score measures the quality of the post viewcount 
measures the number of visitors and favoritecount measures how many developers mark 
it as favorite",Blockchain
"a post may get high values of these metrics under the following scenarios 
access 
example post how to retrieve a value from a blockchain using php",Blockchain
" 
design decentralized applications by leveraging blockchain technology application 
example post how can blockchains be used in audit trails",Blockchain
" 
authenticate the participants by verifying the certifications or signatures authentication 
example post using the blockchaininfo api to verify bitcoin signatures in c  
configure blockchain systems to make them work correctly configuration 
example post error running custom blockchain hyperledger application with security enabled  
connect to blockchain systems or peer networks connection 
example post how to correctly respond to remote server",Blockchain
" 
design or implement the logic of smart contracts contract 
example post how to create contracts on ethereum blockchain in python",Blockchain
" 
achieve encryption or decryption of payloads or calculate hash values cryptography 
example post how to decrypt the transaction payload when confidentiality is turned on",Blockchain
" 
deploy or install blockchain relevant frameworks on their environments deployment 
example post how can i integrate etherium or waves platform wallet on my site",Blockchain
" 
post the opinions discuss the puzzle about blockchain technology discussion 
example post whats the difference between distributed hashtable technology and the bitcoin blockchain",Blockchain
" 
parse transfer or store the blockchain data processing 
example post bitcoin parsing blockchain api json in pyqt  
clarify programming details of blockchain relevant technology programming 
example post programming on solidity setname function bitdegree  
implement the protocols between peers ie consensus fault tolerance protocol 
example post how exactly to make consensus when chaincode has coding block of authority or event",Blockchain
" 
make transactions receive or send cryptocurrency between accounts transaction 
example post simple to bitcoin transaction with bitcore  
retrieve or query information from blocks cryptocurrency accounts addresses etc",Blockchain
"the question is just what many other developers want to ask the topic of the question is 
what many other developers concern the question is related to the jobs what many other 
developers are doing",Blockchain
in brief many other developers are interested in the question,Blockchain
"to 
find the types developers interested in we rank the  types according to the average 
score viewcount and favoritecount of posts they involve",Blockchain
"the results are shown in 
figure  b – d",Blockchain
"we note that the three metrics of question posts belonging to contract and protocol 
are all in top ranks",Blockchain
"questions of contract are about how to develop or implement the 
smart contract that is to contribute verify or implement the negotiation or performance 
of the contract",Blockchain
"in brief they are about the business logics of blockchain eg 
post how to destroy tokenscoins in a smart contract",Blockchain
"questions of 
protocol are about how to deal with protocols to make blockchain work correctly",Blockchain
"that is 
they are about the underlying logics of blockchain eg post how exactly to 
make consensus when chaincode has coding block of authority or event",Blockchain
"in general the 
types that developers are interested in are all related to the operating mechanisms of 
blockchain",Blockchain
there are some implications of the findings,Blockchain
"the official organizations of existing 
blockchain platforms frameworks or libraries may provide more manuals tutorials or 
books to facilitate the novice developers to handle these techniques",Blockchain
"the practitioners of 
blockchain may write more informal reading materials to make the masses understand the 
fundamental principles of blockchain more easily",Blockchain
"moreover the blockchain 
communities may set up specialized forums or websites so that the blockchain enthusiasts 
could discuss or exchange their ideas more conveniently",Blockchain
"a questions about blockchain can be roughly categorized into  types figure 
",Blockchain
"among them questions about configuration deployment discussion and 
mechanisms contract or protocol of blockchain are notable",Blockchain
the ranks of  types according to different metrics,Blockchain
"blockchain relevant entities detection 
 
tags selection 
in stack overflow a question post contains up to five tags",Blockchain
"the tags can usually reveal 
the main technologies the question post involves

 and they can usually be identified as 
named entities eg operating systems apis and platforms",Blockchain
"therefore we attempt to 
find commonly used frameworks tools libraries or techniques which are relevant to 
blockchain from the tags of the blockchain relevant question posts",Blockchain
to select blockchain relevant tags we leverage association rule mining,Blockchain
"generally if a 
tag frequently appears and only appears in the blockchain relevant question posts then 
this tag is highly possible to be specialized in blockchain",Blockchain
"there are usually two measures 
of each tag support indicates the frequency the tag appears in the blockchain relevant 
question posts confidence represents the proportion of the appearances of the tag in the 
blockchain relevant question posts to the total appearances of this tag",Blockchain
"the common process of association rule mining is to set thresholds for the two 
measures respectively and select the tags whose measures are above the thresholds",Blockchain
"however blockchain is a relatively new topic in stack overflow and blockchain relevant 
tags may appear very few times for instance only one time",Blockchain
"therefore we set the 
threshold of support to be zero ie all the tags which appear in the blockchain relevant 
question posts are considered so that more potential blockchain relevant tags can be 
selected",Blockchain
"for confidence we sort the values of this measure of all the tags in a descending order 
and draw a curve of the sorted values with their ranks",Blockchain
"then we find the knee of the 
curve

",Blockchain
"that is in the curve the value decreases steeply before the knee and get smooth 
after the knee",Blockchain
the value at the knee is chosen as the threshold of confidence,Blockchain
"in this way 
 tags are selected as their measures exceed the corresponding thresholds",Blockchain
"entities identification 
for each of the blockchain relevant tag we check the tag’s descriptions in stack 
overflow to determine what the entity the tag represents",Blockchain
"for example in stack overflow 
the tag “webjs” is described as “the webjs library is a collection of modules which 
contain specific functionality for the ethereum ecosystem allowing to ” it implies that 
the tag “webjs” represents webjs which is a javascript library used for ethereum",Blockchain
nevertheless descriptions of some tags can not be found in stack overflow,Blockchain
"under 
this condition we search the tag on the internet and check which descriptions are related 
to blockchain",Blockchain
fortunately there are no ambiguities,Blockchain
"that means a unique entity can be 
deduced from the information of the tag which is related to blockchain",Blockchain
"when the entities of all the blockchain relevant tags are identified the blockchain 
relevant frameworks tools libraries or techniques are clear to us",Blockchain
"blockchain relevant entities 
the identified entities of the  selected tags are analysed and summaried",Blockchain
"sometimes 
two tags represent the same entity ie the two tags duplicate each other",Blockchain
there are  unique entities in total,Blockchain
"figure  draws the word cloud 
 of the  entities",Blockchain
"the size of an entity name indicates the 
number of blockchain relevant question posts containing this entity as a tag",Blockchain
"there is 
undeniably that the biggest one is blockchain",Blockchain
"moreover we give each entity a summary

"if the readers are interested in any of these entities then more 
information could be got by retrieving on the internet with their full names as keywords",Blockchain
these entities cover a wide range of categories,Blockchain
"a large part of them belong to 
platformframework which helps users to build their blockchain systems in different 
aspects",Blockchain
"for example ethereum allows users to build and run decentralized applications 
operated through blockchain techniques corda allows businesses to transact directly in 
strict privacy and bigchaindb allows developers and enterprise to deploy blockchain 
applications with a blockchain database",Blockchain
"entities in tool are softwares or systems for 
certain uses eg parity hyperledger explorer and metamask are for interaction with 
blockchains",Blockchain
"library is a set of apis for developers to build applications associated with 
blockchain or bitcoin",Blockchain
"we note that all the listed platformsframeworks tools and 
libraries are freely available",Blockchain
"among all the categories currency means cryptocurrency 
a specialized one for blockchain",Blockchain
"a cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which 
cryptography techniques are used to regulate its generation and transfer",Blockchain
"bitcoin is the 
first decentralized cryptocurrency and we find cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin for 
example dogecoin and litecoin",Blockchain
"techniqueprotocol is referred to as technique protocol 
standard or concept used in blockchain or just blockchain itself",Blockchain
"moreover there are 
other categories eg solidity an advanced programming language",Blockchain
for all  entities we find three big groups hyperledger ethereum and bitcoin,Blockchain
"in 
the word cloud figure  the font colors of the entity names which are in the three 
groups are set to be magenta orange and cyan respectively",Blockchain
"it means that these entities 
are relevant to hyperledger ethereum or bitcoin",Blockchain
"the numbers of involving posts of the 
three groups are   and  which are relatively large numbers compared with the 
total number of blockchain relevant question posts ie ",Blockchain
"therefore we can say 
that hyperledger and ethereum are two most concerned about blockchain platforms in 
stack overflow",Blockchain
moreover unsurprisingly bitcoin is discussed frequently,Blockchain
"with the identified blockchain relevant entities the beginners could have a glimpse of 
blockchain relevant concepts",Blockchain
"especially they could use these open source frameworks 
tools or libraries to build their blockchain systems for example they could begin with the 
most popular platforms in stack overflow hyperledger or ethereum",Blockchain
a we identify  blockchain relevant entities figure  in stack overflow,Blockchain
"the 
entities in three groups which are relevant to hyperledger ethereum and bitcoin 
are frequently mentioned",Blockchain
"conclusion 
blockchain is going to be a hotspot in both industrial and academic fields",Blockchain
"our study 
investigates what are mostly concerned in the perspective of software developers",Blockchain
"we 
find that most developers in stack overflow are just in stage of learning and attempt",Blockchain
"many of them want to know how to correctly deploy and configure the blockchain 
systems with existing platforms or frameworks and they are also interested in the 
mechanisms of blockchain",Blockchain
"in general the three primary topics discussed in stack 
overflow are hyperledger ethereum and bitcoin",Blockchain
"with these findings the blockchain project communities could acknowledge the 
directions for making more practical blockchain techniques and novices could know what 
resources to exploit to build their first blockchain projects",Blockchain
"in the future we plan to 
expand our study to other q  a platforms forums or blogs",Blockchain
"on october   satoshi nakamoto published a 
brief but groundbreaking paper to a cryptography forum",Blockchain
"in it he outlined a way to overcome the  
doublespend scenario – a problem which plagued previous cryptocurrencies",Blockchain
"despite not mentioning 
blockchain explicitly he described its structure as a chain of hashed timestamps “each timestamp includes 
the previous timestamp in its hash forming a chain with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones 
behind it” nakamoto ",Blockchain
"although this approach was later refined for bitcoin the concept was laid out 
a chain of blocks each cryptographically linked to the previous using a hash digest",Blockchain
"from this we denote 
that a blockchain is little more than a sequence of records each hashed and linked to the previous block 
figure ",Blockchain
"nakamoto’s blockchain proposal nakamoto  
however this approach alone wasn’t sufficient to eliminate the double spend issue",Blockchain
"in a double spend 
scenario the attacker attempts to create a race condition in which they spend the same virtual assets twice 
before either is validated",Blockchain
"for a blockchain to guard against this bitcoin needed a method for its network to 
form consensus",Blockchain
"nakamoto introduced a proofofwork model in which agents would repeatedly hash the 
block with a random number nonce until they achieved a value less than a specified target",Blockchain
"once found the 
block would then extend the existing chain",Blockchain
"as the blockchain is decentralized over peertopeer any agent

can participate in the proofofwork consensus model to validate transactions bitcoin incentives agency with 
potential economic gains",Blockchain
"the bitcoin cryptocurrency required a construct into which it could record the order of transactions 
verify them and then secure the entry",Blockchain
"blockchain technology provided this mechanism through a collection 
of ever extending blocks where each block represents a pool of transactions and are cryptographically 
linked to a parent block via a hash digest",Blockchain
"since the blockchain is represented in a freely distributable file 
there is no master copy it is distributed among all parties",Blockchain
"the bitcoin network relies on this decentralized 
distribution along with the proofofwork consensus model to coordinate which blocks are added to the chain 
and to update all other copies",Blockchain
"the blockchain in bitcoin functions as a database to store transactions using a series of inputs and output 
resembling double entry accounting",Blockchain
"interestingly bitcoin balances are not maintained just inputs and 
outputs",Blockchain
there are no “coins” minted and serialized for consumption as one may think,Blockchain
"by traversing the 
blockchain the available balance for a user can be quickly calculated",Blockchain
"any attempt to “corrupt” the 
blockchain and award more coins in a transaction will fail as the blockchain hashes would have to be 
recalculated – a computationally hard problem – and the blockchain’s decentralized nature ensures other 
nodes will have legitimate copies",Blockchain
"the first usage of bitcoin dates to january   at which point nakamoto created the blockchain 
genesis block the first block in the chain and the only one not to have a parent block to link to and issued 
himself the first  bitcoins blockchain luxembourg sa  zohar ",Blockchain
"all blocks in the bitcoin 
blockchain trace back to this original transaction",Blockchain
"this leads to one more observation blockchains form an 
immutable historic record of every transaction from the date of origin in a transparent decentralized data 
store",Blockchain
"a blockchain gains its secure immutable nature by combining two innovations a cryptographic link 
between records that makes changes progressively more difficult the longer the chain is and the distribution 
of the data to all participating nodes on the decentralized network in which it is expected honest nodes 
outnumber potential attackers 
 functional characteristics  
despite being initially linked to bitcoin blockchain technology can be used independently in a variety of 
different usecases and markets ranging from insurance to the health industry",Blockchain
"a blockchain can be applied 
in virtually any industry in which assets are managed and transactions occur",Blockchain
"it can provide a secure chain of 
custody for both digital and physical assets through its functional characteristics that facilitate transactions 
through trust consensus security and smart contracts",Blockchain
"these aspects of blockchains are explored in the 
following sections",Blockchain
" transactions  smart contracts 
a transaction is an exchange of assets that is managed under the entity service’s rules",Blockchain
"such rules are usually 
operationalized through scripting languages eg",Blockchain
"bitcoin’s forth and are used for advanced transactions 
such as escrow and multiparty signatures to be performed",Blockchain
"these rules also form the basis for smart 
contracts",Blockchain
"a smart contract is a set of logic rules in the form of a coded script which can be embedded into the 
blockchain to govern a transaction",Blockchain
"the contract is executed autonomously and is used to govern the 
transaction buterin ",Blockchain
in this way contracts act as smart software agents stark ,Blockchain
"once a smart 
contract is embedded in the blockchain it becomes an autonomous agent that is permanently tamperproof",Blockchain
an application then reads the code when performing a transaction executes and processes the results,Blockchain
the contract nature of a smart contract isn’t just restricted to application specific code,Blockchain
"it can also be 
used to codify the terms and condition of an agreement into the transaction workflow",Blockchain
"ethereum the second 
largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin is an altcoin technology that has been designed to support smart 
contracts",Blockchain

 consensus  trust 
in events surrounding nuclear disarmament near end of the cold war president regan made a russian 
proverb famous “trust but verify” the same could be claimed for blockchain",Blockchain
"it is trusted by consensus as 
all parties must have identical copies of the blockchain but each participant is responsible for verifying it",Blockchain
blockchain’s decentralization is a core strength as a copy of the database file is owned by all actors,Blockchain
"in 
order to ensure the integrity of each copy a consensus algorithm is required",Blockchain
"the consensus algorithm allows 
the community to ensure that each added block is legitimate",Blockchain
"it also prevents attackers from compromising 
and forking the chain coindesk ",Blockchain
"nakamoto suggested using a proofofwork approach in which a 
hard cryptographic puzzle must be solved by miners nakamoto ",Blockchain
"miners expend computing resources 
and are rewarded for their efforts using various incentives",Blockchain
"other consensus models such as proofofstake 
proofofburn proofofelapsedtime and proofofcapacity have been proposed in the literature to overcome 
some of the weaknesses of the original proofofwork model by attempting to balance fairness and resource 
expenditure kiayias et al  zamfir ",Blockchain
the nature of blockchain is trustless,Blockchain
"blockchain is designed to eliminate the need for any one entity to 
gate transactions",Blockchain
"it establishes a trust model based on a group consensus where the network validates 
transactions and authorizes their addition to the chain",Blockchain
"there are no middlemen the notion of trust becomes 
implicit as each record in the blockchain is verified by the community which holds multiple copies of the 
blockchain",Blockchain
"by removing trust agents from transactions blockchain has the ability to disrupt many major 
industries",Blockchain
traditional transaction models rely on central authority to act in the clearinghouse role,Blockchain
"trust is granted 
to the central authority with an expectation that it will remain honest while verifying and clearing 
transactions",Blockchain
the instances of records reside with the authority,Blockchain
"if the central authority is compromised either 
intentionally manipulation or unintentionally hacked the interlocutor can wreak extensive havoc on the 
system",Blockchain
"the blockchain model eliminates the central authority figure  by instead disseminating copies of 
the records to all parties",Blockchain
each participant maintains their own instance of the blockchain,Blockchain
"they broadcast 
changes by forming new blocks and requesting validation based on the rules of the consensus model",Blockchain
"once 
validated the block is added to everyone’s chain",Blockchain
"the process is potentially safer than the traditional model 
and the middleman agent isn’t required invoking a disruption to the status quo",Blockchain
"traditional vs blockchain transaction model 
a blockchain relies on mathematics via cryptography to establish independent trust for each transaction 
and on computationally expensive consensus models to replace central authorities",Blockchain
"pools of recent 
transactions are ordered into a block",Blockchain
"the block is then cryptographically linked to a chain of blocks the 
blockchain and is verified through a consensus model that involves significant computing resources 
mining",Blockchain
"as the blockchain is an openaccess file replicated on multiple fullnodes of the network no one 
entity controls the transaction list",Blockchain
"since each block is hashed and inserted into the chain it is immutable and 
serves as a final record of past transactions",Blockchain
"an entity cannot change the chain without changing all blocks 
that follow it an effort which is computationally hard and expensive",Blockchain
"this secures the blockchain and 
establishes trust independent of a central authority",Blockchain

 public – public blockchains have no single owner are visible by anyone their consensus process is 
open to all to participate in and they are full decentralized",Blockchain
"bitcoin is an example of a public 
blockchain",Blockchain
" private – also called permissioned private blockchains use privileges to control who can read from 
and write to the blockchain",Blockchain
"consensus algorithms and mining usually aren’t required as a single 
entity has ownership and controls block creation",Blockchain
 hybrid – also known as consortium these blockchains are public only to a privileged group,Blockchain
"the 
consensus process is controlled by known privileged servers using a set of rules agreed to by all 
parties",Blockchain
"copies of the blockchain are only distributed among entitled participants the network is 
therefore only partly decentralized",Blockchain
"although a public blockchain distributes itself in a decentralized peertopeer fashion this isn’t 
necessarily true for a private blockchain",Blockchain
"private blockchains are those used by enterprises to record asset 
transactions within a limited user base restricted scope",Blockchain
"hybrid blockchains can be visualized as very small 
scale public blockchains they are decentralized only across a limited participant base",Blockchain
"as a summary we can formalize the aforenoted features of the blockchain into a list of four core 
characteristics 
 immutable – permanent and tamperproof a blockchain is a permanent record of transactions",Blockchain
once a block is added it cannot be altered,Blockchain
this creates trust in the transaction record,Blockchain
" decentralized – networked copies a blockchain is stored in a file that can be accessed and copied 
by any node on the network",Blockchain
" consensus driven – trust verification each block on the blockchain is verified independently via a 
consensus models which provide rules for validating a block and often use a scarce resource such 
as computing power to show proof that adequate effort was made",Blockchain
"in bitcoin this is referred to as 
the mining process",Blockchain
"this mechanism works without the use of a central authority or an explicit  
trustgranting agent",Blockchain
" transparent – full transaction history since the blockchain is an open file any party can access it 
and audit transactions",Blockchain
"this creates provenance under which asset lifetimes can be tracked

there are many different blockchain definitions offered ranging from applicationspecific to the excessively 
technical",Blockchain
"for example coinbase the  world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange defines blockchain as “a
distributed public ledger that contains the history of every bitcoin transaction” coinbase ",Blockchain
"as an 
applicationspecific definition this characterization does not account for the fact that blockchains can be 
reused for other cryptocurrencies and industry applications independently",Blockchain
"the oxford english dictionary 
broadens the definition somewhat defining blockchain as “a digital ledger in which transactions made in 
bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly” oxford dictionaries ",Blockchain
"this definition also falls short as blockchain technology can be used independently of bitcoin and other 
cryptocurrencies",Blockchain
"both these definitions also highlight the role of a blockchain as a digital ledger and much 
of the literature would agree with this",Blockchain
"however this domain is evolving rapidly and ledger usage is simply 
a feature of the blockchain but not its essence",Blockchain
"this feature only pertains to blockchain applications that focus 
on managing the exchange of value in the case of virtual assets",Blockchain
"a somewhat broader definition is offered by webopedia where a blockchain is defined as “a type of data 
structure that enables identifying and tracking transactions digitally and sharing this information across a 
distributed network of computers creating in a sense a distributed trust network",Blockchain
"the distributed ledger 
technology offered by blockchain provides a transparent and secure means for tracking the ownership and 
transfer of assets” stroud ",Blockchain
"while this definition succeeds in capturing more of the characteristics of 
blockchain it highlights distribution as a key feature of blockchain computing without acknowledging that 
blockchains are not just a distributed technology but also a decentralized one swan b wright and de

"the key distinction here is that while a distributed system partitions work among participants 
in an optimal fashion a blockchain requires that each and every participant maintain a full node of the system 
and enforce its rules independently",Blockchain
"in a system where nodes operate on local information decision locality 
to accomplish goals rather than the result of a central ordering influence this decentralization ensures that 
pulling the plug is near impossible – only one node needs to remain operational for the network to function",Blockchain
evidently there is a need for a clear and concise definition of blockchain,Blockchain
"based on the theoretical 
underpinnings of blockchain technology outlined in the previous sections we provide the following 
definition of a blockchain  
“a decentralized database containing sequential cryptographically linked blocks of digitally signed 
asset transactions governed by a consensus model”
through this connotative definition we aim to highlight the core constituents for blockchain technology 
in that it is a peertopeer networked database governed by a set of rules",Blockchain
"furthermore blockchains represent 
a shift away from traditional trust agents and a move towards transparency",Blockchain
"as a technological building 
block it permits applications from a broad swath of industries to take advantage of sharing tracking and 
auditing digital assets",Blockchain
"the next section identifies potential opportunities and usecases for blockchain 
technology in different industries 
 blockchain business applications

"value proposition of blockchain technology 
since the fundamental usecase for blockchain technology is to drive greater transparency and substantiate 
accuracy of transaction data across the digital information ecosystem potential applications of such 
technology are practically endless",Blockchain
"in addition to virtual currencies such as bitcoin a multitude of other 
potential blockchain applications and services have been envisioned and discussed by industry pundits and 
technology research firms cbinsights  mougayar ",Blockchain
"to make sense of the blockchain application 
ecosystem mougayar  identifies the value proposition of blockchains as pertaining to the enablement 
of one or more of six elements denoted by the mnemonic atomic assets trust ownership money 
identity and contracts",Blockchain
"these elements constitute the crux of blockchain business applications by 
facilitating the creation management and transfer of digital assets through automated validation rules 
cryptographically verified rights and ownerships and the validation of transactions without requiring 
intermediaries",Blockchain
"using a blockchain platform implies that each of these six elements is programmable and by 
disintermediating these facets blockchains can enable new services to come to market with cheaper 
transaction fees and faster execution",Blockchain
"in this way blockchain technology is poised to disrupt many business 
models which rely on often costly intermediaries",Blockchain
"mougayar  also classifies the role of blockchains as spanning four aspects blockchain as a 
development platform blockchain as a smart contract utility blockchain as a marketplace and finally 
blockchain as a trusted service application rosic ",Blockchain
"these potential roles are discussed herewith 
 blockchain as a development platform 
at present the development of blockchain applications and services requires a highly specialized skillset and  
the state of the blockchain developer toolkits is immature aru ",Blockchain

smart contracts provide a programmatic interface to blockchains",Blockchain
"smart contract utility is defined as “being 
able to perform useful functions to create maintain or augment the value of digital assets” sorin et al

the smart contract when triggered transacts value based on digital assets,Blockchain
"utility is captured in code

this code is executed when a predetermined condition occurs,Blockchain
"activities often 
managed by third party central authorities are mitigated to the blockchain instead disintermediating

"examples include escrow multiparty transactions digital notarization and 
time stamping",Blockchain
"blockchain startups such as r are collaborating with banks and regulators to operationalize 
blockchains as a new operating system for financial markets irrera ",Blockchain
"a specific instance of this 
functionality can be observed in the example of visa and docusign who have partnered to operate a  
proofofconcept blockchain project to streamline vehicle leasing experience for customers by simplifying 
transaction management between multiple parties including sellers buyers and insurance companies hirson 
 
 blockchain as a marketplace 
any robust ecosystem requires a market for generating value",Blockchain
"in the cryptoeconomics marketplace 
blockchain provides a payment infrastructure via cryptocurrencies and a proofofownership structure via 
digital asset tracking",Blockchain
"this has enabled peertopeer marketplaces with no governing authority such as 
openbazaar and soma providing accessible disintermediated trade cbinsights ",Blockchain
"in these 
marketplaces blockchain platforms can be used to directly match buyers and sellers allowing them to 
transact through smart contracts",Blockchain
"blockchain technology is also being touted as an enabler for next generation 
online workforce marketplaces in the context of the gig economy that relies on independent contract workers 
and freelancers for shortterm engagements and the shared economy where consumers increasingly become 
prosumers",Blockchain
"in such instances blockchain platforms can ensure that service providers are not constrained by 
any central authority – hence allowing them to extend flexible offerings and payment interactions and 
service transactions can function in a transparent environment aitken ",Blockchain
"overall as a marketplace enabler blockchains can be used to operationalize programmable assets 
ownership and money

finally in its role as a trusted service application blockchain technology comprises endtoend functionality 
by facilitating highly specialized applications for any purpose imaginable",Blockchain
"this more generalized use of 
blockchains to enable all types of applications through a combination of programmable assets trust 
ownership money identity and contracts is sometimes referred to as blockchain ",Blockchain
"on the frontend trusted service applications built on the blockchain using smart contracts can 
provide disintermediated secure services to end users",Blockchain
"on the backend many of these applications reside on 
public blockchains eg",Blockchain
bitcoin and ethereum which cannot be shut down or restricted,Blockchain
"furthermore many

"this could ultimately lead to the 
elimination of control and audit activities or at the least to a profound redefinition of those professions",Blockchain
"for example access could be granted to auditors and regulators providing a “single source of the

confirmation process that could be eliminated from the auditors’ review process especially 
confirmation of outstanding receivable and payable balances",Blockchain

approved by the blockchain confirmation of transactional information and details are broadcasted to

another making the auditor’s confirmation no longer necessary smith  borthick ",Blockchain
"however even though blockchain technology offers many different features and seems to be 
secured there are several existing challenges that need to be addressed",Blockchain
"one major issue is 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
interoperability",Blockchain
"interoperability is defined by the francophone association of free software users as 
“a characteristic of a product or system whose interfaces are completely understood to work with 
other products or systems present or future in either implementation or access without any 
restrictions”",Blockchain
"as of today even though multiple blockchain projects have been set up and some of them 
are even well established such as bitcoin and ethereum there are still interoperability issues among 
blockchain infrastructures",Blockchain
"moreover the compatibility issue of blockchain with enterprise 
information systems eg erp which often include a variety of functional modules such as 
accounting controlling procurement logistics warehousing manufacturing project management 
quality management etc",Blockchain
"are currently being addressed by several erp vendors and technology 
companies kacina et al ",Blockchain
these systems are widely used across all industries nowadays,Blockchain
"lastly 
blockchain’s benefits are best realized when different industry participants come together to create a 
shared platform which increases interoperability challenges at two levels pwc  first at the 
technical level as each participant’s systems need to be compatible with the shared blockchain and 
second at the blockchain governance level as each participant needs to agree on the shared network 
rules",Blockchain
another key issue is the blockchain scalability,Blockchain
"scalability is the ability for a system to continue to 
function well when it changes in size or volume  typically to a larger size or volume rouse ",Blockchain
"in the blockchain context the scalability issue arises when the number of participants increases over 
time",Blockchain
"scalability has several components latency which is the “time for a transaction to confirm” 
croman ",Blockchain
"as of today latency takes at least  minutes with the blockchain bitcoin and  
seconds for ethereum which is significantly more than current payment processing systems is",Blockchain
"moreover   of transactions on public blockchains exceed  minutes and  percent can exceed 
an hour kanaracus  harris ",Blockchain
"potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
    size and storage are other important scalability components that need to be worked on",Blockchain
"indeed by 
design the ledger of a blockchain contains all the transactions since the genesis block",Blockchain
"thus as the 
number of users and transactions grow the size of the ledger also grows",Blockchain
"bandwidth is also important as transactions need to be relayed through the network prior to being 
validated through consensus algorithm",Blockchain
"indeed when the number of users increases and consequently 
the number of transaction increases a better network connectivity is necessary",Blockchain
"good network 
connectivity and large storage capacity require effective record management leading to centralization 
increased costs harris  and more energy consumption",Blockchain
"the last component of scalability is throughput referring to the maximal rate at which the network 
can work properly ie",Blockchain
transmit receive and validate transactions,Blockchain
"because of the design of the 
blockchain infrastructure the number of transactions being transmitted received and validated over 
the network is small in regard to other existing centralized infrastructures",Blockchain
"with bitcoin for example 
the maximal rate is of approximately  transactions per second",Blockchain
"this issue mainly concerns public 
blockchains and is already managed for private blockchains for which some infrastructures can already 
handle thousands of transactions per second",Blockchain
there are other important types of risks,Blockchain
"for example credentials can be compromised or stolen 
and there are concerns that it might be vulnerable to programming errors such as in the decentralized 
autonomous organization or dao platform which lost  million in  or systems weaknesses 
such as the vulnerabilies behind the scandal of the bitcoin exchange mt",Blockchain
"this is also 
true for smart contracts",Blockchain
"they are standalone programs that once started automatically execute pre
defined conditions encoded within the blockchain",Blockchain
"they work just like any conditional statement of 
the if  then type if such a condition is satisfied then such a consequence runs",Blockchain
"no form or human 
intervention is needed to process those transactions",Blockchain
"a study recently revealed that  of all smart 
contracts are fatally flawed nikolic et al ",Blockchain
"another analysis performed by a blockchain security 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
company showed that among projects that have collectively raised  billion more than one quarter 
of them had critical vulnerabilities de havilland ",Blockchain
"in addition to these technical challenges the biggest barrier to blockchain adoption today as reported 
by pwc and deloitte in their reports pwc  deloitte  is the regulatory uncertainty",Blockchain
"indeed 
even though many territories have begun studying and discussing the issues pwc  particularly 
as they relate to financial services the regulatory environment remains unsettled",Blockchain
"overall there are 
currently insufficient standards and controls in place to ensure that the systems are functioning as 
intended alarcon ",Blockchain
"for example in the european union it is unclear how any blockchain project 
can meet the general data protection regulation gdpr privacy standards pwc ",Blockchain
blockchain impact on audit and control professions remains an underresearched area,Blockchain
"in a context 
where blockchain developments flourish our general hypothesis is that blockchain technologies have 
the potential to significantly disrupt and transform the audit and control work",Blockchain
"research methodology 
    this section describes the methods used in developing the research collecting and analyzing data",Blockchain
the grounded theory approach was used for this research,Blockchain
"strauss and corbin have defined grounded 
theory as “theory that was derived from data systematically gathered and analyzed through the

specialists will be necessary for the audits to be as efficient effective and of higher quality as 
anticipated by the use of new technologies",Blockchain
"at the same time  of the interviewees foresee that the traditional auditing workload will 
decrease",Blockchain
"indeed some of the tedious and laborintensive processes traditionally associated with an 
audit raphae  especially the ones that do not require experience and technical knowledge such 
as data collection data cleansing and sorting and tick and tie activities will be eliminated or 
automatized martindale  smith ",Blockchain
" hypothesize that the use of blockchain coupled 
with the use of other new technologies such as workflow automation digitalization data mining 
robotization and the use of artificial intelligence will increase audit efficiency and effectiveness thus 
leaving more time for auditors to use their professional judgment experience knowledge of an 
industry and of competitors performance to get a better understanding of their clients and therefore 
provide deeper analysis on business issues controls and risks",Blockchain
"this trend appears to be in line with 
the literature that foresees efficiency gains as a result of the use of new technologies in auditing 
raphae  sheehan  smith ",Blockchain
"thus  of the interviewees think that auditors will 
therefore be able to focus on value added activities and provide better insights to their audit clients 
based on their professional judgment",Blockchain
"this is aligned with current literature explaining that the 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
traditional role of data verification responsibilities will change and evolve over time but the need for 
data interpretation and integration into strategy are positioned to grow and change moving forward 
smith ",Blockchain
"some auditors also predict that they will be able to perform real time audit as also mentioned in the 
literature",Blockchain
"indeed if operational and financial information is uploaded into the blockchain network on 
a continuous basis and if auditors have continuous access to the blockchain used by their clients then 
they will be able to analyze this information in a real time manner banham ",Blockchain
"real time review 
will also contribute to providing better insights to audit clients thus not only increasing the value of 
the audit but also bringing audit quality to a new level as exceptions will be detected earlier and 
corrected by clients on a timely basis",Blockchain
findings have some other implications for the audit firms,Blockchain
"indeed ‘the future is characterized by 
unparalleled organizational and informational complexity with corporate and business reporting 
evolving rapidly’ axelsen et al ",Blockchain
"if the auditors and the audit firms are to keep up with these 
changes and the it current development accounting firms should think about what the audit of the 
future will look like and whether their audit teams have the required skills macmanus ",Blockchain
"as of 
today the big four have already invested in the use of new technologies such as data analytics 
software and ai programs and started proofofconcept projects on blockchain",Blockchain
"all interviewees are 
anticipating a “people challenge” at two levels",Blockchain
"first auditors need to stay up to date on new auditing 
and accounting standards and latest developments and more importantly increase their is skills",Blockchain
"indeed  of the interviewees think that auditors financial and is in place and in training need 
deeper it skills",Blockchain
"to address those requirements the big four continuously invest to ‘retrain’ and ‘re
skill’ their employees and keep them informed on “hot topics”",Blockchain
"however it seems that smaller auditing 
firms are not investing as much as larger auditing firm in training their employees on new technologies 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
including blockchain and therefore are not as prepared for the changes to come as our study shows",Blockchain
"indeed  of the audit firms surveyed that are not among the big four have not started investigating 
the subject matter",Blockchain
"they are in a “wait and see” mode and hope that they will be able to catch up with 
any new developments when time comes but this might be too late",Blockchain
"the second challenge comes from 
the fact that the tedious and manual audit processes and tests that are currently performed by junior 
auditors will be automated therefore auditing firms will not need as many juniors as they need today",Blockchain
"instead they will need more specialists and more experienced professionals who will be able to use 
their professional judgment to solve complex problem analyze data identify control improvements 
and provide valueadded insights to their clients",Blockchain
"this will affect the audit pyramidal organization and 
the way auditing firms manage their workforce careers which is partially based on a high turnover 
rate especially at the junior and senior auditor positions",Blockchain
"lastly as reported by  of the interviewees the auditing standards will have to be updated to 
include more it related guidance",Blockchain
"indeed as of today there is no auditing standard describing how to 
perform an audit on blockchain",Blockchain
"the extent and the pace to which international rules will be modified 
in relation to the growth of blockchain use and other new technologies such as data analytics and ai 
remain unknown at this stage",Blockchain
"we can say that the iaasb initiated an awareness process that can be 
illustrated both with the presentation of blockchain done by chuck landes chair of the iaasb 
innovation working group and the feedback statement by the data analytics working group 
dawg on ‘exploring the growing use of the technology in the audit with a focus on data analytics’",Blockchain
"the feedback statement reports that the respondents to their request for input from the audit 
professionals emphasized the need for the iaasb to ‘reflect the digital era in application guidance’ 
and recommended that the dawg members ‘consider other technologies whose impact on auditing 
deserves further consideration such as blockchain technology’iasb ",Blockchain
"also the pcaob 
announced in december  the plan to form a new task force on data and technology to explore 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
whether there is a need for guidance changes to pcaob standards or other regulatory actions in light 
of the increased use of data analytics and of other new and emerging technologybased tools pcaob 
",Blockchain
"to the best of our knowledge the swiss transmitter of the national auditing standards 
expertsuisse has not yet set up such a working group to assess the impact of blockchain on the 
audit profession",Blockchain
"in the meantime swiss financial auditors already face the challenge to audit 
companies active on blockchain or companies that have implemented blockchain platforms to run 
some of their business processes",Blockchain
"this situation requires them to use their professional judgement when 
auditing standards are silent or not adequate",Blockchain
"the evolution of norms or the development of new 
standards may follow and draw on the evolution of this professional practice",Blockchain
"over all the findings suggest that the profession is at a turning point and three major hypotheses 
have emerged  
 
h the potential disruptive effect of the technology on the profession is not fully anticipated and 
smaller auditing firms are not tooling up to face the changes to come",Blockchain
"the impact of blockchain on the audit profession would be different if audit clients adopt it as part 
of their business process or if it is used by auditing firms as an audit tool",Blockchain
"even though both venues are possible none of the auditors interviewed even the auditors working 
for the big four mentioned blockchain as a possible audit tool on its own",Blockchain
"all of them only considered 
the potential impacts blockchain would have on their profession if it is used by their clients how this 
would have an effect on the relationship with their clients how they would access clients’ data and 
how they would audit the new system in place",Blockchain
"furthermore on the one hand the big four have 
launched projects training programs and communicate actively on blockchain technology which 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
allows their auditors to better understand the technology provide support to and advise their clients",Blockchain
"those companies at the strategic level are developing the knowledge and the resources to not only 
anticipate but also influence the deployment and usage of blockchain by their clients and the audit of 
the technology by audit professionals",Blockchain
"on the other hand smaller auditing firms have not started to 
invest and to investigate the technology as they do not have the financial and human capacity",Blockchain
"they 
also believe that their client type smaller firms will not embrace the technology at the same pace as 
larger firms and therefore they can wait to develop their capacities and capabilities",Blockchain
"however as 
blockchain offer many interesting characteristics and as the technology is based on “shared and 
distributed” features we can anticipate that once it will start to root into the business ecosystem its 
adoption will most probably be rapid and general",Blockchain
"indeed pwc recently reported that in the  
countries where they surveyed leaders  of them explain that their company is already engaged 
into a project related to blockchain pwc ",Blockchain
"another survey from deloitte led in  countries 
reported that  of the  senior executives working in companies with annual revenues over  
million think that their company will adopt the technology within the next  months deloitte ",Blockchain
"we can thus infer that most smaller audit firms as they do not have sufficient current knowledge and 
understanding of the technology are not anticipating the impact of the technology on their profession 
and sooner than later might not be able to answer their clients’ emerging needs on the technology",Blockchain
h the profession will change its paradigm to become more it oriented and more forwardlooking,Blockchain
"first blockchain allows controls to be embedded into the technology therefore some processes and 
transactions will be automated",Blockchain
"moreover records of all transactions will be instantly available to the 
auditors and will be automatically validated by the technology itself",Blockchain
"we can then induce that the main 
focus of the auditors will not be to guarantee the existence of transactions attest of their evidence 
accuracy and completeness as those checks are going to be performed by the technology itself but to 
attest that blockchain is working as intended",Blockchain
"is auditors will have to not only understand the 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
technology but also the underlying code they will have to assess the related risks and the emerging 
issues that could affect their clients",Blockchain
"indeed as demonstrated by kinney businesses place a great 
reliance upon is as part of their business strategy and operations axelsen et al  which will be 
reinforced by the use of blockchain",Blockchain
"the change in the profession paradigm will also be accelerated 
by the fact that not only the audit clients but also the audit firms use more and more different kinds of 
technologies to perform their audit work",Blockchain
"for example kpmg has partnered with ibm watson to 
begin automating and streamlining audit and tax processes smith  other type of artificial 
intelligence systems can also be used to reconcile data while drones can help with inventory counts",Blockchain
"second audit has always been a “backlooking” activity whose purpose is to obtain reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements of an audited entity are free from material misstatement isa 
  to provide an audit opinion for an ended period isa  ",Blockchain
"thanks to the use of 
blockchain and datadriven analysis auditors will be able to provide new insights to their clients",Blockchain
"we 
can then construe that the profession will move from checking past data to providing new types of 
analysis and therefore become “forwardlooking”",Blockchain
"even though none of the  auditors interviewed 
already provides forwardlooking information to their audit clients we expect this move to happen 
sooner than later",Blockchain
"indeed audit clients will probably urge their auditors to provide them with advisory 
as it would bring them additional value",Blockchain
"however auditors are currently restricted in the type of 
services they can provide to their audit clients for independence reasons which might represent an 
ethical challenge that the profession will have to tackle",Blockchain
h profile of auditors will change,Blockchain
"the hypothesis  suggests that the audit paradigm will change as it will be more it and advisory 
driven",Blockchain
"even though today’s financial auditors and is auditors are well educated  indeed many 
financial auditors are also cpas is auditors cisa and both financial and is auditors have graduated 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
with a bachelor or a master’s degree  we can induce that to address the changes brought by the 
paradigm shift profile of auditors will have to change in several ways",Blockchain
"as demonstrated by curtis dowling and leech technologies at the auditees are increasingly more 
sophisticated axelsen et al  and blockchain with its technical features such as asymmetric 
cryptography and distributed systems is a good example of a sophisticated technology",Blockchain
"if the role of 
auditors is less and less to audit the financial data but to audit the blockchain and certify that it is 
properly implemented then auditors will have to be able to thoroughly understand those features",Blockchain
"they 
will have to widen their technical skillset to master coding hashing cryptography and also work on 
their soft skills",Blockchain
"indeed if auditees use smart contracts that execute automatically  predefined 
conditions within the blockchain if such condition is satisfied then such consequence runs auditors 
will have to first understand the underlying code and second will have to be able to communicate 
clearly with lawyers to ensure that those contracts are legally valid",Blockchain
"moreover the literature review 
shows that the audit profession will also be impacted by the use of other technologies such as data 
analytics tysiac  anderson  macmanus  raphae  and sheehan  iasb 
 which is confirmed by the interviewees",Blockchain
"indeed all the auditors interviewed who work for a big 
four mentioned that they already use data analytics as an audit tool which is however not yet the 
case in smaller cpa firms as only a few interviewees working for this type of firm already use it",Blockchain
"therefore audit firms will have to hire data scientists or train their auditors in order to drill down large 
volumes of data",Blockchain
"those data scientists will team up with experienced auditors or field specialists tax 
finance valuation to interpret data and provide the insights and advice auditees will expect to receive 
from their auditors",Blockchain
"as such audit firms will need more experienced professionals instead of juniors 
and instead of hiring juniors who gain experience over the years and climb the hierarchy will directly 
hire experienced people",Blockchain
"today auditors leave audit firms to work in the industry in the future the 
other way around might prove to be true",Blockchain
"professionals might leave the industry and work for audit 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
firms directly as managers or directors which will deeply impact audit firms’ organizational chart",Blockchain
"conclusion 
    indeed blockchain is sometimes compared to automation and data analytics that will require 
transforming how audits are performed raphae ",Blockchain
"blockchain technology has the potential not 
only to make the accounting and auditing rules change but also to impact the nature of the accounting 
and auditing profession",Blockchain
"some top executives highlight the fact that blockchain is a better ledger 
because it allows adding entries to a ledger and to have multiple ledgers crosschecking against each 
other martindale ",Blockchain
"in addition it provides a third validation point that did not exist before 
where auditors have previously stepped in and may not have to do so anymore in a near future 
martindale ",Blockchain
"finally a major opportunity resides in the fact that blockchain could facilitate the 
audit and control work by encoding rules directly in specific processes",Blockchain
"but a major challenge exists 
in terms of potential redefinition of audit and control activities based on the properties of blockchain 
technology transparency traceability security persistency and immutability of transactions",Blockchain
"the question of the nature and scope of audit work in the case of blockchain use has been raised and 
not fully answered yet",Blockchain
"some emphasize the growing need of digital technology profiles raphae 
 while others emphasize the move towards less numerous but more valueadded activities 
macmanus  which is confirmed by our study",Blockchain
"more importantly blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to cause the greatest 
level of disruption for the audit profession",Blockchain
"while this potential disruption may be years away some 
commentators have suggested that the potential impact on the auditing profession could be as 
significant as the impact of the internet on industries such as travel or retail sheehan ",Blockchain
"and yet 
our research results highlight the fact that auditors in practice do not completely foresee the radical 
potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
changes that blockchain technology could bring potentially far more important compared to evolution 
of companies towards automation and increased use of data analytics",Blockchain
in that sense the audit profession could in fact be facing a paradigm change,Blockchain
"legal obligations to 
perform audits of financial statements may become useless once blockchain technologies will be 
mature enough and have proved their scalability",Blockchain
"automated and certified audits will be on blockchain 
and financial statements information accessible to stakeholders in real time",Blockchain
"while auditors are 
foreseen to become blockchain technology experts and certifiers it is unclear whether they will encode 
the rules in blockchain themselves or work together with accounting internal control risk management 
and compliances experts",Blockchain
"will the work be limited to assessing whether or not blockchain is working 
correctly macmanus  or go beyond that",Blockchain
"is the audit profession about to change its paradigm 
to move from being backlooking to forwardlooking",Blockchain
"will it change its perspective and be more 
futureoriented",Blockchain
"how will this move toward less independence be perceived by investors especially 
as trust in the profession has not fully recovered yet",Blockchain
"we believe that because blockchain technology and the development of auditing and control 
standards are not envisioned in an integrated way the potential impact of blockchain on audit and 
control professions has not yet been systematically and thoroughly assessed",Blockchain
"we think that the results of this study can be of interest to the profession and to the organizations 
that are in charge of training auditors",Blockchain
"indeed the use of blockchain and other “new technologies” will 
require very different skillsets",Blockchain
"such skills will be more it oriented and at the same time will require 
a strong business and accounting technicity a mix of skills that is rare among the profession as well 
as in the current academic and professional training",Blockchain
"potential impact of blockchain on audit practice 
 
 
 
    this study also contributes to both blockchain and auditing scientific literature because it describes 
and explores the financial and is auditors’ perceptions regarding the impact of blockchain technology 
on their profession",Blockchain
"it also provides accounting and auditing firms as well as auditing continuing 
education institutions with insights on the required future skillset of auditors and the evolution of their 
scope of work",Blockchain
"finally we stress the limited nature of our study whose purpose was to serve as an initial 
exploration of the impacts of blockchain on the auditing profession",Blockchain
"we should insist on the fact that 
these research hypotheses need to be validated in subsequent research",Blockchain
"indeed we started in march 
 a threeyear swiss national science foundation research project on this specific topic covering 
both the management and the technical dimensions of the research question",Blockchain

goes to show that the public needs to become more educated on the many ways one can 
lose money when investing in the proverbial ‘wild west’ of investments",Cryptocurrency

"new investors are wrangled in by falsified 
reports unrealistically high return rates and the recommendations of older investors",Cryptocurrency

elicited",Cryptocurrency
"however due to the general public’s naiveite concerning cryptocurrencies most 
may not be familiar with ponzi schemes that can be committed with cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"probably the most infamous ‘cryptoponzi scheme’ would be the scheme perpetrated by 
 
 
bitconnect",Cryptocurrency
"on the surface bitconnect seems like a perfectly legitimate 
cryptocurrencyexchange with a userfriendly website complete with a fun animated 
video explaining its supposed perks",Cryptocurrency
"however bitconnect perpetrated a ponzi scheme 
that relieved thousands of investors of their cash",Cryptocurrency
"initial investors were promised returns 
of up to  in the early days of the cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"investors were told by bitconnect 
that they would earn ‘interest’ on their bcc’s if they stored and traded them on 
bitconnect’s native cryptocurrency exchange thus rendering  of bcc transactions to 
occur on said exchange buntinx ",Cryptocurrency
"another red flag was that any purchases of 
bitconnect coin bcc had to be paid in bitcoin",Cryptocurrency
"this was most likely due to the fact 
that cash purchases are easier to trace as opposed to purchases using bitcoin or any other 
cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"bitconnect supplied investors with earnings reports that would show how 
much they had gained in interest",Cryptocurrency
"the ‘interest’ was no doubt earned through the funds 
coming from new investors the textbook definition of a ponzi scheme jenkin ",Cryptocurrency
"as 
of january th  many believe that bitconnect’s ponzi scheme has come to a halt",Cryptocurrency
"the price of bcc had decreased drastically by  in a short amount of time falling 
from a lofty  per bcc to a mere  per bcc buntinx ",Cryptocurrency
"this rapid decline is 
no doubt in response to many cryptoinvestors’ realizations that they were most likely 
being scammed out of their money and had no chance of recovering their funds",Cryptocurrency
unfortunately the perpetrators of the scheme covered their tracks very well,Cryptocurrency
"by operating 
anonymously and requiring that all bcc purchased be made be bought with bitcoin they 
made it nearly impossible for investigators to track them down",Cryptocurrency
"some estimate that 
anywhere between  and  million dollars were stolen as a result of this fraud cryptick 
et al",Cryptocurrency
"regardless of what the scope of the damage of this cryptoponzi scheme actually 
 
 
was the fraud was prominent enough to make many potential cryptoinvestor wary of his 
or her next cryptoinvestment",Cryptocurrency
"another notable ‘cryptoponzi scheme’ would be the one 
that a company by the name of bitfinex perpetrated",Cryptocurrency
"bitfinex started out as legitimate 
‘cryptocompany’ that took in investors just as any public company would",Cryptocurrency
"the scam 
began when bitfinex servers were hacked and thieves made off with  worth 
of customer investments",Cryptocurrency
"in an attempt to minimize the effects of the theft bitfinex 
executives encouraged investors to convert their shares into equity within the company 
thus creating value from nothing at all",Cryptocurrency
"once most of the investors had converted their 
investments to shares bitfinex then encouraged them to sell their equity as shares to new 
investors",Cryptocurrency

set to an equal exchange rate",Cryptocurrency

for investors who are constantly trading one cryptocurrency for another",Cryptocurrency

that for each tether on the marketplace there will be one us dollar to back it up",Cryptocurrency

flags manifest when you look into the numbers for yourself",Cryptocurrency

"many cryptoinvestors believe that tether is 
perpetrating a ponzi scheme since the amount of cash that they are supposed to have to 
 
 
back up their cryptocurrency is nowhere close to the amount of cryptocurrencies on the 
market as there should be",Cryptocurrency
"along with the numbers not matching up many crypto
investors are also wary of a few other red flags surrounding tether’s business practices 
such as the business ties with the aforementioned bitfinex the disintegration of 
relationships with many prominent banks lawsuits against said banks the tendency of 
tether to withhold crucial information from investors as well as ronn torrosian’s head 
of public relations for tether past association with a company that had committed a 
ponzi scheme in the past bitcoinexchangeguide",Cryptocurrency
"fraudsters are famous for their 
craftiness and ingenuity so it is no surprise that they have adapted an ageold scheme to 
cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"another typical fraud associated with cryptocurrencies would be the fake ico 
scheme",Cryptocurrency
"in the world of cryptocurrencies ico’s or initial coin offerings are similar in 
many aspects to initial public offerings for stocks",Cryptocurrency
"typically a cryptocurrency company 
will release a predetermined number of coins to the open market in the same way stocks 
are issued when a company goes public",Cryptocurrency
"many ico’s are in fact legitimate 
cryptocurrencies that have potential to make the investor a profit like any other security",Cryptocurrency
"however there is a substantial portion of ico’s that are deemed fraudulent since the 
executives of these companies attempt to coerce investors to invest in cryptocurrencies

efficient manner",Cryptocurrency
"these con artists capitalize on potential investors’ fomo or ‘fear of

investors to become ensnared in their scheme by fabricating exorbitantly high return 
rates lying about the numbers of investors and how much they had invested as well as 
advertising novel features in an effort to make their nonexistent cryptocurrency 
irresistible",Cryptocurrency
"a fake ico scheme under the guise of a fake cryptocurrency by the name of 
plexcoin did just this",Cryptocurrency
"plexcoin’s executives promised unbelievable returns of up to 
 in the first  days which of course cannot be a number that any feasible security

they were in the process of developing a credit card like instrument deemed ‘plexcard’",Cryptocurrency

fake ico scheme perpetrated by plexcoin was the brainchild of a repeat fraudster 
dominic lacroix",Cryptocurrency
"was able to prosecute lacroix since fake ico’s fall under 
securities fraud levine ",Cryptocurrency
"unfortunately lacroix was still able steal over  
million before his arrest lee ",Cryptocurrency
"another interesting example of a fake ico scheme 
would be the recoin scheme",Cryptocurrency
"recoin was a fictitious cryptocurrency created by a 
fraudster by the name of maksim zaslavskiy",Cryptocurrency
"zaslavskiy pedaled his ‘revolutionary’ new 
cryptocurrency as being the first ever cryptocurrency to be backed by real estate",Cryptocurrency
"one 
article described recoin as a great investment vehicle for investors wary of the world of 
cryptocurrency since unlike any other cryptocurrency the “proceeds from the initial sale 
 
 
of tokens will be invested in the highly regulated real estate market in virtually all 
jurisdictions while reinforcing the holders and investors confidence in the recoin 
“zaslavskiy ",Cryptocurrency
"zaslavskiy also perpetrated the same fraud with another fake 
cryptocurrency with the designation of drc for diamond reserve club",Cryptocurrency
"the theory 
behind drc was similar to recoin but instead of proceeds being invested in real estate 
proceeds were supposedly invested in diamonds morris ",Cryptocurrency
"however it seems as 
though zaslavskiy never did invest any proceeds from recoin into any real estate or any 
proceeds from drc into diamonds",Cryptocurrency
"according to an investigation conducted by the sec 
it was discovered that neither recoin or drc had any operations morris ",Cryptocurrency
"zaslavskiy and lacroix are just a few of many fraudsters that have attempted to 
perpetrate fake ico schemes",Cryptocurrency

the next scheme to be discussed is exit schemes,Cryptocurrency
"according to investopedia an 
exit scheme is “a fraudulent practice by unethical cryptocurrency promoters who vanish 
with investors’ money during or after an ico” shobhit ",Cryptocurrency
"sometimes exit schemes 
may be able to start out as legitimate enterprises",Cryptocurrency
"however due to adverse economic 
conditions poor business planning or a combination of both future perpetrators of exit 
schemes may attempt to vanish into thin air in an attempt to escape the consequences of 
overseeing a failing business making off with all the investors’ funds in the process",Cryptocurrency
"this 
 
 
sort of scheme has become popular with cryptocurrency start ups seeing as anonymity is 
easy to maintain when all a business’s operations are virtual",Cryptocurrency
"a cryptocompany by the 
name of giza perpetrated a scheme just like this",Cryptocurrency
"investors believed giza to be a 
legitimate company since it had announced a partnership with a russian tech firm third 
pin llc",Cryptocurrency
"giza contracted third pin to aid in the creation of a secure device that could 
store cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"giza in turn raised over  ethereum coins an amount equal to

transferred out of the known giza wallet supposedly by the mysterious and anonymous 
ceo",Cryptocurrency
"no one has been able to track down fike if that is even his 
real name since his linkedin profile contained falsified information such as the fact he 
attended oxford university when oxford has no record of his attendance kharpal 
",Cryptocurrency
"giza has now become synonymous in the cryptotrading community with exit 
schemes",Cryptocurrency
a similar exit scheme was perpetrated by the cryptocompany loopx,Cryptocurrency
"loopx 
told investors that it had developed a complex cryptotrading software that contained an 
algorithm that would earn investors weekly profits",Cryptocurrency
"contrary to the payouts that they 
were expecting investors were instead relieved of  bitcoin and  ethereum in 
january ",Cryptocurrency
"it appears as if loopx decided to pull an exit scheme when they decided 
that they would not be able to convince investors that they were unable to come up with a 
software that could do everything that they promised",Cryptocurrency
"there are no traces of loopx’s 
website or the typeo riddled white paper anywhere on the internet seeing as the 
fraudsters wiped every trace of loopx’s existence from the internet mix ",Cryptocurrency
"even 
though some cryptocompanies may pull an exit scheme to escape a business plan gone 
 
 
wrong there are many more fraudsters perpetrate the same scheme with no intention of 
ever delivering anything for their customers or investors",Cryptocurrency
"one of the biggest exit schemes 
that fits into this category would be the one pulled off by cabbagetech",Cryptocurrency
"of cabbagetech pulled his exit scheme by offering customers crypto
investment trading advice in exchange for payments of cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"cabbagetech 
claimed that with their service one could expect as high as a “ return on an 
investment in less than a week” cheng ",Cryptocurrency
"however mcdonnell never delivered the 
service to his customers and attempted to simply exit the business with approximately 
",Cryptocurrency
million worth of customers’ bitcoin,Cryptocurrency
"however the securities and exchange 
commission and commodity futures trading commission have filed charges against 
mcdonnell and cabbagetech to thwart ever growing cryptocurrency fraud in america

the cabbagetech fraud is not alone by any stretch of the imagination,Cryptocurrency
"benebit was supposed to be a novel cryptocurrency company that would use benefits to 
incentivize customers to invest",Cryptocurrency
"benebit also claimed that it would the rewards system 
would work like racking up frequent flyer miles from your airline",Cryptocurrency
"however investors 
began to question benebit’s authenticity when they discovered that the photos of the team 
members were fake",Cryptocurrency
"soon after the allegations were brought up the scammers exited 
with estimated funds of ",Cryptocurrency
"to  million before ever even bringing their novel 
cryptocurrency idea to the market kean ",Cryptocurrency
"a cryptocurrency by the name of opair 
has a very similar story",Cryptocurrency
"a mysterious developer who went by wasserman offered a 
cryptocurrency that supposedly would act as a sort of “decentralized debit card system 
using its own token xpo” kean ",Cryptocurrency
"the cryptocurrency brought in an estimated 
",Cryptocurrency
"million before the fraudsters exited with all the funds after investors noticed that the 
 
 
team’s linkedin profiles were fake",Cryptocurrency
"to date nobody knows the true identity of 
wasserman or where the money from opair has gone to kean ",Cryptocurrency
"not all exit 
schemes have to be as elaborate as the previous examples do",Cryptocurrency
"probably the most 
ridiculous exit scheme was perpetrated by the ironically named ponzicoin",Cryptocurrency
"ponzicoin 
raised over  before the perpetrator vanished with the funds",Cryptocurrency
"apparently the 
cryptocurrency openly marketed itself as a scam however gullible investors were still 
drawn to invest money into what they must have thought was a legitimate cryptocurrency 
kean ",Cryptocurrency
"with the everincreasing amount of exit schemes that are uncovered every 
day prospective cryptoinvestors must remain careful to research the legitimacy of these 
cryptocurrencies and businesses now more than ever",Cryptocurrency
"pump and dump schemes have been around for ages and have proven to be fairly 
lucrative schemes for fraudsters to perpetrate",Cryptocurrency
"according to investopedia pump and 
dump schemes can be defined as a fraud “that attempts to boost the price of a stock 
through recommendations based on false misleading or greatly exaggerated statements” 
investopedia ",Cryptocurrency
"in other words fraudsters will pump up the price by buying 
substantial amounts of the stock as well as propagating fake news through fake celebrity 
tweets or fake articles to entice others to help them inflate the price of the security then 
dump it all in one single coordinated effort to make a profit",Cryptocurrency
"this may seem like a 
victimless crime but one must consider the amount that investors who are purchasing the 
‘dumped’ securities are purchasing them at an artificially inflated price under the false 
pretenses of the scammers",Cryptocurrency
"these new investors will no doubt lose significant amounts to 
the scam",Cryptocurrency
"pump and dump schemes have been popular ever since the ’s and remain 
relevant today almost  years later",Cryptocurrency
"fraudsters have now taken to perpetrating these 
 
 
schemes with cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"due to cryptocurrency’s markets inherent qualities of 
volatility and unpredictability cryptoinvestors’ extreme fear of missing out on the next 
big cryptocurrency as well as the ability to remain completely anonymous using the 
internet pump and dump perpetrators have found it relatively easy to make a quick profit 
off budding cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"usually these scams are started by only one or a handful of 
people",Cryptocurrency
"these ‘investment groups’ as many pump and dump groups like to refer to 
themselves coordinate their efforts through anonymous messaging apps such as discord 
and telegram and recruit new members through means of shameless social media 
advertising and member recruitment",Cryptocurrency
"recruitment is vital to the success of these pump 
and dump schemes since the biggest contributing factor to how much the price of the 
cryptocurrency can be inflated is based solely on how many coins are bought up by how 
many investors",Cryptocurrency
"members are enticed to recruit new members with the incentive of being 
promoted to higher ranks within the group based on how many new members that they 
have invited",Cryptocurrency
"the advantages of being of a higher rank means that you will get anywhere 
",Cryptocurrency
"to a  second earlier notification when to dump your coins to get a higher return on 
an investment since you will be selling before a majority of the group does",Cryptocurrency

schemes while not stifling early innovation in the crypto space” cftc ",Cryptocurrency

cftc and sec can prosecute pump and dump schemes under the securities act of  
sec ",Cryptocurrency
"however due to the anonymity of the message groups it is hard to discern 
who is involved in these schemes",Cryptocurrency

 or up to  of the sanctions recuperated by the fraudsters for whistleblowers 
who expose the heads of these pump and dump schemes crypto insider ",Cryptocurrency
"in addition to the aforementioned schemes that can be committed with 
cryptocurrencies there are a few schemes that i have categorized simply as 
‘cryptocurrency theft’",Cryptocurrency
"due to the inherent nature of cryptocurrencies being a virtual 
currency hackers have attempted to relieve unsuspecting investors of their 
cryptocurrencies for years",Cryptocurrency
"i have chosen to categorize the following frauds as 
cryptocurrency theft since they all involve some sort of perpetrator stealing 
cryptocurrencies from an unsuspecting holder",Cryptocurrency
"most financially literate individuals will 
be familiar with the infamous ‘nigerian prince’ or  fraud labeled  due to the 
section of nigerian law that makes it illegal",Cryptocurrency
"this scheme is a type of advance fee 
scheme that involves a scam artist stereotypically from nigeria that entices someone to 
wire him or her a small sum of money in order to clear a large sum in which the scammer 
claims can be split between both the conman and the conned",Cryptocurrency
"however all these stories 
are fictitious and the investor usually never sees any of their investment ever again",Cryptocurrency
"these scammers are now perpetrating these same  scams but now with 
cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"in addition to scamming citizens abroad such as us in america these 
nigerian scammers have also taken to scamming their own countrymen",Cryptocurrency
"the goal is to 
 
 
convince unsuspecting nigerians to wire over naira the local nigerian currency for 
phony cryptocurrencies such as ‘billion coin’ mcdonnell ",Cryptocurrency
"in addition to these 
cryptonigerian schemes hackers have also become prevalent threats to the security of 
investors’ cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"these hackers will use many different tactics to steal 
cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency

"another type of cryptocurrency theft 
that has become more and more popular over the past couple years are ransomware 
schemes",Cryptocurrency
these schemes have caught the entire cryptoworld off guard,Cryptocurrency
"fraudsters 
perpetrate these schemes by utilizing ransomware to take over people’s computers and 
vow only to unlock them once a payment of untraceable cryptocurrency has been made to 
the fraudster’s ewallet",Cryptocurrency

exchange by using an auditor’s credentials that were supposed to be kept confidential",Cryptocurrency

lost during the second hack",Cryptocurrency
the second hack which occurred in  relieved mt,Cryptocurrency

over  of bitcoins in circulation at the time",Cryptocurrency

rendering the aforementioned examples to not be isolated incidents khatwani ",Cryptocurrency

digital forensics can be done to gather information regarding cryptocurrency 
activities",Cryptocurrency
"lastly we suggest several steps to enhance cryptoforensics which are 
tailored for law enforcement agencies such as directorate general of taxes 
 
 background 
this chapter describes the background knowledge of our paper which 
consists of three parts namely cryptocurrency taxation and digital forensics",Cryptocurrency
" cryptocurrency 
 overview 
instead of relying on a central authority to control and run the whole system 
cryptocurrency lets anyone to conduct data verification on a publicly available 
distributed ledger",Cryptocurrency
"to enable the feature several cryptographic techniques are 
implemented in the system making it fully run by the automated protocols",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrency runs on the internet where traditional boundaries such as 
working hours geographical locations and jurisdictions are eliminated",Cryptocurrency
"international money transfers can be done through cryptocurrency network which 
can be verified within minutes",Cryptocurrency
"the success of bitcoin has caused a rapid adoption 
of cryptocurrencies across the world",Cryptocurrency
" the technologies behind cryptocurrency 
in recent days there is a huge collection of technologies being implemented 
in various cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"however there are several core technologies that are 
used in almost all cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"pkc is a cryptographic technique which 
utilises two keys public key and private key",Cryptocurrency
"as the name implies the public key 
is intended to be publicized shared to other parties while the private key needs 
to be kept secret by the owner",Cryptocurrency
"both keys are different but having a to 
relationship",Cryptocurrency
"this technique enables the cryptocurrency users to prove the 
ownership of the coins without revealing their real identities by the help of digital 
signatures",Cryptocurrency
distributed ledger technology dlt,Cryptocurrency
"dlt is a public ledger where the 
information stored in the ledger is shared among system participants",Cryptocurrency
"the 
                                                             
 based on information published by coinmarketcapcom on  november  
information inside dlt is constructed such that stored data is infeasible to tamper",Cryptocurrency
"dlt is an appendonly database consensus method is applied to determine which 
participant can write the next data",Cryptocurrency
"there are at least two major types in dlt 
namely blockchain and directed acyclic graph dag",Cryptocurrency
"in dlt new data is first 
collected and then stored once every predetermined period epoch constructing 
a sequential historical data",Cryptocurrency
"the way it is stored in the existing storage is by linking 
it to the previous data the hash of the previous data is included in the new data",Cryptocurrency
"while blockchain can only have one main branch in the system nakamoto  
dag allows multiple branches when storing information popov ",Cryptocurrency
"in this 
paper blockchain and dlt will be used interchangeably to refer dlt as a general 
concept",Cryptocurrency
"hash function is an algorithm to convert 
an arbitrary length data into a value which has a constant length over the same 
hash function",Cryptocurrency
"one of the main roles of hash function is to represent data without 
mentioning the data at all hence it acts as the commitment of the represented 
data",Cryptocurrency
"merkle tree is a form of binary tree where anyone can verify the correctness 
of any data within its leaves without the need of knowing all the leaves",Cryptocurrency
"the merkle 
tree is often used as an authenticated data structure ads where it is easy to 
verify the integrity of its leaves",Cryptocurrency
" various types of cryptocurrency 
classifying cryptocurrencies is important in digital forensics as it will 
determine the tools and methods during the investigation or even determine how 
difficult the investigation will be",Cryptocurrency
"based on its characteristics we can classify the 
cryptocurrencies into several types",Cryptocurrency
"the naming convention is coined based on 
bitcoin as the standard cornerstone hence we also use the blockchain technology 
in our classification",Cryptocurrency
"blockchain  the cryptocurrencies in this class are those 
cryptocurrencies following the identical or with minor changes protocols of 
bitcoin",Cryptocurrency
"litecoin and dogecoin are two most popular cryptocurrencies other than 
bitcoin",Cryptocurrency
"this class is marked by its legacy protocols such as nakamoto consensus 
pseudoanonymity and inputoutput transactions",Cryptocurrency
"the main function of these 
cryptocurrencies is payment method",Cryptocurrency
"blockchain  this class is for those cryptocurrencies that have evolved 
from version ",Cryptocurrency
by embedding additional features on their systems,Cryptocurrency
"the 
cryptocurrencies in this class are nxt ardor nem waves and others",Cryptocurrency
"not only 
as payment methods these cryptocurrencies also provide rich features such as 
peertopeer marketplace child chains digital asset management electronic 
voting and so on",Cryptocurrency
"blockchain  the need of stronger anonymity motivated people to embed 
extra anonymity features on cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"the members of this class are 
known to be more difficult to analyse than bitcoin such as monero zcash and 
dash",Cryptocurrency
"several other cryptocurrencies such as verge claimed that these products 
are anonymous despite it is still unclear how their proposed protocols can provide 
a strong anonymity to the data and to their users",Cryptocurrency
"blockchain  the development of ethereum has expanded the scope of 
blockchain from merely storing data into a system that enables its users to run 
programs on its virtual environment which is in sync to its permanentlystored data",Cryptocurrency
"offers smart contract capability to its users where the users are 
given the flexibility of creating complex algorithms using the provided software 
development tools",Cryptocurrency
"not only providing a payment scheme the smart contract can 
be utilised to develop decentralized applications dapps with unlimited features 
which will be run directly on the blockchain wood ",Cryptocurrency
this class exists due to the popularity of smart contract,Cryptocurrency
"in a smart 
contract platform a developer can create a contract which contains values or 
tokens",Cryptocurrency
these tokens can be set to be transferred from their owners to receivers,Cryptocurrency
"token can be treated as a different class of cryptocurrency but it can also be a 
derivation of smart contract",Cryptocurrency
"the most popular token platform at the time of the 
writing is ethereum where erc vogelsteller and buterin  is the most 
known standard when creating tokens",Cryptocurrency
"by implementing the erc standard a 
token can be traded with other tokens in a peertopeer token market as they have 
identical functions and characteristics",Cryptocurrency
"this type of token is also commonly called 
as erc token",Cryptocurrency
" activities related to cryptocurrency 
as a system several activities are closely related to cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"these 
activities are miningstaking transacting trading and providing services",Cryptocurrency
"mining 
and staking are activities related to cryptocurrency’s open consensus",Cryptocurrency
"in a 
cryptocurrency implementing a proofofwork pow consensus a miner uses 
computing devices such as computers and applicationspecific integrated circuit 
asic",Cryptocurrency
"the miners compete to compute mathematical questions where the 
winner can write the next block",Cryptocurrency
"stakers are participant of any cryptocurrencies 
implementing proofofstake pos consensus mechanism where coins are being 
staked and raffled to determine who has the authority to produce the next block",Cryptocurrency
"both miner and staker are motivated by the prize coin promised to be rewarded by 
the protocol as well as the right to claim the transaction fees paid by the 
cryptocurrency users",Cryptocurrency
"while mining requires investment in the form of computing power and staking 
requires a huge amount of money to acquire a significant portion of the coins 
creating transactions can be done by anyone",Cryptocurrency
"the two requirements for creating a 
transaction are a wallet and a fraction of coin",Cryptocurrency
"creating a transaction in a 
cryptocurrency system means the user utilises the wallet application to construct a 
digital information which expresses the coin movement from the payer to the 
payees",Cryptocurrency
"this information will be authorized by using digital signatures which will 
validate that the payer owns the coins to be sent to the payees",Cryptocurrency
"it is feasible to 
send a fraction of a coin only if the amount exceeds the minimum amount if 
determined by the cryptocurrency system and sufficient to pay the transaction fee",Cryptocurrency
cryptocurrency trading activity is a logical result of the emerging digital asset,Cryptocurrency
"as the cryptocurrencies were getting more valuable and usable in daily life 
cryptocurrency trading facilitates supply ask and demand bid",Cryptocurrency
"while the trading 
platform will receive trading fees the traders expect to make profits from their 
trading activities",Cryptocurrency
"as a valuable intangible asset it is possible that the cryptocurrencies are 
used as a payment method as most of them were intended to be",Cryptocurrency
"however until 
now the indonesian government do not facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies as a 
legal tender where currency act  defines rupiah as the only legal tender in 
indonesian jurisdiction",Cryptocurrency
"the statement is further clarified by indonesian central 
bank through a press release on  january  press release no",Cryptocurrency
dkom with a lengthy explanation through a faq document,Cryptocurrency
" cryptocurrencyrelated tools 
in general a cryptocurrency system is entirely run by its set of protocols",Cryptocurrency
"the 
protocols are implemented in one or more application software bundles where 
there will be multiple and separated parties are running the main application 
usually called as a node",Cryptocurrency
"each node manages a copy of the blockchain containing 
the entire transactions from the genesis block to the newest block",Cryptocurrency
"it also validates 
new transactions republish transactions to its connected peers and lets wallets 
request information about the blockchain data which will be responded with the 
requested information by the node to the requesting wallets",Cryptocurrency
"a wallet is a clientside application which helps a user to create transactions 
manage private keys and compute the remaining coin balance",Cryptocurrency
"the wallet does 
not store any information about the blockchain hence it relies on the node when it 
requires certain information",Cryptocurrency
"there are multiple types of wallet namely mobile 
wallet which runs in smartphones desktop wallet in computers web wallet which 
can be accessed through web browsers and hosted by service providers",Cryptocurrency
"there 
are also special wallets such as hardware wallet which contains secured storage 
to protect the private keys and paper wallet which stores private keys in a piece of 
paper",Cryptocurrency
"most wallets excluding paper wallet are spvwallets simplified payment 
verification wallet which only store the blockchain header",Cryptocurrency
"the correctness of the 
information received from the node it is connected to will be checked by using the 
blockchain header it manages",Cryptocurrency
"merkle tree and the chained blocks structures help 
the data integrity checking",Cryptocurrency
"the relationship between nodes and wallets can be 
expressed in figure ",Cryptocurrency
"an illustration of a blockchain system with multiple nodes daemons and several wallets 
connected to one of the node wijaya et al",Cryptocurrency
"a blockchain explorer is an application which will help the users to explore 
the content of a blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"normally every cryptocurrency provides at least one 
blockchain explorer as a way to prove the transparency of the system",Cryptocurrency
"however 
popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum have many options of 
blockchain explorers which are provided for free by multiple parties",Cryptocurrency
" indonesian cryptocurrency markets 
indodax previously known as bitcoin indonesia is the first cryptocurrency 
exchange in indonesia and the only cryptocurrency exchange for several years",Cryptocurrency
"due to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in indonesia now there are 
more platforms for cryptocurrency trading with order book such as luno 
tokocrypto coinone and tokenomy including over the counter otc 
platforms such as triv",Cryptocurrency
"indodax provides two types of markets namely idr indonesian rupiah and 
btc bitcoin",Cryptocurrency
"in idr market the users can buy or sell the paired cryptocurrency 
by using rupiah while in btc by using bitcoin",Cryptocurrency
"tokenomy supports four markets

"luno pairs bitcoin with several currencies such as 
eur european euro idr myr malaysian ringgit ngn nigerian naira zar 
south african rand and eth ethereum",Cryptocurrency
"tokocrypto only sells bitcoin and 
ethereum where both are paired to idr while in coinone bitcoin bitcoin cash 
litecoin ethereum ethereum classic qtum ripple and vexanium are traded

"users are free to create new accounts but they need to 
provide real identities as well as other validation methods such as signatures and 
selfphotos before the new accounts are activated",Cryptocurrency
"the kyc and aml procedures 
allow the service providers to store the users’ identities and id cards on their own 
local storage",Cryptocurrency
" taxation 
taxation plays an important role in indonesia state budget",Cryptocurrency
"in financial year 
 at least  of the total revenue for the national budget comes from tax 
kementerian keuangan republik indonesia ",Cryptocurrency
"this figure shows the 
importance of taxation for the country",Cryptocurrency
"selfassessment policy has been 
implemented as a part of the first indonesian tax reform in  to replace the 
legacy tax administration system which was highly inefficient and low compliance 
prasetyo nd",Cryptocurrency
however the selfassessment policy does come with a cost,Cryptocurrency
"tax avoidance 
cases could happen as the taxpayers tend to minimize their tax due",Cryptocurrency
"tax audits 
will be established to measure the compliance and when preliminary proofs are 
found the case can be escalated into tax fraud case which is an offense according 
to taxation act ",Cryptocurrency
" digital forensics techniques 
digital forensic has multiple branches according to various medium to store 
or to compute digital information",Cryptocurrency
"nevertheless diskbased forensics and network 
forensics are popular due to their wide scope and usefulness in during the 
investigation",Cryptocurrency
"in the diskbased forensics the focus of the analyses includes but 
not limited to operating system analysis deleted file analysis password recovery 
and userrelated data",Cryptocurrency
"while the network forensics’ focus is on how multiple 
computers communicate through computer networks including how network 
protocols are utilized to carry information from the sender to the receiver",Cryptocurrency
"digital forensic activities are supported by various forensic tools in the form 
of hardware and software",Cryptocurrency
"in accordance to the activities there are also protocols 
and standard procedures to be followed such that the digital information gathered 
during acquisition process is wellpreserved hence it can be presented as a valid 
evidence in the court

cryptocurrency was not created for illpurposes people always find ways to utilize 
the medium in legal offences",Cryptocurrency
"tax offense and other financial fraud cases 
unfortunately are not unfamiliar cases in cryptocurrency area for example in 
pearce ",Cryptocurrency
"moreover cryptocurrencies are considered as tax havens due to 
their technologies marian ",Cryptocurrency
"while traditional tax fraud cases will be one of the main concerns for 
directorate general of taxes cryptocurrencyrelated cases must also be on the 
list",Cryptocurrency
"cryptoforensics as digital forensics methods and procedures can be useful in 
collecting information related to cryptocurrency activities",Cryptocurrency
" data collection in cryptoforensics 
we have identified several methods for data collection in cryptoforensics 
including diskbased cryptoforensics network cryptoforensics blockchain 
cryptoforensics",Cryptocurrency
"wallet seizure will be discussed in a separate subchapter as it 
serves a different purpose",Cryptocurrency
" diskbased cryptoforensics 
diskbased cryptoforensics focuses on the examination of wallet applications 
which can be used to manage their coins andor create transactions",Cryptocurrency
"as it has been 
described that there are various types of wallet multiple digital forensics 
techniques are also needed to gather information",Cryptocurrency
"the desktop wallets are 
generally compatible with multiple operating systems such as windows osx and 
linux",Cryptocurrency
moreover multiple wallets store information in different methods,Cryptocurrency
"however it is almost certain that the database file to store the private keys 
and transaction details is encrypted and passwordprotected",Cryptocurrency
"despite the difficulty 
to read the private keys it is advisable to collect all information from the application 
folders as well as other locations such as home folder and application data folder 
to investigate the log files",Cryptocurrency
"passwords pin keys or seed words might need to be 
obtained from the users through any appropriate procedures",Cryptocurrency
"web browsers such as mozilla firefox and google chrome are also good 
places to search",Cryptocurrency
"two most popular ethereum wallets myetherwallet mew 
and metamask provide web browser addons for their clients",Cryptocurrency
"in mew addresses 
are visible without login to the wallet as shown in figure ",Cryptocurrency
myetherwallet shows several addresses it manages,Cryptocurrency
"once the ethereum addresses are known the balance will be easily defined 
by the help of any ethereum explorer for example etherscan",Cryptocurrency
"not only the 
balance their associated erc tokens can also be concluded by using the same 
tool",Cryptocurrency
" network cryptoforensics 
as with other standard network forensic methods network cryptoforensics 
also can be done through packet capture techniques",Cryptocurrency
"in most cryptocurrency 
systems there will be two types of network packets namely rpc and pp 
connections",Cryptocurrency
rpc is the protocol for the connection between a node and a wallet,Cryptocurrency
"the wallet sends requests by using rpc interface and the responses will be sent 
by the node either in json javascript object notation or bin binary formats",Cryptocurrency
captured network packets showing rpc communication,Cryptocurrency
"pp peertopeer protocol on the other hand is used to exchange 
information between nodes",Cryptocurrency
"the protocol’s packets are identified by its “packet 
magic” as a fingerprint",Cryptocurrency
"every cryptocurrency system has its own packet magic or 
often called as “magic bytes”",Cryptocurrency
captured network packets showing pp communication,Cryptocurrency
" blockchain cryptoforensics 
the increase use of cryptocurrency motivated the development of blockchain 
analyses",Cryptocurrency
"taint analysis is commonly used in blockchain  where all related 
addresses can be concluded",Cryptocurrency
"taint analysis shows other addresses and 
transactions that are directly and indirectly related to a specific address",Cryptocurrency
"however 
the taint analysis will eventually produce a cluster which contains a massive 
number of related addresses as they are mostly using “haircut” method 
greenberg ",Cryptocurrency
"several companies such as chainanalysis coinfirm and 
ciphertrace use the method to track bitcoins greenberg ",Cryptocurrency
"furthermore 
clustering analyses have been developed and being used to check the information 
stored in bitcoin’s blockchain meiklejohn et al ",Cryptocurrency
"a recent research describes a novel approach which was based on a british 
legal system anderson shumailov and ahmed ",Cryptocurrency
"the new approach 
describes firstinfirstout fifo method instead of taint analysis which results 
in a shortened list of related address",Cryptocurrency
" walletcoin seizure 
unlike any other digital assets or financial instruments where user ids are 
required to transact cryptocurrencies only require private keys to move coins to 
other addresses",Cryptocurrency
"when the private keys are seized from the users or suspects it 
                                                             
 an example of bitcoin taint analysis can be seen in  
  
  
  
is advisable that the information is carefully managed such that anyone having 
access to the private keys cannot easily move the digital assets",Cryptocurrency
"the event where 
rogue law enforcement agents moved seized bitcoins has happened in the past 
redman  
the way the problem can be mitigated is to create a new wallet with 
multisignature feature",Cryptocurrency
"several cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin has this feature 
although unfortunately not all cryptocurrencies have implemented it",Cryptocurrency
"in a 
multisignature wallet each transaction requires more than one valid signature 
which implies that every transaction is approved by multiple parties",Cryptocurrency
"of course it 
is assumed that the new multisignature wallet’s private keys are held by different 
parties",Cryptocurrency
" challenges 
we identify several challenges for cryptoforensics activities",Cryptocurrency
"sometimes 
they are not straightforward as its counterparts",Cryptocurrency
"some of these challenges are 
pseudonymity privacypreserving cryptocurrencies and worldwide markets",Cryptocurrency
" pseudonymity 
although the public blockchains utilized by the cryptocurrencies are 
transparent and accessible through blockchain explorers it does not mean that 
determining the owners of the coins being transacted in the blockchains is trivial",Cryptocurrency
"pseudonymity is a default characteristic in those public blockchains where the 
users are identified by their addresses",Cryptocurrency
"however complications occur because one 
user can create unlimited number of addresses",Cryptocurrency
"a quantitative analysis has 
successfully determined the activities conducted by a cryptocurrency thief ron 
and shamir  however the same technique cannot be applied to other cases",Cryptocurrency
" privacypreserving cryptocurrencies 
privacypreserving cryptocurrencies such as monero and zcash have 
implemented extra cryptographic techniques such that several information in the 
blockchain is obfuscated",Cryptocurrency
"monero is using ring signature method where the real 
signer is obfuscated by using decoys or false addresses",Cryptocurrency
"moreover the 
implementation of ring confidential transaction ringct encrypts the amount of 
coins such that it cannot be seen by anyone but the payer and the payee noether 
and mackenzie ",Cryptocurrency
"several studies have discovered the weaknesses in monero 
system moeser et al ",Cryptocurrency
" and since 
then monero has gone through several updates to improve its security",Cryptocurrency
"different compared to monero zcash is using zero knowledge proof zkp 
technology zksnarks to be specific where transaction history is completely 
obfuscated and relationships between coins are hardly identified bensasson et 
al",Cryptocurrency
"however recent finding discovered the weakness of the implementation 
of zcash quesnelle  kappos et al ",Cryptocurrency
"due to the extensive computing 
requirements for its wallet which hinders its users from using the secure mode 
namely zaddr",Cryptocurrency
"despite this finding it is difficult to say that zcash technology has 
been broken as the problems found are in the system level",Cryptocurrency
" worldwide markets 
although there are already exist several cryptocurrency markets in 
indonesia it does not mean that all indonesian cryptocurrency users are only using 
them when conducting trading",Cryptocurrency
"a trader is motivated to open accounts in as many 
exchanges as possible where it is free to create them all she needs to do is to 
provide a username and password followed by identity verification",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrency market is unique and totally different compared to stock 
market such that there will be multiple prices in different markets",Cryptocurrency
"a skilled trader 
can leverage the opportunity by buying on the lowest price market and selling on 
the highest price market",Cryptocurrency
"by doing this it is expected that she could gain significant 
profits",Cryptocurrency
"however this socalled opportunity for the traders could become a significant 
obstacle for law enforcement agencies",Cryptocurrency
"unlike any fiat currencies where their 
transactions are limited by regulations and boundaries cryptocurrencies do not 
share the same limitations",Cryptocurrency
"a user can send payments through cryptocurrency to 
the other side of the world in a matter of several minutes",Cryptocurrency
"as there are many 
cryptocurrency markets in the world a trader can store her digital assets not in the 
local cryptocurrency exchanges but in any exchanges beyond the reach of any 
local law enforcement agencies",Cryptocurrency
" enhancing cryptoforensics 
after identifying several challenges for cryptoforensics we propose methods 
to enhance cryptoforensics",Cryptocurrency
"our proposed methods are not about enhancing 
technical capabilities but mainly about legal instruments collaboration and 
extensive research",Cryptocurrency
" legal instruments 
we propose the use of any available legal instruments to support 
cryptoforensics activities",Cryptocurrency
"the legal instruments could ensure that information 
related to cryptocurrency activities within the country’s jurisdiction can be acquired",Cryptocurrency
"this includes but not limited to enforcing kycaml procedures for onboarding new 
customers of cryptocurrencyrelated businesses",Cryptocurrency
" collaboration 
collaboration is important in cryptoforensics especially for gathering a 
proper information",Cryptocurrency
"the main actors for collaboration in this matter are 
cryptocurrency markets or exchanges",Cryptocurrency
"they hold important information about the 
users as the users provided their real identities to the markets and this information 
can be utilized to connect cryptocurrencyrelated activities with the persons doing 
them",Cryptocurrency
"an important scheme developed in the monero community called eabe 
shows the importance of cryptocurrency exchanges holmes ",Cryptocurrency
"eabe stands 
for exchangealicebobexchange",Cryptocurrency
"in this scheme alice purchases several 
cryptocurrency coins from an exchange then she transfers the coins to bob",Cryptocurrency
"bob 
then sells the coins to an exchange not necessarily the same exchange where 
alice purchased the coins to get the local currency",Cryptocurrency
"in the scenario although 
normally it is infeasible to determine who alice and bob are with the help of two 
cryptocurrency exchanges it is now possible to map the transactions and identify 
two parties alice and bob",Cryptocurrency
" extensive research 
with the rapid development in cryptocurrency technology digital forensics 
need to keep up with the pace hence extensive research in cryptoforensics field 
need to be conducted",Cryptocurrency
"the research focuses on finding relevant artefacts that can 
help law enforcement agencies to track down illicit activities",Cryptocurrency
"not only in technical 
area research can also be conducted on social science public policies and 
economy which will help investigating the correlation between cryptocurrency 
transactions with real world situations 
 
 conclusion 
we have described cryptaxforensics a term to express a combination of 
cryptocurrency taxation and digital forensics",Cryptocurrency
"the massive adoption of 
cryptocurrency the growing number of new technologies that have brought new 
products into the markets and the significant rise in the prices could shift the 
taxation problem from its traditional landscape into a global broader and more 
complex ecosystem as in the cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"we also have described the recent development in both areas 
cryptocurrency and digital forensics including how existing digital forensic 
methods can be utilized to explore digital evidences with regards to 
cryptocurrencyrelated activities",Cryptocurrency
"we then discussed challenges in the areas

"an interesting note is what happens in the “tails of the distribution 
of outcomes” of startups that obtain funding during bubbles",Cryptocurrency
"the authors 
report that although companies who were started during a “hot period” are “sig
nificantly more likely to go bankrupt than those founded in periods when fewer 
startup firms were funded” other companies ended up being “extremely suc
cessful and innovative” in other words—a bubble extends both sides of the 
distribution “tail”—there is not only more failure but also more “extreme suc

an “ipo or acquisition” will “simultaneously create more value”

"at  “our iv results 
also highlight that changes in capital availability that are unrelated to the investment opportunities 
seem to exacerbate our results suggesting that one mechanism through which hot markets could 
lead to riskier investments is that it makes investors more willing to experiment and thereby fund 
more novel risky investments",Cryptocurrency
"this finding is consistent with nanda and rhodeskropf  
who demonstrate how increased funding in the venture capital market can rationally alter the type of 
investments investors are willing to fund toward a more experimental innovative project",Cryptocurrency
"accord
ing to this view the abundance of capital associated with investment cycles might not only be a re
sponse to the arrival of new technologies but could also play a critical role in driving their creation 
and commercialization",Cryptocurrency

willing to finance in these times",Cryptocurrency

cycles”

components and how they differ from flat currencies such as cash",Cryptocurrency
"a few cases that are 
related to cryptocurrency would also be discussed in order to understand their 
connection to cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"what is cryptocurrency 
cryptocurrency are digital assets that are designed to work as a medium of exchange 
using cryptography to secure its transactions to control the creation of additional units 
and to verify the transfer of assets",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrencies can be classified as a subset of 
digital currencies",Cryptocurrency
"what is unique regarding cryptocurrency is that they utilise 
decentralised system in decentralised banking system boards or governments does not 
hold control over the system",Cryptocurrency
"this differs from traditional banking system which utilises 
centralised control",Cryptocurrency
"what are some of the terms associated with cryptocurrency 
there are a few terms that are closely associated with cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"brief description 
will be given below in order to assist with understanding the later contents of this work",Cryptocurrency
"cryptography 
cryptography is the practice and study of secure communication in the presence of a 
third party",Cryptocurrency
"this also includes construction of protocols that prevent third parties or the 
public from reading private details within a message",Cryptocurrency
"blockchain  
blockchain is a public transaction database",Cryptocurrency
"blockchain also functions as a distributed 
ledger which contains list of records called blocks – linked and secured using 
cryptography",Cryptocurrency
"each block contains a pointer as a link to the previous block a timestamp 
and transaction data",Cryptocurrency
"decentralised  
a decentralised system in economy means that none actually holds control of them 
system neither the government nor the boards",Cryptocurrency
"in other words the government holds 
no power in setting market cap for cryptocurrencies or how much a cryptocurrency is in 
circulation whereas in the traditional banking system such as cash the government 
regulates how much cash are in circulation and setting the market cap",Cryptocurrency
"digital asset 
a digital asset is anything that exists in binary format and is able to be used for trade 
purposes",Cryptocurrency
"digital assets includes but not limited to digital documents audible content 
motion picture and other digital data that can be stored in mediums such as laptop 
personal computers and media players",Cryptocurrency
"ledger  
a ledger is a summary of all amounts entered in supporting journals which list individual 
transactions by date",Cryptocurrency
"the function of a ledger is to record and total economic 
transactions",Cryptocurrency
"volatile  
cryptocurrencies are known to be volatile",Cryptocurrency
"a cryptocurrency can have a high value in a 
moment and become significantly cheaper the next moment",Cryptocurrency
"such risk is common 
amongst cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"components of cryptocurrency 
cryptocurrency trading involves several key components in which without would result 
in failure to trade cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"the components are cryptocurrency keys 
cryptocurrency wallets blockchain and cryptocurrency mining",Cryptocurrency
"details of each 
component will be discussed below",Cryptocurrency
"keys  
there are two types of keys that are essential in cryptocurrency trading private keys and 
public keys",Cryptocurrency
"a private key is stored in a cryptocurrency wallet and proves ownership of a 
public key",Cryptocurrency
"a public key is connected to a particular amount of cryptocurrency and can be 
used to access that amount",Cryptocurrency
"both the private and public keys are significant tools to 
maintain the security of cryptoeconomy",Cryptocurrency
"private key 
a private key is a sophisticated form of cryptography that allows a user to access his or 
her cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"a private key is an integral aspect of cryptocurrency and its security 
helps in protecting a user from theft and unauthorized access to their cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"in cryptocurrency trade a use is commonly given a public address and a private key to 
receive cryptocurrency in a form of coins or tokens ",Cryptocurrency
"the private key is made up of  
alphanumeric characters which make it hard for a hacker to obtain",Cryptocurrency
the private key of a user is typically stored in a digital wallet belonging to the same user,Cryptocurrency
"when a transaction is commenced the wallet software creates a digital signature by 
processing the transaction with the private key",Cryptocurrency
"this symbolizes a secure system since 
the only way to generate a valid signature for any given cryptocurrency transaction is to 
use the private key",Cryptocurrency
"the signature is then used to confirm that a transaction has come 
from a particular user and ensures that the transaction cannot be changed one it has 
been broadcasted into a blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"if a transaction is altered the signature will change 
as well",Cryptocurrency
"if the private key is lost the user can no longer access their wallet to spend withdraw or 
transfer cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"hence it is imperative that to save the private key in a secure 
location",Cryptocurrency
"private keys can be stored on paper wallets or hardware such as smartcards or 
usb devices",Cryptocurrency
an offline software wallet can also be used to store private keys,Cryptocurrency
"this type of 
wallet has an offline portion for private keys and an online portion which contains the 
public key",Cryptocurrency
"in short a private key is an indispensable component in order to conduct a 
cryptocurrency transaction",Cryptocurrency
"security measures need to be taken to prevent loss of private 
key whether accidental or theft by hackers",Cryptocurrency
"a solution to cryptocurrency private key security was suggested by wisekey international 
holding ltd a leading cyber security and iot company in january  about the use of a 
 
 
secure mechanical watch called wiswatch powered by contactless secure hardware 
enabled wallet ",Cryptocurrency
it was designed to offer security and ease to cryptocurrency users,Cryptocurrency
"the wiswatch can securely store a user’s private key and allows them to make 
contactless transactions",Cryptocurrency
"every time a contactless blockchain transaction is initiated 
including a bitcoin transaction the private key must be validated by using the near field 
technology before enabling the transaction",Cryptocurrency
"while software wallets continue to be 
vulnerable to hackers the secure hardware wallets have gained popularity",Cryptocurrency
"with the 
existence of wiswatch hardware wallets such as usb flash drives are now able to be 
used without contact and users can establish multiple private keys into the secure store 
by using the wisewallet application and access these private keys to make transactions 
",Cryptocurrency
"the wisewallet application was said to be compatible with most of the existing 
blockchain technologies and works as a part of payment using wisekey blockchainasa
service technology offerings",Cryptocurrency
"the wiswatch is also said to be able to be used as a 
unique personal key identifier and trusted device to access smartphones applications 
personal data and secured cloud storage",Cryptocurrency
"public key  
the public key is where cryptocurrency funds are deposited and received",Cryptocurrency
"it is a 
cryptographic code that allows a user to receive cryptocurrencies into their account ",Cryptocurrency
"when a user initiates their first transaction with a cryptocurrency a unique pair of public 
key and private key is created",Cryptocurrency
"the transaction would also be broadcasted to the 
network where distributed nodes confirm the validity of the transaction before finalising 
it and recording it on the blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"it was noted that before a transaction is 
broadcasted it needed to be signed digitally using the private key",Cryptocurrency
"the signature would 
 
 
prove the ownership of the private key but not divulge the details of the private key to 
anyone",Cryptocurrency
"since a public key is created based on the private key the user’s public key is used to 
prove that the digital signature came from their private key",Cryptocurrency
"once the transaction has 
been verified as valid the cryptocurrency funds are sent to the recipient’s public address",Cryptocurrency
the public address is a hashed version of a public key,Cryptocurrency
"since the public key is made up of 
extremely long string of numbers it needed to be compressed and shortened hence the 
creation of public address",Cryptocurrency
"in other words a private key generates a public key which 
then generates a public address",Cryptocurrency
"when two users agreed to conduct a transaction they 
would reveal their public addresses to each other",Cryptocurrency
"the sender needs the recipient’s public 
address to be able to send the funds to which will then be able to spend or withdraw the 
amount using their private key",Cryptocurrency
"the recipient can also verify the sender’s batch of 
cryptocurrency coins using the sender’s public address which is displayed on their 
screen",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrency wallets 
cryptocurrency wallets are essential component of cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"they are digital 
wallets that are used to store send and receive cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"a cryptocurrency 
wallet is commonly used to store a private key that proves ownership of a public key 
which is a public digital code connected to a particular amount of currency",Cryptocurrency
"types of cryptocurrency wallets  
there are several types of cryptocurrency wallets and each wallet has their advantages 
and disadvantages",Cryptocurrency
"most cryptocurrency have their official wallet or a few officially 
recommended thirdparty wallets",Cryptocurrency
"typically no wallet can store many cryptocurrency 
 
 
most can only hold one or two cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrency users would need to 
figure out which wallet can store their chosen cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrency wallets can also be divided into two categories cold wallet and hot 
wallet",Cryptocurrency
"a cold wallet is generally considered to be effective for longterm storage of 
unused funds",Cryptocurrency
"a hot wallet is described as a type of wallet that is carried around for 
immediate use of the funds within",Cryptocurrency
"the key difference between hot and cold wallets is 
that hot wallets are connected to the internet whereas cold wallets are not",Cryptocurrency
"hot wallets 
are also considered to be more likely targets from hackers as they’re connected to the 
internet – cold wallets are offlinenot connected to the internet hence they’re safe from 
hackers",Cryptocurrency
"due to this it was recommended to have as many layers of protection as 
possible on hot wallets",Cryptocurrency
"layers of protection can include twofactor authentication 
strong password and security settings",Cryptocurrency
"it was also thought to not have many funds in a 
hot wallet",Cryptocurrency
"the reason being that hackers can see how much funds are inside a hot wallet 
as it’s connected to the internet",Cryptocurrency
lesser funds would naturally mean less appealing target,Cryptocurrency
"however despite having an offline feature to protect them from online threats cold 
wallets are not immune to threats",Cryptocurrency
"a study found that a malware can be preinstalled or 
pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet ",Cryptocurrency
"alternatively it can infect the 
cold wallet’s system when removable media such as usb flash drives is inserted into the 
wallet’s computer in order to conduct a transaction",Cryptocurrency
"the study found that these attack 
methods have been repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade     ",Cryptocurrency
"after obtaining a foothold in the wallet a hacker can then utilise various airgap covert 
channel techniques  including physical electromagnetic electric magnetic acoustic 
optical and thermal techniques",Cryptocurrency
"in conclusion even though cold wallets provide a high 
 
 
degree of isolation it is still possible for attackers to compromise such wallets and steal 
private keys from the owners",Cryptocurrency
"desktop wallet  
a desktop wallet is the type that is considered more secure when compared to both an 
online and mobile wallet",Cryptocurrency
"however the degree of security is directly related to the quality 
of the desktop’s protection against online threats such as computer virus and malware",Cryptocurrency
"examples of desktop wallets are desktop applications such as exodus multibit armory 
and bitcoin core",Cryptocurrency
"a desktop wallet also has a feature that can identify it as a ‘cold’ wallet when not 
connected to the internet the desktop wallet is impervious to online threats from 
hackers viruses etc",Cryptocurrency
"a cold desktop storage can be an older laptop that is completely 
offline and on a clean operating system install",Cryptocurrency
"some of the advantages of desktop wallets are that they are easiertouse cryptocurrency 
wallet as compared to the others good cold storage solution and private keys not stored 
on a thirdparty server",Cryptocurrency
"it was noted however that they are only great solution for a cold 
wallet only if they have never been connected to the internet before if they have been 
connected to the internet they would obtain an ip address which hackers can trace and 
use to access the desktop",Cryptocurrency
"desktops can also store private keys by downloading and 
storing them  eliminating the need to rely on thirdparty server",Cryptocurrency
"disadvantages of desktop wallets include the security concerns when and if they are 
connected to the internet",Cryptocurrency
"as mentioned before connecting to the internet would 
present the desktop with an ip address which hackers can use to hack the desktop",Cryptocurrency
"being 
able to or connected to the internet also exposes the desktop to other online threats 
 
 
such as malware key loggers and viruses",Cryptocurrency
"desktops are also not immune to physical 
damages",Cryptocurrency
"fixing desktops by relying on service of others can expose its contents to them 
they can examine the desktop’s contents potentially obtaining access to cryptocurrency 
funds of the owner",Cryptocurrency
"it was also mentioned earlier that desktops can download private 
keys into them for storage",Cryptocurrency
"this also creates a risk such as that if a backup keys were not 
made and the desktop become disabled or inaccessible the keys would be lost and 
likely impossible to retrieve",Cryptocurrency
"mobile wallet 
mobile wallet is a type of wallet that is run from a phone application",Cryptocurrency
"it provides access to 
cryptocurrencies via mobile devices and provides additional features via the applications 
however it does create security risks similar to desktop wallets when connected to the 
internet",Cryptocurrency
"advantages of mobile wallets include them being practical and easier to use and access 
than other cryptocurrency wallets mobile phones can be carried around and accessed 
anywhere so long as there’s internet connection",Cryptocurrency
"this enables users to accept or send 
cryptocurrency payments practically from anywhere",Cryptocurrency
"it was also mentioned that mobile 
wallet have additional features via the applications",Cryptocurrency
"one such feature includes qr code 
scanning to access cryptocurrency funds",Cryptocurrency
"the disadvantage of mobile wallets is the fact that mobile phones in general are 
incredibly insecure devices just as desktops they can also be infected with online threats 
such as malware and viruses",Cryptocurrency
"online wallet 
online wallets are commonly cryptocurrency wallets that are accessed via web browsers 
which is why they can also be referred to as web wallet",Cryptocurrency
"advantages of online wallets include the fact that they are the fastest way to complete 
cryptocurrency transactions given that there is no lag between locations of the 
application and server",Cryptocurrency
they are also ideal to hold small amounts of cryptocurrency,Cryptocurrency
"this 
characteristic categorise them as hot wallets and share their property ideal for quick 
daily transactions that does not involve massive amount of cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"some online 
wallets are also able to manage multiple cryptocurrencies transfer between them or be 
directly integrated into a cryptocurrency exchange marketplace",Cryptocurrency
"disadvantages of online wallets include users being susceptible to phishing scams 
malware and insider tracking and outdated security measures",Cryptocurrency
"the risks mentioned are 
a part of the hazard of using web browser services and often out of the user’s control",Cryptocurrency
"information relating to user’s cryptocurrency details are also out of their control as in 
they are stored in a thirdparty storage the internet",Cryptocurrency
"use of online wallet requires a 
desktop and as mentioned earlier desktops connected to the internet are at risk from 
malware key loggers and viruses",Cryptocurrency
"as such it is generally not recommended to use 
services such as internet café to reduce the risk of information theft",Cryptocurrency
"hardware wallet  
hardware wallets are dedicated hardware that is built to be able to hold cryptocurrency 
and keep it secure",Cryptocurrency
hardware wallets include usb devices and external hard disks,Cryptocurrency
"these 
devices are able to go online when connected to desktop conduct transactions and 
taken offline upon completion for transportation and security",Cryptocurrency
"requiring a desktop and 
 
 
internet connection to conduct transactions relating to cryptocurrency classifies this type 
of wallet as hot wallet",Cryptocurrency
"paper wallet 
paper wallets are a medium in which stores information related to both public and 
private keys",Cryptocurrency
"an example of the information stored is qr code that belonged to a private 
key",Cryptocurrency
"using that qr code a user can both send and receive digital currency using a paper 
wallet",Cryptocurrency
"overall paper wallets enabled an option of not storing digital data about a user’s 
data such as private key by using a paper wallet",Cryptocurrency
"mining  
cryptocurrency mining is the process of generating new cryptocurrency in the form of 
coins",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrency mining is called such from to the fact that when transactions are 
added to the public ledger that is blockchain new coins is created or in other word 
mined",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrency mining is an integral part of how cryptocurrency functions as a digital 
currency",Cryptocurrency
"the mining network relies on miners to verify and update the public ledger of 
cryptocurrency transactions to verify that cryptocurrency users are not trying to cheat 
the system and to add newlydiscovered coins into the system",Cryptocurrency
"miners 
as explained earlier miners work together to verify transactions ultimately mining new 
coins into the system",Cryptocurrency
but that does not mean that all miners are on the same team,Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrency miners gets rewarded in the form of some new coins for their hard work 
in mining coins but the amount of coins rewarded are directly proportional to the 
contribution a miner had in the process of generating new coins",Cryptocurrency
"hence there are 
competitions amongst cryptocurrency miners in adding new transactions into the ledger 
 
 
as part of generating new coins",Cryptocurrency
"to put it simply the more a miner contribute into adding 
new transactions into the ledger and generating coins the more coins the miner obtains 
as rewards",Cryptocurrency
"proofofwork  
in cryptocurrency proofofwork is a system that utilises hardtocompute but easyto
verify functions in order to limit exploitation of cryptocurrency mining by miners",Cryptocurrency
"a proofofwork system’s hash function is the algorithm used to find a solution to the 
computational puzzle which is simple to calculate the output is if the input is known",Cryptocurrency
"however it is virtually impossible to calculate an output if the input is unknown trying 
every possible input would be done until the correct input is found",Cryptocurrency
"when cryptocurrency 
miners mine digital coins and add blocks of transactions to a blockchain they effectively 
complete a proofofwork system by using highpowered computers to solve a 
mathematical problem that is cryptographical puzzle",Cryptocurrency
"one of the most popular proofofwork functions is called sha a part of the sha 
family of secure hash algorithms",Cryptocurrency
it is also the one that is used as bitcoin’s proofofwork,Cryptocurrency
it was first used by adam back in  as a way to block spam emails,Cryptocurrency
"recently however 
bitcoin started utilising an alternative to proofofwork called proofofstake  ",Cryptocurrency
"it 
was a new proofofwork mechanism that improves decentralisation and reduces risk of 
 attack without increasing the risk of sybil attack – an attack in which a single node 
such as a cryptocurrency miner assumed multiple identities ",Cryptocurrency
"there is a single major flaw to the proofofwork system and that is requiring a large 
amount of computing power to solve cryptographical puzzle",Cryptocurrency
"the proofofwork system 
holds no use apart from protecting the validity of cryptocurrency transactions and 
 
 
generally ensuring cryptocurrency system are ran honestly",Cryptocurrency
"this would mean that the 
process of mining cryptocurrency with proofofwork is horribly wasteful in terms of 
energyuse",Cryptocurrency
"given the wasteful energy spent on proofofwork system it was not viewed 
as a longterm for cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"alternatives such as the aforementioned proofof
stake are seen as a more friendly function",Cryptocurrency
"in short proofofwork is indeed designed to be difficult in order to prevent malicious 
behaviour such as a miner trying to add fake transaction block into a blockchain to get 
reward coins",Cryptocurrency
"proofofwork would not only protect digital currency such as 
cryptocurrency from malicious miners but also prevent a single person from assuming 
control over which transaction block to next be added into the blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"how cryptocurrency are mined  
in order to add transactions into a blockchain all miners collect all transactions that were 
recently broadcasted by cryptocurrency users verify the transactions and compile them 
down into a transaction block – a condensed record of all transactions for that period of 
time",Cryptocurrency
"it is possible for a miner to simple create a fake transaction block and adding it into the 
blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"due to this the cryptocurrency algorithm was designed to make 
cryptocurrency mining difficult",Cryptocurrency
"to prevent a miner from adding a transaction block at 
their will they have to solve a difficult computational puzzle – a proofofwork scheme",Cryptocurrency
"the proofofwork scheme was designed to provide solutions that are easy to verify but 
difficult to find",Cryptocurrency
"in short cryptocurrency miners compete against each other to see who can solve a 
difficult cryptographic puzzle first",Cryptocurrency
"as one miner found the solution they broadcast the 
 
 
solution to all the other miners for them to verify that the solution is correct",Cryptocurrency
"if the 
solution is indeed correct the network adds the successfullymined transaction block to 
the accepted blockchain permanently",Cryptocurrency
"the miner who was the first to successfully solve the cryptographic puzzle of transaction 
block is the rewarded for their effort by receiving new coins – the amount of coins differs 
and depends on the transaction block size",Cryptocurrency
"the possibility of reward acts as an incentive 
for cryptocurrency miners to keep investing in computational time and effort into mining 
new cryptocurrency coins",Cryptocurrency
"the process of rewarding cryptocurrency miners with coins for 
their hard work of solving cryptographic puzzle also contributes to the overall 
cryptocurrency coins supply",Cryptocurrency
"where cryptocurrencies are mined 
it was explained that cryptocurrencies are mined by miners in which they solve 
cryptographical puzzle to add transactional blocks into a blockchain creating new coins 
as a result",Cryptocurrency
"as such cryptocurrency mining can be done from practically everywhere 
providing that the miner have access to a computer with sufficient computing power",Cryptocurrency
"it was also explained that mining cryptocurrency with proofofwork in place would 
require a large amount of energy",Cryptocurrency
this raised a concern such as carbon footprint ,Cryptocurrency
"it 
was estimated that the combined electricity consumption for bitcoin and ethereum 
mining which represented as high as  of the total cryptocurrency market 
capitalisation  had already reached a staggering  terawatthours yearly and is on 
the rise",Cryptocurrency
"in terms of perspective greece’s population of  million consumed close to  
terawatthours annually the consumption of energy to mine bitcoins and ethereum coins 
alone nearly require as much energy as greece a nation",Cryptocurrency
"a vast majority of cryptocurrency mining  was done in china and is typically 
powered by coal plants ",Cryptocurrency
"with the use of lifecycle impactassessment methodology 
it was estimated that the annual carbon footprint for bitcoin and ethereum mining was 
comparable to that of some ",Cryptocurrency
"million average european inhabitants hence the 
conclusion of the study being that the cryptocurrency industry was in need of reform to 
be more environmentally sustainable",Cryptocurrency
"however despite the claim that cryptocurrency mining was environmentally hazardous a 
different study found that findings to be economically unsound",Cryptocurrency
"in a review stuart 
wimbush mentioned a possible fault in the claim of the combined annual electricity 
consumption due to bitcoin and ethereum mining was  that of greece ",Cryptocurrency
"it was 
found that bitcoin and ethereum generated a total wealth of us billion in  
whereas the  million inhabitants of greece generated a total wealth of approximately 
us billion in the same year",Cryptocurrency
"given that greece generated less wealth than 
cryptocurrency mining and would have consumed much more than simply electrical 
energy in the process it was thought that the mining of cryptocurrency seemed to be 
considerably less wasteful",Cryptocurrency
"in summary even though there are valid claims that cryptocurrency mining is 
environmentally hazardous it was theoretically impossible for it to be so given that 
greece a nation generated less wealth than cryptocurrency mining and yet consumed 
much more than simply electrical energy in the process",Cryptocurrency
"in other words it was natural for 
cryptocurrency mining to have consumed as much power electrical in order to generate 
a large amount of wealth",Cryptocurrency
"it was also suggested for nations to transit from using fossil
fuelbased electricity generation to nuclear or other sustainable alternatives ",Cryptocurrency
"this 
 
 
would allow generation of a large amount of wealth such as from cryptocurrency mining 
and using a large amount of sustainable energy",Cryptocurrency
"blockchain  
in terms of cryptocurrency a blockchain is a public ledger of all a cryptocurrency’s 
transaction",Cryptocurrency
"as new transactions are made they are compiled into blocks which will be 
added into the sequential blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"in order for a transaction to be considered 
successful it has to be added into the blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"once a transaction block is added into 
a blockchain it will remain there permanently and are considered as public record",Cryptocurrency
"other uses for blockchain 
aside from cryptocurrency there are emerging theories in ways to utilise the blockchain 
technology",Cryptocurrency
"amongst them are medicines gun control stock exchange and other 
investments such as gold",Cryptocurrency
"medicine  
a use of the blockchain ledger system was suggested by m hoy in medicines ",Cryptocurrency
"it was 
suggested to tie everything from medical records to library checkouts using a blockchain 
ledger containing verifiable timestamped records of creation and ownership",Cryptocurrency
"the system 
can also potentially prevent changes in documents and data tampering",Cryptocurrency
"gun control 
it was suggested by thomas f heston that the blockchain used for effective gun control 
",Cryptocurrency
"the blockchain protocol can be used to keep track of gun flow from manufacturer to 
end user and track sales from a gun owner to another",Cryptocurrency
"the blockchain’s anonymity 
feature would also allow better privacy than existing background check systems and 
simultaneously link ownership of a particular gun to an individual in an immutable 
manner",Cryptocurrency
"stock exchange  
in december  it was announced that asx australia’s main stock exchange would 
start using blockchain technology to process its equities transactions ",Cryptocurrency
"asx would begin 
replacing its current system chess with the distributed ledger technology to help 
manage the clearing and settlement for buying and selling stocks",Cryptocurrency
"asx chief executive at 
that time dominic stevens stated that the change into using blockchain technology 
would put australia at the forefront of innovation in the financial markets",Cryptocurrency
"other investments – gold  
it is apparently possible to implement the blockchain system onto other types of 
investment",Cryptocurrency
"an article was published about australia’s biggest gold refiner perth mint 
developing their own blockchainbased gold products as a response to the threat posed 
by the increasing in popularity of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ",Cryptocurrency
"richard hayes 
chief executive of perth mint at that time commented that the underlying blockchain 
technology behind cryptocurrencies presented an opportunity for perth mint to develop 
new products with greater security and traceability",Cryptocurrency
in summary blockchain has features that are beneficial to many fields,Cryptocurrency
"such features 
include antitempering as all records added into a blockchain are final anonymity and 
continual records to keep updated about a matter",Cryptocurrency
"how to trade cryptocurrency  
trading cryptocurrency requires having good background knowledge and the 
components needed to trade cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"the two main components a user needed 
to start trading cryptocurrency are cryptocurrency wallet and cryptocurrency exchange",Cryptocurrency
in terms of having good background knowledge there are several notes to consider,Cryptocurrency
"first 
a beginner should choose a trading company with a good reputation that offers an 
 
 
exchange and a wallet",Cryptocurrency
a beginner should also trade prominent coins as starter,Cryptocurrency
"bitcoin 
and ethereum are two of the most prominent coins as of june   ",Cryptocurrency
"how to spend cryptocurrency  
one of the major concerns regarding cryptocurrency is finding ways to spend it",Cryptocurrency
"conducting a search using a search engine was thought to be one of the best ways to look 
for ways or merchants who accepts cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"gambling is also a way to spend 
cryptocurrency  
spending cryptocurrency is not always possible as some countries have banned trading 
of cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
some countries opted for a compromise in the form of regulations,Cryptocurrency
government regulations will be discussed in more detail in a later section,Cryptocurrency
"how cryptocurrencies differ from flat currencies 
as explained earlier cryptocurrency differs from regular flat currency",Cryptocurrency
"the difference lies 
in two major ways",Cryptocurrency
"cryptocurrencies are only accepted as payment by other users – if no 
one accepts it then it is considered worthless",Cryptocurrency
"flat currency however will always be 
accepted as payment by the government at the very least",Cryptocurrency
"the second major difference 
is that cryptocurrency token supply is not managed by a central authority whereas flat 
currency is managed by the government and can lead to either inflation or deflation",Cryptocurrency
"popular cryptocurrencies latest price  
there are thousands of cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"it can be hard to determine which cryptocurrency 
is the best or worst",Cryptocurrency
"there are several parameters that can be used to rank 
cryptocurrency their price market cap supply rate and existing volume in circulation",Cryptocurrency
"in 
 
 
terms of price the four highestranked cryptocurrency as at june  are bitcoin 
bitcoin cash mixin and ethereum ",Cryptocurrency
"crime types in australia 
the types of crimes in australia will be listed and matched with some of the cases related 
to cryptocurrency discussed below",Cryptocurrency
"the types of crime happened in australia according to 
australian criminal intelligence commission acic are illicit drugs fraud financial crimes 
illicit firearms money laundering cybercrime identity crime exploitation of business 
structures public sector corruption and violence ",Cryptocurrency
"some of the most recent crimes in relation to cryptocurrency  
to understand more as to how cryptocurrency can be related to crimes various case 
involving cryptocurrency in general or a particular cryptocurrency such as bitcoin various 
case that occurred in the last decade will be discussed below",Cryptocurrency
"swoop for cases that 
occurred in the last decade was decided as cryptocurrency or at least the proofof
concept was published in  by satoshi nakamoto ",Cryptocurrency
"december  – hacking of nicehash  
one of the case examples to be explained is the cyberattack against nicehash",Cryptocurrency
"the crime 
happened on the th of december  where nicehash a cryptomining company 
based in slovenia reported that their system was breached in a cyberattack",Cryptocurrency
"nicehash is known as the world’s largest cryptomining marketplace and was created 
based on the concept of a shared economy",Cryptocurrency
"they were founded on the th of march 
 and has grown to exponential heights ever since and harboured  
cryptocurrency miners daily on average ",Cryptocurrency
"nicehash is different from any crypto
mining marketplace in that they applied a new system to cryptocurrency mining that 
 
 
resolved around the relationship between cryptocurrency sellers and buyers",Cryptocurrency
"nicehash 
users upon registration are presented with three options",Cryptocurrency
"the first option would be that 
users can choose to sell their hashing power generated from their mining hardware to 
receive earnings",Cryptocurrency
"the second option would be that investors can choose to buy a package 
to mine a particular cryptocurrency at a designated set pool with the support of crypto
algorithm",Cryptocurrency
"the last option would be to be a combination of a buyer and a seller via 
nicehash",Cryptocurrency
"on more detail about the case it was reported on newstex finance  accounting blogs 
that about  bitcoins were stolen ",Cryptocurrency
"the approximate worth of those stolen bitcoins 
was  million",Cryptocurrency
"it was reported earlier that day that the price of bitcoins was at a 
recordhigh of more than  ",Cryptocurrency
"the recordhigh price of the bitcoin was very 
possibly be the motive of the crime or at least tempted them to steal bitcoins",Cryptocurrency
in terms of bitcointheft the case was not the first reported case in the field,Cryptocurrency
gox a bitcoin exchange based in japan reported a theft of  coins ,Cryptocurrency
those bitcoins were worth nearly  million at that time,Cryptocurrency
"gox were shut down not 
long after the case  and filed for bankruptcy protection in japan later that year ",Cryptocurrency
"a 
study of this case found that a meteoric rise in price and rapid growth were associated 
with cryptocurrency particularly bitcoin – this also attracted thieveshackers ",Cryptocurrency
"in regards of the aftermaths of the case about nicehash the ceo of nicehash at that 
time marko kobal had resigned following the incident  and reimbursements were 
carried out by the company",Cryptocurrency
"on the st of january nearly two months after the hacking 
of bitcoins the company announced that they are going to reimburse their service users 
that were affected by the security breach that occurred on th of december  ",Cryptocurrency
"the reimbursement program is called the repayment program and thus far consisted of 
four stages the first was carried out on the nd of february  the second on the st of 
march  the third on the rd of april  and the latest stage fourth stage was done 
on the th of may ",Cryptocurrency
"it was also reported along with the fourth stage that  of the 
old balance amount was already reimbursed to all users that were impacted by the 
security breach",Cryptocurrency
"more details about the program are unknown or if there will be any 
more but  given that there are four stages thus far and  of the stolen amount 
reimbursed it can be predicted that there will be about seven more stages of 
reimbursements with each stage reimbursing approximately  of the stolen amount",Cryptocurrency
"blockchainrelated – child pornography  
in a report published in march  german researchers found about  files of non
financial data some linking to or actually containing child pornography and other 
objectionable materials on the blockchain system that stores bitcoin transactions ",Cryptocurrency
"it 
was concluded that users of blockchain are able to add nonfinancial data for purposes 
such as describing a transaction’s purpose and insert benign messages or record 
information for other financial services",Cryptocurrency
"the objectionable contents were found to be 
imbedded in such data and given that blockchain are viewable by practically all users the 
data would be downloaded and persistently stored by them",Cryptocurrency
this discovery would place certain users of the bitcoin network in legal difficulties,Cryptocurrency
"the 
researchers also mentioned that this discovery could pose an obstacle for greater 
adoption and mainstream acceptance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"upon 
further analysis the researchers found that most of the files were harmless but some of 
the files contained copyright violations and the disclosure of the people’s identifiable 
information and at least eight files were said to containing sexual content ",Cryptocurrency
"amongst 
 
 
the child pornography materials two files were found to contain  links to child 
pornography websites and a file depicting a nude image of a minor",Cryptocurrency
"experts said that the files were likely to be downloaded as a part of notes to transactions 
or inserted as the transactions themselves",Cryptocurrency
"users of blockchain are able to add non
financial data for purposes such as describing a transaction’s purpose insert benign 
messages or record information for other financial services – anyone with access to 
bitcoin software such as miners exchanges and traders have the ability to upload any 
content into the blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"arbitrary data insertion methods for bitcoin’s blockchain  
as explained before aside from recording financial transactions bitcoin’s blockchain are 
also able to be filled with nonfinancial data",Cryptocurrency
"nonfinancial data can take a form of short 
messages via special transaction types or even complete files",Cryptocurrency
"to add complete files into 
a blockchain arbitrary data has to be encoded as standard transactions",Cryptocurrency
"there are two 
insertion methods for nonfinancial data lowlevel insertion methods and content 
insertion services",Cryptocurrency
"benefits and risks of arbitrary blockchain content 
bitcoin’s blockchain design included several ways to insert arbitrary nonfinancial data 
into its blockchain both intentionally and unintentionally",Cryptocurrency
"potential benefits of engraving 
arbitrary data into the bitcoin’s blockchain and the risks associated with them will be 
discussed further below",Cryptocurrency
"benefits  
bitcoin offered coinbase a digital currency exchange headquarters and opreturn a 
special transaction template that allows one small data chunk as an attachment onto a 
transaction as explicit channels to insert small chunks of nonfinancial data into their 
 
 
blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"the benefit of using opreturn is that different services use opreturn to 
link nonfinancial assets such as vouchers to bitcoin’s blockchain",Cryptocurrency
"coinbase differ from 
opreturn in those only miners who dedicate significant computational contribution to 
maintain the blockchain to be able to add extra chunks of data into the new transaction 
blocks",Cryptocurrency
"risks  
there are several risks associated with adding data into blockchain content",Cryptocurrency
"some of 
them are copyright violations malware privacy violations politically sensitive content 
and illegal  condemned content",Cryptocurrency
"as the blockchain are akin to filesharing networks 
pirated data can be distributed as part of a transaction block",Cryptocurrency
"malware is also a threat as 
they can be inserted as an attachment and if downloaded and opened can cause 
cataclysmic damage onto the system or device",Cryptocurrency
"governments have valid concerns 
regarding a leakage of classified information",Cryptocurrency
"if such classified information is added into a 
blockchain it would mean that more than a single user having the file and the ability to 
access it potentially exposing sensitive information about a government",Cryptocurrency
"in short there are ways for someone to add an objectionable content into a blockchain 
and cause harm if possessed or accessed by other users",Cryptocurrency
"unlike systems such as social 
media platforms filesharing networks and online storage systems contents that are 
stored in a blockchain can be do so while remaining anonymous making it hard to trace 
the culprit",Cryptocurrency
"examining the data nonfinancial data 
there are three methods to examine nonfinancial data in a blockchain lowlevel 
insertion methods detectors and service detectors and suspicious transaction detectors",Cryptocurrency
"lowlevel insertion method detectors 
the lowlevel insertion method detectors were designed to match individual transactions 
that are likely to contain nonfinancial data",Cryptocurrency
"they detect manipulated financial 
transactions as well as opreturn nonstandard and coinbase transactions",Cryptocurrency
"service detectors  
the service detectors enabled the detection and extraction of files based on the service’ 
protocols and also tracking of data used in servicecreated transactions",Cryptocurrency
"suspicious transaction detectors  
the suspicious transaction detectors examine standard transactions that are likely to 
carry nonfinancial data but were not detected",Cryptocurrency
"for a transaction to be examined by this 
method it has to have at least  suspicious outputs",Cryptocurrency
"illegal drugs  
there was a reported case in india about a drug trade related to cryptocurrency ",Cryptocurrency
"an 
arrest was made by the police against two university students that were caught 
purchasing drugs using cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"the duo would purchase an amount of drug 
and then have it transported into a particular place where it’ll be picked up",Cryptocurrency
it was not the first case where cryptocurrency was used to purchase drugs,Cryptocurrency
"there was a 
case in  where a university student soldauction drugs via an online drug 
marketplace called ‘silk road’ ",Cryptocurrency
"the student had created a fake profile and auctioned 
drugs online where customers would buy and have it delivered to an address of their 
choice",Cryptocurrency
"the method of payment was cryptocurrency with different drugs cost different 
amount of coins",Cryptocurrency
"the case was ultimately solved when police made an arrest of the 
student in a public library where he logged in into his silk road profile",Cryptocurrency
"march  
in a newspaper article published on march  it was announced that pavel lerner a 
cryptocurrency businessman was kidnapped in ukraine by armed assailants and was 
forced to pay  million ransom in the form of bitcoins from his digital wallet ",Cryptocurrency
"the 
case led to demands being made to the government to clamp down on cryptocurrency 
crime",Cryptocurrency
"it was mentioned that every month the ukrainian police would raid the kvazar 
semiconductor plant in kiev and seize millions of pounds in form of computer 
equipment which were claimed to be taken by russians and used to finance the 
separatist regions of donetsk and lugansk",Cryptocurrency
"base on the case examples below in terms of type of crimes in australia by acic 
cryptocurrency had been used in two categories of crimes illicit drugs silk road 
cybercrime hacking of nicehash",Cryptocurrency
"child pornography and kidnapping did not quite fit into 
the crime categories listed but they are serious crimes nonetheless",Cryptocurrency
"government regulations  
in response to several concerns such as environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining 
and the risks of owning cryptocurrency several governments had decided to take actions 
against cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"actions taken include total banning and putting regulations in 
place",Cryptocurrency
"china  
china as of february  had completely banned cryptocurrency trading within their 
country",Cryptocurrency
"the process actually started from september  where it was announced that 
chinese regulators declaring initial coin offerings illegal ",Cryptocurrency
"this meant that 
cryptocurrency owners are not allowed to promote much less sell their cryptocurrency 
 
 
to anyone in the country",Cryptocurrency
"the regulatory action was said to be caused by growing fear 
from initial coin offerings which caught investors’ imagination that further leads to 
phishing activities",Cryptocurrency
ultimately cryptocurrency was banned in total starting february ,Cryptocurrency
"it was announced 
in an article that was published by financial news a publication company that is affiliated 
with the people’s bank of china that the chinese government’s recent attempts to stamp 
out digital currency trading by shutting down domestic cryptocurrency exchanges were 
not successful in completely eradicating cryptocurrency trading and that the government 
will strengthen measures to thoroughly remove any onshore or offshore trading 
platforms related to virtual currency trading ",Cryptocurrency
"south korea 
south korea is another country that moved to regulate cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"initially it was 
reported that south korea planned to ban cryptocurrency trading in light of 
cryptocurrency abuse",Cryptocurrency
"south korea’s justice minister at that time park sungki 
mentioned there being great concerns regarding virtual currencies  ",Cryptocurrency
"however as 
at midjanuary  a ban had not been placed but instead considered taxing 
cryptocurrency transactions according to the south korean finance minister at that time 
kim dongyeon ",Cryptocurrency
"later in the month raids were conducted by the country’s police 
and tax agencies on major cryptocurrency exchanges for alleged tax evasion",Cryptocurrency
"aside from 
alleged tax evasion case the police were also looking for a seoulbased cryptocurrency 
exchange over possible gambling allegations",Cryptocurrency
"ultimately the south korean government officially banned anonymous cryptocurrency 
trading commencing at the end of january  ",Cryptocurrency
"this would mean that 
 
 
cryptocurrency traders could only make cryptocurrency transactions from bank accounts 
set up under their real names",Cryptocurrency
"ukraine  kazakhstan 
ukraine had started to intensify the search for methods to regulate cryptocurrencies due 
to growing concerns in their capital kiev that exploitation of the digital assets by 
criminals and geopolitical adversaries presented a growing national security risk ",Cryptocurrency
"ukraine’s national security and defence council chief oleksandr turchynov warned that 
the current legal vacuum posed a threat to the economy and security of the state",Cryptocurrency
"he also 
mentioned that given the rapid development of cryptocurrencies around the world the 
issue could not be left out of attention hence the plans to develop regulations",Cryptocurrency
"the 
soaring prices of cryptocurrency have made the market an increasingly lucrative target 
for cyber criminals",Cryptocurrency
"there was also a growing concern among regulators and governments 
that cryptocurrency could be used by organised crimegroups for money laundering  
 and other criminal activities",Cryptocurrency
"in a response to growing concerns of cryptocurrency being used or simply being related 
to crimes the kazakhstan association of blockchain and cryptocurrency submitted a 
proposal to the eurasian economic union eaeu to create an advisory board on 
blockchain and cryptocurrency ",Cryptocurrency
"the proposal was submitted during the 
cryptoconference  in almaty and had gathered some support for governments to 
adopt legislation to regulate the cryptocurrency market",Cryptocurrency
"conference participants were 
pushing for the adoption of cryptocurrency laws within the eaeu in order to protect the 
best interests of all market from third parties such as cryptocurrency exchange 
marketplace",Cryptocurrency
"the regulation also aimed to prevent the use of cryptocurrency as a tool for 
 
 
illegal transactions the legalisation of proceeds from crime and the financing of 
terrorism",Cryptocurrency
"australia  
as of april  new laws for digital currency exchange dce providers operating in 
australia were implemented by austrac australia’s financial intelligence agency anti
money laundering and counterterrorism financing regulator amfctf ",Cryptocurrency
"the new 
laws would cover regulation of service providers of cryptocurrency such as 
cryptocurrency exchange marketplace",Cryptocurrency
"the austrac ceo nicole rose announced that the new laws would strengthen the 
agency’s compliance and intelligence capabilities to help dces implement systems and 
controls that can minimise the risk of criminals using them for purposes such as money 
laundering terrorism financing and cybercrime",Cryptocurrency
"with the new laws in place dces with a business operation located in australia must now 
register with austrac and meet the government’s amlctf compliance and reporting 
obligations",Cryptocurrency
"the transition period were run until may  to allow dces time to register 
them",Cryptocurrency
"corporate regulations  
countries are not the only one capable of banning or at least regulating 
cryptocurrencies",Cryptocurrency
"it was found that massive corporations such as google and apple have 
also moved to regulate cryptocurrency – cryptocurrency mining to be exact",Cryptocurrency
"google 
on the rd of april  it was reported that google had decided to start cracking down 
on malicious cryptocurrency mining via extensions on their website platform google 
 
 
chrome ",Cryptocurrency
"until that period google chrome’s web policy had been permitting 
cryptocurrency mining in their extensions providing that cryptocurrency mining was 
indeed an extension’s single purpose of use and that the user is adequately informed of 
the cryptocurrency mining behaviour",Cryptocurrency
"unfortunately it was found that approximately  of extensions with cryptocurrency 
mining scripts that developers have attempted to upload to the chrome web store failed 
to comply with google chrome’s policies ",Cryptocurrency
"that resulted in their rejection or removal 
from the store according to james wagner extensions platform product manager 
explained in a blog post",Cryptocurrency
"it was then decided that chrome web store would no longer 
accept extensions that mine cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"however the currency existing extensions 
with blockchainrelated purposes other than cryptocurrency mining would still continue 
to be permitted in the web store",Cryptocurrency
"apple  
apple is one of the latest companies to ban cryptocurrency mining on their devices ",Cryptocurrency
it began with the release of a new set of developer guideline updates,Cryptocurrency
"virtual currencies 
such as cryptocurrency heavily rely on cryptocurrency mining to sustain their existence",Cryptocurrency
"the process required using a computer’s processing power in order to obtain fractions of 
coins – this consumes an incredible amount of power",Cryptocurrency
"the power drains could potentially 
end up leading to a higher electricity bill surpassing the price of what are mined",Cryptocurrency
"it could 
also put a significant burden on the mining device",Cryptocurrency
"the reason of apple banning 
cryptocurrency mining seemed to be caused by the latter concern as they banned 
cryptocurrency mining on their devices due to power consumption and the potential of 
the process to put unnecessary pressure on the devices",Cryptocurrency
"in summary some countries actively ban cryptocurrency while others opted to 
compromise by placing regulations in place",Cryptocurrency
"concerns regarding cryptocurrency being 
used for crime seemed valid but with regulations such as the new law implemented by 
australia’s austrac would ensure transparency of dces and assist in solving crimes by 
having decs registered in the system and keeping track into their activities",Cryptocurrency
"the new law 
would also help in monitoring decs for any sign of criminal activities",Cryptocurrency
"conclusion  
in conclusion cryptocurrency indeed have a relation to crimes",Cryptocurrency
"there have been cases 
where cryptocurrency was used to commit a crime such as purchasing a drug kidnapping 
a person and demand ransom in the form of cryptocurrency and hacking into a 
cryptocurrency marketplace to steal cryptocurrency",Cryptocurrency
"based on the crime types listed by 
acic two crime categories have been proved to be related to cryptocurrency 
cybercrime and illicit drugs",Cryptocurrency
"in response to crimes related to cryptocurrency being 
committed laws were put in place in several countries",Cryptocurrency
"some laws were implemented to 
ban cryptocurrency completely such as in china whereas others such as south korea and 
australia opted to regulate cryptocurrencies as opposed to completely banning them",Cryptocurrency
"as 
cryptocurrency are able to continue to rise so too are the number of people that accept 
them as payments – this can be a cause for a crime",Cryptocurrency
"in this study there was no search 
conducted on the relation between cryptocurrency against other crime types such as 
violence and arson",Cryptocurrency
"a future study concerning the relation between cryptocurrency and 
other crime types including the lesser ones would be helpful in identifying more ways 
cryptocurrency can be used or related to a crime – this can help in placing laws or create 
methods to counter or solve those crimes",Cryptocurrency

future of humans in innumerable ways",Genetic engineering
"there are many proposed uses of the new genetic engineering technologies including 
cancer therapy and other therapies for genetic diseases",Genetic engineering
"however the ability to alter the human

further than disease therapy",Genetic engineering
"altering the human genome would not only allow us to edit out 
mutant genes that cause disease in humans but also to alter multiple other traits",Genetic engineering

already developed the technology to genetically test the genomes of human embryos a human

using the new genetic engineering technologies to perform similar actions and create “designer

the genetic engineering techniques we have developed involve the precise modification 
of dna and allows genes to be turned on or off meaning that certain genes will not be 
physically expressed if they are turned off and they will be expressed if they are turned on",Genetic engineering
"this 
allows scientists to identify traits they want to remove or to insert other traits found somewhere 
else in an organisms’ genome through the process of editing alleles out and replacing them with 
nonmutant alleles",Genetic engineering
"should we alter a human embryo if we are able to genetically test and 
confirm that it will be born with a lethal degenerative disease or should we allow the human 
race to populate naturally",Genetic engineering
"even in the case of using genetic engineering technology on already 
born humans the question of what we are able to do versus what we should do still introduces an

unwound and replicated and then converted into rna which is singlestranded rather than

 the first attempt at genetically modifying a human embryo in the us occurred in summer 
of  by a research team in portland oregon at oregon health and science university",Genetic engineering

research team led by shoukhrat mitalipov used the crispr system to edit multiple onecell 
human embryos",Genetic engineering

and most importantly edited safely",Genetic engineering
"this means that there were no observed detrimental and 
  
unexpected offtarget effects in the embryos in the trial",Genetic engineering

it is imperative to understand the major theories of bioethics along with the four 
principles of medical ethics in order to analyze the ethical question at hand",Genetic engineering

theories of bioethics deontology and consequentialism",Genetic engineering
"the theory of deontology was 
formulated by immanuel kant and follows rules based ethics",Genetic engineering
"this theory states that we must not 
violate rules which depend on rational thought and we must not intentionally harm someone 
else",Genetic engineering
"in order to decide whether something is ethically justifiable or not one must be capable of 
rational thought",Genetic engineering
"in this theory there are certain obligations and commitments that we cannot 
violate regardless of the outcome ie",Genetic engineering
"even if the outcome is ideal and we cannot use other 
humans for the purpose of achieving our goals",Genetic engineering
"one of the largest aspects of deontology is that 
we cannot lie",Genetic engineering
"kant also states as a part of deontological theory that no person can be simply 
used to fulfill one’s own goals and we cannot intentionally harm",Genetic engineering
"the consequentialist theory formulated by jeremy bentham and john stuart mill is 
quite similar to an economic theory",Genetic engineering
"this theory focuses on the outcomes of behavior and is 
therefore commonly contrasted to deontological theory",Genetic engineering
"it judges whether something is ethically 
justifiable or not based on what a behavior produces and not the path it took to get to that 
outcome",Genetic engineering
"according to consequentialism we are trying to achieve the greatest good for the 
greatest number of people which is similar to a costbenefit analysis",Genetic engineering
"contrary to deontology 
consequentialists will sacrifice individuals to save the many and achieve personal goals",Genetic engineering
"case study  introduction 
  
in this section i am answering the following question is it ethically justifiable to use the 
crisprcas technology in its current condition to eliminate risk or determinate genes of 
alzheimer’s disease",Genetic engineering
"in order to answer this question i propose the following scenario 
 a middleaged couple had been attempting to conceive a child and they just found out 
that the woman is pregnant",Genetic engineering
"they have both been screened for their genetic makeup and the 
father is positive for the mutated apolipoprotein ε apoe gene that is the major precursor 
for the formation of βamyloid plaques and therefore a large precursor for alzheimer’s disease",Genetic engineering
"worried about the possible inheritance of this gene the couple decides to screen their embryo for 
the apoe gene",Genetic engineering
"they have the belief that they should do anything and everything to make sure 
that their child has the best and longest life possible",Genetic engineering
"after screening it is determined that the 
embryo also carries the mutated apoe gene that is a precursor for alzheimer’s",Genetic engineering
"they decide 
that they want to use current genetic engineering technology the crisprcas system in order 
to edit out the mutated gene and replace it with a normal one",Genetic engineering
"however the couple’s physician is 
skeptical about using the technology in its current state to perform this procedure",Genetic engineering
"is it ethically 
justifiable for the couple and the physician to do go ahead with the editing of the embryo",Genetic engineering
"my 
conclusion as shown in the arguments below is that at the current state of the crisprcas 
technology it is not ethically justifiable for the couple to edit out the mutated apoe gene from 
their growing embryo",Genetic engineering
"case study  analyzing deontological theory 
 editing the mutated gene out of the couple’s embryo would violate major aspects of 
deontological theory",Genetic engineering
"first of all it can be argued that the couple is not currently relying on 
rational thought",Genetic engineering
"although it could be argued that wanting to do everything for your child is 
  
rational in this case the parents are not scientists that know the small details of the unintended 
consequences even if they have been informed of these consequences by their physician",Genetic engineering
"they 
are trying to do everything possible to help their child and even though editing out the mutated 
gene is possible it is not rationally okay to do in its current state",Genetic engineering
"as stated in the previous 
section the scientific issues of unintended base changes and mosaicism could lead to 
consequences we have not yet discovered or predicted",Genetic engineering
"even though the couple wants to use it to 
possibly eliminate the risk of alzheimer’s or alleviate later symptoms of alzheimer’s in their 
future child they are not considering the possible side effects",Genetic engineering
"although alzheimer’s could be 
gone many other complications which possibly could be fatal could arise from the use of the 
crisprcas system",Genetic engineering
"from the physician and scientist standpoint the physician would be violating 
deontological theory as he would be using someone else in order to reach his own goal of 
eliminating andor alleviating alzheimer’s disease especially knowing that there could be 
possible consequences",Genetic engineering
"deontological theory states that we cannot use others to achieve personal 
goals",Genetic engineering
"he has the obligation to give the best possible care to each patient he encounters and to 
make sure that he helps the patient become as healthy as possible",Genetic engineering
"knowing that there are 
possible detrimental consequences of using the crisprcas technology in its current state 
would be violating the commitment he made when he became a physician",Genetic engineering
"kant places a lot of emphasis on the importance of the rational person and how humans 
must be considered rational in order to make the decision of what is right and wrong",Genetic engineering
"around the 
age of  kant allows children moral status because they are then capable of rational

color etc",Genetic engineering

genes could very likely lead to the embryo being born with the desired trait or a trait much more

"this is why it is imperative to set limits on this technology the first being 
what it is used for",Genetic engineering

limited to use for disease control and elimination",Genetic engineering
"it should not be allowed to use this technology

crisprcas system is the most developed engineering technology and that which is closest to 
use on humans it is not nearly perfected to the necessary point of accuracy in which it would 
not cause more harm than good",Genetic engineering

changes or mosaicism are unknown and could possibly cause harm that far outweighs the 
benefit for example how it can cause cancer",Genetic engineering
"the science behind the crisprcas 
technology is still in a developmental stage when considering its use for human embryos",Genetic engineering

conclusion is based on the analysis of multiple trials and case studies that have been performed

iii populations evolve by changes in gene frequency 
brought about by natural selection gene flow and drift 
iv genetic variants generate slight phenotypic effects

continuous v genetic inheritance alone accounts for 
the transmission of selectable variation vi new species

engineering principles
it would seem natural for researchers who claim to embrace the 
explanation that living things look designed because they are 
designed to get out in front of this trend for using engineering 
principles to explain biological functions",Genetic engineering
"for those who believe 
that the bible provides insight into biological function there 
is justification for approaching research from an engineering 
perspective",Genetic engineering

stating that some attributes of god are revealed in nature",Genetic engineering
"both 
texts emphasize that living things manifest “workmanship” nature 
displays features unique to designing agency that humans would 
ascribe to the workmanship of artists or engineers",Genetic engineering
"for instance 
living things are full of systems with multiple parts working 
together for a purpose which are otherwise only found in human
engineered devices",Genetic engineering
"it is this clearlyseen tight correlation between 
the function of living things and humanengineered contrivances 
that strongly indicates that living things were in fact designed 
by an intellect—with engineering prowess far surpassing the 
best human engineers",Genetic engineering
"analysis of romans  prompts a 
profound question related to biological research is there a biblical 
or scientific reason to believe that any biological function will 
be discovered that will operate by different engineering principles 
than those by which humanengineered apparatuses are already 
operating or could be operating",Genetic engineering
"therefore researchers open to 
intelligent causation for living creatures should expect to find an 
everincreasing resemblance of biological function to sophisticated 
engineering",Genetic engineering
"since creatures were commanded to “fill the earth” genesis  
    which was a highly dynamic place after creation 
and the flood designguided biological researchers should begin to 
identify the basic engineering principles governing the operation of 
systems which appear to selfadjust to dynamic external conditions

"it is time to rethink the 
concepts of diversification and adaptation and to develop a 
framework that explains biological function with engineering 
principles one that naturally incorporates the numerous highly 
regulated mechanisms that appear to be incompatible with current 
evolutionary theory
 formalizing a new engineeringbased framework
to begin formalizing rather than just conceptualizing biological 
adaptability within a valid framework of engineering design we 
should consider  objectives  constraints  variables and  
the biological systems corresponding to mathematical equations 
in engineering related to the previous three",Genetic engineering
"incorporating several 
broad observations and reinterpreting them in this light will form 
a new description of what organisms achieve when they adapt ie 
the design objective for what they are doing",Genetic engineering
"organisms are observed to modify their own developmental 
course by continuously monitoring responding to and adjusting 
their internal and external states and these adjustments appear 
to play a significant role in producing novel potentially 
beneficial phenotypic variants bateson ",Genetic engineering
"further there is a 
growing body of evidence that appears to indicate that recently
discovered regulated mechanisms enable organisms to actively 
and continuously track environmental changes",Genetic engineering
"for instance 
organisms appear to quickly respond to significant environmental 
changes—often making surprisingly rapid adaptations—and then 
more gradually adapt to conditions during periods with relatively 
little environmental change reigner ",Genetic engineering
"we posit that organisms are continuously tracking 
environmental changes and responding with suitably selfadjusted 
traits to maintain homeostasis—within their lifetime and cross 
generationally—resulting in adaptation",Genetic engineering
"how might they achieve 
this objective within realistic constraints",Genetic engineering
"a hypothesis
we observe sophisticated human engineering demonstrated in 
automated autonomous robotic drones equipped with exquisite 
detectors logiccentered algorithms and locomotive performance 
to reliably track a target",Genetic engineering
"if the application of engineering design 
objectives constraints and variables for humancreated tracking 
systems can be applied to biological systems then this readily 
offers a testable hypothesis
organisms actively and continuously track environmental variables 
and respond by selfadjusting to changing environments—utilizing 
the engineering principles that constrain how humandesigned 
things adapt to changing conditions—resulting in adaptation",Genetic engineering
"this assumes that fluctuating environmental conditions are 
comparable to the variability of moving targets followed by tracking 
systems",Genetic engineering

understanding diversification and adaptation",Genetic engineering
"scientific activities 
including interpretations of findings take place within a structure

we offer promotes comparing data and observations findings 
of reported biological functions to those of humanengineered

what are the elements of biological systems that should correspond 
to manmade tracking systems",Genetic engineering
"tracking systems are generally 
part of larger robust adaptive control systems",Genetic engineering
"these follow 
the movement of a select “target” within a specified “field of 
view” and elicit response per a predetermined algorithm",Genetic engineering
"these 
“surveillance systems” use one or more sensors coupled to a 
computer system that gather and interpret incoming data about 
uncertain environments",Genetic engineering
"there are three irreducible elements common to all tracking 
systems  sensors to detect prespecified conditions  condition
consequence logic mechanisms that process information by 
specifying if  condition then  consequential output response 
and  output responses which adjust activities to effectively pursue 
a target blackman and popoli  ioannou and sun",Genetic engineering
"if 
navigation or interception at a precise location is desired then a 
chronometer or circadian device to measures time is also an essential 
element",Genetic engineering
"if the cet hypothesis is correct we would expect to find 
biological mechanisms with corresponding irreducible elements 
that are recognizable by the following characteristics
 sensors",Genetic engineering
"the element linking the system to its environment is 
the sensor",Genetic engineering
"fraden a system design specialist highlights the role 
of sensors in initiating data acquisition “a sensor does not function 
by itself it is always a part of a larger system that may incorporate 
many other detectors signal conditioners signal processors 
memory devices data recorders and actuators…a sensor is always 
a part of some kind of a data acquisition system…depending on 
the complexity of the system the total number of sensors may vary 
from as little as one a home thermostat to many thousands a 
space shuttle” fraden  p",Genetic engineering
"understanding three key characteristics of how sensors integrate 
into systems helps illuminate important details of the relationship 
between an entity and exposures",Genetic engineering
"first sensors are exquisitely 
designed to be selective by specifying the environmental conditions 
to which they will be sensitive and insensitive",Genetic engineering
"sensors should 
minimally disturb the condition being monitored so its “true value” 
remains",Genetic engineering
"second a sensor must be ready to collect data by means 
of detecting a condition often by “active surveillance” third 
sensors are an integral part of the system",Genetic engineering
"this relationship may be 
difficult to see since sensors are often remotely located",Genetic engineering
"sophisticated internal logic mechanisms 
are currently being designed as more than basic ifthen types of on
off switches or gates",Genetic engineering
"engineers are patterning logic mechanisms 
in tracking systems after the nervous system in living organisms 
so that they function as artificial neural networks",Genetic engineering
"ioannou  
believes his approach to adaptive control systems “…will be of 
great interest to the neural and fuzzy logic audience who will 
benefit from the strong similarity that exists between adaptive 
systems whose stability properties are well established and neural 
networks fuzzy logic systems where stability and convergence 
issues are yet to be resolved” p xiv",Genetic engineering
"the logical programming 
may be extraordinarily complex and mathematically rigorous to 
process the array of incoming variables especially when multiple 
sensors are tracking multiple moving targets oh et al",Genetic engineering
"advanced logical programming integrates data from multiple 
sensors with preprogrammed ranges to further reduce target
tracking uncertainties by filtering out useless data or “noise” and to 
make determinations on the validity of data prior to specifying an 
output response luo et al",Genetic engineering
"the final step in tracking is to respond to 
target movements",Genetic engineering
"though the response is usually a necessary 
consequence when specific conditions are encountered responses 
can range from a simple discreet onoff action to a continuous 
range produced by an algorithm utilizing input variables",Genetic engineering
"this 
is illustrated in the multiple uses for tracking eye movements 
which range from medical diagnostics refractive surgery human
computer interfaces and commercial marketing gneo et al",Genetic engineering
"responses may be integral to a tracking system itself such as a 
mechanism using stepping motors to keep a solar panel tracking 
the sun’s movement",Genetic engineering
"implications of this hypothesis help clarify biological adaptability
a fundamental design constraint is that the capacities for a designed 
entity to both relate to—and adapt to—external conditions must be 
built entirely into an entity",Genetic engineering
"in terms of external conditions these are 
insufficient to cause changes to an internal system’s function",Genetic engineering
"an 
engineer would identify conditions pertinent to performance and 
may specify some amongst a myriad of conditions as variables 
that are either present or not",Genetic engineering
"the implication of the utilization 
of engineering principles and causation is reflected in the second 
half of our engineeringbased organismfocused characterization 
which keeps the operational spotlight on the organism rather than 
the environment",Genetic engineering

individual elements",Genetic engineering

declared to be causal",Genetic engineering

"it is a very useful technique that enables the use 
of machine learning models in an interdisciplinary setting however it still suffers from 
performance degradation issues due to large complex unstructured unpredictable scalable and 
heterogeneous data characteristics in big data analytics",Machine learning

understood in a big data analytics settings hence it is still questionable whether the automl 
approach will provide desired results with big data analytics framework under interdisciplinary 
settings",Machine learning

learning and bayesian learning and the way these three areas work together as companions 
toward meeting the expectation of interdisciplinary research and applications",Machine learning
"in particular this 
article reviews and reports the research progress in big data analytics and in the efforts made to 
make machine learning much smarter so that the interdisciplinary research can benefit from big 
data analytics techniques and technologies",Machine learning
"big data analytics 
 
the current progress in big data analytics can be appreciated by observing its widespread 
applications in many scientific and nonscientific disciplines",Machine learning
"the recent major conference in the 
discipline—the  ie",Machine learning
"international conference on big data held in boston ma usa on 
december – —incorporated several topics that highlight the trend of big data analytics 
and the interests of research community in the field",Machine learning
"using the compiled conference program and 
the proceedings published in this research forum we can divide the current progress in big data 
analytics into the following focused‐driven research domains 
 
• descriptive big data analytics it addresses the theoretical and design aspects of modeling 
and algorithms of big data analytics and associated big data characteristics 
• predictive big data analytics it focuses on the topics of machine learning that helps the 
study of predictive and classification models and algorithms for big data analytics 
• visual big data analytics it defines the preprocessing and visualization techniques that 
help us understand the big data characteristics through exploration analysis 
• streaming big data analytics it describes the theory and methods required to study 
spatiotemporal characteristics of big data and machine learning models and algorithm 
• graphical big data analytics it helps to study big data environment using graphical 
models and network analysis under machine learning and big data analytics paradigm 
• big data systems and software it addresses the designing and building of big data 
systems and software that focus on efficient resource utilization and big data processing",Machine learning
"although the progress of big data analytics can be grouped into above categories a closer and 
careful understanding of the current research activities in each of these categories suggest that 
the companion field of machine learning contributes significantly to the successful progress of 
big data analytics which include brain network analysis khazaee ebrahimzadeh  babajani‐
feremi  social network analysis cybenko  and ecological network analysis 
stephens sánchez‐cordero  gonzález salazar ",Machine learning
"hence it cannot be separated from big 
data analytics",Machine learning
"in addition bayesian inference is also emerging with big data analytics because 
of the parametrization and optimization requirements of the machine learning models and 
algorithms klein bartels falkner hennig  hutter  shahriari et al ",Machine learning
"the research 
in systems and software also focuses on the optimization of the performance of a computing 
environment hence the parametrization and parallelization of the computing processes and 
resources are explored dean  ghemawat  white ",Machine learning
"the systems and software are 
essentials to house the big data analytics framework hence their progress is first discussed and 
then the research progress in machine learning and bayesian optimization focusing on big data 
analytics is discussed",Machine learning
"systems and software 
 
the current big data systems and software have been developed as a parametric platform using a 
divide‐and‐conquer algorithm so that the distributed resources eg cores memory executors 
and software modules can be parallelized to achieve optimal performance for big data analytics",Machine learning
"it also focuses on providing both local and global ie cloud computing resources as an 
affordable mechanism for different levels of users and applications—an essential feature that is 
required for an interdisciplinary setting",Machine learning

currently available computing platforms such as the hadoop distributed file systems 
mapreduce framework and spark in‐memory computing system that adopt the programming

"these big data processing computing platforms were initially 
developed to perform big data analytics in local computing environment however as the 
research in big data analytics progresses a lack of resources has been realized and the ideas were 
extended to cloud architecture for addressing scalability issues with other big data 
characteristics",Machine learning
"figure  also illustrates some of the latest tools developed for big data systems 
and software bhatt patwa  sandhu  komarek pavlik  sobeslav  
 
 parallelization 
 
the aforementioned parametrization techniques enable the parallelization of computing 
resources with automated resource allocation and utilization",Machine learning
"a simple example of systems and 
software parametrization and parallelization can be found in chapter  of book by the author 
suthaharan ",Machine learning
"in the current big data system this parallelization is not transparent and it 
performs optimal resource allocation and utilization automatically",Machine learning
"however in some situations 
it is important for the users to set the system parameters such as the number of cores executors 
and memory size",Machine learning
"therefore the progress in this domain has also shifted to allow user 
intervention and suggest some mechanism to select a correct combination of system parameters 
sundaravarathan martin rope mcroberts  statchuk ",Machine learning
"machine learning 
 
the initial progress in machine learning has defined the standard methodological processes that 
include the development of parametric models and development of algorithms that help optimize 
the model parameters using training validation and testing processes and given labeled data",Machine learning
"these methodological processes may be grouped into two categories interpretable knowledge 
discovery suthaharan  and actionable knowledge discovery cao ",Machine learning
"additionally the 
machine learning models are defined using two types of parameters namely hyperparameters 
and learned‐parameters",Machine learning
"the hyperparameter values must be selected at the beginning of the 
training process—requires some expertise in the research domain—and the learned‐parameters 
are optimized by machine learning algorithms 
 
 parametrization 
 
to date the machine learning models are parametrized in three groups mathematical 
hierarchical and layered models",Machine learning
"the mathematical models include the models developed using 
the concept of support vectors and statistical regression—examples are support vector machine 
logistic regression and lasso regression",Machine learning
"the hierarchical models include the models developed 
based on the concept of decision tree—examples are random forest models",Machine learning
"the layered models 
include the models proposed based on the concept of neural networks—examples include deep 
learning models",Machine learning
the first two types of approaches have been proposed to address batch learning,Machine learning
"later a need for on‐line learning ie learning from a single point was realized for big data 
analytics hence the layered models have been proposed 
 
 optimization 
 
the optimization has been performed in a conventional manner targeting the extraction of exact 
and complete knowledge from data hence strong mathematical techniques have been deployed 
to optimize model parameters",Machine learning
"these approaches are based on the concepts of gradient descent or 
stochastic gradient descent luketina berglund greff  raiko ",Machine learning
"however the latest 
trend is in the use of bayesian optimization—a probabilistic approach—to address the problems 
and challenges evolve from the big data characteristics such as data heterogeneity 
unpredictability and scalability shahriari et al  wainer  cawley  when the 
optimization of model parameters is the main objective",Machine learning
"smart machine learning 
 
as deep learning technique progresses—of course",Machine learning
"as a promising solution to solve big data 
analytics problems—researchers have been trying to make machine learning techniques more 
intelligent as possible to meet the requirements of interdisciplinary research and applications",Machine learning
"hence the expected features of machine learning techniques are currently divided into three 
groups automatic adaptive and cognitive features",Machine learning
"as a result the current trend in big data 
analytics focuses on three types of machine learning—automl adaptive machine learning and 
cognitive machine learning",Machine learning
"in essence bayesian learning bayesian optimization and related 
approaches can help us develop smart machine learning 
 
 bayesian learning 
 
the bayesian learning which includes bayesian optimization and bayesian mixture models is 
especially adopted to optimize hyperparameters because of its ability to defend the difficulties 
that come from the big data characteristics using probabilistic approaches",Machine learning
"some of the latest 
progress in the integration of bayesian optimization in big data analytics and machine learning 
are the techniques proposed in polson  sokolov  shahriari et al  and snoek 
larochelle  adams ",Machine learning
"these approaches replace mathematical optimization with 
probabilistic optimization—a preferable approach for big data settings 
 
 bayesian mixture model and machine learning 
 
the bayesian mixture models assume data heterogeneity and represent a data domain in action 
as a composition of multiple sub domains or clusters with finite or infinite number of mixture 
distributions tafaj kasneci rosenstiel  bogdan ",Machine learning
"an example of its implementation in 
software systems for a big data environment is that the master node in a data sharing network can 
distribute these sub domains to worker nodes by associating them with general prior distributions 
and then the worker nodes process them and generate corresponding posterior distributions to 
specify hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms such as the kernel and regularization 
parameters in support vector machine svm klein et al  and weights and learning‐rate 
parameters in deep learning suthaharan  
 
 automated machine learning 
 
a machine learning technique can be claimed to be truly automatic only if every step of the 
machine learning technique is automated such that it can minimize the problems of 
interdisciplinary applications",Machine learning
"the research in automl for big data analytics is still in progress 
and it includes the research work reported in feurer et al  and luo ",Machine learning
"the current 
approaches mainly focus on the optimization of hyperparameters and the selection of models and 
algorithms to create suitable automl approaches that can be adopted by any types of users of 
interdisciplinary applications",Machine learning
"one aspect of an automl is the optimization of hyperparameters such as the regularization 
parameter in lasso regression suthaharan  kernel and regularization parameters in svm 
nguyen gupta rana  venkatesh  wainer  cawley  and learning rate in deep 
learning",Machine learning
this objective requires efficient learning models and algorithms,Machine learning
"the current research 
progress in this area shows a significant interest and an appropriate use of computational 
techniques based on bayesian klein et al  and radial basis function ilievski akhtar 
feng  shoemaker ",Machine learning
"another aspect of an automl is the automatic selection of models and algorithms for 
optimization and learning",Machine learning
"as we know the hyperparameter selection requires the automatic 
selection of suitable models and algorithms from a large pool of models and algorithms for 
optimization with respect to a given data set",Machine learning
"however in big data analytics environment this 
selection process is problematic and very challenging because of the data characteristics that 
include complexity scalability and heterogeneity",Machine learning
"a significant research has been performed—
including thornton et al  and sparks et al —in this problem space however the 
research is still progressing because of the emerging problems and challenges that evolve from 
the interdisciplinary nature of big data analytics 
 
 adaptive machine learning 
 
the adaptive machine learning is not new and it also includes automl concept",Machine learning
"the concept of 
adaptive machine learning can be dated back to s blum  littlestone  
warmuth  as stated in the paper torabi sayad  balke ",Machine learning
"today it can be 
observed that the big data characteristics and the current widespread interdisciplinary 
applications have enforced new constraints and requirements that triggered the exploration of 
novel approaches for adaptive machine learning",Machine learning
"one aspect of adaptive machine learning is the selection and optimization of the learned model 
parameters with respect to changing data characteristics between interdisciplinary domains",Machine learning
"the 
examples include the techniques published in anagnostopoulos anagnostopoulos  
hadjiefthymiades  and azodi gawron sapegin cheng  meinel ",Machine learning
"in other words 
we can say that the progress in adaptive machine learning focuses on learning techniques that are 
adaptive to unseen data",Machine learning
"another aspect of adaptive machine learning is the revision of machine 
learning models and algorithms with a minimum effort to work with changing data 
characteristics between interdisciplinary domains",Machine learning
"for example in a recent paper the authors 
have proposed a learning‐based approach that generates an adaptive best‐fit algorithm from a set 
of supervised learning algorithms to detect silent errors that occur in a high‐performance 
computing environment subasi et al ",Machine learning
"they described the silent errors as silent data 
corruption in high performance computing systems and these errors corrupt the execution results 
with no warning and undetectable by hardware or software 
 
 cognitive machine learning 
 
cognitive machine learning is an emerging field and it includes both the adaptive and automl 
concepts",Machine learning
"in big data analytics the use of exact or complete knowledge for making decisions is 
impractical because of the big data characteristics that include data heterogeneity 
unpredictability and scalability",Machine learning
"hence the machine learning research community has realized 
the need for developing techniques and technologies that mimic the cognitive processes that the 
humans use to solve complex environmental problems and make decisions through 
approximation hypothesis and reasoning",Machine learning
"hence computational intelligence and cognitive 
computing have been studied in recent years by focusing on machine learning and big data 
analytics suthaharan  wang et al  
 
 intelligent computing computational intelligence 
 
the intelligent computing or computational intelligence is another concept that has been 
integrated in big data analytics to help computers learn from data in the similar way that the 
human brain learns from data modha et al ",Machine learning
"this concept includes the techniques such as 
the fuzzy sets genetic algorithms and neural networks–the latest book chapter by samanpour 
ruegenberg and ahlers  discusses clearly about the integration of these evolutionary 
algorithms with machine learning especially in the interdisciplinary domain 
 
 cognitive computing 
 
this research focuses on resource‐efficient cost‐effective and cognition‐enabled computing 
platforms for big data analytics suthaharan ",Machine learning
"in this computing platform cognition‐enable 
means the availability of methodologies and techniques that mimic human cognitive process that 
utilize object‐recognition speech‐recognition and functional brain networks machine learning 
reasoning and analysis to make cognitive decisions",Machine learning
"similarly the cost‐effective feature 
includes computational cost as well as affordable systems and software that support 
interdisciplinary settings",Machine learning
"finally resource‐efficient feature includes the automated resource 
allocation and resource utilization with no transparency to users—it is especially useful to 
nonexpert users of the learning models hurwitz kaufman  bowles  
 
 smart deep learning 
 
a literature review suggests that machine learning for big data analytics is converging to deep 
learning techniques",Machine learning
"for example based on the proceedings of the  international conference 
on machine learning held in sydney australia on august –  we can clearly see that 
the research interest of the machine learning community has shifted toward deep learning 
significantly",Machine learning
"the deep learning compared to other machine learning techniques focuses on 
single‐data‐point analysis ie it enables both on‐line learning and batch learning which is a 
highly preferred option for a big data analytics framework",Machine learning
"hence it is expected in the current 
research of big data analytics that the deep learning will be studied focusing on automated 
adaptive and cognitive approaches to create smart deep learning",Machine learning
"conclusions 
 
the progress of research in big data analytics and machine learning was reviewed and 
understood in three phases past present and future",Machine learning
"in phase  a significant amount of research 
has been done on data analytics and machine learning by defining data‐driven approaches",Machine learning
"in 
other words the focus of research in phase  was mainly on interpretable knowledge 
discovery theme ie the development of models and algorithms that enhance the discovery of 
interpretable knowledge from a given set of data",Machine learning
"in essence the data‐driven approaches 
focused on the discovery of patterns that help understand the source that produced the data",Machine learning
"in phase  the focus of data analytics research shifted to big data analytics based on the 
redefinition of data that describe big data characteristics",Machine learning
"hence the research has started to shift 
toward domain‐driven approaches which of course included data‐driven approaches",Machine learning
"in other 
words the focus of the research in phase  was on actionable knowledge discovery theme",Machine learning
"the 
actionable knowledge discovery defines the practical significance of the knowledge discovered 
from data through domain‐driven data mining",Machine learning
"hence it defines the flow of knowledge from 
data‐driven approaches to domain‐driven interdisciplinary applications",Machine learning
"it is now well understood that big data analytics research spans across multiple disciplines where 
automl models and algorithms are required to solve problems without the help of data science 
experts",Machine learning
"hence as we have seen the selection and optimization of hyperparameters became a 
very strong research component among machine learning or artificial intelligence and data 
science research community",Machine learning
"a significant research still has to be done on hyperparameter 
selection and optimization using bayesian optimization to develop automl approaches that are 
useful for interdisciplinary big data analytics",Machine learning
"in phase  over the next two decades a significant research is expected on fullautoml 
approaches toward achieving smart machine learning techniques that are fully automated 
adaptive and cognitive under big data characteristics",Machine learning
"however to advance this research it is 
important to study approaches that help discover patterns that are sensitive to changes between 
interdisciplinary domains",Machine learning
"hence the progress reported in this paper suggests an establishment 
of a new research theme—transformative knowledge discovery",Machine learning
"it means that when a learning 
model is developed for a big data environment big data domain or a discipline it is important 
to discover the knowledge that can cause a noticeable change to the model in addition to 
discovering the knowledge that is interpretable and actionable",Machine learning
"this knowledge will help the 
model to become adaptive to a new environment",Machine learning
"hence when a learning model is built for a 
data domain it is important to study all the potential alternatives which include both the real and 
hypothetical alternatives",Machine learning
"the discovery of transformative knowledge from big data can significantly benefit from 
bayesian learning including bayesian optimization and bayesian mixture models",Machine learning
"in other 
words we need to define a new research discipline called transformative data science and 
analytics or transformative data science and big data or transformative big data 
analytics that study bayesian optimization approaches and bayesian mixture models 
extensively",Machine learning

designed the program",Machine learning
"remarkably a computer could be trained to 
do this in eight to ten hours of playing time over sixty years ago 
using machine learning",Machine learning

after analyzing the base data using the training dataset the 
programmer can make algorithmic tweaks or changes to the 
training data to right the course",Machine learning
"in supervised machine learning all 
of the data within a training data set is “labeled” or assigned a 
value which allows the machine to easily compare analysis data 
against the training set baseline",Machine learning
"the algorithm generates 
information based on its analysis of the training data and uses that 
information to produce inferred or revised functions",Machine learning

said it allowed her more time to figure out what her students actually understood and where 
they were having difficulties",Machine learning
"by so doing it helped her know which areas needed much atten

"she recounted that teaching a class of  students can some
times be difficult to know who understood well who needed extra attention on a specific topic 
and what learning model suited a specific group of students",Machine learning

this connection and other approaches to parallel learning are discussed in section ,Machine learning
"from radon points to radon machines
the radon machine described in algorithm  first executes the underlying base learning algo
rithm on random subsets of the data to quickly achieve weak hypotheses and then iteratively aggre
gates them to stronger ones",Machine learning
"both the generation of weak hypotheses and the aggregation can be
executed in parallel",Machine learning
"to aggregate hypotheses we follow along the lines of the iterated radon point
algorithm which was originally devised to approximate the centre point ie a point of largest tukey
depth  of a finite set of points ",Machine learning
"the radon point  of a set of points is defined as follows
definition ",Machine learning
"a radon partition of a set s ⊂ f is a pair ab ⊂ s such that a ∩ b  ∅ but
〈a〉 ∩ 〈b〉  ∅ where 〈·〉 denotes the convex hull",Machine learning
"the radon number of a space f is the smallest
r ∈ n such that for all s ⊂ f with s ≥ r there is a radon partition or ∞ if no s ⊂ f with
radon partition exists",Machine learning
a radon point of a set s with radon partition ab is any r ∈ 〈a〉 ∩ 〈b〉,Machine learning
"we now present the radon machine algorithm  which is able to effectively parallelise consistent
and efficient learning algorithms",Machine learning
"input to this parallelisation scheme is a learning algorithm l on
a hypothesis space f  a dataset d ⊆ x × y  the radon number r ∈ n of the hypothesis space
f  and a parameter h ∈ n it divides the dataset into rh subsets d ",Machine learning
"   drh line  and runs the
algorithm l on each subset in parallel line ",Machine learning
"then the set of hypotheses line  is iteratively
aggregated to form better sets of hypotheses line ",Machine learning
"for that the set is partitioned into subsets of
size r line  and the radon point of each subset is calculated in parallel line ",Machine learning
"the final step of
each iteration is to replace the set of hypotheses by the set of radon points line ",Machine learning
the scheme requires a hypothesis space with a valid notion of convexity and finite radon number,Machine learning
"while other notions of convexity are possible   in this paper we restrict our consideration to
euclidean spaces with the usual notion of convexity",Machine learning
"radon’s theorem  states that the euclidean
space rd has radon number r  d  ",Machine learning
"radon points can then be obtained by solving a system
of linear equations of size r × r to be fully selfcontained we state the system of linear equations
explicitly in appendix c",Machine learning
"the next proposition gives a guarantee on the quality of radon points
proposition ",Machine learning
"given a probability measure p over a hypothesis space f with finite radon number
r let f denote a random variable with distribution p  furthermore let r be the random variable
obtained by computing the radon point of r random points drawn according to p r then it holds
for the expected regret q and all ε ∈ r that
p q r  ε ≤ rp q f   ε ",Machine learning
the proof of proposition  is provided in section ,Machine learning
"note that this proof also shows the robustness
of the radon point compared to the average if only one of r points is εbad the radon point is
still εgood while the average may or may not be indeed in a linear space with any set of εgood
hypotheses and any ε′ ≥ ε we can always find a single ε′bad hypothesis such that the average of
all these hypotheses is ε′bad",Machine learning
"a direct consequence of proposition  is a bound on the probability that the output of the radon
machine with parameter h is bad
theorem ",Machine learning
"given a probability measure p over a hypothesis space f with finite radon number r
let f denote a random variable with distribution p  denote by r the random variable obtained by
computing the radon point of r random points drawn iid according to p and by p its distribution",Machine learning
"for any h ∈ n let rh denote the radon point of r random points drawn iid from ph− and by ph its
distribution",Machine learning
"then for any convex function q  f → r and all ε ∈ r it holds that

the proof of theorem  is also provided in section ",Machine learning
"for the radon machine with parameter
h theorem  shows that the probability of obtaining an εbad hypothesis is doubly exponentially
reduced with a bound δ on this probability for the base learning algorithm the bound ∆ on this
probability for the radon machine is
∆  rδ

in the next section we compare the radon machine to its base learning algorithm which is applied
to a dataset of the size necessary to achieve the same ε and ∆",Machine learning
"sample and runtime complexity
in this section we first derive the sample and runtime complexity of the radon machine r from
the sample and runtime complexity of the base learning algorithm l we then relate the runtime
complexity of the radon machine to an application of the base learning algorithm which achieves
the same ε∆guarantee",Machine learning
"for that we consider consistent and efficient base learning algorithms
with a sample complexity of the form nl ε δ  αε  βε ld δ

for base learning algorithms l with runtime tln polynomial in the data size n ∈ n ie
tln ∈ o nκ with κ ∈ n we now determine the runtime trhn of the radon machine with
h iterations and c  rh processing units on n ∈ n samples",Machine learning
"in this case all base learning algo
rithms can be executed in parallel",Machine learning
"in practical applications fewer physical processors can be used
to simulate rh processing units—we discuss this case in section ",Machine learning
"the runtime of the radon machine can be decomposed into the runtime of the base learning al
gorithm and the runtime for the aggregation",Machine learning
"the base learning algorithm requires n ≥ nl ε δ
samples and can be executed on rh processors in parallel in time tln",Machine learning
"the radon point in each of
the h iterations can then be calculated in parallel in time r see appendix c",Machine learning
"thus the runtime
of the radon machine with n  rhn samples is
trhn  tl n  hr ",Machine learning
"
in contrast the runtime of the base learning algorithm for achieving the same guarantee is
tlm with m ≥ nl ε∆",Machine learning
"ignoring logarithmic and constant terms nl ε∆ behaves as
hnl ε δ",Machine learning
"to obtain polylogarithmic runtime of r compared to tlm we choose the parame
ter h ≈ ldm − ld ldm such that n ≈ mh  ldm ",Machine learning
"thus the runtime of the radon machine is in
o ldκm  r ldm",Machine learning
this result is formally summarised in theorem ,Machine learning
"the radon machine with a consistent and efficient regularised risk minimisation al
gorithm on a hypothesis space with finite radon number has polylogarithmic runtime on quasi
polynomially many processing units if the radon number can be upper bounded by a function poly
logarithmic in the sample complexity of the efficient regularised risk minimisation algorithm",Machine learning
"the theorem is proven in appendix a and relates to nick’s class  a decision problem can
be solved efficiently in parallel in the sense of nick’s class if it can be decided by an algorithm
in polylogarithmic time on polynomially many processors assuming eg pram model",Machine learning
"for the
class of decision problems that are the hardest in p  ie for p complete problems it is believed
that there is no efficient parallel algorithm for solving them in this sense",Machine learning
"theorem  provides a
step towards finding efficient parallelisations of regularised risk minimisers and towards answering
the open question is consistent regularised risk minimisation possible in polylogarithmic time on
polynomially many processors",Machine learning
"a similar question for the case of learning half spaces has been
called a fundamental open problem by long and servedio  who gave an algorithms which runs
on polynomially many processors in time that depends polylogarithmically on the sample size but
is inversely proportional to a parameter of the learning problem",Machine learning
"while nick’s class as a notion of
efficiency has been criticised  it is the only notion of efficiency that forms a proper complexity
class in the sense of blum ",Machine learning
to overcome the weakness of using only this notion kruskal et al,Machine learning
" suggested to consider also the inefficiency of simulating the parallel algorithm on a single

tailed in figure ",Machine learning

with    instances and  features
the radon machine on  processors with
h   is  times faster than its base learn

the roc curve auc on an independent test
dataset are comparable",Machine learning
"how does the scheme compare to averaging
attheend",Machine learning
"in figure b we compare the
runtime and auc of the parallelisation scheme
against the averagingattheend baseline avg",Machine learning
"in terms of the auc the radon machine out
performs the averagingattheend baseline on
all datasets by at least ",Machine learning
"the runtimes can
hardly be distinguished in that figure",Machine learning
"a small
difference can however be noted in figure 
which is discussed in more details in the next
paragraph",Machine learning
"since averaging is less computa
tionally expensive than calculating the radon
point the runtimes of the averagingattheend
baselines are slightly lower than the ones of
the radon machine",Machine learning
"however compared to the
computational complexity of executing the base
learner this advantage becomes negligible",Machine learning
how does our scheme compare to stateoftheart spark machine learning algorithms,Machine learning
"we
compare the radon machine to various spark machine learning algorithms on  large datasets",Machine learning
"the
results in figure c indicate that the proposed parallelisation scheme with h  max has a substan
tially smaller runtime than the spark algorithms on all datasets",Machine learning
"on the susy and higgs dataset
the radon machine is one order of magnitude faster than the spark implementations—here the com
paratively small number of features allows for a high level of parallelism",Machine learning
"on the casp dataset
the radon machine is  faster than the fastest spark algorithm",Machine learning
"the performance in terms of auc
of the radon machine is similar to the spark algorithms",Machine learning
"in particular when using wekalogreg
with h  max the radon machine outperforms the spark algorithms in terms of auc and runtime
on the datasets susy wikidata and casp",Machine learning
"details are given in the appendix b a summarizing
comparison of the parallel approaches in terms of their tradeoff between runtime and predictive
performance is depicted in figure ",Machine learning
"here results are shown for the radon machine and averaging
attheend with parameter h  max and for the two spark algorithms most similar to the base

learning algorithms",Machine learning
"note that it is unclear what caused the consistently weak performance of all
algorithms on wikidata",Machine learning
"nonetheless the results show that on all datasets the radon machine has
comparable predictive performance to the spark algorithms and substantially higher predictive per
formance than averagingattheend",Machine learning
"at the same time the radon machine has a runtime comparable
to averagingattheend on all datasets and both are substantially faster than the spark algorithms",Machine learning
how does the runtime depend on the dataset size in a realworld system,Machine learning
"the runtime of
the radon machine can be distinguished into its learning phase and its aggregation phase",Machine learning
"while
the learning phase fully benefits from parallelisation this comes at the cost of additional runtime for
the aggregation phase",Machine learning
"the time for aggregating the hypotheses does not depend on the number of
instances in the dataset but for a fixed parameter h it only depends on the dimension of the hypothesis
space and that parameter",Machine learning
"in figure  we compare the runtimes of all base learning algorithms per
dataset size to the radon machines",Machine learning
"results indicate that while the runtimes of the base learning
algorithms depends on the dataset size with an average exponent of  the runtime of the radon
machine depends on the dataset size with an exponent of only 
how generally applicable is the scheme",Machine learning
"as an indication of the general applicability in practice
we also consider regression and multiclass classification",Machine learning
"for regression we apply the scheme to
the scikitlearn implementation of regularised least squares regression ",Machine learning
"on the dataset yearpre
dictionmsd regularised least squares regression achieves an rmse of  whereas the radon
machine achieved an rmse of  at the same time the radon machine is times faster",Machine learning
"we
also compare the radon machine on a multiclass prediction problem using conditional maximum
entropy models",Machine learning
"for multiclass classification we use the implementation described in mcdonald
et al",Machine learning
 who propose to use averagingattheend for distributed training,Machine learning
"we compare the radon
machine to averagingattheend with conditional maximum entropy models on two large multi
class datasets drift and spokenarabicdigit",Machine learning
"on average our scheme performs better with only
slightly longer runtime",Machine learning
"the minimal difference in runtime can be explained—similar to the results
in figure b—by the smaller complexity of calculating the average instead of the radon point",Machine learning
"discussion and future work
in the experiments we considered datasets where the number of dimensions is much smaller than
the number of instances",Machine learning
what about highdimensional models,Machine learning
"the basic version of the paral
lelisation scheme presented in this paper cannot directly be applied to cases in which the size of the
dataset is not at least a multiple of the radon number of the hypothesis space",Machine learning
"for various types of
data such as text this might cause concerns",Machine learning
"however random projections  or lowrank approx
imations   can alleviate this problem and are already frequently employed in machine learning",Machine learning
an alternative might be to combine our parallelisation scheme with block coordinate descent ,Machine learning
in this case the scheme can be applied iteratively to subsets of the features,Machine learning
in the experiments we considered only linear models,Machine learning
"learning
nonlinear models causes similar problems to learning highdimensional ones",Machine learning
"in nonparametric
methods like kernel methods for instance the dimensionality of the optimisation problem is equal
to the number of instances thus prohibiting the application of our parallelisation scheme",Machine learning
"how
ever similar lowrank approximation techniques as described above can be applied with nonlinear
kernels ",Machine learning
"furthermore methods for speeding up the learning process for nonlinear models ex
plicitly approximate an embedding in which then a linear model can be learned ",Machine learning
"using explicitly
constructed feature spaces radon machines can directly be applied to nonlinear models",Machine learning
"we have theoretically analysed our parallelisation scheme for the case that there are enough process
ing units available to find each weak hypothesis on a separate processing units",Machine learning
"what if there are
not rh but only c  rh processing units",Machine learning
"the parallelisation scheme can quite naturally be “de
parallelised” and partially executed in sequence",Machine learning
"for the runtime this implies an additional factor of
max rhc",Machine learning
thus the radon machine can be applied with any number of processing units,Machine learning
"the scheme improves ∆ doubly exponentially in its parameter h but for that it requires the weak hy
potheses to already achieve δ ≤ r",Machine learning
is the scheme only applicable in highconfidence domains,Machine learning
"many application scenarios require highconfidence error bounds eg in the medical domain 
or in intrusion detection ",Machine learning
"in practice our scheme achieves similar predictive quality much faster
than its base learner",Machine learning
besides runtime communication plays an essential role in parallel learning,Machine learning
"what is the commu
nication complexity of the scheme",Machine learning
"as for all aggregation at the end strategies the overall amount
of communication is low compared to periodically communicating schemes",Machine learning
"for the parallel aggre
gation of hypotheses the scheme requires orh messages which can be sent in parallel each
containing a single hypothesis of size or",Machine learning
"our scheme is ideally suited for inherently distributed
data and might even mitigate privacy concerns",Machine learning
in a lot of applications data is available in the form of potentially infinite data streams,Machine learning
"can the
scheme be applied to distributed data streams",Machine learning
"for each data stream a hypotheses could be
maintained using an online learning algorithm and periodically aggregated using the radon machine
similar to the federated learning approach proposed by mcmahan et al",Machine learning
in this paper we investigated the parallelisation of machine learning algorithms,Machine learning
"is the radon
machine more generally applicable",Machine learning
"the parallelisation scheme could be applied to more general
randomized convex optimization algorithms with unknown and random target functions",Machine learning
"we will
investigate its applicability for learning in noneuclidean abstract convexity spaces",Machine learning
"conclusion and related work
in this paper we provided a step towards answering an open problem is parallel machine learn
ing possible in polylogarithmic time using a polynomial number of processors only",Machine learning
"this question
has been posed for halfspaces by long and servedio  and called “a fundamental open prob
lem about the abilities and limitations of efficient parallel learning algorithms”",Machine learning
"it relates machine
learning to nick’s class of parallelisable decision problems and its variants ",Machine learning
"early theoretical
treatments of parallel learning with respect to nc considered probably approximately correct pac
  concept learning",Machine learning
"vitter and lin  introduced the notion of nclearnable for concept
classes for which there is an algorithm that outputs a probably approximately correct hypothesis in
polylogarithmic time using a polynomial number of processors",Machine learning
"in this setting they proved positive
and negative learnability results for a number of concept classes that were previously known to be
paclearnable in polynomial time",Machine learning
"more recently the special case of learning half spaces in par
allel was considered by long and servedio  who gave an algorithm for this case that runs on
polynomially many processors in time that depends polylogarithmically on the size of the instances
but is inversely proportional to a parameter of the learning problem",Machine learning
"our paper complements these
theoretical treatments of parallel machine learning and provides a provably effective parallelisation
scheme for a broad class of regularised risk minimisation algorithms",Machine learning
"some parallelisation schemes also train learning algorithms on small chunks of data and average the
found hypotheses",Machine learning
"while this approach has advantages   current error bounds do not allow
a derivation of polylogarithmic runtime    and it has been doubted to have any benefit
over learning on a single chunk ",Machine learning
"another popular class of parallel learning algorithms is based
on stochastic gradient descent targeting expected risk minimisation directly  and",Machine learning
"supervisedlearning models  and decision
reinforcement learning models  can be used for perception
and planning and conventional control theory can be used
for control respectively",Machine learning

each subsystem including those incorporatingmachinelearning

"as a result qa of subsystems that do not usemachine
learning models can be performed through conventional
methods with minimal change in the development process",Machine learning

planning with a deep qnetwork ",Machine learning

"we consider that the most relevant technical
area for qa at the subsystems level is software engineering",Machine learning
"subsystems are the intermediate layer between the deduc

safetycritical properties of systems should be managed at
the subsystem level and handed to the machinelearning

"open problems of machine
learning models
a machinelearning model is acquired by executing a train
ing algorithm training with a model structure and training
data sets as inputs",Machine learning
"a machinelearning model before deter
mining the parameters by training is called a model structure
in this paper",Machine learning
"trained machine models are evaluated using
test datasets ",Machine learning
"the open problems in this paragraph are to
deductively design the requirements of the machine learning
models and their test data as the final step manual engineer
ing in machinelearning systems",Machine learning
"requirement in machine learning we consider that the
roles of training data and test data are different",Machine learning
"while the
training data is used for improving the performance of the
machinelearning model the test data should be used to ac
curately reflect the environmental conditions in operation",Machine learning
"for example when all the data obtained at the time of de
velopment are randomly divided some of them are used as
training data and the others are test data",Machine learning
"in this way the
training data and the test data are approximately equally
distributed but the relationship to the operational data is
unknown",Machine learning
"particularly in a safetycritical machinelearning
system it is necessary to design the test data distribution
considering the operational environment in which the sys
tem will actually be operated in the future and to collect test
data based on the designed data distribution",Machine learning
"in this way by
accepting an apriori viewpoint of the test data distribution
we can deductively define the assumed environment and
inductively collect data based on the requirements of the
overlaid subsystem",Machine learning
"moreover by assuming the distribution
of the test data we can now discuss their distribution and
define the operation domain with concrete design informa

"even in the current development of invehicle automated
driving systems the test data would be collected assuming
the operational environment in order to make the distri
bution at the time of operation and the distribution of the
test data as consistent as possible",Machine learning
"however the methods of
describing the assumed environment of machinelearning
models are not organized",Machine learning
"in particular we need methods to
describe the properties of the test data",Machine learning
"furthermore since
the required performance may change depending on the
assumed environment it is necessary to express the associ
ation between the assumed environment and the required
performance",Machine learning
"test data should have attributes such as time
and weather and their distributions which are based on
the assumed environment",Machine learning
"each condition of the test data
distribution should have a confusion matrix which machine
learning models will have them as desired value table ",Machine learning
"in table  the confusion matrix accuracy is shown as a
requirement of the machinelearning model but there are
other quality characteristics of machinelearningmodels that
should be investigated",Machine learning
"in order to use machinelearning
models in safetycritical systems it is necessary to define
and evaluate models by the performance indicators from
various perspectives besides accuracy",Machine learning
"if we refer to the soft

"design a machinelearning model is automatically ob
tained by training the model structure using the training
data",Machine learning
thus specifications cannot be designed a priori,Machine learning
"this
limitation is essential because highperformance machine
learning models are realized by learning highdimensional
parameters from data that engineers cannotmanually specify",Machine learning
"however in the development of a safetycritical machine
learning system at a minimum it is necessary to record
the model structure the training data and the training sys

and quantify robustness by maximizing the ae to which the

depending on imagerecognition technology",Machine learning
"study on ae is
important not only for defending intentional attacks such as
false traffic signs but also for understanding the formation of
decision boundaries of machine learning model and realizing
highly robust recognition functions",Machine learning
"inference processes of advanced machine learning models
such as neural networks nn are considered black boxes",Machine learning
"in particular safetycritical systems should exhibit inter
pretability and transparency",Machine learning
"in this context a black box
refers to a situation where although feature activations can
be observed physically the actual phenomenon cannot be
understood",Machine learning
"regarding interpretability nn visualization 
shows great promise",Machine learning
"in nn visualization one method in
tentionally performs occlusion on input data and specifies
the region where the inference result changes drastically
as a region of interest another method backpropagates ac

"in  in a paper published in nature  researchers of new york 
university have presented a major step in building a robust controllable machine from 
dna by demonstrating a robust sequencedependent rotary dna device operating in a 
fourstep cycle",Nanotechnology
"the authors yan et al  show that dna strands control and fuel 
this device cycle by inducing the interconversion between two robust topological motifs 
paranemic crossover px dna and its topoisomer jx dna in which one strand end is 
rotated relative to the other by °",Nanotechnology
"the authors say that they expect that a wide range of 
analogous yet distinct rotary devices can be created by changing the control strands and 
the device sequences to which they bind",Nanotechnology
"constructed from synthetic dna molecules the device improves upon 
previously developed nanoscale dna devices",Nanotechnology
"the researchers say that the new device 
may help to build the foundation for the development of sophisticated machines at a 
molecular scale ultimately evolving to the development of nanorobots that might 
someday build new molecules computer circuits or fight infectious diseases see yan et 
al ",Nanotechnology
"controlled mechanical movement in molecularscale devices has been 
realized in a variety of systems by exploiting conformational changes triggered by 
changes in redox potential or temperature reversible binding of small molecules or ions 
or irradiation",Nanotechnology
"“the incorporation of such devices into arrays could in principle lead to 
complex structural states suitable for nanorobotic applications provided that individual 
devices can be addressed separately",Nanotechnology
"but because the triggers commonly used tend to act 
equally on all the devices that are present they will need to be localized very tightly",Nanotechnology
"this 
could be readily achieved with devices that are controlled individually by separate and 
devicespecific reagents",Nanotechnology
"a trigger mechanism that allows such specific control is the 
reversible binding of dna strands thereby fuelling conformational changes in a dna 
machine” yan et al ",Nanotechnology
"this new robust sequencedependent rotary dna device operating in a four
step cycle represents an improvement upon the initial prototype system that used this 
mechanism but generated byproducts",Nanotechnology
"that initial prototype system was announced in 
 by prof seeman that consisted in a machine constructed from dna molecules 
which had two rigid arms that could rotated from fixed positions by adding a chemical to 
the solution",Nanotechnology
"the problem was that this chemical affected all molecules within a structure 
uniformly",Nanotechnology
"a big advance now is the fact that the movement can be manipulated within 
molecule pairs without affecting others within a larger structure what is got by inserting 
dna set and fuel strands into individual molecule pairs",Nanotechnology
"in biological research particularly in the area of molecular biology and working 
nucleic acid molecules many other achievements have been recently made",Nanotechnology
"moreover 
  
many progresses have been made in the area of molecular biology applications",Nanotechnology
"in this 
field many techniques have been successfully implemented in many scientific fields 
such as in the diagnostics area or in biology biotechnology or medical science",Nanotechnology
"for 
example “the introduction of polymerase chain reaction pcr resulted in improving old 
and designing new laboratory devices for pcr amplification and analysis of amplified 
dna fragments",Nanotechnology
"in parallel to these efforts the nature of dna molecules and their 
construction have attracted many researchers",Nanotechnology
"in addition some studies concerning 
mimicking living systems as well as developing and constructing artificial nanodevices 
such as biomolecular sensors and artificial cells have been conducted” kubik et al 
",Nanotechnology
"in this century the development of ribonucleic acid rna and 
deoxyribonucleic acid dna diagnostics are being made considering a large set of 
approaches using new techniques and technologies many of them associated to dna 
developments being particularly supported by nanotechnology solutions which have 
been already successfully introduced",Nanotechnology
"these achievements take part in the fundamental 
development of many areas of diagnostics and science including the health care 
medicine or pharmaceutical industry kubik et al ",Nanotechnology

reality",Nanotechnology
"it can be noted for example in the particular case of the production of electric 
energy through the photovoltaic panels use",Nanotechnology
"the emphasis is placed on the competitive 
advantage associated to the use of nanotechnology versus the solar energy production for 
companies in this market segment",Nanotechnology
"the american firm nanosolar which studies are sponsored by major 
companies like google or ibm or resulting from the allocation of benefits offered by the 
department of energy is leading the competition for energy production resulting from 
nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
the company has named this technology as nanophotovoltaic panels,Nanotechnology
"the photovoltaic solar energy is obtained converting light into electricity the 
socalled photovoltaic effect see becquerel ",Nanotechnology
"the photovoltaic cell works when light reaches the photovoltaic panel 
exciting energetically electrons making them circulate freely from atom to atom forming 
the electric current",Nanotechnology
the photovoltaic cell is a practical application of photoelectric effect,Nanotechnology
"the 
photovoltaic cell that turns the light into electricity will continue to generate electric 
power according to the level of radiation received",Nanotechnology
"so see nascimento  p  the 
photovoltaic cell  maintains a flow of electrons established in an electrical circuit as 
long as there is light on it",Nanotechnology
"note that the energy produced with the classic solar panels is much more 
expensive than the energy produced in either thermoelectric power plants or dams",Nanotechnology
"if 
instead nanophotovoltaic panels are used although more expensive the price is already 
comparable with the price of the energy produced in either thermoelectric power plants or 
dams see ferreira et al ",Nanotechnology

dominate the industry",Nanotechnology
"at the same time it is interesting to note that nanotechnology is a technology 
that may use a minor quantity of natural resources than other technologies",Nanotechnology
"probably a 
  
company gets additional benefits and has a lower cost and additionally gets better results 
for operating inputs",Nanotechnology
"to nogami and passos  p  from the harsh reality of scarcity arises 
the necessity of choice",Nanotechnology
"since it is not possible to produce everything that it is felt as 
needed mechanisms must be created to show somehow to the societies the path to decide 
what goods are effectively to produce and what needs have to be met",Nanotechnology
"all the means or methods of production indicate different combinations of 
forces and inputs",Nanotechnology
production methods vary according the way such combinations occur,Nanotechnology
every concrete act of production incorporates a kind of combination,Nanotechnology
"a company can 
itself be considered a combination and even may be the conditions of production of the 
whole economic system see schumpeter  p ",Nanotechnology
"roughly speaking being photovoltaics already an innovation in itself when it 
is combined with nanotechnology its power of subversion which can also be interpreted 
as its ability to break paradigms in the energy industry takes the form of a powerful 
competitive weapon for the production units",Nanotechnology
"given this context nanotechnology combined with the production of solar 
energy becomes interesting for the production units whether they are public or private",Nanotechnology

"this technology is very interesting reaching good results either in terms of 
costs when compared with other solar panels and also in terms of performance even 
considering public energy",Nanotechnology
those costs have coming to be considerably reduced,Nanotechnology
"in brazil a strong trend of increasing costs to the production of hydroelectric 
power is observed",Nanotechnology
"the comparison of the hydroelectric energy produced in brazil and 
other countries like canada for example shows the importance of the development of 
alternative energies",Nanotechnology

capabilities of electronic components namely in what concerns the reducing their 
dimensions weight and power consumption",Nanotechnology
"indeed being the electronic components traditionally of very short 
dimensions and very low weight the reducing of these quantities to the nanoscale level 
makes possible to conceive electronic devices with much more qualities since then it is 
possible to incorporate there much more components and even so to reduce the size and 
weight of the device",Nanotechnology
"as for the reducing of power consumption only to emphasize that this is 
crucial in these times in which the energy shortage becomes an increasingly dramatic 
problem nothing being too much in the efforts to achieve that the human activity 
happens to follow with an increasingly lower consumption of energy attempting to reach 
a situation close to the one of no wastes

importance of nanotechnology in electronics",Nanotechnology
"nanoelectronics holds some answers for how it is possible to increase the 
capabilities of electronics devices and simultaneously reduce their weight and power 
consumption making its operation more and more convenient and cheaper",Nanotechnology
"many of the 
nanoelectronics areas under development are devoted to the following topics

situation will become overwhelmingly dominant for all electronics and for example for 
televisions is already there",Nanotechnology

allow the touch command",Nanotechnology
"everyone is amazed at how much information can be stored nowadays in 
such small spaces",Nanotechnology

possible to develop a kind of memory chip with a projected density of at least one 
terabyte  byte of memory per square inch",Nanotechnology

where the diagnosis drug deliveries’ systems in the body or the treatment of diseases are 
particularly important",Nanotechnology
"applications of nanotechnology for treatment diagnosis monitoring and control of 
biological systems were recently referred to as nanomedicine by the institutes of health see 
moghimi et al ",Nanotechnology
"the origin of the concept of nanomedicine is related to the idea that nanorobots and 
related machines could be designed manufactured and introduced into the human body to 
execute cellular repairs at the molecular level",Nanotechnology
"nowadays nanomedicine has multiplied in many 
directions understanding the idea that the ability to structure materials and devices at the 
molecular scale can bring enormous immediate benefits in the research and practice of medicine 
see freitas ",Nanotechnology
"the use of instrumentation techniques inside the human body for ‘medical 
nanorobotics for diabetes control’ ‘nanorobotics for brain aneurysm’ ‘nanorobots for treatment 
of patients with artery occlusion ‘nanorobots for laparoscopic cancer surgery’ has been 
established and now only requires further industrial implementation and commercialization",Nanotechnology
"aspects such as integrating and using ‘nanorobotic architecture for medical target identification’ 
can effectively contribute to the advance of several medical issues thus improving biomedical 
engineering",Nanotechnology
"upcoming and current available technologies should be used to achieve a fully 
functional ‘medical nanorobot architecture based on nanobioelectronics’ cavalcanti ",Nanotechnology
"according to moghimi et al  the application of nanotechnology to medical 
activities according to the idea inherent to the concept of nanomedicine involves the 
identification of precise targets cells and receptors related to specific clinical conditions and the 
choice of the appropriate nanocarriers to achieve the required responses while minimizing the 
side effects",Nanotechnology
"they say yet that “mononuclear phagocytes dendritic cells endothelial cells and 
cancers tumor cells as well as tumor neovasculature are key targets”",Nanotechnology
"in moghimi et al  also it is shown how important are nowadays 
nanotechnology and nanoscience approaches to particle design and formulation",Nanotechnology
"the authors 
highlight that they begin to expand the market for many drugs and are forming the basis for a 
highly profitable niche within the industry",Nanotechnology
"their article highlight rational approaches in design 
and surface engineering of nanoscale vehicles and entities for sitespecific drug delivery and 
medical imaging after parenteral administration",Nanotechnology
"among the most relevant fields of nanotechnology use one is the development 
of artificial tissues organs and cells",Nanotechnology
"the implantation of encapsulated cells is being planned for 
the treatment of diabetes liver failure and kidney failure",Nanotechnology
"and also for the use of encapsulated 
genetically engineered cells for gene therapy",Nanotechnology
"artificial cells uses are very relevant for drug 
delivery and other applications in biotechnology chemical engineering and medicine see kubik 
et al ",Nanotechnology
"new researches are being directed to discover new techniques which may contribute 
for the artificial growth of organs and tissues on nanopatterned scaffolds aiming to obtain 
internal tissues implants",Nanotechnology
"the studies on the creation of nanostructures that can interact with and 
replace natural biological materials give raise to many opportunities and hope for medical 
treatments",Nanotechnology
"some of the medical areas in which nanomaterials have successful utilization 
are precisely the medical diagnosis the proper and efficient delivery of pharmaceuticals or the 
development of artificial cells",Nanotechnology
as seen above many advances in nanomedicine have been worked,Nanotechnology

"particularly it is interesting to show the case of the advances on dna 
sequencing and the consequent benefits",Nanotechnology
an ultrafast dna sequencing has been made possible,Nanotechnology
"branton’s team at harvard university used an electric field to drive a variety of rna and dna 
polymers through the central nanopore of an ahemolysin protein channel mounted in a lipid 
bilayer similar to the outer membrane of a living cell",Nanotechnology
"branton first showed that the nanopore 
could rapidly discriminate between pyrimidine and purine segments along a single rna molecule

differing only in base pair sequence freitas ",Nanotechnology
"a colossal increase has been got recently in the understanding of the way basic 
biological processes happen at a molecular level see for example the very particular case of the 
human genome sequence",Nanotechnology

"molecular medicine by itself exploits molecular and cellular 
  
biology advances to characterize how normal cellular processes fail or are subverted in disease",Nanotechnology
nanotechnology has an important role in this matter,Nanotechnology
"according to freitas cited by kubik  there are three important molecular 
technologies

medicine considering also the use of medical nanorobotics",Nanotechnology
"medical nanorobots can offer 
targeted treatments to individual organs tissues cells and even intracellular components",Nanotechnology

the level of the control of human aging",Nanotechnology

communicate anywhere to anybody making more and more useless the traditional phones",Nanotechnology
"nanotechnology because of its negligible dimension of devices will spread the use of devices 
that now are nuisance",Nanotechnology
"for instance the pacemaker that now is used like a “last resource” maybe 
soon will be used in a much larger scale if it will be possible to design one at a nanoscale",Nanotechnology
however ethical questions rise with the development of nanotechnology,Nanotechnology
"what are 
the borders for this kind of progress",Nanotechnology
"what are the implications in a 
later phase of development of these technologies",Nanotechnology
"global discussion has begun about this theme since the beginning of the 
discoveries about this subject",Nanotechnology
"legal ethical and social implications are irreversible and the 
discussion is usually asked to be hard",Nanotechnology
"vanessa nurock cited in bensaudevincent  questions the standard view of 
an ethics for nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"she argues that none of the current trends in the discipline of ethics 
would qualify for application to nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"then considering that neurotechnology – a 
rapidly growing field at the intersection between nano and biotechnology – can affect moral 
capacities of the brain she suggests that ethics itself may be affected by nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"and she 
leaves open the question of a coconstruction of ethics and bionanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"freitas  says that the society should be “able to muster the collective 
financial and moral courage to allow such extraordinarily powerful medicine to be deployed for 
human betterment with due regard to essential ethical considerations”",Nanotechnology
"at eu there are some important concerns and discussion about the development 
of the integration of human beings and artificial softwarehardware entities",Nanotechnology
"a funded project in 
  
this area ethicbots was created to promote and to coordinate a multidisciplinary group of

"actually there are irreversible and longterm impact consequences for future 
generations and for the environment",Nanotechnology
however there are risks as well,Nanotechnology
"but in truth there are 
incredible potential advantages",Nanotechnology
and the discussion is all over the place,Nanotechnology
"the borders are of 
course evident and there has to be an achieved balance between the path found to the new 
dimension of knowledge and the contours the problem has",Nanotechnology
"the rub of the question is exactly in 
what measure criticisms may have into account the potential of the technology",Nanotechnology
"so despite the high feasibility for the economy and the environment there are 
some considerations regarding the ethical human dignity and moral borders on nanotechnology 
that should be taken into account",Nanotechnology
"it is interesting to go to the definition of human dignity and its relationship to 
moral made in the “opinion of the european group on ethics in science and new technologies to 
the european commission”  when discussing the ethical aspects of information and 
communication technologies ict implants in the human body",Nanotechnology
"the group makes allusion to 
the eu’s draft treaty that establishes a constitution for europe stating that “human dignity is 
inviolable",Nanotechnology
"it must be respected and protected” article ii and goes on to explain that “the 
dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis 
of fundamental rights” declaration concerning the explanations relating to the charter of 
fundamental rights",Nanotechnology
"this group says yet that this explanation does not strictly define human 
dignity and that many writers have attempted to fill this gap",Nanotechnology
"one such attempt
 
suggests that 
human dignity is defined as follows “the exalted moral status which every being of human origin 
uniquely possesses",Nanotechnology
"human dignity is a given reality intrinsic to human substance and not 
contingent upon any functional capacities which vary in degree",Nanotechnology
"… the possession of human 
  
dignity carries certain immutable moral obligations",Nanotechnology
"these include concerning the treatment of 
all other human beings the duty to preserve life liberty and the security of persons and 
concerning animals and nature responsibilities of stewardship” 
                          the introduction of new devices to go further above the natural capabilities of the 
human being brings lots of concerns to scientific community",Nanotechnology
"desires challenges but also 
concerns are always present… what are the consequences",Nanotechnology
"to human beings to life it to other 
living beings to environment to biodiversity to progress to the civilization as a whole

"are 
humans creating a new being",Nanotechnology
"are we prepared to get different biologically and to become 
another thing",Nanotechnology
"are humans creating further nanodigital devices between humans that have 
access to these advanced technologies and humans that have not access",Nanotechnology
"this discussion is 
recognized but probably the ethical discussion has not been enough promoted",Nanotechnology
"in the long term which are the consequences that nanotechnology has in the 
environment",Nanotechnology
"it is possible to predict that less damage in nature can be done if nanomaterials are 
considered instead large equipments are used",Nanotechnology
"besides once the need of inputs to produce these 
devices is lesser probably there is an additional advantage on this perspective for nature 
preservation",Nanotechnology
but what is the reverse of the medal,Nanotechnology
"really the implications and directions of nanotechnology need further 
discussion",Nanotechnology
"the consequences of avoiding the discussion may be severe for public considering 
rejection or fear of the effects",Nanotechnology
is there a need for a regulatory authority,Nanotechnology
"which kind of 
mechanisms are needed to interfere in the nanotechnologies developments area",Nanotechnology
"in truth it may be possible in general to consider  topics for discussion see 
mnyusiwalla et al  about ethics in this subject",Nanotechnology
"they are equity privacy security 
environment and metaphysical when discussing the relationship humanmachine",Nanotechnology
"about each one 
of them some considerations may be made",Nanotechnology
"so assuming these topics it may be said the 
following without going until the limit of the analysis 
                                equity the classical problem of developed and developing countries may 
assure a new topic for discussion",Nanotechnology
in fact technology and development are closely related,Nanotechnology
"some 
important subjects that developing countries are worried with are poverty reduction the problems 
of energy water and health and somehow biodiversity as well",Nanotechnology
"nanotechnology would help these 
  
countries to better conditions of population health and way of life",Nanotechnology
"but it is costly to implement 
any project in this area and as often there are no financial resources to do that consequently these 
countries will be the less benefited with these advances",Nanotechnology

access to the benefits of technology considering the poorest and the richest people in any country",Nanotechnology
who may reach the advances of science and benefit from them,Nanotechnology
"anyway it is true that poor 
whatever they are may benefit from these advances",Nanotechnology
"it may depend on the will of politicians and 
on the investments of some of these countries for example",Nanotechnology
"a consequence would be lower needs 
for energy and a cleaner energy production as well as other environmental benefits a safer drug 
delivery the improvement on health through for example better prevention diagnosis and 
treatment",Nanotechnology
" privacy at this level it is possible to consider the enormous innovations 
which can be reached by improving surveillance devices or other devices that restrict human 
privacy",Nanotechnology
an individual may be facing situations of “invisible” microphones and cameras,Nanotechnology
"this is a 
real problem if privacy is intended to be assured",Nanotechnology

legislative omission or imperfect regulation ie",Nanotechnology

to provide appropriate safety levels for nanotechnology’s users consumers and

regulating public authority liability tort law could regain its primary function
which is the materialization of the idea of justice d although any additional
regulations can result in stifling the pace of technological development
regulating public authority liability can slow down this pace potentially to a
lesser degree than regulating the liability of companies because public authority
liability does not affect the functioning of tech companies directly and thus it

the pace of technological development and even result in blocking further
development",Nanotechnology
"for example the way genetically modified organism gmo
technology has been regulated in the eu eg",Nanotechnology
"mandatory labelling outpaced
attention to the environmental health and safety implications while other
products such as hormones remain less tested and monitored",Nanotechnology
"the role of the
policymaker is thus to balance the necessity of ensuring an adequate level of
protection while using nanotechnology if the benefits outweigh the risks to
provide more advanced research and to foster innovation",Nanotechnology
"the lack of knowledge
about the longterm health effects of using nanoproducts causes difficulties in
establishing one precise standard that can be applied to public authorities that
are seeking to craft regulations that attempt to balance both health and safety
considerations with the creation of conditions in which innovation in the
nanotechnology area can thrive",Nanotechnology
"generally it can be claimed that the standard
should correspond to the safety level that the users are entitled to expect based
on the current state of knowledge but also including justified predictions",Nanotechnology
"those
expectations should be assessed from the normal and prudent user’s
perspective",Nanotechnology
"even though nanotechnology is usually operated by a specific
group of users eg",Nanotechnology
"scientists researchers the assessment of the safety of a nano
product should be made solely based on what a final normal user could expect",Nanotechnology
"the complexity of nanotechnology and the vast scope of its application justify
taking into account the safety expectations of the final user",Nanotechnology
"it means that the
standard applied by public authorities should remain flexible and correspond to
actual problems",Nanotechnology
"too strict or too expanded a regulatory legal system can also lead to
overregulation",Nanotechnology
"both the users of the technology and the companies working on
the technology can be overwhelmed by the number of regulations",Nanotechnology
"moreover
when the regulations are very precise and detailed they start losing their
flexibility and after some time their importance",Nanotechnology
"for example if the policy
maker draws up a list of potential dangerous materials and provides the exact
name or chemical composition it can quickly turn out that a substance with a
similar but not exactly the same chemical composition will be excluded from the
application of this regulation even though it has dangerous features",Nanotechnology

mandatory requirements like additional more detailed safety tests product
labelling risk tracking mandatory maintenance and reviews of a product can all
impose extra costs on a company",Nanotechnology
"these extra costs generated by additional
regulations are usually passed on to the consumers of the final product",Nanotechnology
"when
users receive a product which meets higher standards of protection the price of a
product will usually be higher",Nanotechnology
"this means that the costs of raising a product’s
standards will be covered by the users of the technology which at the end of the
day can result in ‘‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater” ensuring high
quality and safety standards can lead to an increase in price to a level where
buying a product is no longer costeffective and lucrative",Nanotechnology
"users can thus make a
decision not to purchase a product but then they will be deprived of the real
possibility of taking advantages of technological development",Nanotechnology
"therefore setting
disproportionate standards of protection can adversely affect users’ decisions",Nanotechnology
"moreover if users do not buy products companies will not have enough revenue

"v problems with european product liability law
so far little attention has been devoted to the issue of liability with respect to
nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"although nanotechnology generates new risks there is no
separate liability regime which means that the traditional rules of existing tort
law have to be applied in the case of injuries caused by nanomaterials",Nanotechnology
"from the
user’s perspective liability rules might be as important as health and safety
regulations",Nanotechnology
"this is because the safety rules are addressed mainly to the
companies and consumers are not directly identified by such regulations",Nanotechnology
"the
regulation of compensation for damages caused by products which do not meet
certain safety requirements might be thus more interesting for the users of
nanoproducts",Nanotechnology
"this area is regulated by tort law more precisely by product
liability law and its role in connection with the development of new technologies
should primarily be users’ protection",Nanotechnology
"unfortunately existing regulations in force in the eu member states
regarding liability for damage caused by defective products implemented under
the product liability directive is not a fully adequate legal response to the risks
connected with nanoproducts and fails to ensure appropriate levels of safety for
users of this technology",Nanotechnology
"first of all the directive limits the scope of its application to ‘‘tangible”
goods",Nanotechnology
"according to article  of the directive ‘‘product” means all movables
with the exception of primary agricultural products and game even when
incorporated into another movable or into an immovable",Nanotechnology
"the definition of a
‘‘product” causes some problems with respect to nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"nanomaterials
can be classified as tangible but invisible objects which are the components of
the product",Nanotechnology
"however nanotechnology can also be used to produce products for
example by nanolaser as well as possibly being a part of a service for example
medical procedures or treatment which are not covered by the scope of the
application of the directive",Nanotechnology

secondly legal problems are related to a notion of ‘‘defectiveness”,Nanotechnology
"under
article  of the directive a product is defective when it does not provide the
safety which a person is entitled to expect taking all circumstances into account
including a the presentation of the product b the use to which it could
reasonably be expected that the product would be put and c the time when the
product was put into circulation",Nanotechnology
"also a product shall not be considered
defective for the sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into
circulation",Nanotechnology
"the phrase ‘‘the safety which a person is entitled to expect” shows
that the directive regime is based on a consumer expectation model",Nanotechnology
"the crucial
element of this model however is the necessity that consumers are wellinformed
so that they can make an informed decision as to whether or not they would like
to use nanoproducts",Nanotechnology
"currently there is no legal obligation to inform consumers
about the risks associated with the use of nanoproducts eg",Nanotechnology
labelling issues remain controversial,Nanotechnology
"marchant douglas and abbott
introduced labelling as a discriminatory action from the point of view of
market mechanisms because of its stigmatization effect",Nanotechnology
"similarly juni has
pointed out the difficulties of companies in relation to the communication of the
risks",Nanotechnology
"introducing new technologies can cause fear and social concerns and run
into resistance against their use",Nanotechnology
"in many cases this anxiety is unsupported and
based solely on the fear of novelty",Nanotechnology
"it often results from false selective or
misinterpreted information about a new technology as well as conflicting reports
from the science world ‘‘media storm” and groups of opponents",Nanotechnology
"an example of
distrust in technological development might be the example of the ‘‘antivax”
movement emerging in europe and north america",Nanotechnology
"this movement originates
from an article of dr andrew wakefield published in the the lancet in ",Nanotechnology
"according to wakefield’s research  of  children brought by their parents to a
hospital in london exhibited symptoms of autism within  days after mmr
vaccination measles mumps and rubella",Nanotechnology
"the research was criticized by other
experts and finally it turned out that in an examined group there was only one
case of autism symptoms which appeared a few months after the vaccination",Nanotechnology
"dr wakefield was removed from the register of professional medical
practitioners and  years after it was published his article was withdrawn
from the journal",Nanotechnology

public authority liability  the regulation of nanotechnology 
the stigmatization effect can also be seen in case of gmos",Nanotechnology
"although new
technologies are usually introduced to the market under the assumption that they
will be beneficial and bring improvement to existing technologies they are
sometimes rejected by the potential users for above mentioned reasons",Nanotechnology
"in that
case labelling can magnify the effect of distrust and resistance which can be seen
in the social approach to gmo in the eu",Nanotechnology
"the eu selectively targets products
which are made through gm processes although there is no evidence that proves
that these processes are riskier than other methods of processing food",Nanotechnology
" concerning the traceability and labelling of
genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products
produced from genetically modified organisms gmo products are subject to
strict labelling and traceability even though researchers are in agreement that
gmo food products are not more hazardous than the nongmo food and are
actually even safer",Nanotechnology
"consumers are more aware of the existence of gmo food
but on the other hand they are not informed about hormones for example which
are less monitored and at the end of the day consumers could make a biased
decision",Nanotechnology
nonetheless to some extent labelling can be beneficial,Nanotechnology
"first since users do
not know that the product contains nanomaterials they have a limited ability to
benefit for example from the protection provided by tort law",Nanotechnology
"accurate
information enables users to make an informed decision about whether they
want to use potentially dangerous technology and expose themselves to the
possibility of harm",Nanotechnology
"apart from labelling users could also be informed about risks by the media
or public campaigns",Nanotechnology
"according to howells if risks are known and users are
informed the matter of defectiveness depends on whether the risks are socially
acceptable",Nanotechnology
"greater risk will probably be more acceptable in the area of
medicine and pharmaceuticals where the risk could bring considerable
improvement rather than in the cosmetics or entertainment industry",Nanotechnology

risk defence",Nanotechnology
"according to article e of the directive the producer shall not be
liable if he proves that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time
when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence
of the defect to be discovered",Nanotechnology
"this defence is especially favourable to those
producers who use new technological processes the consequences of which are
difficult to predict",Nanotechnology
"the existing legal framework demands that companies make
a reasonable decision based on data and research available only when the
product is put into circulation",Nanotechnology
"as indicated above the most significant problem
with nanoproducts is that currently the risks and negative effects on the human
body and the environment are mostly unknown",Nanotechnology
"the growing pace of
technological development in the area of nanotechnology could result in
producers being able to easily free themselves from responsibility",Nanotechnology
"the existing
regulations also create an incentive to put products on the market carelessly and
to do less research ahead of time",Nanotechnology
the next problem relates to the limitation period,Nanotechnology

directive the rights conferred upon the injured person to claim for compensation
shall be extinguished upon the expiry of a period of  years from the date on
which the producer put into circulation the product which caused the damage",Nanotechnology

might not present themselves for a long period of time a year limitation
period from the date on which the producer put the product into circulation

almost entirely on the vision of a particular policymaker",Nanotechnology
"regulations are
supposed to reflect the societal interactions and needs as well as attitudes
existing in a society which usually expresses traditional regional and cultural
diversity",Nanotechnology
"policymakers have the freedom to make decisions concerning the
scope and form of regulations",Nanotechnology
"this can help explain why gmo technology is
regulated differently in the us and the eu",Nanotechnology
"one of the concerns around regulating for public authority liability with
respect to new technologies is the excessive burden this would place on public
authorities to foresee the effects of the legislative solutions that are adopted",Nanotechnology
"this leads to the more fundamental question of who should bear the risk of
regulatory policy and why",Nanotechnology
"first it seems justifiable to assume that public
authorities should be aware of the consequences of their decisions",Nanotechnology
"they have
access to a wide range of the latest research results and if in doubt they can
commission further analyses evaluate regulatory proposals with experts and
public opinion and based on that weigh the pros and cons",Nanotechnology
"the policymakers’
decision also has an impact on whether and how technology will be used by
companies and how products will be introduced to the market",Nanotechnology
"companies thus
rely on legal regulation and adjust their production processes to the existing legal
framework",Nanotechnology
"on the other hand there is a threat that the users will bear all the
costs of introducing technology to the market",Nanotechnology
"it is clear that policymakers are also the risktaking actors when introducing

active actor on the innovation field thus explaining why companies should
contribute to public funds it is possible to go a step further",Nanotechnology

public authorities to technological development can support the liability they
should bear for their policy decisions",Nanotechnology

can for example commission more research on the potentially detrimental
effects of the technology to be regulated",Nanotechnology

the rules for claiming damages",Nanotechnology

"the applicants brought actions for damages against the eu for
allegedly unlawful conduct in failing to adopt appropriate measures to prevent
the risks presented by ‘‘mad cow disease”",Nanotechnology
"the probable origin of the disease was
a change in the preparation of cattle feed which contained proteins derived from
sheep infected with scrapie",Nanotechnology
"transmission of the disease came about mainly
through the ingestion of feed in particular meatandbone meal containing the
infectious agent that had not been eliminated",Nanotechnology
"the applicants contended that
the european council and european commission persistently and deliberately
favoured the interests of traders on the market in beef and veal to the detriment
of the health of consumers when they assessed and managed the risks linked to
the disease",Nanotechnology
"the applicants claimed that there were wrongful omissions on the
part of those institutions in carrying out their duties and obligations in the area
of animal and human health and that they adopted insufficient incorrect
inadequate or belated standards and measures to deal with the risks resulting
from ‘‘mad cow disease”",Nanotechnology
"the court concluded that the allegedly unlawful
actions and omissions of the council and the commission cannot be considered
to be a definite and direct cause of the infection",Nanotechnology

of the case the court stated that it had not been shown that if those institutions
had adopted or had adopted earlier the measures which the applicants criticized
them for not adopting the damage in question would not have occurred",Nanotechnology

which are the market social norms and ‘‘architecture” cannot guarantee a
sufficient level of protection with respect to the nanotechnology phenomenon",Nanotechnology
"the arguments discussed in part iv remain relevant while analyzing the public
authority problem",Nanotechnology
"it should be noted that the liability for damage caused by acts or omissions
committed by a public authority is a common principle in european legal
systems",Nanotechnology
"the lack of regulation or regulations providing an inaccurate
response to the risks created by nanotechnology results in law losing its function
as a regulatory mechanism for social relations",Nanotechnology
"however there are some
problems related to public authority liability",Nanotechnology
"the uncertainty in determining the
proper standard of care is a challenge and could cause liability to be blurred or
create ineffective stimuli",Nanotechnology
"where liability is imposed excessively a decreased level
of activity on the part of authorities could result",Nanotechnology
"conversely if liability is
excessively tempered an increase in the abuse of authority could result",Nanotechnology
secondly liability will have an impact in terms of the costs of indemnification,Nanotechnology

budgets and increase the fiscal burden imposed on citizens",Nanotechnology

position as regards the possible existence of a principle of liability in the

by the exercise of wide discretion which is essential for implementing

imposing public authority liability as legal regulatory acts influence business
decisions including the necessity of adjusting production processes in line with

following how nanotechnology’s technological linkages are shaped due to its multidisciplinary

scientific areas and technology domains",Nanotechnology

same discipline or across disciplines with some particular patents",Nanotechnology
"moreover one can assume there 
will be diffusion in terms of patent usage in some applications as they may require multiple patents 
from different patent owners",Nanotechnology

illustrate a possible scenario of technological development in multidisciplinary fields such as 
nanotechnology and biotechnology",Nanotechnology

work on",Nanotechnology
"this research applies a techmining method porter and cunningham  which has had a 
significant impact on the analysis of technology dynamics",Nanotechnology
"the outline of the research design is 
shown in table ",Nanotechnology
"the data for this study was retrieved from the thomson innovation database and 
analysed using the techmining software thomson data analyser tda which automates mining 
and clustering of terms occurring in patent abstracts and descriptors according to authors affiliations 
or keywords that it recommends",Nanotechnology

many ways such as cleaning the data of duplicates or unnecessary items mapping clustering co
occurrence factor analysis and citation networks",Nanotechnology

certain steps which need to be taken to optimise the data for example eliminating duplicates by 
obtaining patent data with the dwpi derwent patent index and preparing categories and groups for 
analysis",Nanotechnology
"insert table  here 
after optimisation is completed various analyses can be undertaken such as trend landscape 
network patent portfolio citation and topological analyses",Nanotechnology
"for this the tda is used as it performs 
multidimensional statistical analysis to identify clusters and relationships among nodes",Nanotechnology
"each cluster 
is represented by nodes the size of a node representing the number of patent documents that belongs 
to it while its centrality represents how often that particular node occurs with other nodes",Nanotechnology
"the 
closeness of nodes and their thicknesses are calculated on the basis of the significance and 
interrelationship level between each node which in turn is calculated on the basis of how many of 
those documents belong to the node and how many of those documents are shared",Nanotechnology
"in addition to the tda another offering of thomson innovation called the themescape tool can be 
used",Nanotechnology
"themescape extracts text terms from a set of patent records and generates a topological map 
showing the frequency of a term’s occurrence as apparent peaks on a geographical island",Nanotechnology
"themescape was used to map key technologies and allowed the categorisation of documents 
containing similar content as they were placed near each other on the map",Nanotechnology
"the density of documents 
can be indicated with tall or small peaks and the distance between peaks sheds light on the 
relationship between content as peaks that are located closer to each other have more closely related 
content than peaks that are located farther away",Nanotechnology
"contour lines indicate relative document density and 
by using the tool it is possible to zoom in on a specific area whereby new contours labels and 
documents can be revealed",Nanotechnology
this research also maps the profile of the nanotechnological competencies for nations,Nanotechnology
"the patent data 
were converted to calculate the relative technological advantages of regions in nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"the 
revealed technological advantage rta index cantwell  patel and pavitt  oecd 
 provides an indication of the relative specialisation of a given country in selected technological 
domains",Nanotechnology

relatively strong share in the technology pole ie",Nanotechnology
"relative importance to competencies in 
nanotechnology and having distinctive advantages nationally",Nanotechnology
"the region of low share and low rta 
reveals countries allocating relatively fewer resources to technology or science and having less 
distinctive advantages nationally",Nanotechnology
"it is to be noted that the value of the benchmark share in the xaxis 
is difficult to identify and varies depending on various dimensions such as the countries or region 
considered innovation process analysed national requirements etc",Nanotechnology
"in this case a breakeven share 
has been chosen in order to accommodate all countries in such a way that a proper comparison of their 
technological or innovation performance can be made",Nanotechnology
"therefore in this analysis what matters is the 
direction of movement and comparative positions rather than absolute positions",Nanotechnology
"one of the biggest challenges in a patent analysis is to gather required patent data by selecting the 
appropriate search terms so that the data set includes the relevant patents and excludes unnecessary 
patents thus increasing the validity of the research",Nanotechnology
"this study offers a more effective method with an 
improved patent search query which uses a combination of both patent classifications and lexical 
queries to exclude unrelated patents",Nanotechnology

"this is mainly due to the presence in these regions of large corporate players with an 
interest in patenting their technologies",Nanotechnology
"another reason why patenting activity is predominantly 
business driven in these countries is that they are host to the world’s largest electronics corporations

"in china russia and taiwan academic institutions are more heavily involved than their corporate 
counterparts an unexpected outcome given the nature of their patenting activities",Nanotechnology

been combined with interview analyses in order to understand why these three countries have higher 
levels of academic involvement",Nanotechnology
"in china’s case interviews with key experts in the chinese academy

be key materials under the nanotechnology umbrella in various sectors and most importantly in the

new linkage model is proposed which assumes that this field is diffused among different technology 
domains which in turn reflects the linkages within the same disciplinary fields or across disciplines",Nanotechnology
"as such the study of nanotechnological linkages has presented novel and highly informative results in 
terms of interrelationships within the field in comparison to previous studies",Nanotechnology
"by using the 
themescape tool specific nanotechnologyrelated terms were analysed to identify the dominant 
technology clusters and to see how technology linkages are formed their intensities and their various 
usages",Nanotechnology
"it can be seen which domains have significant relevance within the nanotechnology field for 
example the linkage between the cluster of nanotubesnanowirespolymers and the cluster of 
nanowiresemiconductoroptical applications identifies a nanoelectronics domain",Nanotechnology
"some of the 
dominant domains become very apparent and this leads to the identification of general fields such as 
chemical science powdersnanoparticleaqueous optoelectronics semiconductorslaserquantum 
dots biotechnology proteinmoleculesnanoparticles and nanotools probemicroscopescanning",Nanotechnology
"the involvement of academia is found to be more dominant than corporate actors in china and 
russia as academia has been given a greater funding share",Nanotechnology
"in particular in china a politically 
driven patenting system gives considerable support and motivation to academia to file patents while 
corporate actors’ involvement is higher than that of academia in the us the uk germany and japan 
as large corporate players are located in these regions",Nanotechnology
"with respect to the involvement of key actors 
in the nanotechnology field the electronics industry’s ownership of patents is dominated mostly by 
 
 
large organisations",Nanotechnology
also a considerable heterogeneity was found in patenting activity,Nanotechnology
"there are two 
main reasons for this",Nanotechnology
"firstly large organisations have the capability to provide the large investment 
necessary for rd activities and they are aware of the benefits of these technologies in terms of their 
efficiency and for bringing about incremental innovation characteristics",Nanotechnology
"secondly they collaborate 
with academic organisations such as universities to benefit from their inventions as well",Nanotechnology
"the second 
point is not found in every national innovation system but of those where there are such 
collaborations for example korea the us and japan the systems appear to be the most effective",Nanotechnology
the results also show the regional strengths and weaknesses in competence building processes,Nanotechnology
"an 
interesting outcome of this research is that it shows that asian players over the last few years have 
had a huge involvement in this area",Nanotechnology
"it appears that south korea and china are now catching up with 
japan and are close to the us in terms of the number of nanotechnology patents granted",Nanotechnology
"to gain an 
understanding of comparative dynamics we have compared the relative technological advantages of 
europe the us and the asian regions",Nanotechnology
"this indicates that the us has maintained its leading position 
in the technology pole with a high share and high rta in all periods revealing its strong 
competitiveness in the nanotechnology field",Nanotechnology
"relative to other regions the nanotechnological 
competencies in japan started losing strength in the mids and have continued to fall behind in 
recent years",Nanotechnology
a similar trend was observed in the case of top european players eg,Nanotechnology
"the decline in rta may be due to the entry of other asian countries especially the exponential 
growth of south korean firms into nanotechnological activities",Nanotechnology
"as china has a relatively low 
percentage share in the technology pole its distinctive advantage in nanotechnology is still low but 
promises to be greater in the future",Nanotechnology
"contribution of the study 
this study has discussed how this research its methodological approach and its findings have reduced 
the identified gaps and improved on weaknesses in this research field",Nanotechnology
"furthermore it points out 
practical and theoretical contributions to the field and reports key findings related to research 
objectives",Nanotechnology
"practical contributions consist of descriptive and analytical findings based on various 
different types of categories such as actors’ performances and regions’ strengths and competencies 
that offer specific determinants for linkage mechanisms in the nanotechnology field",Nanotechnology
"the case of 
tsinghuafoxconn represents successful practice in this field and its study has increased the depth 
and quality of the findings",Nanotechnology
"the outcomes of this study were also found to be useful for other 
innovationrelated collaborations",Nanotechnology
"the theoretical contributions of this study are the theoretical 
frameworks that have been adapted and tested in this research",Nanotechnology
"the technology linkage model allows 
the identification of technology clusters and their linkages to application or market domains",Nanotechnology
"accordingly this model could be adapted to different fields such as biotechnology or with other types 
of data such as publications",Nanotechnology
"apart from the practical and theoretical contributions there are also methodological contributions 
from this research",Nanotechnology
"as explained in the research design section this study has greater validity than 
other studies due to its large sample size and greater accuracy of its patent search query which used a 
combination of both patent classification codes and lexical queries",Nanotechnology
"using only patent codes has a 
weakness in that unrelated patents appear in the patent data due to errors in their classification but 
this was one of the common approaches adopted by other studies",Nanotechnology
"this study offers an effective 
method of patent data gathering when compared to other methods and could be considered to be 
reliable as technological links were checked with multiple sources and supported by themescape 
mapping and interview data analysis that extended the findings in the nanotechnology field",Nanotechnology
"with regard to the ten model networks and clusters within the nanotechnology innovation system 
showed that boundaries of interactions are not limited to the national level and there are interactions 
between different types of organisations so it is not possible to limit this field into certain sectors",Nanotechnology
"however an identified weakness is that the linkage between the science pole and market pole is not 
strong enough in terms of innovation processes",Nanotechnology
"there are some strong linkages such as between 
tsinghuafoxconn but these types of linkages are rare overall",Nanotechnology
"the weakness in collaboration 
between the science and market poles may be why the nanotechnology field is not in its highly 
commercialised stage and one of the reasons can be related to its collaborative innovation process",Nanotechnology
"this is because there are many radical level patented inventions that are owned by academic actors 
but the majority of these technologies have not yet transferred to industry  
 implications and future research 
the implications of this study are the following  
 the substantial increase in patent generation by asian organisations leading to their catching up 
major players such as the us especially south korea and china is having a great impact in the 
nanotechnology field  
",Nanotechnology
"mapping of mature and emerging technologies within the nanotechnology field indicates future 
commercial applications  
",Nanotechnology
"even though some nations such as the us are strongly involved in the nanotechnology field in 
general it was very apparent that the key capabilities of each country and various organisations were 
widely divergent",Nanotechnology
"this implies that nations and organisations should provide and have targeted funds 
and rd to accelerate development in this field  
",Nanotechnology
governments should encourage ie,Nanotechnology
"by funds special policies and targeted intermediaries their 
active or potentially active organisations to become involved in the nanotechnology field to gain 
 
 
competitive advantage and help establish clusters or networks to adapt and develop nanotechnology 
rapidly  
",Nanotechnology
"active or potentially active organisations should become involved in this field to gain competitive 
advantage  
",Nanotechnology
"management in intermediaries and fund providers should focus on linking academic and industrial 
organisations together and the majority of funds for innovative activities should be targeted towards 
collaborative research",Nanotechnology
"to take this study further there are many other relationships that could be looked at within the sub
fields of nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"future studies could look at specific technology domains such as 
nanomaterials nanodevices and nanofabrications",Nanotechnology
"as was mentioned above there are some 
organisations and inventors that hold a high number of patent documents but the question is whether 
they are highly influential patents in terms of citations commercial potential and quality",Nanotechnology
"interviews 
and surveys collected from academic and nonacademic organisations could be used to gain a more 
indepth understanding of the topic",Nanotechnology
"a statistical analysis of the relationships pertaining between 
commercialised patents and the latest patents granted could be carried out to examine various 
relationships between inventions and innovations",Nanotechnology
"innumerable 
scientific studies in several areas of knowledge were made since nanoscale 
emergence carrying their contribution to the nanoscience development 
leading to a great development of technical and scientific knowledge but 
also raising numerous problems in the ethical field",Nanotechnology
"in this chapter 
nanotechnology is discussed both in terms of ethics and in terms of borders 
that nanotechnology applications must satisfy and concluding notes are 
presented highlighting the results of the analysis",Nanotechnology
"significant 
considerations are made on the close connection between ethics and the 
nanotechnology and the effects over the society and values",Nanotechnology

introduction 
 
bearing in mind that nanotechnology is the skill to work at the atomic 
molecular and supramolecular levels at a scale of approximately  –  
nm the enormous possibilities raised by the work of nanomaterials can be 
easily understood",Nanotechnology
"the creation and the use of these material structures 
devices and systems with essentially new properties and functions result 
from their very small structure with applications in several areas such as 
bioprocessing in industries molecular medicine considering physical 
chemical biological and medical techniques used to describe molecular 
structures and mechanisms often referred as personalized medicine 
analyzing the health effect of nanostructures in the environment improving 
food and agricultural systems in summary improving human performance 
at many fields considering the different branches of science and the 
applications at many dimensions and scales",Nanotechnology
"indeed nanotechnology for instance supplies the tools and the 
technology allowing that researches lead to the transformation of biological 
systems to the extent that biology provides models and bioassembled 
components to nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"another relevant example nanoscales used in biosystems contribute to 
enhance very innovative and promising results in medical area 
improvements in telemedicine and on health may be expected with new 
systems operation and new nanotechniques much less invasive and 
therefore much less uncomfortable for patients",Nanotechnology
however ethical as far as legal and social implications are postured,Nanotechnology
"this discussion is as old as the issue itself but the boundaries are too much 
large even large enough to find out the difficulties on finding definitive 
answers to this discussion",Nanotechnology
"in the next section this issue is approached in 
general terms",Nanotechnology
"follow a section on ethical human dignity and in the next two 
sections are approached the themes of nanotechnology and  
 
ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
environment first and of ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace",Nanotechnology
"then 
a framework for ethical analysis in nanotechnology is presented and this 
work finish with a concluding remarks section",Nanotechnology
"in the end a short 
bibliography on these subjects is presented",Nanotechnology
"ethics and nanotecnology  
 
computers have brought an increase in the ability to type and made 
handwriting more and more superfluous even obsolete",Nanotechnology
"mobiles and their 
miniaturization brought the ability to generally communicate from anywhere 
with anybody making more and more useless the traditional phones",Nanotechnology
"nanotechnology because of the negligible dimension of devices this 
technology proportionate will spread the use of devices that now are 
nuisance",Nanotechnology
"for instance the pacemaker that presently is used like a “last 
resource” certainly soon will be used in a much larger scale because it is 
hopeful that will be possible to design it at a nanoscale level",Nanotechnology
"however ethical questions quickly rise with the development of 
nanotechnology 
 
 what are the borders for this kind of progress",Nanotechnology
 until where it is admissible and wise to go,Nanotechnology
" what are the implications in a later phase of development – 
obviously unknown  of these technologies",Nanotechnology
"global discussion has begun about this theme since the beginning of the 
discoveries about this subject",Nanotechnology
"legal ethical and social implications are 
irreversible and the discussion is usually asked to be hard and not pacific 
needing urgently great clarifications",Nanotechnology
"vanessa nurock  see citation in bensaudevincent  questions 
the standard view of an ethics for nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"she argues that none of 
the current trends in the discipline of ethics would qualify for application to 
nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"then considering that neurotechnology – a rapidly  
 
manuel alberto m ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
growing field in the intersection between nano and biotechnology – can 
affect moral capacities of the brain she suggests that ethics itself may be 
affected by nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"and she leaves as open the question of a co
construction of ethics and bionanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"in short new approaches 
must be considered but which ones",Nanotechnology
"in freitas  it is affirmed that the society should be “able to muster 
the collective financial and moral courage to allow such extraordinarily 
powerful medicine to be deployed for human betterment with due regard to 
essential ethical considerations”",Nanotechnology
"at eu there are some important concerns and discussion about the 
development of the integration of human beings and artificial 
softwarehardware entities",Nanotechnology
"a funded project in this area ethicbots 
was created to promote and to coordinate a multidisciplinary group of 
researchers into artificial intelligence robotics anthropology moral 
philosophy philosophy of science psychology and cognitive science with 
the common purpose of identifying and analyzing technoethical issues 
concerned precisely with the integration of human beings and artificial 
softwarehardware entities",Nanotechnology
"next generations in the perspective of nanomaterials utilization will 
obtain many benefits in all these issues health economic environmental 
etc",Nanotechnology
"by using this kind of advanced technology with many more applications 
and much welcoming using the conditions this technology offers will be 
very environmental friendly as well as already seen",Nanotechnology
"actually there are irreversible and longterm impact consequences for 
forthcoming generations and for the environment",Nanotechnology
"however there are risks 
as well",Nanotechnology
but in truth there are incredible potential advantages,Nanotechnology
"and the 
discussion is all over the place",Nanotechnology
"that borders must be considered is of 
course evident and there has to be an achieved balance between the path 
found to the new dimension of knowledge and the contours specific for the 
problem",Nanotechnology
"the rub of the question is exactly in what measure criticisms may 
have into account the technology potential",Nanotechnology
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
ethical human dignity 
 
despite the high feasibility for the economy and the environment there 
are some considerations regarding the ethical human dignity and moral 
borders on nanotechnology that should be taken into account",Nanotechnology
"it is interesting to have a look to the definition of human dignity and its 
connection to moral conveyed in the “opinion of the european group on 
ethics in science and new technologies to the european commission”  
when discussing the ethical aspects of information and communication 
technologies ict implants in the human body",Nanotechnology
"the group makes allusion 
to the eu’s draft treaty that establishes a constitution for europe stating 
that “human dignity is inviolable",Nanotechnology
"it must be respected and protected” 
article ii and goes on to explain that “the dignity of the human person 
is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis of 
fundamental rights” declaration concerning the explanations relating to the 
charter of fundamental rights",Nanotechnology
"this group declares yet that this 
explanation does not strictly define human dignity and that many writers 
have attempted to fill this gap",Nanotechnology
"one such attempt suggests that human dignity 
is defined as follows “the exalted moral status which every being of human 
origin uniquely possesses",Nanotechnology
"human dignity is a given reality intrinsic to 
human substance and not contingent upon any functional capacities which 
vary in degree",Nanotechnology
"… the possession of human dignity carries certain 
immutable moral obligations",Nanotechnology
"these include concerning the treatment of all 
other human beings the duty to preserve life liberty and the security of 
persons and concerning animals and nature responsibilities of 
stewardship” 
the introduction of new devices to go further above the natural 
capabilities of the human being brings lots of alarms to scientific 
community",Nanotechnology
"desires challenges but also concerns are always present… 
what are the consequences",Nanotechnology
"to human beings to life itself to other living 
beings to environment to biodiversity to progress to the civilization as a 
whole 
 
manuel alberto m ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
which are the consequences about the limit for the human being as 
human",Nanotechnology
are humans creating a new being,Nanotechnology
"are humans prepared to get 
different biologically and to become another thing",Nanotechnology
"are humans creating 
further “nanodigital devices” between humans that have access to these 
advanced technologies and humans that have not access",Nanotechnology
"this discussion is 
recognized but probably the ethical discussion has not been enough 
promoted",Nanotechnology
"and possibly no one is enough prepared to participate effectively 
and wisely on it",Nanotechnology
much reflection study and information is still needed,Nanotechnology
"nanotecnology and environment 
 
in the long term which are the consequences that nanotechnology has 
in the environment",Nanotechnology
"is it possible to predict that less damage in nature can 
be done if nanomaterials are considered instead of large equipment are used",Nanotechnology
"besides once the need of inputs to produce these devices is lesser probably 
there is an additional advantage on this perspective for nature preservation",Nanotechnology
but what is the reverse of the medal,Nanotechnology
"let’s have a look on the following situation 
 
 there is a growing consensus today that it is considered priority 
should be given to the development of alternative energies over the 
classical energies",Nanotechnology
"it turns out that the classic energies price of 
production is cheaper than that of the alternative energies",Nanotechnology
"but in the 
case of solar energy produced with nanophotovoltaic panels the 
price though higher is already comparable to say hydroelectric 
energy",Nanotechnology
"in this case this difference in costs can be compared with 
the environmental damage caused by the construction of dams",Nanotechnology
"and 
even with the damage due to the pollution produced by the operation 
of the fuel oil plants",Nanotechnology
"there is here an ethical problem in which one 
balances between paying a little more and preserving the 
environment or paying less and destroying it in which the interests 
installed with the classical energies will hardly abdicate their 
positions without struggle see ferreira et al ",Nanotechnology
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
really the implications and directions of nanotechnology need 
further discussion",Nanotechnology
"the consequences of avoiding the discussion 
may be severe for society considering rejection or fear of the 
effects",Nanotechnology
"so it is pertinent to ask  
 is there a need for a regulatory authority",Nanotechnology
" which kind of mechanisms are needed to regulate the 
nanotechnologies developments area",Nanotechnology
"ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace 
 
a theme urgently needing study and reflection concerns the potentially 
harmful effects on workers’ health due to their exposure to nanoparticles in 
companies dealing with nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"indeed very little to say nothing 
is known about these harmful effects",Nanotechnology
"in similar situations the harmful effects on workers’ health were only 
identified after long periods of activity with the occurrence of real disasters 
in sanitary terms",Nanotechnology
"one has to learn from history and try to avoid situations 
such as for example atomic energy in which only relatively late the 
harmful effects of radiation have been noticed",Nanotechnology
"and only then were the 
necessary preventions taken after the damage to health occurred in the 
workers of the plants and in the neighboring populations",Nanotechnology
"and today 
humanity in general is not very confident on those preventions",Nanotechnology
"however 
atomic energy was initially used for war purposes which helps explain but 
by no means excuse this late reaction",Nanotechnology
"the same is not true for  
nanotechnology so it is natural that the attitude towards the problem is 
different",Nanotechnology
"thus in the absence of scientific knowledge on the potentially negative 
health effects of workplace exposure to nanoparticles it is necessary to 
establish guidelines for decision making regarding risks and controls",Nanotechnology
"identifying the ethical issues involved certainly helps with proper 
decisionmaking",Nanotechnology
"it is therefore imperative for the decisionmakers 
particularly the employers the workers the investors and the health 
authorities to be aware of these issues",Nanotechnology
"as the primary objective of 
manuel alberto m ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
occupational safety and health is the prevention of accidents and diseases in 
workers the situations with the ethical implications that affect those most 
will be see schulte salamancabuentello  
 
a identification and communication of hazards and risks by scientists 
authorities and employers both from the perspective of each of 
these groups and from a global perspective 
b awareness and acceptance of risks by workers 
c adequate choice and strict implementation of controls 
d establishment of medical screening programs 
e investment in toxicological research 
f investment in control research",Nanotechnology
"ethical issues involve the independent and impartial determination of 
risks implacability autonomy justice preservation of privacy and 
promotion of respect for people",Nanotechnology
"their identification and implementation 
will make the options for decisionmakers more evident",Nanotechnology
"and companywide 
discussions on the workplace hazards of nanotechnology can be reinforced 
by a special emphasis on small businesses and the adoption of a global 
perspective",Nanotechnology
"ethical questions about nanotechnology in the workplace arise from the 
state of knowledge about the dangers of nanomaterials and the hazards and 
risks they may pose to workers’ health",Nanotechnology
"as this knowledge is still incipient 
it is imperative to carry out a provisional assessment of the hazards and risks",Nanotechnology
"workers can exercise their autonomy only if the processes leading to hazard 
identification and risk assessment are transparent comprehensible and 
credible",Nanotechnology
"employers will be in accordance with the principles of autonomy 
beneficence nonmaleficence justice privacy and respect for persons as 
far as see schulte  salamancabuentello

b address risks from a social security perspective 
c communicate and dialogue with workers

d take the necessary measures to control risks so that they are 
understandable and accepted by workers to ensure their 
collaboration in their implementation",Nanotechnology
"framework for ethical analysis  
in nanotechnology 
 
a methodology for conducting an organized and coherent discussion 
about ethics in this subject is to subdivide it by the following topics of 
analysis see mnyusiwalla et al  equity privacy security 
environment and metaphysical when discussing the relationship in the 
humanmachine binary",Nanotechnology
"about each one of them some considerations may 
be made",Nanotechnology
"so assuming these topics and trying to go as far as possible in the 
analysis 
 
 
equity 
 
the classical dichotomy of developed and developing countries raises a 
new topic for discussion",Nanotechnology
"indeed technology and development are closely 
correlated",Nanotechnology
"examples of great worries for developing countries are 
 
 people poverty reduction  
 energy problem  
 water problem 
 health problem 
 biodiversity maintenance",Nanotechnology
"nanotechnology would help these countries to better conditions of 
population health and way of life",Nanotechnology
"but it is costly to implement any project 
in this area and more often there are no financial resources available",Nanotechnology
"developing countries will be lesser benefited with these advances than 
manuel alberto m ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
developed countries",Nanotechnology
"the main problem happens with the access to the 
benefits of technology considering the poorest and the richest people inside 
any country",Nanotechnology
"who may effectively reach the advances of science and take 
benefit from them",Nanotechnology
"anyway it is true that poor people whatever they are 
may benefit in some measure from these advances",Nanotechnology
"it may depend on the 
will of politicians and on the investments capacity one way of overcoming 
countries’ lack of investment capacity is their indebtedness which as many 
current cases show is nevertheless a generator of future and sometimes very 
serious financial problemsof some of these countries for example",Nanotechnology
"a result 
would be lower needs for energy and a cleaner energy production as well as 
other environmental benefits a safer drug delivery the improvement on 
health through for example better prevention diagnosis and treatment",Nanotechnology
"privacy 
 
at this level it is to consider the enormous innovations which can be 
reached by improving surveillance devices or other devices that restrict 
human privacy",Nanotechnology
"an individual may be facing situations of “invisible” 
microphones and cameras",Nanotechnology
"this is a real problem if privacy is intended to be 
assured",Nanotechnology
"wireless monitoring provides healthcare providers and patients to 
be mobile and being able to exchange data when needed",Nanotechnology
"but there is the 
reverse of the medal privacy violation",Nanotechnology
"it is true that wireless 
communication and new physiological sensors bring enormous implications 
in ehealth",Nanotechnology
"one point needed is about the necessary discussion on privacy 
and security",Nanotechnology
"security 
 
surely new powerful weapons will be available very soon as far as 
“invisible” microphones and cameras will be available",Nanotechnology
"will this ensure new 
ways of security or will be added to a potential “arsenal of bioterrorism and 
technoterrorism or even nanoterrorism” see mnyusiwalla et al ",Nanotechnology
"ethical considerations on nanotechnology  
mnyusiwalla et al  also ask “who will regulate the direction of 
research in defensive and offensive military nt nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"how 
much transparency will be necessary in government and private nt 
initiatives to avoid misuses",Nanotechnology
"there are also very interesting legal questions 
involving monitoring ownership and control of invisible objects”",Nanotechnology
"environment 
 
this topic was already approached above in the section 
“nanotechnology and environment” due to extreme importance of the 
subject there considered the production of electrical energy through 
nanophotovoltaic panels versus the production through classical means",Nanotechnology
obviously this does not exhaust the subject,Nanotechnology
"so going on new materials 
fullerenes carbon nanotubes are now available",Nanotechnology
"no one knows what will 
be the precise effects when this kind of nanomaterials goes into the 
environment and also the effects on health",Nanotechnology
"where 
are they put in the end of their mechanical lives",Nanotechnology
"will some medical devices 
be kept inside human body",Nanotechnology
"or will be given 
another destiny to them",Nanotechnology
"is it possible to predict any kind of effects caused 
to the environment",Nanotechnology
"jacobstein  refers that it is important to make an 
analysis on the risks associated to passive compounds in the less than  
nanometer size range",Nanotechnology
"there is the possibility for example of being 
introduced inadvertently in human bodies",Nanotechnology
"there is in fact the concern with 
their ability to be inhaled  
 
 
absorbed through the skin or to pass through biological compartment 
barriers such as the blood brain barrier",Nanotechnology
"this kind of dangers pose a real 
range of potential health and environmental risks that are associated to their 
potential toxicity or mutagenicity in their interactions with biological 
systems note the analogy of this situation with the considered above in 
“ethics and nanotecnology in the workplace”",Nanotechnology
"while the range of effects 
vary most of the risks may be addressed by advanced industrial hygiene and 
manuel alberto m ferreira and josé antónio filipe  
environmental health practices and techniques that seek to characterize the 
specific risks exposure patterns and control methods and enforce them 
through a combination of practitioner education industry selfregulation 
monitoring and government regulation",Nanotechnology
"this is an important emerging field 
in the environmental and health sciences since most of the existing 
legislation on environmental safety and health risks may cover particulates 
but do not take the change in physical and biological properties at the 
nanoscale into account",Nanotechnology
"it is reasonable to assume that passive nanoscale 
particle risks although potentially serious if not addressed will be 
characterized and addressed systematically under new versions or 
extensions to existing occupational industrial hygiene environmental and 
medical regulations",Nanotechnology
"metaphysical

"hybrid computing systems
we broadly define hybrid computing systems as a class of
abstract machine models that combine different computational
paradigms",Quantum computing
"however we specialize our analysis to the case of
realizable architectures that integrate a conventional classical
turing machine with a quantum turing machine",Quantum computing
"research into
these different machine models has clarified that they are not
equivalent with respect to computational power  and we
address some of the unique considerations that arise by using
the conventional model to program and control the quantum
model",Quantum computing
"fig  a hybrid computing infrastructure that integrates classical systems of
boolean logic into the control of quantum dynamics requires an interface for
inputoutput io based on the transmission and reception of physical fields
finputt and foutputt",Quantum computing
" the twoway interaction between a
classical and a quantum machine model imposes a constraint
that requires the machines to share a common understanding
of language",Quantum computing
"in practice this language is expressed as the
physical fields that define the operations issued by the conven
tional model and implemented within the quantum domain ",Quantum computing
"electric magnetic and optical fields are prominent examples
by which the current technology controls the quantum physical
systems",Quantum computing
"it is notable that this description is inherently ana
log due to the continuity of the timedependent schrodinger
equation",Quantum computing
"translation between the system of boolean logic
characterizing the conventional turing machine into the analog
fields is necessarily limited by the available computational
power",Quantum computing
"in practice this amounts to constraints imposed by
the available digitaltoanalog converters and the range of the
arbitrary waveform generators as well as the speed at which
the logical network can be processed and the connectivity of
the control system",Quantum computing
"the outstanding concern for programming such a hybrid
computing system is the controllability of the conventional and
quantum machines  ",Quantum computing
"that is to say for those scenarios
in which the quantum machine must execute a series of issued
instructions how accurately are these instructions realized and
how precisely does the result reflects the effect of the intended
instructions",Quantum computing
"a clientserver model for hybrid computing systems
current stateoftheart hybrid computing systems integrate
existing cpubased clients with qpubased servers  ",Quantum computing
"the latter represent the online availability of a programmable
infrastructure to access the field generators that drive the
control of a quantum physical device",Quantum computing
"the applied fields
are shaped and scheduled to control the dynamics of an
addressable array of quantum physical subsystems which for
convenience we denote generically as the quantum register",Quantum computing
"similarly the response fields emitted by the register elements
are collected and discriminated to generate binary representa
tions that characterize the state of the register",Quantum computing
"a qpubased server often includes conventional cpus for
purposes of parsing the digital programming instructions that
generate the shape and timing of the control fields as well
as the detection and discrimination of the response fields",Quantum computing
"access to the qpubased server requires an interface that may
adhere to conventional logic for example as found in modern
networking communication technology to accept instructions
from and return results to a cpubased client",Quantum computing
"currently the
conventional clientserver model shown in fig",Quantum computing
"dominates
the access method to qpu systems due in large part to the
experimental nature of these machines",Quantum computing
"within the clientserver model for hybrid computing sys
tems the qpu represents a layer of language parsers that
translate the boolean logic of the client to the control fields
required to drive the quantum register",Quantum computing
"as detailed elsewhere
 the qpu is partitioned into a control unit execution
units and the register itself",Quantum computing
"the control unit parses the client
instructions received by the server into the local instruction
set architecture for generating and applying control fields",Quantum computing
"application of the fields are carried out by the execution units
which in practice represent waveform generators for electric
magnetic and optical fields",Quantum computing
"a similar signal flow occurs for
detecting output fields and generating a digital response",Quantum computing
"fig  currently most hybrid computing systems rely on a cpubased client
interacting with a qpubased server over a network",Quantum computing
"the qpubased server
presents a classical control interface to the client that can be customized to a
variety of programming styles",Quantum computing
"internally the qpubased server must parse
these instructions into a local representation that carries out the requested
sequence of control fields",Quantum computing
"b programming and execution model
the clientside api for the hybrid computing system dic
tates how users access the quantum physical devices while
the functionality of the qpubased server is restricted to the
local interpretation of these transmitted instructions",Quantum computing
"in this
programming model a client may select which instructions
to send from a predefined instruction set for the qpu",Quantum computing
"the
international conference on rebooting computing may  
instruction set architecture isa defines the functionality of
the qpu and the language for the control unit ",Quantum computing
"these in
structions are generally transmitted as character strings that are
mapped by the qpubased server into precompiled functions
that execute the instruction",Quantum computing
"calls to these libraries initiate
the cascade of logic required to trigger the execution units
which subsequently apply the necessary fields to the register
elements",Quantum computing
"fig  components in a qpubased server include a control unit that
expresses the instruction set architecture isa multiple execution units that
translate instructions into applied fields and the quantum register which stores
the computational state",Quantum computing
"this layered hierarchical structure provides a natural
separation of concerns but introduces challenges to programming nearterm
noisy qpus",Quantum computing
" the twoway information flow within the
qpubased server provides a natural separation of concerns
for device programming",Quantum computing
"the logic dictating computational
functionality is isolated within the control unit and determined
by programs expressed within the isa",Quantum computing
"similarly the execution
unit hosts the translation of individual instructions into the
fields that carry out the intended logical transformations on
the register",Quantum computing
"the information unique to the implementation of
either layer is notionally not required in the opposing layer",Quantum computing
"however as we explore in the subsequent section this design
of the current qpubased servers leads to several challenges
for application programming",Quantum computing
"programming challenges for noisy qpus
despite the natural separation of concerns that arises in
a hybrid computing system using a qpubased server this
design presents a number of challenges when programming
currently available noisy quantum processors",Quantum computing
"advances in
our understanding and engineering of qpus have enabled
demonstrations with register capacities up to  addressable
elements yet these realizations still demonstrate a nontrivial
amount of noise relative to the underlying decoherence rates
greatly limiting the depth of quantum circuits with even
modest reliability",Quantum computing
"this raises a need for repeated sampling of
the circuit execution but existing clientserver access models
hamper this interaction and greatly limit the overall utility and
accessibility of the qpus",Quantum computing
"code portability is also a growing concern as many qpu
vendors trend toward standalone programming frameworks
that interact with their tightly controlled and proprietary isa",Quantum computing
"these barriers to portability impede efforts to perform veri
fication of software and benchmarking of hardware as well
as methods to validate hardware behavior using numerical
simulation",Quantum computing
"finally the individual workflow steps required to
program compile and execute hybrid applications with near
term qpus are tightly coupled",Quantum computing
"the lack of interoperability
across available software and hardware platforms raises a
concern that the users programming hybrid computing systems
will face artificial barriers to adoption and performance",Quantum computing
"we provide a more detailed description of each of these
challenges with an analysis for how hybrid computation is
affected",Quantum computing
"because moore’s law is merely an observation and not a physical law this

doubling of transistors every two years cannot continue forever",Quantum computing
"as the limits of moore’s law are 
reached stagnation in the computer industry is inevitable",Quantum computing
"the rapid advancement of the past few 
decades will continue to slow as creating faster and more efficient technologies using current 
methods climbs in difficulty",Quantum computing
"with these problems becoming more prominent every year the 
computer industry faces a unique challenge that it has not faced since the inception of transistors",Quantum computing
"effectively the industry is back at square one and must create an entirely new approach or fester 
in an era without innovation",Quantum computing
"taking these major issues into account it is reasonable to state 
quantum computing will be a viable alternative to the classical computers of today",Quantum computing
"research design 
research was conducted using a variety of science and technology databases to find relevant 
sources that pertained to the computer field",Quantum computing
"specifically i considered peer reviewed journal 
articles as they provided the most reliable and up to date information",Quantum computing
"additionally these peer 
reviewed journal articles were from  or later since this technology is a relatively new topic",Quantum computing
"the databases that i used to find these articles included ieee xplore scopus acm digital 
library and google scholar",Quantum computing
"these databases all pertain to computer and electrical engineering 
and provided relevant results that strengthened my research paper",Quantum computing
"i searched these databases 
using terms such as quantum computing applications of quantum computing moore’s law and 
classical vs quantum computing",Quantum computing
"sources that pertained to the history of quantum computing or 
the physics of quantum mechanics were ignored",Quantum computing
"the sources found in these databases have 
provided sufficient information on the topic and allowed me to come to a conclusion on the 
viability of quantum computing",Quantum computing
"overcoming the limits of moore’s law 
in the past few decades the rapid progress in electronics has been nothing short of 
astonishing",Quantum computing
"while this unprecedented advancement changed the course of history the end of 
this innovative era is near",Quantum computing
"currently the computer and electronics industries face the hurdle 
known as moore’s law",Quantum computing
"the economic and physical repercussions of moore’s law are two major 
factors that constrict development",Quantum computing
"researchers have noted that “this exponential growth in 
complexity cannot continue forever and there is increasing evidence that as transistor 
geometries shrink towards atomic scales the limits to moore’s law may be reached over the next 
decade or two” cumming furber and paul  ",Quantum computing
"cumming and his team offer a description 
of moore’s law that illustrates the limits of physics and what is possible using current methods",Quantum computing
"they go on to say that to deliver better performance and grow in a variety of new markets a new 
approach must be developed",Quantum computing
"while these startling facts suggest a bleak future for computers and 
electronics the moore’s law hurdle can be conquered with new emerging technologies",Quantum computing
"this 
only further strengthens the argument for pursuing quantum computing",Quantum computing
"cumming and his team’s assertion on moore’s law is shared by robison another 
prominent researcher in the field",Quantum computing
"robison indicates that “although the marginal cost of 
producing a single silicon chip has remained stable or decreased over time as the number of 
components per chip has exponentially increased the cost of research and development and of 
manufacturing infrastructure has increased exponentially in what has been dubbed moore’s 
second law” robison  ",Quantum computing
"robison’s research demonstrates that physical limits are not 
the only thing holding innovation back",Quantum computing
"economic limits are just as important and rising costs 
for development of technologies will also slow innovation",Quantum computing
"robison  further indicates that 
to progress past the age of silicon new emerging technologies such as quantum or molecular

computers must arrive",Quantum computing
"with the rising cost of development for microelectronics it is easy to see 
that further progress will be limited",Quantum computing
"all research seems to indicate that quantum computing 
could be the breakthrough needed to overcome moore’s law",Quantum computing
"while there are other technologies 
such as molecular computing quantum computing is the most attractive option as there has 
already been concrete research and prototypes developed",Quantum computing
"quantum computing versus classical computing 
as the era of classical computing begins to slow viable alternatives must be examined to 
compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two",Quantum computing
"one of the main advantages quantum 
computing has is its exponential increase in processing power",Quantum computing
"biswas indicates in his research 
that “the proposed quantum computer can exponentially speedup the processing capabilities of 
the processors over that of the classical computing capabilities of the existing processors” 
biswas  ",Quantum computing
"the significantly improved processing power of quantum computers 
allows it to process data at a much faster rate than even supercomputers currently available",Quantum computing
"using this processing power to solve some of the bestknown algorithms gives quantum 
computing a massive advantage over classical computers",Quantum computing
"svore and troyer  note that quantum computers can solve a range of problems 
exponentially faster than even the most famous classic algorithms",Quantum computing
"this is because quantum 
computers can use quantum algorithms which use superposition and are superior to classical 
methods in terms of speed and efficiency",Quantum computing
"these significantly faster quantum algorithms can 
solve many issues including database searching finding periodic functions solving linear 
systems sampling from a distribution and probability distribution svore and troyer ",Quantum computing
"with improved processing power and algorithms these proposed quantum computers can run 
simulations and calculations much faster",Quantum computing
"use of calculations and simulations are vital to 

missouri st’s peer to peer vol",Quantum computing
"engineering and science fields and quantum computing could fundamentally change how 
scientists analyze and manipulate data",Quantum computing
"biswas and svore and troyer all highlight the advantages of quantum computing over 
classical however other prominent researchers in the field such as moller and vuik doubt that 
it could be a viable option",Quantum computing
"moller and vuik’s research illustrates that “a common challenge of 
most of today’s quantum devices is the need for extremely low operating temperatures near 
absolute zero which suggests quantum computing as a cloud service as most promising business 
model to bring this technology to the endusers” moller and vuik  ",Quantum computing
"the current need for 
extreme cooling solutions presents a unique challenge for the development of quantum 
computers that its classical counterpart has already solved",Quantum computing
"moller and vuik  go on to say that the immense costs of development may 
discourage researchers from pursuing development if the costs outweigh the benefits",Quantum computing
"the high 
cost and unconventional cooling requirements may give classical computers an advantage here 
but quantum computers are very much still early in their development and have room for 
improvement",Quantum computing
"perhaps quantum computers will not be available for consumer use at first but 
they could realistically be used in large data centers and still have immense benefits",Quantum computing
"as with any 
new emerging technology the initial cost of development is high",Quantum computing
"however continued 
development and research will drive the cost of production down as quantum computing 
becomes the norm",Quantum computing
"the immense improvements in processing and algorithms alone make it a 
worthwhile and viable alternative to the classical technologies of today",Quantum computing
"applications and viability of quantum computing 
when examining the applications of quantum computing there are thousands of different 
applications that promise to improve over what the classical computer can do",Quantum computing
"although there are 

king viability of quantum computing
published by scholars mine 
lots of different uses for quantum computers ranging from medicine to artificial intelligence 
researchers are mostly interested in its ability to decrypt data and simulate models",Quantum computing
"these 
applications are vital to science and could potentially revolutionize how data is analyzed",Quantum computing
"computer scientists have noted that “this subroutine is at the core of peter shor’s seminal 
quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers which is one among several quantum algorithms 
that would allow modestly sized quantum computers to outperform the largest classical 
supercomputers in solving the specific problems required for decrypting encoded information” 
ladd et al",Quantum computing
"because quantum computers can potentially decrypt much better than 
classical computers governments and military agencies are pushing for development to use this 
power to hack into sensitive enemy information and learn more about securing important data",Quantum computing
"the attractive prospect of having unstoppable decrypting power has driven several countries to 
pursue quantum computing effectively creating a new racetothemoon scenario",Quantum computing
"while decrypting is a major application of quantum computing quantum simulation is 
another highly important application that could allow for discovery of new and previously 
unsuspected phenomena",Quantum computing
"simulations can be run on classical computers however they are 
inaccurate and cannot compare to the simulations attainable with a quantum computer",Quantum computing
"preskill 
 highlights the importance of this application saying quantum computers will be able to 
simulate highly entangled matter including antiferromagnets superconductors complex 
biomolecules nuclear matter and spacetime singularities",Quantum computing
"using these powerful simulations it is 
hoped new information regarding the universe can be uncovered preskill ",Quantum computing
"such a 
proposition has the potential to validate or refute predictions made by theorists and allow for 
learning about the universe",Quantum computing
"the applications of quantum computing are highly enticing and only 
strengthen the need to pursue quantum computing",Quantum computing
"the payoff of researching this new 

missouri st’s peer to peer vol",Quantum computing
"technology could be huge and allow for a new generation of decrypting tools and simulation 
models which in turn will allow for an expanded knowledge of the universe and its laws",Quantum computing
"discussion 
“technological progress has often faced seemingly fundamental barriers",Quantum computing
"when viewed 
from a new perspective these barriers can be transformed into opportunities for innovation” 
morton et al",Quantum computing
"this in depth look into the viability of quantum computing has 
revealed the need for a new computing technology that is able to deliver revolutionary 
performance and data processing to help advance the computing industry past the age of silicon",Quantum computing
"the impacts of such an achievement would undoubtedly be far reaching and would shape the 
computer engineering field for years to come",Quantum computing
"the design of quantum computers is a completely 
new approach that features a new architecture newly designed components and a major shift 
from the classical fundamentals currently available",Quantum computing
"the computer engineering field will have to 
start from square one and effectively relearn how to construct a computer",Quantum computing
"the way fundamentals 
of computing logic is taught in universities would also need to be reinvented to incorporate the 
quantum design",Quantum computing
"others outside the computer engineering field would see noticeable effects as 
well",Quantum computing
"quantum computing would affect the world on industrial trade and civilian levels by 
delivering exponentially faster performance",Quantum computing
"breakthroughs in physics advanced decryption and 
encryption techniques and extreme simulation models would all become a reality with the 
development of quantum computers",Quantum computing
"improved processing power would lead to a faster 
computer which in turn would lead to faster devices such as phones processors and video 
cards",Quantum computing
these devices are crucial and are depended on every day,Quantum computing
"while the impact of quantum computing would be far reaching it is not without its 
limitations",Quantum computing
"the initial cost of production would be quite high considering this is a brandnew

technology",Quantum computing
"this should not be a major issue considering major military agencies and countries 
are already pursuing this technology and the price of development will decrease over time",Quantum computing
"the 
other major limitation is the cooling issue",Quantum computing
"currently quantum computers can only operate in 
subzero conditions",Quantum computing
"while this could be a roadblock for consumer production architecture and 
cooling optimizations could be developed in the future",Quantum computing
"nevertheless these widespread impacts 
present the importance of developing such a quantum computer and demonstrate the need for 
further research and development of this exciting technology",Quantum computing
"for instance with reference to our previous integer factorization
example shor’s quantum algorithm exhibits polynomial complexity",Quantum computing
"this means that a bit random integer can be factorized in
few minutes or hours by using a quantum computer but it takes
billions of years – more than the age of universe – by using a
classical computer ",Quantum computing
"but the complete overtaking of classical computing is expected
to require hundreds thousands of faulttolerant qubits embedded in
a single quantum chip ",Quantum computing
"however quantum technologies are still
far away from this ambitious goal and it is impossible to predict if
this revolution will take years or decades",Quantum computing
"in fact so far although the quantum chips storing the qubits
are quite small with dimensions comparable to classical chips
they require to be confined into specialized laboratories hosting the
bulked equipment – such as large subabsolutezero cooling systems
– necessary to preserve the coherence of the quantum states",Quantum computing

from the above it is now clear that the computational power of
a quantum device is dictated by the number of qubits that can be

"interconnecting multiple quantum devices via a quan
tum internet ie through a network able to share quan

two devices with a quantum internet the resulting cluster can rep

a property of two quantum particles",Quantum computing

for this choice lies in the advantages provided by photons for entan

quantum computer possesses special qualities that make it possible for truly random numbers to 
be created ",Quantum computing
"understanding and improving computation capabilities is a key focus in computer 
science",Quantum computing
"in this context quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computing as we 
know it​ ​in order to understand quantum computing one must understand how a classical 
 
 
computer operates",Quantum computing
"a classical computer is binary such that every operation is done with a bit 
which can have a value of either  or ",Quantum computing
"a classical computer implements operations on these bits 
using gates",Quantum computing
"all operations in a classical computer are comprised of a combination of these gates 
​",Quantum computing
a quantum computer works differently than a classical computer,Quantum computing
"instead of using classic 
bits a quantum computer uses qubits",Quantum computing
"the state of a qubit is more complex in that a qubit can 
have more than two states and is often represented as a bloch sphere as in figure ",Quantum computing
"figure  a bloch sphere representing a qubit  
given its property to hold multiple states a qubit can store much more information than a 
classical bit",Quantum computing
"however extracting meaningful information from a qubit is perhaps one of the 
biggest challenges in quantum computation",Quantum computing
"there are two key properties that make quantum computing different from classical 
computing superposition and entanglement",Quantum computing
superposition is a linear combination of states ,Quantum computing
"this means that if a qubit is in superposition there is an equal chance of these states being 
measured as  as there is of being measured as ",Quantum computing
"this can be described effectively with a visual 
quantum circuit as described in figure ",Quantum computing
"figure  quantum circuit with one  qubit in superposition and one hadamard gate 
 
in figure  a quantum score is created using a single qubit",Quantum computing
"this qubit is then put into 
superposition using a hadamard gate and measured  times as quantum scores often are ",Quantum computing
"the output is in figure  and shows that there is a nearly  percent chance of the qubit being in 
either state  or state ",Quantum computing
"this result showcases one of the most powerful properties of quantum 
computing",Quantum computing
"figure  quantum score for one qubit in superposition after  measurements 
 
the other key property of quantum computing is entanglement",Quantum computing
"qubits have the ability to 
become entangled and this is where much of their computing power comes from",Quantum computing
"in its most 
simplistic and abstracted form entanglement means that while each part of a system is acting 
randomly the actions of the entire system are predictable",Quantum computing
"the behavior of one qubit can be 
predicted based on the behavior of another qubit",Quantum computing
"however this property doesn’t exist until the 
 
 
qubits are measured ",Quantum computing
"each part of a system may act randomly but when measured the two 
parts are strongly correlated",Quantum computing
"this is explained visually in figure  which shows the quantum 
score of a  system of two qubits put in superposition and then entangled",Quantum computing
"figure  quantum circuit with two qubits in superposition and entangled 
 
if just one qubit is measured the output is random similar to the output of the circuit 
shown in figure  where half the time the result is zero and half the time the result is one as 
shown in figure ",Quantum computing
"figure  output for quantum entanglement measuring one qubit 
 
 
however if both qubits are measured at the same time the qubits show a strong 
correlation as shown in figure ",Quantum computing
"this result indicates that while still independently random both 
qubits are either  or  which is due to the qubits being entangled",Quantum computing
"this property is unique to 
quantum and there is no understandable reason for two things that seem totally unrelated to act 
this way",Quantum computing
"figure  output for quantum entanglement measuring two qubits  
 
in quantum computing gates are used to manipulate bits just as in classic computing",Quantum computing
"these quantum gates are powerful as they do operations on qubits in superpositioned states 
while using significantly fewer bits than a traditional computer would",Quantum computing
"these quantum gates are 
the result of matrices multiplied together",Quantum computing
"a base matrix represents the original state of the qubit 
and the gates are set matrices that can be multiplied by the original matrix in order to get a 
particular output",Quantum computing
these quantum gates are strung together into a quantum circuit,Quantum computing
"all of the 
operations are calculated and then the state is measured smashing this information down into a 
single onedimensional state the output is a quantum score ",Quantum computing
"because of this property 
quantum systems can only be measured once at the end of a program",Quantum computing
"additionally this 
 
 
measurement will likely be different each time it is taken due to noise in the quantum system",Quantum computing
"to 
overcome this limitation quantum scores are usually measured multiple times and graphed on a 
bar plot to indicate the probability of each output ",Quantum computing
"quantum computing takes advantage of the current understanding that very small 
particles exist as both a wave and a particle",Quantum computing
"this means that very small amounts of matter must 
be measured and understood in order to represent qubits",Quantum computing
"there are a few different technologies 
to create a qubit for example the polarization of a photon or the spin of an electron ​​",Quantum computing
"in order 
for the qubits to work as intended they must be kept at a very low temperature near absolute 
zero or approximately −",Quantum computing

outperforms a current supercomputer",Quantum computing

properties to compute including designing new algorithms suitable for quantum systems",Quantum computing

quantum computer wasn’t impossible and physicists and mathematicians could develop 
algorithms that could run on this theoretical machine",Quantum computing

quantum computer",Quantum computing
"in his paper divincenzo emphasized the physical limitations of quantum 
computing arguing that it is very difficult to measure and sustain changes to a single electron in 
the way that is necessary for quantum computation ​​",Quantum computing
"later that year isaac chuang created a 
crude fivequbit quantum computer using fluoride atoms and researchers at los alamos 
national laboratory created a sevenqubit system out of a single drop of water",Quantum computing

sophisticated machines have been created but it wasn’t until recently that researchers and

unveiled bristlecone a qubit quantum chip",Quantum computing

chip",Quantum computing

defined as the point at which a quantum computer performs an algorithm that a classical 
computer cannot ​​",Quantum computing

can use",Quantum computing
"in november  ibm created a   qubit quantum computer a size which can nearly 
outperform our current supercomputers",Quantum computing
"ibm also has a   qubit quantum computer available 
 
 
for public use",Quantum computing
"this means that quantum technology is accessible to the general public through 
the cloud thus creating opportunities for more research and learning ",Quantum computing
"another important potential advancement for quantum computing is in the time 
complexity of certain algorithms",Quantum computing
"in classical computing an algorithm acts as a stepbystep 
instruction manual for a computer to solve a problem",Quantum computing
"algorithms are categorized based on their 
“time complexity” or  the rate at which they speed up with respect to the size of the input",Quantum computing
"quantum computing has potential to decrease the time complexity of solving difficult problems 
with the use of new and more efficient algorithms",Quantum computing
"classical algorithms fall into different categories based on the amount of time it takes for 
them to complete as follows  
 
p​ a problem that can be solved in polynomial time",Quantum computing
"np​ nondeterministic polynomial time also known as the set of problems where a 
solution can be verified as correct or incorrect in polynomial time",Quantum computing
"npcomplete​ a problem where a solution can be verified but cannot be found in 
polynomial time ",Quantum computing
"analysis of a quantum register indicates that one quantum register with ​n​ qubits can store 
up to pieces of information whereas a classic register can only store ​n​ pieces of informationn  
this is to say that in order to represent numbers  through  one would only need log  
bits which is the equivalent of  qubits",Quantum computing
"in order to represent that many numbers in classical 
computers one would need  bits",Quantum computing
"this it the first hint that quantum could provide a 
 
 
significant speed up",Quantum computing
"a classical computer could not represent a quantum one without an 
exponential slowdown",Quantum computing
"with this onset of quantum computing offering a potential speedup 
there has been the creation of another class of problems  
 
qp​ a problem that can be solved in polynomial time by a quantum machine",Quantum computing
"it wasnt until the ​deutsch–jozsa algorithm​ that this theoretical speed up was shown to 
exist",Quantum computing
"this algorithm was one of the first to demonstrate a difference between a classical problem 
and a quantum problem ",Quantum computing
"while the deutschjozsa algorithm does not have many direct 
applications it is important to note that it is essential to the understanding of the power of 
quantum computing",Quantum computing
"a key example that shows a real life application of quantum computing is ​shor’s 
algorithm​",Quantum computing
"originally published in  and expanded upon in  by peter shor the 
algorithm significantly decreases the speedup of factoring prime numbers",Quantum computing
"the time complexity 
of this problem is not yet solved and no classical algorithm can do it very efficiently ",Quantum computing
however shor’s algorithm can find the prime factorization in polynomial time,Quantum computing
"this speed up 
indicates  that certain types of encryption can now be broken with quantum computation and 
because of this capability we will have to look into alternative ways to encrypt data in the future 
",Quantum computing
"another algorithm that takes advantage of the unique properties of quantum computers is 
grover’s algorithm​",Quantum computing
"in its most simple form grover’s algorithm manipulates the amplitudes of 
numbers in a quantum register in order to find a number in a list of numbers",Quantum computing
"for example if you 
 
 
have a thousand database entries and you are looking for a single entry with a unique attribute 
grover’s algorithm could be used",Quantum computing
"assuming that no other entry in that list has that attribute a 
classical computer would have to go through every entry to check if it had that quality thus 
taking linear time",Quantum computing
grover’s algorithm can find that entry in o  time,Quantum computing
"this speed up is very√n  
significant and has potential to change database searching drastically",Quantum computing
"additionally grover’s 
algorithm uses something called “amplitude amplification” in order of a specific entry",Quantum computing
"this 
amplitude amplification exploits the properties of quantum computation to create the speedup 
",Quantum computing
currently quantum computation has a few specific applications to science and research,Quantum computing
in  researchers found a way to simulate protein folding using a quantum computer ,Quantum computing
"quantum also has applications in machine learning as it can process large amounts of 
information better than classical computers do",Quantum computing
"one example of this capability is the 
aforementioned grover’s algorithm for finding an entry in a database",Quantum computing
"last but not least researchers also explored generating truly random numbers using 
quantum computers",Quantum computing
"a classical computer only has the ability to generate a pseudorandom 
number",Quantum computing
"some algorithms are pure math utilizing matrices and large prime numbers to perform 
calculations that appear random ",Quantum computing
"another technique for random number generation is using 
an arbitrary measurement of something in the universe as the basis for computing random 
numbers",Quantum computing
"one example is measuring the time between keystrokes on a computer and using that 
as the basis for the computation",Quantum computing
"however the closer to statistically random a number generator 
is the more time and space it takes to compute",Quantum computing
"this makes random number generation a 
problem in the world of computation",Quantum computing

generator is implemented on both a quantum computer and a classical computer",Quantum computing

on the python programming language and runs on ibm’s quantum computer ",Quantum computing
"the random 
number generator takes advantage of the superposition property of quantum systems",Quantum computing

combination of states ie",Quantum computing

run this quantum circuit on ibm’s qiskit quantum computer",Quantum computing
"the results of the quantum score 
are sent back in a python dictionary",Quantum computing
"since the quantum circuit is ran only once the output is a 
single string of ’s and ’s",Quantum computing

was introduced in  by makoto matsumoto and takuji nishimura and it is based on the 
mersenne prime",Quantum computing
the algorithm simulates randomness,Quantum computing

differences between a basic algorithm implemented on both a quantum computer and a classical 
computer",Quantum computing
"in order to understand the quantum random number generator  numbers are 
generated using the quantum system and then plotted on a bar graph with respect to how many 
times they appear in the data",Quantum computing

we propose a quantum neural network model as an
illustration of soft quantum computing",Quantum computing

behind the proposal stems from the recent exciting
discoveries on possible quantum mechanical effects in
biological systems for a review see ref",Quantum computing

rather than focusing on physical implementations of
quantum functioning of the brain we are interested in the
mathematical model of quantum neural network which
works as a soft quantum computer",Quantum computing

possibly nj other neurons each of which “interacts” with
the jth neuron",Quantum computing
"the interaction is characterized by a
connection superoperator wijt instead of a connection
matrix or weighted pathways wij in the conventional
neural networks  ",Quantum computing
"here we have shown the
timedependence of wijt explicitly",Quantum computing
"then we assume
that the jth neuron is a logic qubit consisting of nj
physical qubits",Quantum computing
"the candidate of these physical qubits
could be neuron’s ion channels whose two conducting
states open and closed states qualify them as the two
state systems",Quantum computing
"the detailed microscopic justification
of physical qubits which will be considered in future
is of course meaningful but irrelevant here for our

" a drastically simplified drawing of a neuron a
and the soft quantum neuron model b",Quantum computing
"in a the neuron
integrates hundreds or thousands of impinging signals through
its dendrites",Quantum computing
"after processing by the cell body the neuron
outputs a signal through its axon to another neuron for
processing in the form of an action potential when its internal
potential exceeds certain threshold",Quantum computing
mathematical formulation of the quantum neuron model,Quantum computing
"these nj physical qubits are operated by nj inputs
via the connection superoperator wijt",Quantum computing
"as in a real
neuron integrating impinging signals and outputing a
signal when the internal potential of the neuron exceeds
certain threshold here the resulting collective state of the
nj physical qubits represents the integration of impinging
signals and determines the output state of the logic qubit",Quantum computing
"thus we model the quantum neuron at each network node
simultaneously as nj physical qubits and as a logic qubit
such that it can interact with nj impinging signals and
output a single qubit state",Quantum computing
"in this way the neuron
model proposed above mimics as much as possible the
realistic neurons and meanwhile uses quantum laws for
processing information",Quantum computing
"the logic qubit is initially described by a density
matrix ρinj ",Quantum computing
"by modeling each neuron as a logic qubit
we only consider binary signals namely si   or ",Quantum computing
"whenever si   corresponding to the case of a signal
input a quantum operation here a superoperator wij
will be acted upon ρinj  while for si   zero input

"obviously such

acted upon the target neuron with specific temporal
patterns and as such the timeordering of these actions is
important as different wijt might be noncommutative",Quantum computing
"note that in addition to the conditional dynamical
evolution in eq",Quantum computing
" each quantum neuron can also be
subject to local noisy operations",Quantum computing
"a neuron of the hu
man brain normally has about  synapses on average",Quantum computing
"it is this large number of input neurons that activate the
target neuron",Quantum computing
"according to modern neuroscience the
connection matrix wij is the mathematical abstraction
of the synaptic efficacies of the interneuron synapses
while impinging signals mathematically represent action
potentials",Quantum computing
"in classical neuron model the activation of a
real neuron is then determined by the internal integrated
cell potential or mathematically by the signal function
and the internal firing threshold",Quantum computing
"for real neurons as
action potentials and cell potentials change much faster
than changes in synaptic efficacies neuron activations
are a fast process while the changes of synaptic efficacies
are a slow one",Quantum computing
"in classical neural networks the change
of synaptic efficacies is implemented by a “learning
algorithm”   during a learning process in response
to stable patterns of activity",Quantum computing
"however in the context of our current quantum neuron
model the above remarks should be looked from a
different angle",Quantum computing
"here a learning process is realized by
a “quantum learning algorithm” see eg ref",Quantum computing
" for
a review ie a specific temporal pattern of quantum
operations wijt depending on the states of input
neurons",Quantum computing
"by using various quantum learning algorithms
the quantum neuron model opens a door to quantum
manipulations of real neurons artificial intelligence and
ultimately the human brain",Quantum computing
"by sharp contrast the
existing quantum neural networks  model neurons
as qubits in pure states and connection weights as
usual quantum logic gates",Quantum computing
"however the human brain
is a highly open and decohering system",Quantum computing
"it is very
unlikely to model the human brain as a well isolated
quantum system",Quantum computing
"in our model the human brain is
neither a classical computer soft or hard nor a standard
quantum computer but something in between namely
a soft quantum computer",Quantum computing
"by modeling neuron nodes
as qubits in mixed states and their connections as
connection superoperators we are left to see to what
extend our model could simulate and understand the real
functioning of the human brain",Quantum computing

"any bipartite state is called fully

ρ 
∑

pij i〉 〈i ⊗ j〉 〈j  
otherwise it is quantum correlated",Quantum computing
"here i〉

and
j〉

are the orthonormal bases of the two parties with
nonnegative probabilities pij ",Quantum computing
"obviously for the twoneuron state ρout

in eq",Quantum computing
"
the first neuron becomes correlated with nonorthogonal
states of the second neuron as far as wρin  and ρin
are nonorthogonal – namely ρout has quantum
correlations",Quantum computing
"  show the
creation of discord from classically correlated two
qubit states by applying an amplitudedamping process
only on one of the qubits for the phasedamping
process see ref",Quantum computing
" is
the classicalquantum state as dubbed in ref",Quantum computing
"—
while for measurements on neuron the discord is zero
measurements on neuron in general lead to nonzero
discord",Quantum computing
"thus we reveal the first important feature of our
neural network a soft quantum computer",Quantum computing
"namely
the neural network can develop quantum correlations
although only mixed initial states and very noisy
operations are available",Quantum computing
"consequently if soft quantum
computing does mimic the working mechanism of the
human brain the brain is certainly quantum as there
are quantum correlations among the neurons therein",Quantum computing
now let us consider the threeneuron case,Quantum computing
"we
are interested in two particular examples where two
controlled kraus operations o and o are performed
in different orders namely ρout

 ooρin ⊗ρin ⊗ρin 
and ρ′out  ooρin ⊗ ρin ⊗ ρin ",Quantum computing
"assuming ρin 
p 〉 〈   − p 〉 〈 and ρin  p 〉 〈   −
p 〉 〈 yields
ρout

 p− p 〉 〈 ⊗ 〉 〈 ⊗wρin 
 pp 〉 〈 ⊗ 〉 〈 ⊗ ρin  − p
× − p 〉 〈 ⊗ 〉 〈 ⊗wwρin ",Quantum computing
"
meanwhile it is easy to check that ρ′out can be obtained
from ρout

only by reversing the orders ofw andw in
the last term of eq",Quantum computing
"if − p− p   then for
noncommutative w and w the resulting states ρout
and ρout

are different from each other",Quantum computing
"the importance
of the quantum operation orders is a quantum feature
which remains in our quantum neural network model",Quantum computing
"using the national representative surveys gallup polls
and laboratory experiments a recent result  reported
an evidence supporting a quantum model of question
order effects for human judgments",Quantum computing
"whether or not our
quantum neural network model is a quantum mechanical
foundation for such a result is certainly an interesting
future problem",Quantum computing
"open quantum systems have been considered for
various applications in quantum information processing
by engineering environment   and in particular for
mixedstate quantum computing – or dissipative
quantum computing  ",Quantum computing
"while soft quantum
computing is no more powerful than the unitary circuit
model as implied by the “dissipative quantum church
turing theorem”  there does exist a mixedstate
quantum computing model with a collection of qubits
in the completely mixed state coupled to a single control
qubit with nonzero purity proposed by knill and
laflamme  and known as deterministic quantum
computation with one qubit dqc which provides
exponential speedup for estimating the normalized
trace of a unitary matrix over the best known classical
algorithms",Quantum computing
"the possible role of quantum discord was
considered eg in refs",Quantum computing
"   as a figure of
merit for characterizing the nonclassical resources present
in the dqc which itself is a special soft quantum
computer",Quantum computing
"thus it is reasonable to expect that soft
quantum computing has computational power between
classical computation and usual quantum computation",Quantum computing
"finally we give a brief remark on the physical
implementation of soft quantum computing",Quantum computing
"above
discussions focus mainly on a special form of the
conditional dynamical evolution as in eq",Quantum computing
" more
general forms can of course be envisioned",Quantum computing
"a physical
realization of oij is simple the superprojectors ps〉
i
correspond to a von neumann measurement on neuron
i along the computational basis conditionally on the
measurement results an identity operation iˆ or wijt
is acted upon neuronj",Quantum computing
"such a conditional dynamical
evolution is experimentally friendly to implementation
based on any quantum computing systems under current
investigation such as linear optics superconducting
qubits atomsions and quantum dots",Quantum computing
"to summarize we have proposed soft quantum
computing as nonclassical computation using real world
quantum systems with naturally occurring decoherence
and dissipation induced by environment",Quantum computing
"a mathe
matical model of quantum neural network is suggested
to illustrate soft quantum computing",Quantum computing
"even using
very simple and noisy operations the controlled kraus
operations in eq",Quantum computing
" the quantum features such as
the presence of quantum discord and noncommutability
of quantum operations remain in our model",Quantum computing
"as an
experimentally friendly model the neural network as
proposed mimics as much as possible the realistic human
brain and thus paves the way to quantum artificial
intelligence and to better understanding the working
mechanism of the human brain",Quantum computing
"if the human brain
does be a soft quantum computer it utilizes quantum
laws in such a fundamental way that it forms certainly
a quantum correlated entity",Quantum computing
"this might be the reason
why the human brain is much more powerful for certain
tasks than classical computers although we have to know
more consequences and applications of the model to
arrive at a conclusive result",Quantum computing
"while the soft quantum
computer is much easier to build than the standard one
we need to do more works to understand what kinds
of computational tasks it can execute and to find the
corresponding efficient algorithms",Quantum computing

composed into individual gates instead of only the dom
inant part of a quantum algorithm",Quantum computing

components have to be properly integrated with a target
quantum computer system architecture",Quantum computing

have to find a path for qubit movements or braiding on
the target system architecture without raising any con
flicts with other paths",Quantum computing
"by doing so the quantity of qubit
movements which cannot be considered in the statistical
analysis can be exactly measured and therefore we can
say that the analysis results are realistic",Quantum computing
"in this work to perform the integrated analysis more
efficiently we propose and develop a quantum computing
framework composed of three functional layers compile
system and building block where each layer has a well
defined role for a quantum computing as follows",Quantum computing
"• compile decomposition of a quantum algorithm
into a sequence of quantum gates called a quantum
assembly code
• system integration of a quantum algorithm and
building blocks under a quantum computer system
architecture
• building block implementation of logical qubits
and gates according to a quantum errorcorrecting
code and a faulttolerant scheme

"the objective of this work is to estimate the most ac
curate quantum computing performance and quantum
resource by the help of the framework we developed",Quantum computing
"for
that we first need to configure a quantum computing
by choosing specific protocols and device properties",Quantum computing
"by
doing so as mentioned above we can see the quantum
resource and the performance of a quantum computing
based on most of quantum computing components from
algorithm to hardware",Quantum computing
"besides it is also possible to see
which component affects a quantum computing most se
riously by applying realistic technology from the top layer
to the bottom layer gradually",Quantum computing

that a theoretically optimal protocol really leads to opti

in composition with other components",Quantum computing

show numerical data for some theoretical conjectures in
the faulttolerant quantum computing",Quantum computing

based quantum computing increasing a concatenation
level makes it possible to achieve more reliable quantum
computing but we guess that the more does not lead to
the better all the time because a higher concatenation
level requires more quantum resource and longer execu

"therefore it is reasonable to guess that there
may exist a tradeoff between the reliability and the per
formance resource",Quantum computing

such tradeoff and in surface code based quantum com
puting too",Quantum computing

we describe how to configure a quantum computing

possible to configure a quantum computing by selectively

qubits and gates",Quantum computing

tum computing you need to choose a quantum error
correcting code",Quantum computing
"our platform supports    steane
code and a surface code now",Quantum computing
"according to a quantum
algorithm and the reliability error rate of physical de
vice the concatenation level for steane code or the code
distance for a surface code will be determined",Quantum computing
"the choice of the quantum computing type affects a
succeeding quantum compile step",Quantum computing
"exactly target quan
tum gates for a compile completely depends on the cho
sen quantum computing type",Quantum computing
"for example rzθ gate
for a rotational angle θ is very exploited in a quantum
algorithm but its logical version is not generally imple
mented in a faulttolerant manner",Quantum computing
"therefore to realize
a faulttolerant quantum computing you have to decom
pose such rzθ gate into a sequence of h  s and t
gates those are faulttolerantly implementable",Quantum computing
"on the
other hand since the physical rzθ gate can be easily
performed on physical qubits there is no problem with
quantum gates including the rotational gate for a non
faulttolerant physical quantum computing",Quantum computing
"the second step is to make a quantum computing pro
gram and compile it into a quantum assembly code",Quantum computing
"as
mentioned above for the compile you have to exploit
target quantum gates determined in the previous step",Quantum computing
"the proposed framework exploits opensource program
ming language scaffold and compiler scaffcc",Quantum computing
"you can
see how to make a scaffold program in ref",Quantum computing
" and how
to use scaffcc compiler in ref",Quantum computing
"in section iva
we show a simple example of a scaffold program and the
associated quantum assembly code",Quantum computing
"note that scaffcc
decomposes an arbitrary onequbit gate into a sequence
of h  s and t by exploiting gridsynth  or sqct ",Quantum computing
"the third step is to choose a quantum computing archi
tecture in particular a qubit array",Quantum computing
"the proposed plat
form takes not only a simple regular  or dimensional
lattice but also a hierarchically structured qubit array",Quantum computing
"a
communication bus also should be considered to make an
efficient interaction over distant qubits",Quantum computing
"shows an
example of a hierarchically structured quantum comput

"in case of steane code quantum com
puting the structure of a qubit array seriously affects a
quantum computing due to the limited local qubit inter
action",Quantum computing
"we will show such limitation raises highly non

"on the other
hand surface code quantum computing scheme is fun
damentally established based on local qubit interaction
on the dimensional lattice",Quantum computing
"shows a quantum
computing architecture for a surface code quantum com
puting",Quantum computing
"if the configuration is completed we can perform the
system synthesis",Quantum computing
"during the system synthesis the quan
tum algorithm is reformulated for the target quantum
computer architecture",Quantum computing
"as will be discussed later from
the system synthesis the expected performance circuit
depth execution time fidelity kq and so on and the
required quantum resource qubits and gates of a quan
tum computing are evaluated",Quantum computing
"c analysis of quantum computing
we briefly mention what performance are evaluated by
the framework but the detailed analysis method will be
described in section v the framework first inspects the
quantities of qubits and gates",Quantum computing
"those figures are usually
analyzed by a quantum compile without considering a
quantum computer architecture  ",Quantum computing
"but our frame
work examines such quantities with the consideration for
a quantum computer system architecture",Quantum computing
"in the system
synthesis a faulttolerant quantum computing scheme in
particular a magic state factory is taken into considera
tion",Quantum computing
"therefore it is possible to estimate the temporal
and spatial overhead caused by factors those are veiled
in a quantum algorithm and therefore we believe our es
timation nearly coincides with the resource to perform a
real quantum computing",Quantum computing
"the framework examines the expected quantum com
puting execution time circuit depth fidelity kq and
so on of a quantum algorithm based on quantum com
puter architecture faulttolerant protocol and physical
device",Quantum computing
"by applying the properties of physical device
and faulttolerant protocol we deduce the performance
of logical gates and quantum error correction",Quantum computing
"besides
by conducting a system integration we are able to obtain
the singleround execution time of a quantum algorithm
by applying the performance of logical gates and error
correction above",Quantum computing
"our framework goes further for more
detailed analysis",Quantum computing
"during the system integration as men
tioned above the fidelity of a quantum computing can
be calculated",Quantum computing
"by reflecting the fidelity it is possible to
estimate the execution time for a quantum computing
achieving a fidelity ",Quantum computing
"in doing so we fairly compare
faulttolerant quantum computing and nonfaulttolerant
quantum computing",Quantum computing
"the quantity of qubits is also based
on this performance criterion",Quantum computing
"besides the abovementioned the framework can gen
erate various performance data",Quantum computing
"based on the data we
can estimate the temporal and spatial overhead of a
quantum computing",Quantum computing
"for example as mentioned above
limited local interaction between nearest neighbor qubits
sometimes requires additional qubit movements to per
form qubit cnot gate",Quantum computing
"the quantity of such qubit
movements corresponds to the temporal overhead",Quantum computing
"the
platform evaluates such temporal overhead as a ration of
swap gates to total quantum gates",Quantum computing
"as will be shown
in section vic a quantum computing requires highly
nontrivial temporal overhead",Quantum computing

can be decomposed into a combination of qubit rota

"the target
quantum gates for a compile can be varied according to

usually add more quantum gates to target gates",Quantum computing

both is rzθ gate",Quantum computing

implemented in the faulttolerant manner the first set
is exploited for a physical quantum computing and the
second is used for a faulttolerant quantum computing",Quantum computing

quantum assembly code is a list of quantum instructions

quantum algorithm between a mathematical description

and therefore a specific representation and a structure of
which slightly differ according to literature",Quantum computing
"for exam
ple a quantum instruction to apply a hadamard gate
to a qubit q is represented as “hadamard q” or “hq”",Quantum computing
"besides a certain quantum assembly code has its own

execution of a scaffold program begins with the first in

a quantum algorithm is composed of multiple modules",Quantum computing
"a module consists of performing quantum gates andor

avoid any ambiguity we need to distinguish both",Quantum computing

"in this paper we address the first two question via indepth examination of
the qcps available today
 method of research
the central idea underlying our approach for finding answers for these ques
tions is as follows in order to build various qas into a software application
a software architect indirectly leverages or mitigates the characteristics of
the target computing platform for which the software application is being built",Quantum computing
"consider this example building the performance qa into an application often
demands exploiting parallelism present in a problemtask",Quantum computing
"however if the tar
get computing platform does not offer multiprocessing eg",Quantum computing
"if it has only one
singlecore cpu then the application will not be able to truly realize the qa
of performance",Quantum computing
"a proficient software architect must know i which all charac

how are the qas affected",Quantum computing

ward – one mainly needs to examine in detail the available literature and software
artifacts of a computing platform for identifying its key characteristics",Quantum computing

the pointii is not as straight forward to address",Quantum computing

approach for addressing pointii ie",Quantum computing
"determining how a qa is affected by plat

"examine the definition and general scenario partii for a qa to identify
the causeandeffect relationships if any between platform characteris

 what makes quantum computing different
a classical computer stores and processes information in the form of binary
bits  and ",Quantum computing
"at a physical level a bit is realized using suitable properties
eg",Quantum computing
"an n bit memory cell in
a classical computer can potentially represent n different symbols but at any
moment it can represent only one of these n possibilities",Quantum computing
"information on a
quantum computer is representedstored using quantum bits or qubits",Quantum computing
"these
qubits are physically realized via suitable physical phenomena that obey the
laws of quantum mechanics",Quantum computing
"examples of such phenomena can be the spin of a
single electron or the configuration of an individual ion",Quantum computing
"a qubit can be observed
in one of the two basis states which are labeled as 〉 or a 〉",Quantum computing
"normally the
qubit state 〉 corresponds to classical bit  and 〉 to classical  bit",Quantum computing
"one of the
remarkable properties of qubits which makes quantum computers much faster
than classical computers is the number of possible states in which the qubit
can exist different from its observable state which can be only one of the basis
states",Quantum computing
"at any instant one qubit can be in a 〉 a 〉 state or any quantum
superposition of the two",Quantum computing
"in other words the basis states 〉 and 〉 and their
linear combinations x 〉 y 〉 describe the possible states of a single qubit",Quantum computing
"in
contrast one classical bit at one time can be only in one of the two possible
states a  or ",Quantum computing
"another quantum property that is exploited by quantum computing is en
tanglement of qubits",Quantum computing
"two or more individually independent quantum objects
are said to be entangled when a their individual behavior is random but at the
same time b it is too strongly correlated despite each object being independent
from the other",Quantum computing
"a multiqubit state that cannot be expressed as a list of the
individual constituent qubits is an entangled state",Quantum computing
"consider the bell state
qq  〉 〉
√
",Quantum computing
it is an example of an entangled twoqubit state,Quantum computing
"there
is no way of expressing it as a list of onequbit states",Quantum computing
"suppose you measure
along some axis one of the qubits say q that comprise this entangled state",Quantum computing
it will behave randomly in this case q can be 〉 or 〉 with equal probability,Quantum computing
suppose you measured q to be 〉 then value of q will certainly be 〉,Quantum computing
"that is
you can predict exactly how the other qubit q would behave if measured along
the same axis",Quantum computing
"no unentangled state exhibits this type of perfect correlation with
perfect individual randomness",Quantum computing
"the above two properties – quantum superposition and quantum entangle
ment – are thus very useful resources in quantum computing

computers of s are big in size",Quantum computing
"it requires special physical environment
and conditions for operating correctly",Quantum computing
"the general architecture of a qcp can
be depicted as shown in fig  it comprises of five layers three of which contain
purely quantum hardware and circuitry and two consist of classical hardware

"characteristics of a quantum computing platform
in order to understand the effect of qcps on software architecture it is necessary
to identify all those characteristics of a qcp which can affect the development
deployment operation and management of quantum software",Quantum computing
"some such characteristics of the qcps of today are
",Quantum computing
"platform heterogeneity – the published technical details of different
qcps that are available today show the heterogeneous nature of
the qcps",Quantum computing
"considering certain limitations such as various nogo theorems
that quantum phenomenon obey dependency on classical hardwaresoftware
is inevitable",Quantum computing
"thus the qpus are expected to be inherently heterogeneous
in nature",Quantum computing
"that is both classical as well as quantum hardware and software
are involved
 physical environment – the quantum hardware requires a completely dif
ferent type of physical environment",Quantum computing
"most of the existing implementations
of quantum hardware circuitry make use of superconducting loops requiring
ultralow temperatures",Quantum computing
"achieving and maintaining such physical conditions
necessitates very specialized environment for reliable operation of a qcp
 large form factor – due to requirement of special physical environment
quantum computers of today are very large in size",Quantum computing
"for instance the main
box of dwavetmq system measures roughly ’x’x’
 energy efficiency – energy consumption can be looked at from two main
aspects energy consumed by the qpu itself and secondly the energy re
quirements for cooling and other ancillary circuitry which make up a quan
tum computer",Quantum computing
"it has been observed that a quantum computer spends
most of its energy on cooling",Quantum computing
"a qpu by itself however consumes much less
energy",Quantum computing
as the computation speeds grow to exascale ie,Quantum computing
"petaflops
the energy consumption of a qpu is not expected to increase as fast as that
of a cpugpu",Quantum computing
"experiments conducted with dwave’s qubit system
showed overall energy efficiency improvements of the order of x in
comparison to stateoftheart classical computing servers when considering
pure computation time for running specialized algorithms
 lower level of the programming abstractions – the programming
abstractions offered by qcps of today are of a low level",Quantum computing
"that is
a programmer has to work at the level of quantum logic gates usually via
a highlevel language representation of it when expressing computational
steps that heshe wants to execute via a qpu
 remote software development and deployment – programming tools
such as ides debuggers simulators etc",Quantum computing
"that a software developer can use to
create quantum software are invariably cloud based",Quantum computing
"only a very limited
portion of the quantum programming tools stack can be deployed
and used on a programmer’s local machine",Quantum computing
"for development and testing of
productionready quantum software a programmer typically requires access
to a remote qcp environment
 dependency on quantum algorithms – to exploit the real potential
of quantum computers a programmer has to express the logic of hisher
software using quantum algorithms",Quantum computing
"a computing task where one is looking
to gain speedup by running it on a qcp is typically mapped to or broken
into another tasks for which a quantum algorithms is known
 limited portability of software – quantum computing platforms are
themselves in their infancy though under rapid growth",Quantum computing
"as such there is lack
of standards that are necessary for developing quantum programs which can
be executed transparently on different qpus",Quantum computing
"each of the major providers of
qcps offer their proprietary programming apis and tools
 limited quantum networking – though long distance distribution of
quantum entanglement is feasible realizing practical quantum commu
nication networks is still a work in progress",Quantum computing
"as such practical quantum
software which depends on availability of a reliable quantum network would
be hard to achieve
 lack of native quantum operating system – the quantum processors
are still controlled via classical computing operating systems",Quantum computing
"we do not
yet have mature multitasking and multiprocessing capabilities available for
quantum processors",Quantum computing
"most existing qcps expose the quantum
gates and qubits for direct manipulation by programmers",Quantum computing
"mature protocols
and apis that implement for example practical timesharing of a quantum
processing unit qpu are not available yet",Quantum computing
"similarly quantum algo
rithms which may exploit multiple qpus in parallel is yet to be explored
 limited multitasking and multiprocessing – this follows from the lack
of native quantum operating systems",Quantum computing
"a programmer has to rely on classical
computer’s os for achieving any type of multitasking and multiprocessing
on a given set of qpus
 fundamentally different programming model – as discussed in §
quantum programs are inherently probabilistic",Quantum computing
"a programmer looking to
harness power of a qcp must identify or design suitable quantum algorithms
which are can solve the problem at hand
 dependency on classical storage – though limited time storage of entan
gled qubits is feasible long term persistence of qubits in passive media
is still not possible",Quantum computing
"besides it is not feasible to store arbitrary nonentangled
qubits due to different nogo theorems such as noteleportation page 
nocloning and nodeleting theorems",Quantum computing
"thus permanent persistence of
critical data in quantum programs still requires classical storage devices
 effect on quality attributes
quality attributes qa may be described as the factors which have systemwide
impact on an application’s architecture implementation as well as operation",Quantum computing
"the qas that are of concern for a majority of applications may be categorized
depending on whether they affect design runtime system or user qualities of
the application",Quantum computing
"the overall design and quality of a large majority of software applications can
be considered good when the applications possess a reasonable level of at least
the following qas performance reliability scalability security and
usability",Quantum computing
"however based on our experience we considered a slightly expanded
list of qas when examining how they are affected on a qcp
",Quantum computing
"usability
in subsequent paragraphs we discuss only those aspects of a qa that are rel
evant for identifying how the qa is affected by various characteristics of qcps",Quantum computing

further the list of characteristics that we have given is not an exhaustive list,Quantum computing
"it is quite likely that there are additional qcp characteristics which taken to
gether may be of significance in specific software development scenarios",Quantum computing
"another
point that we would like to highlight is that our findings are derived from a pub
lished information about qcps and b experimental programming on the qcps
accessible to us",Quantum computing
"it is likely that there are unpublished featuresinformation about
those qcps which can affect the software architecture of quantum software ap
plications",Quantum computing
"next we have not covered every qa which is relevant for a wider
set of application types",Quantum computing
"there may be qas such as auditability distributability
extensibility etc",Quantum computing
which are relevant and may be affected by the qcps,Quantum computing
"lastly
our own experience and knowhow as software architects has influenced to some
extent what we identified as the effect of different qcps on various qas",Quantum computing
"conclusions
programmers’ interest in applying quantum computing has surged in the recent
past",Quantum computing
"leveraging this technology in solving general purpose business problems
requires deeper understanding of important characteristics of qcps particularly
those which are relevant for software development",Quantum computing
"we have shown that the key characteristics of a qcp make it different from
a classical computing platform",Quantum computing
"for instance availability and knowhow of quan
tum algorithms for solving a task at hand are a hard requirement for devel
oping quantum programs",Quantum computing
"such characteristics of a qcp affect various quality
attributes qas of the quantum application software",Quantum computing
"the qcp characteristics
such as limited portability of quantum programs lack of native quantum oper
ating system services dependency on quantum algorithms and so on adversely
affect the ability to realize various qas such as scalability portability testability
and maintainability etc",Quantum computing
of the quantum application software,Quantum computing
"the qas that are
favorably impacted by qcp characteristics include performance and scalability",Quantum computing
"overall the specialized nature of qcps appears to have a significant impli
cation it limits the use of qcps for very specialized application areas where
performance qa is of chief importance",Quantum computing
"however because the quantum com
puting is undergoing rapid development we expect that the evolution of this
technology will likely introduce additional concerns and factors which may af
fect the architecture of quantum software applications",Quantum computing
"to make blind quantum computing protocols verifi
able mainly two different types of techniques have been
used",Quantum computing
the first type is so called the trap technique  ,Quantum computing
"alice hides some isolated qubits which are called “trap
qubits” in the register and later checks that trap qubits
are not disturbed by bob",Quantum computing
"since bob does not know the
place of each trap qubit he will disturb a trap qubit
with high probability if he deviates from the correct pro
cedure",Quantum computing
"if the quantum computation is encoded with
a quantum error correcting code the probability that
bob can change a logical state without changing any trap
qubit becomes exponentially small ",Quantum computing
"if bob wants to
change the state of a logical qubit he has to change more
than d qubits where d is the code distance",Quantum computing
"it increases
the probability of he touching a trap qubit",Quantum computing
"the second type of the technique is called the stabilizer
test    ",Quantum computing
"in the mf protocol bob generates
graph states and sends each qubit one by one to alice",Quantum computing
"al
ice randomly choses some of graph states and checks the
correctness of them by measuring stabilizer operators of
the graph state",Quantum computing
"such tests can be done with only single
qubit measurements of pauli operators    ",Quantum computing
"    that if alice passes
the stabilizer test a remaining state is close to the ideal
graph state on which she can do universal measurement
based quantum computing",Quantum computing
"in this way delegated quantum computing has two
important properties the blindness and the verifiability",Quantum computing
relations between them are still not clear,Quantum computing
"for example
the blindness was believed to be necessary to achieve the
verifiability but recently the belief has turned out to be
wrong since a protocol that is verifiable but not neces
sarily blind has been found ",Quantum computing
"another open problem is whether any blind protocol
can always be made verifiable or not",Quantum computing
"the bfk proto
col  can be made verifiable fitzsimonskashefi fk
protocol  and the mf protocol  can also be made
verifiable hayashimorimae hm protocol ",Quantum computing
"how
ever the ways of making these blind protocols verifiable
are protocol specific ie structures of the blind proto
cols are exploited to make them verifiable",Quantum computing
"if someone
finds a completely new blind protocol never seen before
can we always make it verifiable",Quantum computing
"in this paper we solve the open problem affirma
tively",Quantum computing
"we propose a “plugin” that makes any universal
blind quantum computing protocol automatically verifi
able",Quantum computing
our idea is based on the post hoc verification ,Quantum computing
"in the posthoc verification the prover sends the verifier
the solution of a problem and the feynmankitaev his
tory state  corresponding to the quantum circuit that
solves the problem or its complement circuit ",Quantum computing
"the
verifier can verify the correctness of the solution by mea
suring the energy of a local hamiltonian on the history
state",Quantum computing
"measuring energy of local hamiltonians can be
done with only single qubit measurements of pauli op
erators ",Quantum computing
"our idea is that alice generates the two
history states corresponding to the solving circuit and
the complement circuit by using the given universal blind
quantum computing protocol and asks bob to send them
to alice",Quantum computing
"she can learn the solution and verify its cor
rectness at the same time by measuring their energies",Quantum computing
"a
more precise description of the procedure will be given
later",Quantum computing
"we will also see that our verification technique is
different from and simpler than the two existing tech
niques ie the trap technique and the stabilizer tech
nique explained above",Quantum computing

"discussion 
 
the findings for the collaborative robotics project demonstrated that assigned group roles with an increase produced 
statistically significant positive effects on measured student motivation in relation to classroom discussion and usual 
instructional practices which both demonstrated decreases from pre to post mean scores",Robotics
"only assigned group roles 
produced statistically significant positive effects on measured collaborative problem solving in relation to usual 
instructional practices",Robotics
"the novice experience level was associated with statistically significant positive effects on 
measured student motivation and collaborative problem solving in relation to the experienced level",Robotics
"all interventions 
demonstrated positive effects on science process skills but not at a statistically significant level",Robotics
"the assigned group roles intervention included teacher reinforcement and a document outlining each role time 
manager materials manager project manager and data manager as well as detailed job responsibilities",Robotics
"in the 
present study the roles were also designed to balance quiet and dominant group members as encouraged by somyürek 
",Robotics
rotating the roles weekly was established to further promote equal distribution of the work responsibilities,Robotics
"the rotation of the roles provided each student in the group to experience the different roles rather than remaining in 
a single role the entire project",Robotics
"this may have helped students develop empathy and understanding of the various 
roles as well as an understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses",Robotics

et al’s  emphasis of structure during collaborative group work",Robotics
"the four roles included some responsibilities 
that were the same such as researching designing building and programming",Robotics
"in addition to each role having 
identical responsibilities each role had unique responsibilities created to develop and promote collaboration between 
the four roles",Robotics
"the division and sharing of job responsibilities created structure for the assigned group roles that 
supports eguchi  and mills et al",Robotics
 recommendations for collaborative robotics work,Robotics
"the roles were 
developed for educational purposes to develop a wide range of skills in each student",Robotics
"students were required to work 
on all areas of the collaborative robotics project rather than focusing solely on one area or on any areas of strength 
they may have had",Robotics
while this use of group roles is contrary to yuen et al,Robotics
" recommendations of focusing on 
students’ areas of strength the roles are used to promote new skills as well as developing existing areas of strength",Robotics
" addressed collaborative robotics in an informal educational setting and had different instructional 
purposes for group roles",Robotics
"furthermore the rotation of the roles may have increased motivation because students did 
not become complacent in one role and created a stronger support for collaborative problem solving",Robotics
"the positive 
results indicate that structure of the roles provided the necessary support and scaffold to meet the needs of the 
classroom setting while developing motivation and collaborative problem solving",Robotics
"the novice experience level was associated with a clear positive effect on motivation and collaborative problem 
solving",Robotics
"interestingly research with experience levels in robotics suggests that the novice students would have needed 
more supports than more experienced robotics students in order to recognize the same benefits eguchi  and 
yet the novice demonstrated more positive effects",Robotics
"though the positive effects for the novice was less significant 
the experienced had a decrease",Robotics
"perhaps the novelty of the collaborative robotics project could be responsible for 
higher post mean motivation scores",Robotics
"however it is difficult to identify potential reasons for the differences in post 
mean collaborative problem solving scores",Robotics
"post mean scores for collaborative problem solving should have been 
higher for the experienced and yet the experienced students showed a decrease in post mean scores while the novice 
students had a slight increase",Robotics
"perhaps additional supports and interventions need to be identified to continue the 
growth of these skills for experienced students",Robotics
"in addition students had to selfevaluate on the robotics expo  
pre ceenbot  adapted  student survey measure",Robotics
"students with experience with collaborative robotics projects 
may have overestimated their ability to complete the task in groups and had more realistic understanding during the 
post evaluation",Robotics
"the lack of any statistically significant difference in post mean scores for science process skills for interventions and 
experience level may be due to the overall low scores",Robotics
"with the potential for a total of  student scores ranged from 
 to ",Robotics
"the low scores may not have allowed for large enough difference to successfully identify a statistical difference 
between the interventions",Robotics
the fowler science process skills assessment was designed for middle school students,Robotics
"while some middle schools include fifth grade students the instrument may not have been the most appropriate 
measure for students in fourth and fifth grades",Robotics
"the potential issue with the instrument appropriateness may have 
made it difficult to identify effects of the interventions or experience levels",Robotics
"conclusion 
 
while the general method of instruction for collaborative robotics projects had promoted student benefits there was 
a need to evaluate the general method of instruction and determine if collaborative interventions could improve student 
outcomes",Robotics
"additionally with students using a form of robotics as early as first grade and the mindstorms as early as 
third grade understanding how to support the developing experience levels is critical for ongoing robotics instruction 
and development of an appropriate scope and sequence",Robotics
"the results indicate that the assigned group roles had a positive effect on student motivation and collaborative 
problem solving",Robotics
"while assigned group roles had not been previously used in the elementary engineering classroom 
for previous projects it will be used in future instruction and adapted for use with other collaborative projects",Robotics
"not 
all groups used the roles as effectively and some still struggled with the challenge of sharing the work and staying on 
task",Robotics
"however the structure offered with the assigned group roles seemed to provide students with appropriate 
guidance to stay on task if desired",Robotics
"furthermore the structure provided the teacher with appropriate guidance to assist 
students who may have been off task with a simple means of redirection",Robotics
"in the present study assigned group roles 
was the only intervention that had printed guidelines for students to keep in their engineering notebooks",Robotics
"perhaps a 
printed guideline for classroom discussions could be included in the intervention to offer appropriate sentence starters 
questions and reminders about classroom interaction expectations in order to better support that collaboration strategy",Robotics

robotics experience level also played an important part in student motivation and collaborative problem solving",Robotics
"the 
status of novice was associated with positive effects and consistently outperformed the status of experienced",Robotics
"understanding the supports needed for the varying experience levels is important in order to implement the appropriate 
instructional practices",Robotics
"it appears that additional supports are necessary for the experienced students in order for them 
to continue to make gains in learning motivation and collaborative problem solving",Robotics
"post mean motivations scores 
only showed an increase in the experienced for assigned group roles and the increase was minimal",Robotics
"only classroom 
discussion from the experienced had increased post mean scores for collaborative problem solving however not at 
a significant level",Robotics
overall additional investigation into supports for experienced students is warranted,Robotics

support the collaborative nature of the robotics project by reducing the potential for personal opinion to enter the 
discussions",Robotics

 introduction
for decades society has acknowledged the importance and relevance of robotics as it continues
to become a larger part of everyday life",Robotics
"in recent years many educational institutions
have begun to realize the importance robotics has in the world today and have started
to integrate robotics programs into their curriculum",Robotics
"in  our university worcester
polytechnic institute was the first ever to offer a bachelor of science in robotics engineering
",Robotics
"through robotics programs and industry the field continues to grow and develop but
these are not the only ways the field has advanced",Robotics
another way the field has advanced over the years is through robotics competitions,Robotics
"competitions cultivate a competitive and challenging environment that drive the innovation
and creativity necessary to develop new technologies",Robotics
"while most robotics competitions have
the intention of fostering creativity and innovation particularly at the collegiate level not
all of them are successful and sustainable",Robotics
"many collegiate robotics competitions have faced
problems that have led to renewal delays or even cancellation",Robotics
"these problems in part come
as a result of the rapid pace of technological advancement where challenges quickly become
obsolete",Robotics
"this interactive qualifying project delivers a proposal for a successful and sustainable
collegiate robotics competition hosted by worcester polytechnic institute wpi",Robotics
"we have
studied the successes and failures of other competitions and have gathered information from
potential participants sponsors and wpi stakeholders",Robotics
"we have developed this competition
to increase opportunity for undergraduate involvement in cuttingedge innovation and to
elevate wpi’s peertopeer recognition amongst other institutions",Robotics
"in the pursuit of our goals we have researched and discussed a broad range of general
questions and considerations",Robotics
"each of these hurdles have been addressed during the course
of our iqp
• what do we define as a ‘successful’ collegiate robotics competition",Robotics
• what causes some collegiate robotics competitions to fail while others succeed,Robotics
• what do successful collegiate robotics competitions have in common,Robotics
• what do failed collegiate robotics competitions have in common,Robotics
"• what do events outside of the academic world or even outside of the world of tech
nology do to be successful",Robotics
"are any of these design aspects transferable to the kind
of event we are planning",Robotics
"• how can we grow the scale of interest in this competition beyond people already active
in similar ones",Robotics
• how do we get potential sponsors interested in our competition,Robotics
• what can we do to encourage concrete undergraduate involvement in this competition,Robotics
• how will our competition interest peer institutions,Robotics
• what resources will be required to host our competition at wpi,Robotics
"by comprehensively answering these questions using effective methodology and by learn
ing from the triumphs and failures of others we have created a presentable roadmap for a
realistic implementable and impactful collegiate robotics competition hosted by wpi",Robotics
"background
in order to develop a successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competition at worcester
polytechnic institute wpi it is important to understand the background of the school
its robotics engineering program and other collegiate robotics competitions",Robotics
"it is also
important to understand why a collegiate robotics competition hosted by wpi is relevant to
the interests of the school and the benefits that a collegiate robotics competition hosted by
wpi can provide
 about worcester polytechnic institute
worcester polytechnic institute founded in  was established to provide the masses with
an exceptional science and engineering education",Robotics
"it was not until the late ’s that wpi
adapted its signature “plan” combining both theory and practice",Robotics
"doing this arms each
student with the ability to carry a wide range of theoretical knowledge mixed with industry
experience ",Robotics
"wpi’s curriculum structure is designed to foster teamwork rather than
harbor competition",Robotics
"part of this is wpi’s innovative robotics engineering program which
began in  and was the first of its kind 
 about wpi’s robotics engineering program
the robotics engineering program began in  offering just two courses",Robotics
"now it has grown
to include more than twenty courses combining the disciplines of computer science electrical
and computer engineering and mechanical engineering",Robotics
"it awarded its four bachelor’s degrees
in  to students who had switched majors into the program",Robotics
"in  the program awarded
 undergraduate degrees in robotics engineering adding to the total  bachelor’s degrees
awarded to date",Robotics
"in recent years the program has also expanded to the graduate level and
awarded  master’s degrees and  phds this past academic year 
 previous and existing collegiate robotics competitions
the following section conveys research into the most relevant collegiate robotics competitions
today providing insights into the resources needed for a collegiate robotics competition the
potential impacts of such an event and the potential benefits",Robotics
"this section also discusses
the factors that can attribute to a collegiate robotics competition’s success and provides the
groundwork for later sections where we use this information to present a solution to the
problems asserted in the introduction",Robotics
" first
the first robotics competition frc began in  when  teams from around new
england came together for the first frc season",Robotics
"since then frc has seen tremendous
growth and today has  teams in  countries with over  students ",Robotics
"although
it is a high school competition it is worth mentioning as it is the largest robotics competition
in the world ",Robotics
"frc tasks high school teams to design and build robots in six and a half weeks to play
a field game",Robotics
"the rules and game change every year but still fall within certain parameters
allowing teams to reuse base robots each year and only requiring designing and building
specific components",Robotics
" vexu
the vex robotics competition started in  by innovation first international to help
promote their stem education product line ",Robotics
"compared to the already existing first
robotics competition that was also available to high school students the robots were much
smaller and the rules varied considerably",Robotics
"for example for the first robotics competition
robots could be a maximum of  lb and individual parts could be sourced from multiple
suppliers as long as each individual part did not exceed  in cost  ",Robotics
"this differed
from the vex competition rules where there was not a weight limit and robots could not
be a larger than an xx inch cube at the start of the match only using vex brand
parts",Robotics
"this new competition found a home with many high school students as it was far less
expensive than first but more sophisticated than first lego league",Robotics
"unlike first
the participants in vex were not limited to a sixweek build season allowing them to spend
more time working on their robot designs and going to competitions",Robotics
after the vex robotics competition’s first year the program continued to grow,Robotics
"a new
nonprofit organization recf or the robotics education and competition foundation was
created in order to help organize competitive events",Robotics
"this allowed for the competition to
expand to middle school and internationally with more than  teams from more than
 countries competing in the various programs",Robotics
starting in  the vexu division was formed out of the existing vex competition,Robotics
"this new division was created specifically for college and university students with rules nearly
identical to the high school and middleschool level vex competitions but with greater
customization and flexibility",Robotics
"additionally this competition offered teams the ability to
work on realworld problems and engineer robotic solutions",Robotics
"through our research we have identified these factors that contribute to the success of
the vexu competition
• compared to most competitions the vexu competition is less expensive to participate
in since most teams spend a maximum of  per robot their first year",Robotics
– since the parts can be reused the cost of participating each year can decrease,Robotics
"• the competition grows every year with more teams and qualifying events from around
the world",Robotics
"for example in the upcoming  there will be a new vexu quali
fying event in singapore",Robotics
• the field is small xft and easy to set up it makes running events simple,Robotics
"through our research we have also identified the following drawbacks to the vexu compe
tition

• unlike the high school and middle school vex competitions vexu allows for sensors
supplied by outside vendors and d printed parts which allow for some creativity but
teams are still limited to vex brand parts for mechanical and structural components
which puts a cap on what is possible by teams",Robotics
"• the dynamics of the vexu competition are generally similar to that of a sports match
and have less relation to solving realworld problems",Robotics
" robomasters
the robomasters competition is one of the newest competitions we have researched having
only started in  by dji a worldwide quadcopter company based out of china",Robotics
"for the
first two years of the competition only chinese universities could compete but it was still a
huge success drawing in over  teams from more than  universities in its first year",Robotics
"its
rapid growth is largely due to dji who gave each team two kitbots which was the minimum
required to compete in the competition lowering the barrier to entry ",Robotics
"the field is much
larger x meters than other robotics competitions and each team is able to field up
to four robots and one quadcopter at a time",Robotics
"another major difference with robomasters
compared to most competitions is that each robot has a health bar and armor plates",Robotics
"if
these armor plates are hit by the opposing teams pellets then the health of the robot can
decrease and even disable it if the health of the robot is depleted",Robotics
"the structure of the
competition makes its dynamic similar to that of an esports event and brings in fairly large
online audiences in the tens of thousands",Robotics
"its international popularity has even produced a
japanese anime based on the competition",Robotics
"although the robomasters competition is the newest we have researched we consider
it as one of the most successful for the following reasons
• in its short run it has expanded from a chinese national competition to an interna
tional competition with more than  teams from more than than  countries",Robotics
"this
shows the competition only continues to grow",Robotics
"• dji assistance through two free kitbots and other various parts makes it easy for new
teams to join robomasters",Robotics
"• its interesting competition structure and dynamic brings elements popularized in es
ports to attract media attention",Robotics
"through our research we have also identified the following drawbacks to the robomasters
competition
• robomasters competition events only occur in china which can make participation
difficult for international teams",Robotics
"• besides the fully autonomous basebot the competition does not heavily focus on
autonomous robots or realworld applications as part of the competition",Robotics
"• although dji supports teams by supplying two kitbots most teams still spend up
wards of  which can make participation in robomasters difficult for some or
ganizations",Robotics
" robocup
robocup is a nonprofit organization led by a board of trustees a president and vice
presidents as well as a combination of committees designed to fill specific organizational
needs",Robotics
"robocup has hosted international robotics competitions annually since it was founded
in  ",Robotics
"robocup started as a competition for robots to play soccer against each other as
a demonstration of artificial intelligence capabilities and to inspire innovation in the industry",Robotics
"since then it has evolved to include more advanced challenges such as search and rescue
open industrial challenges and humanoid assistant competitions",Robotics
"it is clear that robocup aims to promote innovation and research in artificial intelli
gence through five different levels of the competition robocupsoccer robocuprescue
robocuphome robocupindustrial and robocupjunior",Robotics
"each league has a different tar
get demographic allowing for robocup to draw in a larger audience from primary school
students making dancing robots in the robocupjunior league to college students tackling
research and industrial challenges",Robotics
"within the robocupsoccer division there are further
divisions small middle size standard platform humanoid and simulation",Robotics
"this allows
organizations that choose to compete in robocup divisions that fit with their resources and
goals",Robotics
"robocup also promotes innovation and research by providing a database of publications
presentations and research from leading scientific journals and conferences in artificial intel
ligence",Robotics
robocup currently indexes  research articles from  authors,Robotics
"this provides
participants with accredited sources of information and research on which to base their de
signs and strategy",Robotics
"on their website they state that their database is “constantly updated
and they estimate to reach about  papers” ",Robotics
"robocup also takes into consideration their public image via a “news” section on their
website for the press",Robotics
"they hold databases of promotional newsletters announcements
images and videos for public and press use in order to promote their brand",Robotics
"robocup also
livestreams their events with commentary for international viewers that earn on average a
few thousand views per stream ",Robotics
"through our research we have identified the following factors for robocup’s success
• robocup has developed many divisions of multiple levels and interests in order to
make the competition available and appealing to a wide range of organizations",Robotics
"• robocup events have been held annually since its inception in  showing that
the competition has been sustainable",Robotics
"it is also the longest running competition we
researched",Robotics
"• the competition has consistently had around  teams from over  countries over
the course of the last decade",Robotics
"through our research we have identified the following the following drawbacks to the robocup
competition
• the robocupsoccer competition does not change its rules often making it possible
for teams with successful designs to continue to achieve while newer teams struggle to
compete on the same level",Robotics
"• even robocupsoccer small league requires a significant amount of resources to par
ticipate in",Robotics
many teams spend upwards of  for this division alone,Robotics
" robonation
robonation is a robotics community founded by the association for unmanned vehicle
systems international auvsi that offers multiple educational competitions and programs
",Robotics
"their mission is to allow middle school to graduate students to apply their stem and
robotics knowledge outside of the classroom through the various competitions they have to
offer such as
• robosub  autonomous robotic submarines fully built by students must complete
a difficult series of visual and acousticbased tasks",Robotics
"these tasks simulate the work
required of robotic subs in many facets of underwater activity ",Robotics
"in  robosub
saw significant participation at  registered teams ",Robotics
"• roboboat  student teams design autonomous robotic boats to navigate and race
through an aquatic obstacle course",Robotics
"the behaviors demonstrated by these boats mimic
tasks that are being developed for coastal surveillance port security and other types
of oceanographic operations ",Robotics
"• maritime robotx challenge  this international competition is designed to evolve
into a multiplatform competition that will include maritime aerial and submersible
tasks",Robotics
"currently the competition is primarily focused on autonomous surface vehicle
platforms and sensors ",Robotics
"• the national seaperch challenge  a high school and middle school competition
geared towards the construction and operation of remotely operated underwater vehi
cles to complete certain tasks",Robotics
"most of these vehicles are actually constructed from
kits as part of the educational program associated with the challenge ",Robotics
"• igvc intelligent ground vehicle competition  for this competition under
graduate and graduate students compete to design powerand construct an intelligent
ground vehicle that can follow lanes detect obstacles and follow waypoint navigation
",Robotics
"• suas student unmanned air systems  students research design integrate
and demonstrate an unmanned aerial system that is capable of autonomous flight and
navigation remote imaging and communication and execution of a specific set of tasks",Robotics
these tasks can include sensing detecting and avoiding obstacles ,Robotics
"• iarc international aerial robotics competition  the longestrunning colle
giate aerial robotics challenge in the world iarc advances autonomous aerial robotic
behavior through competition",Robotics
"for iarc international teams must create fully au
tonomous flying robots that demonstrate behaviors never before demonstrated while
completing missions with real world applications ",Robotics
"each competition is held annually with the same technological focus however they are
given different objectives which allow teams to maintain similar designs from year to year",Robotics
"each of the challenges mentioned have real world applications which holds relevance to the
competitors and companies in the industry of that respective competition",Robotics
"based on our research we have identified feel the following reasons attribute to the success
of robonation
• robonation consists of multiple competitions which allow organizations to participate
in the competitions that suit their interests",Robotics
"• since only the tasksobjectives change from year to year teams can use the same
design for their robot every year",Robotics
"this also allows newer teams to draw inspiration
from previous participating teams",Robotics
• all competitions have real world applications and are research based,Robotics
"through our research we have identified the following the following drawbacks to the robon
ation competitions
• robonation as a whole has not grown as the number of teams competing in challenges
has not increased in the last five years",Robotics
"• because of the scale and nature of the maritime robotx challenge it happens every
 years which is not ideal for many college organizations",Robotics
" nasa robotic mining competition
the nasa robotic mining challenge began in  as competition for undergraduate and
graduate students to develop a mining robot designed to navigate and operate on the martian
surface ",Robotics
"since then the competition has been held annually at the kennedy science center
and has consistently hosted  teams",Robotics
"through our research we have found that the following factors can be attributed to the
nasa robotics mining competition’s rmc success
• the robotics mining competition features both undergraduate and graduate level
competitions",Robotics
"• in its first year rmc offered teams  needbased grants for travel expenses and
supplies",Robotics
"• teams can win judge’s awards based on innovation and efficiency within their team
and design ",Robotics
"• rmc maintains eventspecific social media pages to promote their competition and
draw in viewers",Robotics
"• rmc live streams the events in order to reach a wide audience and potentially inspire
other students to join",Robotics
"through our research we have also discovered the following drawbacks to the nasa robotics
mining challenge
• the competition does not seem to have grown in size from year to year",Robotics
"• travel and material costs are high as teams are coming from around the country
making it difficult for lower budget colleges to enter",Robotics
" sae collegiate design series
the sae collegiate design series is a set of college competitions held by the society of
automotive engineers",Robotics
"the competition is designed to provide participants with an oppor
tunity to improve their engineering and project management skills outside of the classroom
",Robotics
"students who participate have a chance to show their engineering skills to companies
in the automotive industry land internships and even earn scholarships",Robotics
"the most popular
of these competitions are formula sae and baja sae",Robotics
"• formula sae  for this competition students are contracted by a fictional manu
facturing company to develop a formulastyle race car",Robotics
"the cars are evaluated as a
potential production item",Robotics
"the cars are targeted at nonprofessional weekend autocross
racers",Robotics
each team is expected to design build and test a prototype,Robotics
"within the for
mula division teams can choose to build various types of cars for different events",Robotics
"for
example teams have the option to build combustion engine vehicles electric vehicles
or hybrids and compete in the respective events for those divisions",Robotics
"the nature of
the events can change from year to year but the most consistent events include timed
races and endurance races to test how long the vehicles can last ",Robotics
"• baja sae  students are expected to build a singleseat offroad vehicle that will
survive the harshness of rough terrain",Robotics
"all vehicles are powered by the same  hp
engine from briggs stratton",Robotics
"the baja competition is not as large as the formula
sae competition but it is able to draw a different crowd to sae competitive events
",Robotics
"through our research we have found that the following factors can be attributed to the
success of the sae collegiate design series
• baja sae gives each team an engine allowing students to focus on the durability of
the car as well as lowering the cost of entry",Robotics
"• event locations on both the east and west coast of the us as well as international
events allow for more colleges to participate",Robotics
"through our research we have also discovered the following drawbacks to the sae collegiate
design series
• due to the nature of automotive engineering the cost of entry is very high making it
difficult for colleges with lower budgets to join",Robotics
"• the space required for this event makes it one of the hardest logistically to hold of the
competitions we have researched",Robotics
"• since teams work with car sized vehicles it can also be difficult to travel to competitive
events with all of the ideal equipment needed to maintain their vehicles",Robotics
"methodology
this sections outlines the methodology used to complete this iqp",Robotics
"each of these steps cover
a specific area in the development of a robot competition to be hosted at wpi
 background research
as part of our development process we spent much of our time researching previous and
existing collegiate robotics competitions",Robotics
"this research allowed us to better understand
several key topics
• the resources necessary to execute a collegiate robotics competition",Robotics
• what makes collegiate robotics competitions appealing to participants and sponsors,Robotics
• the benefits of a collegiate robotics competition for the host,Robotics
• the potential impact a collegiate robotics robotics competition hosted by wpi,Robotics
"• the factors that attribute to successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competi
tions",Robotics
"the background research on various collegiate robotics competitions can be found in
section ",Robotics
"of this report
 interview and discussions
in order to develop a successful and sustainable collegiate robotics competition at wpi it is
important to have discussions with parties that would be involved in the event",Robotics
"these par
ties include wpi stakeholders potential participants from other universities and potential
sponsors",Robotics
" wpi stakeholders
before work began on designing a robotics competition to be held at wpi interviews were
conducted of key stakeholders at the school who would be instrumental in making it a reality",Robotics
"the main stakeholders would be those who would have direct involvement in running the
competition and those who would benefit from the exposure",Robotics
"these stakeholders would be
directly involved in the execution of the event
• the robotics engineering program
• the robotics resource center
• corporate engagement
• touchtomorrow
the stakeholders that would potentially benefit from the event would be

• admissions
• marketing
• precollegiate outreach
• touchtomorrow
 wpi robotics engineering program
the robotics engineering program is the most obvious benefactor and stakeholder of a colle
giate robotics competition at wpi",Robotics
"the robotics engineering program faculty had valuable
insight on hosting such a collegiate robotics competition and on which key individuals we
should be speaking with",Robotics
" wpi robotics resource center
the robotics resource center at wpi is responsible for running every competitive robotics
event on campus such as first robotics competitions and formerly the nasa centen
nial challenge",Robotics
"their relevance to such events makes them a primary stakeholders for our
proposed event so it was critical for us to have discussions with them",Robotics
"the robotics engineering program would also have direct involvement in the event as
they could serve as a source of funding and volunteers in the form of students and professors",Robotics
"the robotics resource center and touchtomorrow would be the primary organizer of the
event and as such is a primary stakeholder",Robotics
" wpi admissions office
the nature of the wpi admissions office is to review students and admit them into wpi so
we decided to meet with them as we felt they had relevant information pertaining to student
statistics and interests",Robotics
" wpi office of precollegiate outreach
another benefactor of a robotics competition held at wpi would be precollegiate out
reach",Robotics
"precollegiate outreach designs programs for middle school and high school students
designed to help them explore the stem field and to ultimately get them inspired to choose
wpi when it’s time to apply to colleges",Robotics
" wpi office of corporate engagement
it was very important to have a discussion with the office of corporate relations as they
are the point of contact for many wpi benefactors and they should have a relevant opinion
on the subject of our iqp",Robotics
" potential participants
a competition is not a competition without participants which is why we conducted inter
views with representatives from  universities in order to better understand their interests",Robotics
"we wanted to find out what they would want to get out of a robotics competition as well
as how to make the competition as inclusive as possible",Robotics
"when finding interviewees from
each university we made sure they were representatives of a relevant stem organization
or involved in stem related activities on campus",Robotics
"because of this the representatives we
interviewed had a deep understanding of the resources available to students at their univer
sity and a relevant opinion on the kind of robotics competition their university would be
interested in participating in",Robotics
"while developing our competition we wanted to both make it interesting to peer insti
tutions with a reputation in robotics as well as universities that are new to the field",Robotics
"in
order to gain diverse range of opinions on the subject we planned to contact and interview
representatives from the following universities in relevant stem organizations

when interviewing each of these universities we asked the following questions to gain
a better understanding of the interests of potential participants and to help identify what
types of competitions wpi could ultimately host
• what is the member size of your organization",Robotics
• what is the annual budget of your organization,Robotics
• does your organization have membership fees,Robotics
• is competition travel covered by your school,Robotics
• do students have access to fabrication resources,Robotics
• what is your ideal frequency for the competition,Robotics
• how often do you feel the rules should change,Robotics
• what is your ideal date for a competition to take place,Robotics
• do you prefer an indoor or outdoor challenge,Robotics
• should there be robot to robot interaction,Robotics
• should there be a multirobot aspect to the competition,Robotics
• if you answered yes how many robots should there be,Robotics
• if you answered yes to a multirobot competition then should those robots be different,Robotics
• should there be any legged robots,Robotics
• should there be any underwater robots,Robotics
"• should robots be fully autonomous or should there be an autonomous portion to the
challenge",Robotics
"• if you answered yes to a multirobot competition then how many robots should be
fully autonomous",Robotics
" potential sponsors
another important aspect of developing a collegiate robotics competition at wpi is con
tacting potential sponsors for the event",Robotics
"through discussions with sponsors we gained an
understanding of how to make our competition appealing to potential sponsors how to form
relationships and eventually partnerships with them",Robotics
"throughout the course of the iqp we contacted the following companies in order to
understand what should be included in our event to properly incentivize sponsors
• irobot
• uber atg
• symbotic
• massrobotics
• new stone soup llc

",Robotics
"development and drafting
through our research we developed a proposal and plan of action for a collegiate robotics
competition hosted by wpi",Robotics
"we have developed severial documents for this iqp this report
which contains our findings as well as conclusions on them a rules handbook targeted
towards potential participants and includes details on each competition and a tentative
schedule and a logistics document which contains details on the resources necessary to host
this event",Robotics
"in developing a proposal for this event we have identified several main decision and
development points
• potential event dates
• potential competition locations
• proposed event schedule
• logistics plan
• sponsorship packages
• proposed competitions
• selected competitions
as part of this report we provide details for each of these points",Robotics
"findings
the following section describes the results of executing the methodology outlined in section
three of this report",Robotics
"it begins with an overview of our discussions with wpi potential
participants and potential sponsors",Robotics
"it then concludes with our work on a proposal for a
collegiate robotics competition to be hosted by wpi
 discussions and information gathering
this section summarizes the information gathered over the course of the iqp",Robotics
"it begins with
details on discussions with wpi stakeholders continues with details on discussions with
potential participants and concludes with details on discussions with potential sponsors",Robotics
" discussions with wpi stakeholders
before work began on designing a robotics competition to be held at wpi interviews and
discussions with key stakeholders at the school were conducted to identify event requirements",Robotics
"these stakeholders are the people and offices who would be directly involved in running the
event and those who would need to give approval for it",Robotics
" robotics engineering program
over the course of this iqp we had many discussions with key figures of wpi’s robotics
engineering program",Robotics
"many of these discussions were with two of our advisors for this iqp
professors nicholas bertozzi and brad miller during weekly meetings and outside discus
sions",Robotics
"they consistently provided valuable insight due to their knowledge of the industry
and experience with mentoring competitive robotics teams",Robotics
"the competitive robotics teams
they have mentored have participated in competitions such as the first robotics com
petition and the vex robotics competition",Robotics
"because of their experience and position as
robotics faculty our frequent discussions with them were extremely helpful in drafting the
competition",Robotics
"these discussions also kept the project on track by ensuring that the vision of
the competition stayed in the best interest of all parties involved",Robotics
"we also had several productive and insightful discussions with professor david cyganski
the interim director of wpi’s robotics engineering program",Robotics
"professor cyganski had been
involved with the program since its inception and had a good understanding of how to
represent the wpi robotics program well",Robotics
"professor cyganski advised that cost would be
a huge consideration when attempting to execute our event and that it would be best to
couple the event with a large existing wpi event such as touchtomorrow",Robotics
"this would
prove advantageous as both events could enhance each other in a variety of ways if hosted in
conjunction",Robotics
"he added that with since the nasa sample return challenge has ended and
is no longer a part of touchtomorrow adding a new competitive robotics event could be of
benefit for all parties involved",Robotics
"professor cyganski received the idea of having a collegiate robotics olympics with multiple
events positively",Robotics
"of his major opinions on the dynamic of the event was that he felt that
we should stray from having events such as combat robotics if we wanted all events to be

academic but he did admit having those as one of the events had the potential of bringing
a maker and hobbyist type of crowd",Robotics
"professor cyganski felt that having events that were
directly related to real world applications would represent wpi well",Robotics
"some examples of
these events would include a legged robotics challenge an underwater robotics challenge
and an item sorting challenge",Robotics
"he made it clear that if we were to have events like that
there proper planning was necessary in order to make it feasible for an event like that to
be executed successfully",Robotics
"the events would also have to be designed to be as accessible to
other universities as possible but should also remain fair to all potential participants",Robotics
"his
concern was that if undergraduate graduate and phd students were allowed to compete in
this competition then undergraduate students might be at a disadvantage",Robotics
"this is because
some graduate or phd students may have developed technology associated with a certain
event over the course of several years",Robotics
"his last major point in these discussions was that it
would be of high interest to wpi to market this sort of event to peer us institutions in
order to draw more domestic students into wpi’s graduate programs",Robotics
" robotics resource center
over the course of our iqp we had many discussions with colleen shaver the associate
director of the robotics resource center and one of the advisors for our iqp",Robotics
"as the as
sociate director of the robotics resource center colleen is in charge of the planning and
execution of many large robotics competitions hosted on wpi campus",Robotics
"such robotics com
petitions include one of the first lego league championships an annual first robotics
district event battlecry and the nasa sample return challenge",Robotics
"throughout the iqp
her knowledge and experience on running robotics events on wpi campus proved to be ex
tremely valuable in reaching our goals for this iqp",Robotics
"she consistently gave valuable insights
and feedback on the information we gathered and the competition proposal could not have
been drafted without her",Robotics
" wpi admissions office
as a benefactor of the potential outreach admissions materials created in the form of pic
tures and videos and the increased attention given to wpi from any robotics competition
held admissions was an important stakeholder in the event",Robotics
"we met with ashley johnson
and katie phung both assistant directors of admissions",Robotics
"ashley specializes in robotics
applicants and katie specializes in minority outreach",Robotics
"during the meeting various strategies were discussed on what what interests potential
high school applicants when it comes to robotics",Robotics
"due to the complicated and visual nature
of the subject videos were brought up as being an important tool",Robotics
"they allow high schoolers
to get excited when they see it for themselves",Robotics
"they saw a robotics competition held at wpi
as a great way of generating content for these videos as well as a mechanism for outreach to
potential domestic graduate students",Robotics
"they mentioned that the admissions office in general
would love a spectator element combined with interactive parts for potential high school
applicants",Robotics
" wpi office of corporate engagement
our main discussions with the office of corporate relations were with rachel leblanc the
vice president of corporate engagement",Robotics
"as mentioned in section  we thought it
was very important to meet with this office as they are the point of contact to many of
the companies and organizations associated with wpi",Robotics
"rachel leblanc also sits on the new
england board of the association for unmanned vehicle systems international auvsi",Robotics
"auvsi is an entity that heavily supports the advancement of robotic technologies and hosts
several robotics competitions and conferences",Robotics
"similar to david cyganski rachel felt that
auvsi and other potential sponsors would be heavily interested in a robotics competition
hosted at wpi",Robotics
"a robotics competition with different focused events would have the potential
of drawing in specific sponsors for each event",Robotics
"for example bluefin robotics an underwater
drone company may be interested in sponsoring an underwater drone challenge",Robotics
"hosting
challenges with real world applications would provide wpi with a good amount of peer to
peer recognition with similar universities",Robotics
"overall our discussions with rachel proved productive in connecting with potential spon
sors for our event and she felt that at a high level our proposed event was executable and
would provide many benefits for all parties involved",Robotics
" wpi office of precollegiate outreach
discussions primarily took place with sue sontgerath who guided us through the three main
avenues in place to direct middle school and high school students towards the school
• through parents
• through educators
• direct contact with students
in general the first two were far more effective than the third for offcampus outreach",Robotics
"she stressed that using “multiple touchpoints” is important because it brings precollegiate
students to the campus and wpihosted events as often as possible so that they associate
the the school with college when it comes time for them to apply",Robotics
"the event touchtomorrow
is one of the largest examples of this",Robotics
"the event brings thousands of students as young as
 from around new england to the campus and gets them introduced to the school and
the types of things undergraduates get to do",Robotics
"discussions also circulated around female inclusion in the event and the types of things
that work for that",Robotics
"sue mentioned that most of the research surrounding this says that
women have heavy interest in helping and improving people’s lives",Robotics
" discussions with potential participants
through our efforts we were able to interview  student representatives from  universities
including the ones we originally planned to interview listed in section  during these
interviews we made sure to answer similar questions in order to produce metrics that would
simplify drawing conclusions",Robotics
"the following universities were interviewed

• massachusetts institute of technology
• harvard university
• olin college
• stanford university
• duke university
• rice university
• university of pennsylvania

"only two of the  universities interviewed had
membership fees",Robotics
"these were both for vexu and at
ut austin and ut dallas",Robotics
"is competition travel covered by
your school",Robotics
"responses ranged from “no” to “sometimes” with 
of the answers being the latter",Robotics
"do students have access to
fabrication resources",Robotics
most universities have access to fabrication resources,Robotics
"these range from small makerspaces to fullfledged
machine shops",Robotics
"only  of the universities
interviewed do not have access",Robotics
"since these representatives would be potential participants of our competitive event we
felt it was important to ask their opinions on how the competition should be structured",Robotics
"the questions we asked every representative and a summary of those question responses can
be found in the table below
table ",Robotics
" potential participant opinions
question response summary
what is your ideal frequency for
the competition",Robotics
"all interviewed representatives preferred annual
frequency",Robotics
"this is because students are only in college
program for four years so an annual competition would
keep students engaged in the competition",Robotics
"how often do you feel the rules
should change",Robotics
"every representative felt that the rules of the
competition should change annually in order to keep
the competition interesting and engaging",Robotics
"what is your ideal date for a
competition to take place",Robotics
"all representatives felt a date during the summer
would be the best timing",Robotics
"most had a preference for
the beginning of the summerlate mayearly june
do you prefer an indoor or
outdoor challenge",Robotics
"all representatives felt that an indoor competition was
preferable",Robotics
"some felt that an outdoor competition is
interesting but did not like that it would be reliant on
the weather",Robotics
"should there be robot to robot
interaction",Robotics
"with the exception of a few representatives most felt
that robot to robot interaction should be a part of the
competition",Robotics
"should there be a multirobot
aspect to the competition",Robotics
"about  of representatives felt that there should be
a multirobot aspect to the competition",Robotics
"if you answered yes how many
robots should there be",Robotics
"about  of representatives felt that  robots would
be a good number to a multirobot competitions",Robotics
"the
other  felt fewer or more robots was ideal",Robotics
"if you answered yes to a
multirobot competition then
should those robots be different",Robotics
"all representatives that felt there should be a
multirobot competition said that the robots should be
different types",Robotics
"should there be any legged
robots",Robotics
"about  of representatives were interested in seeing
a legged robot competition",Robotics
"should there be any underwater
robots",Robotics
"all representatives were interested in an underwater
robotics challenge",Robotics
"should robots be fully
autonomous or should there be
an autonomous portion to the
challenge",Robotics
"about  of representatives felt that there should be
an autonomous portion of the challenge rather than
fully autonomous robots",Robotics
"if you answered yes to a
multirobot competition then
how many robots should be fully
autonomous",Robotics
"about  of representatives who were interested in a
fully autonomous robot thought all robots should be
autonomous while  felt only at least one robot
should be autonomous",Robotics
"only about  of representatives were interested in a
competition with alliances",Robotics
"most felt that if there were
alliances in the competitions it should not be
multirobot",Robotics
"the full interviews of each representativeincluding representative details can be found
in the appendix section of this report",Robotics
"based on the interviews we have made several conclusions that are fully outlined in
the section ",Robotics
"these representative interviews were extremely helpful in
understanding the capabilities of most universities and how to design the competition in a
way that will attract competitors and satisfy their interests",Robotics
" discussions with potential sponsors
over the course of our iqp we attempted to contact all the companies and organizations
we listed in section  we were not able to establish communication with all of these
groups but the following section outline the discussions we had with the groups we were
able to properly contact",Robotics
" uber atg
one of the potential sponsors we were able to contact was the uber advanced technologies
group",Robotics
"uber atg is the autonomous vehicle development division of uber based out of
pittsburgh pennsylvania",Robotics
"because of their mission to advance autonomous vehicle tech
nology we felt it was important to contact them about potentially sponsoring our event",Robotics
we were able to contact alan nuttle a senior engineer at uber atg,Robotics
"allan had previous
experience partnering with the first robotics competition and was heavily interested in
the prospect of sponsoring a collegiate robotics event",Robotics
"we felt that it would be best if uber
was a title sponsor for an autonomous navigation challenge and alan agreed",Robotics
"uber would
be interested in sponsoring a specific event and providing volunteers support in the form of
judges",Robotics
" irobot
we were able to reach out to lisa freed a public relations representative from irobot",Robotics
"through our communications with lisa we discovered that irobot does not sponsor com
petitive events monetarily",Robotics
"according to lisa irobot is focused more on participants rather

than the actual competition",Robotics
"if they were to assist in a competition at wpi they would
provide volunteers that would mentor or judge competitors of the competition",Robotics
"irobot feels
that as long as the competition is giving students the opportunity to find their passion be
it building coding team leadership or some other area of the stem fields it would be of
value to them",Robotics
"one last way irobot might participate in our event that lisa mentioned
would be by having a booth in an exhibition area for recruiting purposes",Robotics
" massrobotics
massrobotics is a robotics startup accelerator in the boston seaport district that was
founded less than two years ago",Robotics
"despite being so young massrobotics has made a large
impact in the robotics community and has more than a dozen different robotics companies
residing in their offices",Robotics
"because of their nature we felt that it was important to talk with
them and the companies they house as these parties could be potential sponsors of our
event",Robotics
"most of our communications were with joyce sidopoulos one of the directors of
massrobotics mainly in charge of their community programs",Robotics
"as a parent joyce was
interested in the prospect of a competition that would be in collaboration of touchtomorrow
and felt that the timing of the competition would be ideal for many",Robotics
"as an organization
massrobotics would be interested in having exhibition space for their multiple companies
and providing judges for the event",Robotics
"joyce also gave helpful competition design suggestions
such as gearing an underwater robotics challenge towards aquaculture a challenge their
company hydroswarm is trying to tackle",Robotics
"one of massrobotics’s residents is american
robotics an agriculture robotics company that utilizes drones to actively track crops",Robotics
"joyce
brought up the idea of this event to them and they were interested in seeing an outdoor
autonomous drone challenge that utilized computer vision to actively track some sort of
target",Robotics
" rita vasquez torres
over the course of this iqp we had several discussions with rita vasquez torres ceo
of engineering consulting company new stone soup",Robotics
"rita’s background and experience
provided a lot of insight while developing our competition",Robotics
"since rita had partnered with
the army and research institutions such as natick labs on many occasions she was confident
that our intent to have competitive events with real world applications was the best approach",Robotics
"overall she was satisfied with the initial proposal for our event and felt it would be successful
but she wanted our event to emphasize more than the technical aspect of things",Robotics
"in her
experience she felt that many bright engineers she had worked with lacked fundamental non
technical skills that are just as important as technical ones",Robotics
"she felt that it was important
to foster a business and entrepreneurial mindset in engineers so she suggested adding an
entrepreneurial aspect to our event",Robotics
"this event should emphasize real technology rules and
regulations currently set in place so that students will understand how to properly bring
technology to market and how to commercialize it",Robotics
" symbotic llc
symbotic llc is a warehouse robotics company based in wilmington ma",Robotics
"as of fall 
this company started a small collegiate competition of their own",Robotics
"this competition is struc
tured to be more like an engineering project but has increased their interest in working
with universities for future competitions",Robotics
"to discuss this topic we met with maggie weeks
symbotic’s marketing communications specialist and taylor smith one of symbotic’s cor
porate recruiters",Robotics
"through this discussion we learned that symbotic would be interested in
sponsoring a robotics competition of any kind and that they would most likely be available
to provide both monetary and volunteer support but more specific details about the final
event will be required",Robotics
"if symbotic were to sponsor an event they would like for the event
to focus on engineering undergraduate students and for students to have opportunities to
develop mechanical engineering hardware engineering and software engineering skills",Robotics
"from
a recruiting standpoint they see it as an opportunity to groom potential employees and see
what those potential employees have to offer",Robotics
"from a marketing standpoint they simply feel
that by being involved it would be a good opportunity especially since symbotic is starting
to become more public
 competition development
through our information gathering and discussions with stakeholders at the school potential
sponsors and participants we developed a proposal for a robotics competition to be held at
wpi",Robotics
"this section outlines this proposal and includes
• potential dates
• potential locations
• a proposed schedule
• general logistics requirements
• sponsorship
• initially proposed challenges
this section ends with a decision matrix to determine which proposed challenges should
be hosted in the first year of the event",Robotics
" potential dates
choosing a potential date for a robotics competition hosted at wpi was challenging as there
are a lot of factors to take into account",Robotics
"first the school year for wpi goes from april th to
may st with commencement on the th",Robotics
"any event in the summer would need to happen
after this date as the whole campus is reserved to that event",Robotics
"additional factors include
the dates that participating colleges adjourn for the summer and students start internships",Robotics
internships typically start at the beginning of june and go until mid august,Robotics
"through talking with potential participants and wpi stakeholders we concluded that the
ideal date for the competition would be late may to early june with the event starting friday
morning and ending saturday evening",Robotics
"this would make the event accessible to participants
with internships even by those traveling from outside of new england as it would allow
them to take thursday and friday off and return on sunday",Robotics
"late may to early june is also ideal for wpi as it would be after commencement and the
quad would no longer be in use",Robotics
"after we determined this time frame was the ideal date
we realized that having an event in conjunction would touchtomorrow would be ideal as it
typically takes place in early june and was originally created to be hosted in collaboration
with nasa’s centennial challenge in  and still has a strong theme of robotics even now
that the challenge is over",Robotics
" potential locations
if this competition were to be in collaboration with touchtomorrow then the following
locations that would be available for use
• harrington auditorium
• recreation center robot pits
• recreation center swimming pool
• riley commons
• wpi football field
• wpi rooftop field
• institute park
we had discussions with meredith merchant the assistant recreation director and fa
cilities director to determine if use of facilities such as the swimming pool in the recreation
center for a competitive robotics event would be possible",Robotics
"meredith was open to the idea
as long as the varsity swimming coach approved as well",Robotics
institute park would also be available for the event,Robotics
"for example the nasa centennial
challenge was held there and the entire park was fenced off",Robotics
"in order to organize this the
worcester parks and recreation center would need to be contacted in order to make sure
that the park was available for our desired event dates",Robotics
"the fees associated with renting the
park were fairly low and the it would be possible to fence it off",Robotics
" proposed competition schedule
through discussions with potential sponsors participants and wpi stakeholders we gath
ered information on what should be included in a robotics competition schedule",Robotics
"we also
determined that this event would be executed best if it occurred over the course of two days
to provide enough time to execute everything that should occur in such an eventin this

schedule there are several important parts that differ from most collegiate robotics compe
titions",Robotics
first we decided it was important to include networking events for participants,Robotics
"these events would be an opportunity for college students studying engineering with experi
ence in robotics to gain connections within industry",Robotics
"these connections would be especially
helpful for rising seniors when seeking out jobs during the coming school year",Robotics
"second
there will be keynote speakers at the provided lunches",Robotics
"these speakers will be experts from
industry discussing a relevant topic in the field of robotics",Robotics

 general logistics requirements
behind every successful event lies extensive organizational planning",Robotics
"we decided to create a
logistical plan to outline where when and how the events would be run in conjunction with
touchtomorrow",Robotics
"we first identified the required resources to run this competition
• volunteers
• event space
• event materials
• audio and video

the competition will require a wide variety of volunteers to operate smoothly",Robotics
"each
challenge will follow the same volunteer structure",Robotics
"the volunteer structure outlines the
expected tasks for each position and is as follows
• standard volunteers
– misc",Robotics
 volunteer positions that are to be determined to help with event flow,Robotics
"– av crew  in charge of lighting and audiovideo for challenge venues and
would be provided by lnl wpi’s av club",Robotics
– challenge reset  assists in challenge venue maintenance,Robotics
"– queuing  maintains time flow of each challenge by directing teams to necessary
destinations",Robotics
– referee  assists in upholding event challenge rules,Robotics
"– challenge admin  who teams checkin to and an informational guide for the
event",Robotics
"• judges
– robotsafety inspector  inspects robots and confirms if they comply to
eventchallenge standards makes sure that event is up to safety standards and
able to restrict teams from competing if they are in violation of safety standards",Robotics
"– technical judge  scores posters and the designs of team’s robots and evaluates
robot performance",Robotics
– scoring judge  maintains scoring of challenges,Robotics
"• key volunteers
– head referee  oversees all the referees for all challenges",Robotics
– head inspector  oversees all the inspectors for all challenges,Robotics
– head judge  oversees all technical judging for all challenges,Robotics
– emcee  master of ceremonies and narrator of challenges,Robotics
– field supervisor  in charge of field maintenance,Robotics
– volunteer coordinator  organizes and oversees volunteers for a challenge,Robotics
– challenge coordinator  also organizes and oversees volunteers for a challenge,Robotics
"the majority of the potential sponsors we contacted expressed intent to provide vol
unteers to help run the event",Robotics
"between our sponsors as well as volunteers from the wpi
volunteers we anticipate to have enough sponsors to staff our selected challenges",Robotics
one of the most important resources required would be funding,Robotics
"the main costs for
running the event would be materials for field construction as well as audio and video pro
duction for the event",Robotics
"all of the fields will be constructed out of basic materials such as
cardboard and plywood",Robotics
"below are the materials costs for the selected challenges

• indoor drone challenge  
• warehouse swarm challenge  
• miniature fire fighting challenge  
audio and video production will be provided by the student run club lens and lights
lnl",Robotics
"they have provided price estimates for each challenge location
• harrington auditorium  
• riley commons  
• robot pits  
based on our positive feedback from potential sponsors we believe that we can generate
the funds needed solely through sponsorship",Robotics
"this would allow the event to be cost neutral
to the school",Robotics
" sponsorship
in order to host a successful event it is vital to recruit sponsors that can provide resources
that will enhance the event",Robotics
"sponsors can provide support in the form of both monetary and
volunteer capacities",Robotics
"therefore in order to entice sponsors of different sizes we developed
sponsorship tiers based on what a sponsor provides for the event",Robotics
"these tiers were developed
in collaboration with colleen shaver one of our iqp advisors",Robotics
"a sponsor is considered within
a sponsorship tier if they provide at least one of the bullets under the following sponsorship
tiers
• standard

 proposed challenges
through discussions with potential participants we learned several key things about what
types of competitions they were interested in",Robotics
"first we learned that different schools with
were interested in different types of competitions of varying sizes",Robotics
"because of this we decided
that instead of designing one specific robotics competition we would propose designing and
hosting multiple",Robotics
"that way universities with different interests and resources could choose
which events they would want to compete in and still participate in the event as a whole",Robotics
"this would also allow us to ask potential contributors to sponsor a specific event relevant
to them",Robotics
"for example symbotic a warehouse automation company could sponsor an item
sorting challenge and could be entitled the “symbotic item sorting challenge”",Robotics
"another
important item we learned was that both potential participants and sponsors were interested
in competitions based on realworld problems",Robotics
"they felt that working on solutions to these
would provide students with relevant experience and make it easier to get sponsors",Robotics
"taking all of what we learned into consideration we went back to potential participants
and sponsors with numerous ideas for competitions and asked for their opinions",Robotics
"the fol
lowing is list of the competitions that stood out
• underwater robotics challenge
• allterrain robotics challenge
• itemsorting challenge
• indoor drone challenge
• fire fighting challenge
• autonomous vehicle challenge
• warehouse swarm robotics challenge
each of these competitions are based on current realworld problems that sponsors we
have been in contact with are currently working on",Robotics
" underwater robotics challenge
with the increasing demand for fish and the reduction of fish populations around the world
the aquaculture industry has grown to account for half of the world’s seafood",Robotics
"despite its
large success the aquaculture industry still face many problems today",Robotics
"for coastal aquaculture farms nets require constant inspection as they have a tendency
to break causing thousands of fish often nonindigenous to escape into local waters",Robotics
"this

causes both substantial losses to the farm and untold ecological problems",Robotics
"every aquaculture
farm also faces the problem of diseased fish",Robotics
"since there are no current systems to identify
and separate diseased populations farms have suffered heavy losses",Robotics
"this challenge was created in order to foster the development of technologies that solve
these problems as well as create a competition for universities interested in underwater
robotics",Robotics
"teams are tasked with building a robot to autonomously find and identify items
underwater",Robotics
these items could be waste or escaped fish,Robotics
"robots could also be tasked with
finding tears in a fish farm net",Robotics
"specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules
handbook",Robotics
" allterrain robotics challenge
for this challenge teams must build robots that are capable of traversing a variety of terrain",Robotics
"this is meant to simulate real life exploration and navigation problems as well as foster
technology geared for disaster relief",Robotics
"points will be rewarded based on how far each robot
travels",Robotics
"robots will not be required to complete each terrain track but an additional bonus
will be awarded",Robotics
there will also be an additional assessment task conducted by each robot,Robotics
specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules handbook,Robotics
" item sorting challenge
to accommodate the growth of ecommerce and demand for more efficient sorting and dis
tribution warehouse automation has grown to be one of the largest industries in the world",Robotics
with the advancement of automated technologies it only continues to grow,Robotics
"for this chal
lenge teams must build and design robots that will be able to pick and sort different objects
that might be found in a typical warehouse such as boxes and containers",Robotics
"specific details on
this challenge can be found in the rules handbook",Robotics
" miniature fire fighting challenge
fire fighting is one one of the most dangerous professions today",Robotics
"in order to foster the
development of technology that can complete firefighting tasks without a human individual
this challenge was created",Robotics
"for this challenge teams must construct robots that autonomously
navigate an “indoor maze” and extinguish a candle that is somewhere in the arena",Robotics
"the
rules for this challenge drew inspiration from the trinity firefighting challenge and specific
details on these rules can be found in the rules handbook",Robotics
" autonomous vehicle challenge
due to recent advancements the autonomous vehicle industry is currently experiencing rapid
growth and as such the demand for engineers in this field is growing",Robotics
"for this challenge
teams will build vehicles that will autonomously complete a small track and avoid obstacles",Robotics
specific details on this challenge can be found in the rules handbook,Robotics
" warehouse swarm challenge
swarm robotics is an active area of research in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence",Robotics
"it is based on the principle of emergent behavior seen in social insects such as ants and bees
were the actions of each individual are heavily influenced by those around them",Robotics
"swarms in
nature make use of many redundant separate entities to accomplish tasks that would have
been difficult to complete alone",Robotics
"this challenge will give college students the opportunity
to develop multirobot systems on a hardware and software level as well as specific software
skills such as computer vision and environment navigation",Robotics
"details on the competition are
in the rules handbook",Robotics
" indoor drone challenge
the market for unmanned aerial vehicles uavs is rapidly growing",Robotics
"companies like ama
zon who is working on uavs to deliver packages from warehouses directly to consumers
in minutes and uber who is working on uavs to transport people from place to place
on demand are spending millions of dollars on development  ",Robotics
"this challenge tasks
teams to build a miniature autonomous drone to navigate within a mock city and transport
packages from a pickup location to a destination",Robotics
"specific details on the competition can be
found in the rules handbook",Robotics
" existing competitions
based on feedback to augment the new robotics competitions we are proposing we decided
to add an already existing competition",Robotics
"this would allow participants of these competitions
to enter their alreadybuilt robot a second time for another chance to compete",Robotics
"the following
are competitions we have considered
• trinity fire fighting robotics challenge
• sparkfun autonomous vehicle challenge
• drone racing
• vex robotics competition
• smart mouse maze competition
 engineering design judging
for each event we decided there should be a judging section to augment the performance
of the robot in the competition",Robotics
"for this teams will have the opportunity to present their
engineering design process and their overall approach to the challenge they competed in",Robotics
"we
outlined the following topics for teams to demonstrate for this judging
• understanding  define the problem
• define  determine solution specifications

• ideas  generate concept solutions
• prototype  learn how your concepts work
• choose  determine a final concept
• refine  improved design
• implement  implement the detailed solution
• test  does the solution work",Robotics
• iterate  are there changes between iterations,Robotics
"based off our research of other competitions and discussions with relevant parties we
decide that the best way for teams to demonstrate the factors listed above would be in the
form of a technical paper and a poster that would be reviewed before and during the event
respectively",Robotics
additional details are available in the rules handbook,Robotics
" competition survey results
as mentioned before our research and initial discussions with teams led us to discover
there was interest in a variety of competitions",Robotics
"in order to accommodate these interests we
decided to create proposals for each",Robotics
"however if this event were ever to be hosted it would
be unrealistic to host all of the challenges we created in the first year so we decided to choose
only three of them",Robotics
"this decision was made with our advisors and was intended to focus
our proposal for a competitive robotics olympics",Robotics
"in order to determine which three of the
competitions we should focus on we created a rubric that compared each of the challenges
we created",Robotics
"this rubric considered the following factors
• potential cost to competitors
• interest of potential participants
• resources required to host event

 conclusions and recommendations
this section outlines the conclusions and findings of this iqp",Robotics
"it begins with an overview of
our conclusions based off the background research on other collegiate robotics competitions
discussions with potential participants and sponsors and interviews with key stakeholders
at wpi",Robotics
"next we will give an overview of our selected competitions based off feedback from
interviews and survey results on drafted competitions",Robotics
"we conclude by explaining how this
proposal fits within the greater wpi ecosystem and recommendations for future work
 what we discovered
through background research on popular collegiate robotics competitions discussions with
potential participants and corporate sponsors and stakeholders at wpi we discovered several
key points about hosting a robotics competition
• based on our research we identified that successful competitions typically have been
around for many years are audience friendly and are based on realworld problems",Robotics
"• our initial interviews showed that potential participants had a wide range of interests
prompting us to develop proposals for several competitions in the context of hosting
them at wpi",Robotics
"• after developing these proposals and discussions with wpi stakeholders such as the
robotics resource center we decided it was unrealistic to host all seven of the chal
lenges we initially proposed",Robotics
"• surveying potential participants on each of these proposed events helped to determine
which were both the most popular and feasible for both the competing university
students and sponsors",Robotics
"• with these survey results we chose three challenges that struck a balance between
the required resources for wpi to host popularity cost for participants to enter and
sponsor interest
 selected challenges
as mentioned in the previous section through survey results and the decision matrix outlined
in section  we discovered that potential participants had a wide range of interests",Robotics
"as
such three of the seven proposed challenges in section  were selected
• indoor drone challenge
• warehouse swarm challenge
• miniature fire fighting challenge
these challenges provide a good balance between feasibility and the resources required
for wpi to host potential participant interest and the resources required to enter",Robotics
"they
also help develop skills that are highly relevant in the robotics industry and experience with
them would put participants at an advantage when seeking a job",Robotics
" indoor drone challenge
the first of the selected challenges is the indoor drone challenge",Robotics
"this challenge would task
participating teams to build a miniature autonomous drone to transport packages from a
pickup location to a destination",Robotics
"this is designed to simulate tasks that companies like uber
and amazon are building fullsized drones for",Robotics
"this miniature scale of this competition is
important because it means that
• low cost to host  one of the largest benefits of an indoor drone challenge is the
low cost to host",Robotics
"the resources required to host this competition are as follows a 
by  by  foot indoor netted space cardboard boxes to be used as obstacles and a
grid on the floor made from tape and plywood",Robotics
"• low cost of entry  for those looking to enter this challenge the cost to entry is
relatively low due to the high availability of parts",Robotics
"it is estimated that teams would
have to spend between  and  on hardware depending on the size of the
drone the compute modules chosen and selected sensors",Robotics
• marketable skills  for this challenge the skills developed are mostly softwarebased,Robotics
"these skills include computer vision obstacle avoidance and advanced autonomous
navigation",Robotics
"mechanical skills are also developed such as designing impactresistant
systems and with general computer aided design",Robotics
"• spectator value  highest among all selected challenges is the spectator value of
drones",Robotics
"for example drone racing has grown to become highly popular in the last
few years with it expected to keep growing as companies such as espn beginning to
broadcast it ",Robotics
" warehouse swarm challenge
the warehouse swarm challenge would task participating teams to create both a hardware
and software platform for five robots to interact with a miniature warehouse and pick up
and deliver packages from and to specified locations",Robotics
"this challenge was chosen because
• low cost to host  as with the indoor drone challenge the warehouse swarm challenge
also has a low cost to host",Robotics
"the resources need are as follows up to  by  foot
indoor space and several boards with miniature packages and shelves to simulate the
warehouse",Robotics
"• low cost of entry  again like the indoor drone challenge this challenge has a low
cost of entry for participating teams",Robotics
"the hardware required are all fairly simple with
components readily available",Robotics
"it is estimated that teams would have to spend between
 and  on hardware depending on the complexity of mechanisms sensors
and compute modules",Robotics
"• multirobot challenge  this challenge satisfies the interest we had for a multirobot
competition with the potential of collaboration with other teams possible",Robotics
"• marketable skills  skills developed through participation in this challenge are both
mechanical and software based",Robotics
"software skills such as computer vision obstacle avoid
ance autonomous navigation and swarm algorithms are developed with mechanical
skills such as computer aided design and the design of mechanical manipulators",Robotics
" miniature fire fighting challenge
the miniature fire fighting challenge would task participating teams with creating robots to
seek out and extinguish a flame on a small tabletop field",Robotics
"it was primarily chosen because it
would allow existing participants of the trinity fire fighting competition have their robots
compete for a second time",Robotics
"this challenge would also have the following benefits
• low cost to host  as with the other two proposed challenges the miniature fire
fighting challenge has a low cost to host",Robotics
"the resources required to host this competi
tion are as follows a  by  foot indoor space and several boards with the layouts
described in the rules handbook",Robotics
• low cost of entry  this challenge has a low cost of entry for participating teams,Robotics
the hardware required are all fairly simple with components readily available,Robotics
"it
is estimated that teams would have to spend between  and  on hardware
depending on the complexity of mechanisms sensors and compute modules",Robotics
"• low difficulty  this challenge was originally targeted at high school students so the
expected technical difficulty is low",Robotics
"• marketable skills  skills developed through participation in this challenge are both
mechanical and software based",Robotics
"software skills such as computer vision autonomous
navigation and obstacle avoidance would be developed as well as basic mechanical
skills such as computer aided design
 future work and implementation
this iqp identified three robotics challenges that wpi could feasibly host in a first iteration
of a collegiate robotics competition when and where it could take place on campus and how
it could be funded",Robotics
"the actual execution of our proposed competition was not in the scope of
this iqp so an actual committee should be formed to execute the event for the first time",Robotics
"this
committee would ideally include key members from offices of touchtomorrow corporate

"this arises from the impact of such operations 
whether it has improved or worsened the life of the people in the community",Social engineering
but sadly this is less practised in the delivery of construction projects,Social engineering
"pavez 
and alarcon  observed that most construction management methods 
focus more on the contract and project with little or no concern on the social 
elements that relate to the people and the community",Social engineering
"globally there are now laws and regulations encouraging the built 
environment sector to move towards social value creation",Social engineering
"for instance in the 
usa we have the energy policy act of  and the energy independent and 
security act of  in the uk the inequality and diversity act of  and the 
public services social value act  within the eu there is the sustainable 
procurement directive  among others",Social engineering
"even with these the current 
understanding and conceptualisation of social value especially in the context of 
delivering a construction project still remains unclear",Social engineering
"for instance the term 
corporate social responsibility csr and shared value are sometimes used to 
mean social value",Social engineering
"although georgeson  criticised such narrow 
perception on social value it shows the concept is not yet well understood in the 
construction industry sector",Social engineering
"it has been reported in the uk australia and the usa that construction is 
the sector showing the least commitment to social value creation villeneuve
simth and chung  kernot and mcneill  barraket et al  clark 
and ucak ",Social engineering
"however loosemore  argues that the construction 
industry is well positioned for delivering social value objectives from its 
operations",Social engineering
"for example the construction industry is the world’s largest 
employer largest employer of youths and it has the capacity to create local jobs 
in the communities of operation loosemore a",Social engineering
"despite these 
opportunities the concept of social value is yet to receive attention from 
construction management researchers loosemore a",Social engineering
"according to 
dreveland and lohne  lack of clear understanding of value and its 
associated concepts such as social value could make detailed discussion on it 
difficult and invariably its application and practice would be limited",Social engineering
"in recent times the lean construction approach has shown to be a viable 
means of creating value and minimising waste on construction projects 
bertelsen  koskela ",Social engineering
"previous studies have also explored and 
shown links between lean construction and sustainable practices johnsen and 
dreveland  fuenzalida et al  maris and parrish  wu and 
wang  huovila and koskela ",Social engineering
"however very limited studies have 
explored the role of lean construction approach as a means to creating ‘social 
value’ in the built environment",Social engineering
"also there is generally less discussion on social 
value in construction management literature loosemore  and recent 
reports indicate that social value awareness is still low burke and king

surrounding social value through a critical literature review",Social engineering

findings from a review of the literature on the current knowledge surrounding 
‘social value and its drivers",Social engineering
"it discusses the relationship between social value 
csr and shared value",Social engineering
"additionally this study aims to show how the lean 
production concept of customer could be used to support social value 
realisation in the delivery of construction projects",Social engineering
"the key research questions 
addressed are  
 what is the current understanding surrounding social value delivery",Social engineering
" how can lean approach support the realisation of social value delivery 
on construction projects",Social engineering
"this paper extends the ongoing debate around social value from construction 
management and lean construction perspectives and contributes to the literature 
on social value in construction management",Social engineering
"more importantly it creates a new 
insight into how social value can be realised in construction project delivery 
using lean production philosophy",Social engineering
"the paper is structured thus the first section 
discusses the current knowledge surrounding social value",Social engineering
"the section examines 
the concept of social value the need for social value its current drivers and the 
relationship between social value shared value and csr",Social engineering
"the second section 
examines the role of lean approaches in delivering social value on construction 
projects",Social engineering

",Social engineering
"in order to explore the current knowledge around social value and 
provide an insight into the ongoing debate from construction management and 
lean construction perspectives a critical literature review approach was adopted",Social engineering
"grant and booth  confirmed that critical literature review allows for the 
synthesis of materials from different sources allows for a degree of analysis and 
conceptual innovations provides a conceptual contribution to existing body of 
knowledge and serves as a launch pad for new research",Social engineering
"these attributes of 
critical review align with the focus of the current study",Social engineering
"however critical review approach has been viewed to be unsystematic 
grant and booth ",Social engineering
"to overcome this in the current study a review 
strategy was developed",Social engineering
"purposive and snowballing sampling approach was 
adopted in selecting studies included in the review bryman  sanders 
",Social engineering
"purposive sampling approach enables the researcher to select the 
population articles or studies that are relevant in answering the research 
questions",Social engineering
"the goal here is not in the quantitative or statistical analysis of the 
studies rather it is in the interpretative analysis of the study included",Social engineering
"this 
means the focus of the literature search would not be rigid as in systematic 
reviews tranfield et al ",Social engineering
"this approach allows a search of as many 
sources as possible and to identify relevant materials that answer the research 
question",Social engineering
"grant and booths  argued that the essence of a critical review 
is not in quality assessment of the studies but to interpretively analyse the 
studies included and provide a conceptual contribution",Social engineering
"the focus of the current 
study is to make a conceptual contribution to the current knowledge around

social value from construction management and lean construction perspectives 
through interpretive analysis of the studies included in the review in order to 
answer the research questions",Social engineering
"additionally sanders et al  show that 
the snowballing approach is used when it is difficult to identify the members of 
the proposed population for the study from the onset",Social engineering
"in this study snowballing 
approach was used to identify other relevant articles and materials through a 
close examination of the reference lists and bibliographies of already identified 
relevant studies",Social engineering
"the population for the study was literature that focuses on social value and 
lean in mainstream management science construction management and lean 
construction",Social engineering
"in achieving this a robust literature search protocol that selects 
publications based on source and its relationship to the study research question 
was developed",Social engineering
"this includes combining key terms from the study and 
subsequently searching on databases perusing of the identified paper abstract 
and snowballing of relevant study reference lists and bibliographies",Social engineering
"through this 
process relevant materials that align with the research question were identified 
and critically reviewed",Social engineering
"a search of the literature was done using online databases emerald 
elsevier scopus google scholar willey online taylor and francis online",Social engineering
"in 
addition peer review articles from the international group for lean group for 
lean construction iglc publications and relevant materials that answer the 
research questions were identified",Social engineering
"the search was conducted between january 
and december ",Social engineering
"a number of terms and combination of terms that align 
with the topics were used in the search",Social engineering
"these include but not limited to ‘social 
value ‘social value in construction project lean project delivery ‘lean thinking 
‘value in lean construction ‘value in construction ‘customer in lean production 
‘lean production ‘shared value ‘corporate social responsibility ‘lean 
construction and social value ‘sustainable construction ‘drivers for social 
value and ‘social value theory",Social engineering
"the articles reviewed were those published in 
english language and that align with the topic",Social engineering
"however it emerged from the search that not much had been documented 
on the social value on some of these databases and journals especially in 
relation to construction project delivery",Social engineering
"for instance a purposive search on the 
term social value in the journal of construction management and economics 
revealed only  papers",Social engineering
"again this confirms that the concept of social value is 
still at an infant stage in construction management literature loosemore 
a ",Social engineering
"as a consequence the search was extended to include 
government reports technical reports and website materials on social value",Social engineering
"this was done to gain an indepth understanding of the current debate around 
social value and to ensure no available relevant materials were omitted",Social engineering
"a total 
of  studies were critically reviewed",Social engineering
"current knowledge surrounding social value 
the concept of social value 
there is a lack of absoluteness in the definition of ‘social value’",Social engineering

choi et al  social value is complex to define due to its intricate and

"nevertheless various reports and research publications have

attempted to offer definitions and explanations on the concept of “social value” 
as presented in table ",Social engineering
"the table presents the definitions of social value and 
the emerging themes found from the several definitions",Social engineering
"the publications in 
table  are categorised into two government publications nonresearch 
publications and research publications",Social engineering
"analysis of the definitions and emerging 
themes from both government and research publications show that in order to 
create social value every business should consider how its operation would 
improve the social economic and environmental wellbeing of the communities 
where they execute their business",Social engineering
"applying this to construction loosemore and 
hoggin  reiterate that the goal of construction firms therefore should 
not only be to make profits and improve productivity for its stakeholders but it 
should include engaging and improving the communities where they build",Social engineering
"notwithstanding table  confirms the previous assertions that there is no 
absolute definition of social value loosemore  choi et al ",Social engineering
"for 
instance from the government publications it can be seen that social enterprise 
uk seuk views social value as ‘thinking on how scarce resource should be 
used which is too broad",Social engineering
"on the other hand the social value definition provided 
by hmrc was definite on three elements social economic and the environment 
as the focus of creating social value",Social engineering
"it is worth remarking that the need for sv 
measurement was highlighted in most of the research publications definitions",Social engineering
"but this was not clearly mentioned in government publications definitions of 
social value",Social engineering
"this could be due to the empirical nature of the research 
publication studies and the increasing understanding of the need for measuring 
the social impact of an organisations operations",Social engineering
"in addition to social value 
measurement some authors argued in their definitions that social value is 
beyond compliance with csr by organisations loosemore  a",Social engineering
"the 
emphasis on the need for measuring social value from the research publications 
shows that it is not sufficient to just include the social value in a contract 
strategies for measuring it should also be put in place",Social engineering
"furthermore table  reveals that despite the current understanding on 
social value there is still no clear or single criterion for measuring social value 
retolaza et al  loosemore and hoggin  choi et al ",Social engineering
"this 
means the criteria to be used in measuring or identifying social value and the 
additional benefits to be created as stated in some of the definitions of social 
value in table  could differ for different context and audience",Social engineering
"it is no surprise 
choi et al  assert that social value is very elusive compared to economic 
value as there is lack of objective approach to measuring its outcomes",Social engineering
"according to burke and king  subjectivity in social outcome could limit 
objective measurement in social value as situations and events could change in 
the process",Social engineering
"this implies that there should be no prescriptive approach in defining the 
supposed additional benefits mentioned in the definition of social value above 
rather the nature of the stakeholders in the community context and situations 
should define the additional benefits expected from the process",Social engineering
"the implication 
of this for construction organisations in the delivery of its project is that the

the project environment rather they should be identified through direct 
engagement with the stakeholders in the community",Social engineering
"however this is less 
practised by construction organisations",Social engineering
"georgeson  observed that 
traditionally organisations use a topdown approach to decide what to provide 
for a community as part of their csr",Social engineering
"however this is contrary to the bottomup 
approach advocated in social value practice",Social engineering
"the need for delivering social value 
the need for delivering products and services with regard to the impact on the 
economy the environment and social wellbeing of the community is increasing 
in every sector choi et al  fernandes et al ",Social engineering
"according to ghazali 
 organisations that do not care for the environment or contribute to the 
wellbeing of the community could have their services and products boycotted 
and image degraded",Social engineering
"this suggests that companies can engage in the creation 
of social value to increase or improve their social image in the eyes of 
stakeholders",Social engineering
"however it has been observed that the commercial sector is 
reluctant to practice social value as it is usually seen as a separate entity from 
an economic value choi et al ",Social engineering
"this view is also supported by the 
separation theory friedma   where companies are seen only as a 
contributing engine to the economic function with less attention to their social 
roles",Social engineering

calling for the consideration and inclusion of social value practice in businesses 
choi et al  croydon council ",Social engineering
"these demands for creating social 
value alongside economic value are increasing",Social engineering

value is now a growing organisational issue with five different groups identified 
by the g to be interested in social value the social impact investment 
taskforce ",Social engineering
"the groups include government foundations social sector 
organisations impactdriven businesses and impact investors",Social engineering
"tomlins  
further described the impactdriven businesses and impact investor groups to be 
customers and users",Social engineering
"in construction project delivery the impactdriven 
business group can be those the construction operations directly or indirectly 
affect",Social engineering
"these groups would expect commitment and contribution to the delivery 
of social value to the community and the environment from construction 
companies operating in their vicinity",Social engineering
"according to ofori et al  
consideration for the environment by construction organisations would certainly 
change the way construction projects are executed",Social engineering

shown that the construction industry is reluctant about this and more concerned 
about the shortterm cost benefit from projects choi et al  ofori et al

there is lack of clear integration between the economic and social views in the 
separation theory",Social engineering

foundation of the company’s operation only lies in the economic gain rather than 
in value creation retolaza et al ",Social engineering

commitment to the creation of social value could have been influenced by this 
socalled separation theory",Social engineering

has been heavily criticised",Social engineering
"freeman  called for a shift in the previous 
practice and advocated the need for complete integration of economic and social 
values in the operations of an organisation",Social engineering
"this implies companies should not view the creation of social value as a 
separate operation from the economic value it hopes to deliver to its 
shareholders rather both should be incorporated and delivered as a system 
with a goal of influencing the society at large",Social engineering

business organisations cannot function in a social vacuum but must definitely 
interact with the communities and the environment where they operate",Social engineering

creation of value is not only for the companys shareholders but also to the 
society and the environment",Social engineering
"this position has great implication for construction 
clients main contracting companies and supply chain companies in their 
operations",Social engineering

supply chains to specify how each of their operations would fulfil the economic 
social and environmental needs in the delivery of their activities right from the 
economic value proposition stage",Social engineering
"this means the economic value proposition 
should not be separated from the social value in the business case",Social engineering

organisations to survive in the present day reality they must pay attention to 
ethical issues social value in the delivery of projects",Social engineering
"this could be demonstrated in new build maintenance infrastructure 
projects and other operations in construction project delivery",Social engineering

theory requires that generation of economic value should be clearly linked with 
the social elements",Social engineering

extension of economic value as advocated in the separation theory friedman

supply chains performance should not be limited to the four project key 
performance indicators time cost quality and safety alone",Social engineering

approach",Social engineering

"search in lean production approach 
 
various authors have described extensively the evolution of lean production and 
the tps in the manufacturing industry shah and ward  womack and 
jones ",Social engineering
"the goal of lean production is to add value and eliminate waste 
from the product right from design through to the manufacturing or production 
stage",Social engineering
"however shah and ward  cautioned that lean production should 
not be viewed as waste elimination alone but rather as an integrated process 
that considers both the product and the processes involved in developing the 
product",Social engineering
"this implies that the focus of lean production is not just on the final 
product but also on the processes that culminate in the development of the final 
product",Social engineering
sadly this view is less upheld in the delivery of construction projects,Social engineering
"according to kagioglou et al  construction project delivery focuses more 
on the final product than on the processes involved in delivering it",Social engineering
"the social 
value on the other hand emphasises the need for every construction project to 
critically consider the processes involved in the delivery of its final product with 
the goal of creating a positive influence on stakeholders in the community the 
local economy and on the physical environment",Social engineering
"in the toyota production 
system tps this entails recognising the problem that would impede flow in the 
production and incorporate it as a task in the production process spear ",Social engineering
"this implies understanding the impact of a construction project on the local 
community the local economy and the environment and integrating them into 
the project execution process would support better value delivery from the 
construction project",Social engineering
"from the foregoing it could be argued that the lean production approach or 
view has more potential to support the achievement of social value delivery on 
construction project compared to the current traditional view that dominates 
construction project delivery",Social engineering
"this is because the latter focuses more on the 
product than the process involved in delivering it farag et al  ballard and 
howell  kagioglou et al ",Social engineering
"however the view of likening the 
manufacturing industry lean production to the construction industry projects is 
not accepted by all",Social engineering
"for example gann  opined that construction 
products are usually large and immobile this implies that construction products 
are created at the point of consumption unlike manufacturing where materials 
are fully produced in the factory before sending it to the market",Social engineering
"although 
salem et al  agreed that there are clear differences between the 
manufacturing and the construction industry they conceded that both 
operations involve ‘production and ‘services with the aim of meeting customer 
demands and requirements",Social engineering

manufacturing and the construction industries can be seen as production 
systems that use processing points and hand over partially completed work to

"but in lean production the customer also includes 
people who are on the production line",Social engineering
"with this understanding the concept of a customer in construction project 
delivery could be widened to include the local communities the local economy 
and the physical environment where the project is undertaken",Social engineering
"for instance 
salvatierragarrido and pasquire  challenged the construction industry to 
move away from the project based context to a more global context that 
adequately considers the impact of construction operations on the wider 
customer or community",Social engineering
"furthermore spear and bowen  from their 
study that explores the dna of the tps show the importance of identifying the 
customers on the production line so as to design the production system to suit 
them",Social engineering
"this helps in the maintenance of a smooth flow in the production system 
and also shows the essence of considering the wider customer a construction 
project could impact",Social engineering
"this view is also supported by an earlier call by ofori 
 that the construction industry should include consideration for the 
environment as the fourth objective of measuring project performance in 
addition to cost quali y and time",Social engineering
"this entails embedding the culture of caring 
for the environment and people living in the environment",Social engineering
"similarly close and 
loosemore  called on the construction industry to view the communities 
where they operate as an asset rather than a liability",Social engineering
"this means in delivering 
social value from a lean production perspective the community and physical 
environment should be viewed as customers",Social engineering
"despite this call the construction 
industry has not really changed its approach to project performance 
measurement indicators",Social engineering
"it could be argued that the nonconsideration of social 
value as an activity that contributes to the achievement of project goals could 
have contributed to lack of sv delivery on construction projects porter and 
kramer ",Social engineering

argued that to deliver viable value in the built environment effort should be 
extended to improve the social economic and environmental wellbeing of the 
inhabitants during the design and delivery process",Social engineering

attention to the abovementioned factors in construction project delivery cannot 
be overemphasised as its absence usually leads to what awakul and ogunlana

communities and ngos situated around the project",Social engineering

positive impact on community wellbeing the loyalty of stakeholders resource

"there are two main types 
of se attacks the targeted and target of opportunity bullée montoya pieters junger  hartel ",Social engineering
"a targeted 
attack is the one in which the attacker is very specific in terms of the victim while a target of opportunity attack is 
the one in which the attacker distributes to a lot of people hoping to get response from as many victims as possible",Social engineering
se usually involves two stages the location and the psychological method used,Social engineering
"the location is where the attack 
takes place",Social engineering
this could be online at work place or over the telephone,Social engineering
"the second phase involves using different 
psychological methods to manipulate a victim",Social engineering
"it includes exploitation of asserted authority people’s commitments 
and strong relationships",Social engineering
"the exploitation can come in form of manipulating people’s tendency to help 
reciprocation liking and similarity jones  p ",Social engineering
"irrespective of the method used the goal of a social engineer 
is to gain access to desired information by manipulating the victim without the victim’s awareness",Social engineering
information is of great importance to governments and organizations,Social engineering
"there has been a rise in information security 
violations with attempts to get sensitive information by illegal access",Social engineering

"participant two believed it was desperation of finding a job and trust in other people’s feedback that made 
the se attack successful",Social engineering
these traits are indications of conscientiousness and agreeableness,Social engineering
"however the 
participant’s personality test result does not indicate that",Social engineering
"the third participant believed it was the fear of being 
locked out of personal account and not having access to money as well as lack of training and proper education as 
at that time that made the se attack successful",Social engineering
these traits are indications of agreeableness and neuroticism,Social engineering
"the 
participant believes in compliance and being loyal as well as fearful of losing personal money",Social engineering
"this does not totally 
agree with the personality result",Social engineering

indicated that money curiosity and trusting positive feedback from others that led to the successful se attack",Social engineering
these traits are indications of openness extroversion and agreeableness which are in line with participant’s result,Social engineering
"from this study and the scenarios examined the findings indicate that personality traits can determine the 
likelihood of se attack and users with some type of personality are more susceptible than others",Social engineering
"while people 
with high score in agreeableness and extroversion trait are likely to be more susceptible to se attack the likelihood 
of a successful se attack is not only dependent on the personality trait it depends on the user’s circumstance and 
the attack technique of the attacker",Social engineering
"though some types of personality traits have the tendency to be easily 
manipulated if the attacker does not motivate them the chances of a successful attack is low",Social engineering
"also the result 
indicated that people that are more trusting will likely be more susceptible because once your trust level increases 
your guard falls",Social engineering

enhancing user’s susceptibility to social engineering attacks",Social engineering
"it was believed that if users understand the traits to 
look out for irrespective of the technique used the likelihood of susceptibility to se attack will be reduced",Social engineering
"two 
of the participants believed it’s the user’s motivating factor that matters irrespective of technique that is been used 
if the user is not motivated the trick will not work on them",Social engineering
"two other participants supported that it’s a synergy of 
the user’s motivating factor attacker’s technique and chance",Social engineering
"all the participants believed that personality is one 
of the reasons why people fall victim of social engineering attack",Social engineering
"considering social engineering attack is a 
targeted attack which means the social engineers knows the class of people they want which are likely to fall 
victim",Social engineering
this brings in personality profile,Social engineering
"drawing from the data analysis it was stated that the factors which 
serves as the motivation can vary from time to time depending on the user’s situation however the user’s 
personality is expected to be relatively constant",Social engineering

understand what makes people vulnerable to this attack is imperative",Social engineering
"social engineers build their attack scenarios 
based on personality profiles",Social engineering

solutions and raising awareness through warnings about social engineering attacks",Social engineering
"however these methods have 
generally been proven to be ineffective junger et al  p ",Social engineering
"this purpose of this study was therefore to 
examine what personality trait makes users more susceptible to se attack",Social engineering
"these data were gathered from 
experiences of participants who understand how social engineering works and have once been a victim of a se 
attack",Social engineering
"several user’s motivating factors were identified and the personality traits with the likelihood of increased 
susceptibility determined",Social engineering
"the result is intended to contribute to the body of knowledge by informing individuals 
and organizations the kind of personality trait that are more prone to se attacks this in turn provides a basis for 
identifying possible se techniques and initiating effective solutions through the decision making of user’s who are 
more susceptible to social engineering attack",Social engineering
"conclusion 
the field of social engineering clearly needs further research especially in identifying the user’s susceptibility and 
to aid effective countermeasures",Social engineering
"as the social engineering techniques become more sophisticated and the incident 
rate increases it is important to provide effective measures",Social engineering
"one of the potential measures is in examining a user’s 
susceptibility",Social engineering
"when the users are aware of their se vulnerability organizations will be able to measure their risk 
to social engineering and employ effective measures to counter these attacks according to the distinct identified 
user’s weakness",Social engineering
"several studies have focused on testing the rate of the user’s susceptibility through phishing 
techniques",Social engineering
"however most of these studies have not focused on what attributes makes the user act the way they 
act",Social engineering
"while there is literature focusing on the relationship between the user’s personality traits and their 
susceptibility rate to se attack there is a discrepancy in existing literature on what individual personality traits 
make users susceptible to attack",Social engineering
"the results reported in this paper suggest that users with high scores in 
agreeableness and extroversion traits are likely to be more susceptible to social engineering attack than others",Social engineering
"we 
also identified moderating variables that included emotional state the environment and motivations",Social engineering
"these results 
are a useful start for further research into the impact of different social engineering attacks on different personality 
types",Social engineering

coded to match the cip scheme",Social engineering

information science alongside computer science in the ipeds classification mlis students 
often have undergraduate degrees in library and information science lis",Social engineering
"this could also be 
due to data from programs offering a broader graduate level degree in information with tracks or 
specializations for lis computer science information management user experience ux and 
other cognate fields",Social engineering
"ipeds does offer a separate category specifically for library science and 
that is where we classified undergraduate lis degrees from our dataset",Social engineering
"however other non
library informationrelated degrees such as information administration and management were 
assigned to the ipeds category of computer  information sciences",Social engineering
"computer science degrees 
may also be more highly represented due to the types of mlis programs that responded several 
contemporary degree programs now admit students to a general informationbased course of 
study where students subsequently may select to pursue a specialization or track in library 
science and librarianship",Social engineering
"therefore some degrees in our dataset surely represent matriculated 
students who went on to pursue information degrees exclusive of the mlis",Social engineering
a similar issue arises in the area of law,Social engineering
"at least one of the mlis programs that contributed data 
offered a specialization in law librarianship thus attracting people with previous experience in 
that area",Social engineering
"although this may not be evident in the undergraduate data  in librarianship 
compared with  overall  of all previous degrees undergraduate graduate and 
postgrad earned by incoming mlis students were in law",Social engineering

juris doctor jd a degree earned only after already earning an undergraduate degree is 
considered the first degree in law in the united states law school admission council nd",Social engineering

statistics is nearly identical to the overall rate  in librarianship vs  overall",Social engineering
"the 
  
only other categories with similar distributions were architecture communicationsjournalism 
and multiinterdisciplinary studies",Social engineering
"the ways in which this profile compares to previous studies 
 
librarianship clearly reflects a different distribution of undergraduate degrees than the us 
population at large",Social engineering
"to investigate whether this distribution is a new trend reflecting 
contemporary needs or has remained constant over time we compared undergraduate degree 
data from our dataset to similar data reported on in previous studies see figure ",Social engineering
"data from 
douglass  white  macklin  and cain  were used for this comparison as 
they all offered a similar level of specificity to the ipeds classification of undergraduate majors",Social engineering
"two of the studies gleaned data from questionnaire responses of undergraduate students 
douglass and white  macklin while cain relied on data from vita bank an attempted census 
of practicing librarians",Social engineering
"not all subject designations were reflected in each study notably white 
and macklin did not specifically report library science business or arts undergraduate degrees as 
individual categories",Social engineering
"totals do not add up to  due to additional subject area designations 
not consistently reported across all four studies as well as accounting for othermiscellaneous 
degrees",Social engineering

categorized as a social science rather than with the humanities subjects",Social engineering
undergraduate degrees across four studies,Social engineering
"despite still comprising a nearmajority earning an undergraduate humanities degree prior to 
librarianship appears to be on the decline",Social engineering
"social sciences are represented in higher numbers in 
more recent years however this could possibly be attributed to a number of reason",Social engineering
"the 
  
classification of history as a social science certainly affects these results in a significant way",Social engineering
"but 
a higher number of social science undergraduates pursuing librarianship could also correspond 
with the evolutionary alignment of librarianship to information science which is often positioned 
as a social science",Social engineering
"or perhaps more options for social science degrees have become available in 
recent years",Social engineering
"some professions such as education library science and business were called out individually 
in most of the studies while other professions determined by our own original inductive coding 
were not",Social engineering
"again this may be an artifact of an evolving education space which now includes 
degrees in subjects that were previously not offered in the academy",Social engineering
"of the specific professions 
highlighted in three of the four studies compared here education seems to have peaked in the 
s and declined since then",Social engineering
"although librarianship is still often affiliated with an educational 
bent especially when considering its historical foundations and core values a decline in this 
focus has been noted as a result of the field’s alignment with information science dali ",Social engineering
"when compared with the contemporary ipeds data librarianship actually slightly lags the 
nation in undergraduate education degrees  nationally vs  in librarianship",Social engineering
"business on the other hand has seen slight rise from  of undergraduate degrees in  to 
 today but as previously noted this is starkly out of proportion from the national figure of

due to graduates of those degrees facing increased challenges in securing jobs in fields directly 
related to their studies",Social engineering
"implications and conclusions 
 
this work set out to investigate the educational and disciplinary backgrounds of contemporary 
librarians as well as to understand how these backgrounds compared to librarians of the past as 
well as the general population",Social engineering
"unsurprisingly we found that contemporary librarians 
represented by mlis students on the cusp of their career so as to reflect the future landscape as 
much as possible still hail predominantly from humanities backgrounds especially english",Social engineering
history is also a strongly represented area of study,Social engineering
"the large number of people with humanities 
backgrounds may have made sense when libraries were focused on books literature and reading",Social engineering
"however by the time library education shifted to the graduate level in the united states 
librarianship itself had also already begun the shift toward becoming the social science field it is 
considered today",Social engineering
"yet the undergraduate backgrounds of people pursuing librarianship do not 
seem to have shifted at the same rate",Social engineering
"this leaves library educators with the difficult task of 
training people with humanities backgrounds to do social science worka fundamentally 
different approach that risks mismatches in disciplinary norms",Social engineering
"while most students with 
humanities backgrounds are more than capable writers their unfamiliarity with the research 
methodologies and genre conventions often found in mlis curricula which is more closely 
aligned with the social sciences leaves many of these students struggling to understand 
expectations",Social engineering

employment where “the ability of library and information professionals to responsibly consume

"the strength 
of this implementation to take place will rely on the fusion of pedagogy and technology within a

 contribution
in this paper our main contributions are listed as follows",Virtual reality
"• propose the concept of inverse augmented reality and elaborate
the formulations according to physical properties",Virtual reality
"• show the typical structure of inverse augmented reality systems
and present the proof of concept for iar",Virtual reality
"framework of inverse augmented reality
",Virtual reality
"dualworld structure
the proposed inverse augmented reality and the traditional aug
mented reality as shown in fig",Virtual reality
" are under the unified dualworld
structure",Virtual reality
"the traditional augmented reality humancentered obser
vation is to augment the physical world with virtual objects while
the inverse augmented reality virtual agentcentered observation is
to augment the virtual world with real objects",Virtual reality
"there might be a misconception between the proposed “inverse
augmented reality” and another wellknown concept called “aug
mented virtuality”",Virtual reality
"even though the two concepts are all describing
using real elements in the physical world to augment virtual ele
ments in the virtual world their positions are definitely different",Virtual reality
"the augmented virtuality means that it is the human who can see a
scene where the virtual elements are augmented by real elements
and the human himself is located in the real world",Virtual reality
"conversely
the inverse augmented reality means that it is the virtual agent who
can see a scene where the virtual elements are augmented by real
elements and the virtual agent itself is located in the virtual world
 mathematical model
take the visual ar and iar as the example the formulation for ar
and iar can be as follows",Virtual reality
"let or denote the real objects ov the virtual objects h the
humans a the virtual agents then we get
ar⇔ shorov a
iar⇔ saorov h 
where sh denotes the observation function of humans and sa
denotes the observation function of virtual agents",Virtual reality
"physical perspective of inverse augmented re
ality
in this work we emphasize the equivalence of the virtual world and
the physical world regarding the structure in physics",Virtual reality
"the referred
physics here contains both the physical world and the virtual world
ie the virtual world is treated as a kind of existence in physics
which possesses the same structure with the physical world",Virtual reality
"in this
way iar has the same important role as the traditional ar",Virtual reality
"we use
a definition called physical equivalence to elaborate the equivalence
of the physical world and the virtual world",Virtual reality
"this means the two
worlds should be the same when talking about the physical structure
which can also be seen in equation 
 spatial structure
in the traditional augmented reality there are three key components
ie the humans the physical world and the virtual contents added to
the physical world",Virtual reality
"as a correspondence the same structure applies
to inverse augmented reality",Virtual reality
"concretely inverse augmented reality
also contains three key components ie the virtual character the
programmable virtual world and the physical contents added to the
virtual world",Virtual reality
"we emphasize the spatial structure rather than the
appearance because the difference regarding appearance is obvious",Virtual reality
"for example all objects in the virtual world are data that are first
created by human and then develop independently",Virtual reality
"though the
appearance is different the spatial structure can be similar especially
the physical roles and interaction ways
 self development
as a common knowledge the physical world we live in is keeping
developing all the time",Virtual reality
"it seems to be driven by a kind of energy
with the form of physical roles",Virtual reality
"meanwhile humans are born with
intelligence so they can actively interact with the physical world",Virtual reality
"since the virtual world is expected to be developing by itself it
should have two kinds of agents ie the character agent and the
environment agent ",Virtual reality
"the character agent can be treated as a
virtual human in the virtual world while the environment agent
determines how the virtual environment can develop automatically",Virtual reality
"the two agents are created by our physical world then they construct
the virtual world and develop independently without being directly
controlled by the physical world",Virtual reality
"the agents can not only learn from
physical world but also evolve by themselves",Virtual reality
"notice that only the
character agents can observe things in the proposed framework of
inverse augmented reality
 equalstatus interaction
considering the traditional ar and the proposed iar the physical
world and the virtual world are equal to each other regarding inter
action",Virtual reality
"as we often see in the traditional ar a human can interact
with both real and virtual objects that have been observed by him",Virtual reality
"similarly the character agent in the virtual world can interact with
both virtual and real objects that have been observed by the agent",Virtual reality
"the two interaction processes are dual processes with the exactly
symmetrical interaction style as shown in fig  the interaction
from virtual world to physical world means the virtual agent can
control some physical power in order to change the physical state
of real objects eg if the virtual agent want to put a real box on a
virtual table it is required to find a certain physical way to support
the real box so that it seems to be on the virtual table",Virtual reality
"and the
physical way to realize this physical effect is expected to be con
trolled by the virtual agent",Virtual reality
"this is surely very hard for the current
technology but it is an essential part for iar to support an equal
interaction process compared with the traditional ar",Virtual reality
"therefore the
equalstatus interaction may need to be further studied and realized
in the future",Virtual reality
"system setup
we utilize microsoft hololens as the basic platform to demonstrate
the concept of iar",Virtual reality
"both ar and iar are implemented by unityd
and the vuforia software development kit",Virtual reality
figure  interaction between physical world and virtual world,Virtual reality
"solid
black arrows denote the direct control stream",Virtual reality
"hollow arrows denote
indirect control stream",Virtual reality
"the big arrows with orange color denote the
registration from virtual world to real world while the big arrows with
blue color denote the registration from physical world to virtual world
 framework representation
since the basic framework has been illustrated above we present a
typical demonstration of iar using an office environment",Virtual reality
"we add
a virtual cube floating above the table which is located by a small
photo",Virtual reality
"the small photo is fixed on the top of a table which serves as
a bridge connecting the physical world and the virtual world",Virtual reality
"after
the environment is constructed two views from the different worlds
are shown in fig  in the traditional augmented reality the user
can see the physical environment and the virtual element a cube
with the checkerboard pattern and she can also interact with the
virtual element",Virtual reality
"in the inverse augmented reality a virtual agent
is constructed and it can behave like a physical human",Virtual reality
"though
what can be “seen” by the agent is absolutely some data we can still
figure out the meaning of these data",Virtual reality
"usually these data include the
virtual cube that is connected with the physical world the virtual
table that corresponds to the real table in the physical world and
some other virtual objects that do not exist in the physical world",Virtual reality
"discussion and conclusion
the equivalence between the virtual world and the real world is
proposed regarding the structure",Virtual reality
"as for the structure it is already
illustrated by introducing all essential parts of the traditional aug
mented reality and the inverse augmented reality",Virtual reality
"though the spe
cific expression forms are different the two paradigms possess the
same structure with each other",Virtual reality
"our demonstration is about the
concept verification and all the results are shown directly by images
observing from different worlds",Virtual reality
"this is a clear way to show the
concept of iar",Virtual reality
"in this paper we propose the big framework of the traditional aug
mented reality and the inverse augmented reality",Virtual reality
"then we illustrate
the main properties of this framework",Virtual reality
"under this framework we
emphasize that the selfintelligence would play an important role in
the virtual world which contributes greatly to building an inverse
augmented reality system",Virtual reality
"we also present a typical implementation
of an inverse augmented reality system which shows the inverse
augmented reality can be realized with most current techniques",Virtual reality
"the remaining challenges in the field of inverse augmented reality
mainly include three aspects
 physical construction of virtual objects in the physical world",Virtual reality
 specific design of virtualtophysical bridges,Virtual reality
 intelligence and knowledge for the selfdriven virtual world,Virtual reality
"future work will be unifying the proposed iar and the previous
ivr into a more general framework in order to represent the reality
at a higher level than what we have done currently",Virtual reality
"in this way what
the virtual agent could experience in both the virtual and the real
world can be well illustrated",Virtual reality
"the left side is the view from
the virtual world while the right side is the view from the physical
world",Virtual reality
"some objects exist in both worlds such as the cube with yellow
dashed circle and the table with green dashed rectangle",Virtual reality
"some
objects only exist in one world",Virtual reality
"for example some colorful cubes only
exist in the virtual world while a chair and a laptop only exist in the
physical world",Virtual reality

did not affect the acceptance of wearing and using the hdm",Virtual reality
"this study revealed from the 
questionnaires given and observations that asd participants accepted the hmd and were 
willing to complete the vr experiences",Virtual reality
"these findings were important because they provided 
initial evidence that for this group of asd participants there was minimal negative effects

accept the use of hdm",Virtual reality
"all of the literature that was reviewed and discussed points to a 
conclusion",Virtual reality

while there are many different methods that have been used there are very few that have 
incorporated the use of virtual reality",Virtual reality
"many of the studies showed a greater positive impact on students when using methods 
in unison with each other verses independently",Virtual reality
"and programs that incorporate virtual reality 
allow instruction to be done in a safe controlled environment where students are able to 
practice the skills they have learned",Virtual reality

formulated regarding a less common intervention method  
 will high school students with asd improve their social conversation skills through 
the use of virtual reality

diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder to learn some of its characteristics to gain an overview of 
some key strategies for educating students with asd specifically in the area of social skills to 
gain an overview of current evidencebased approaches to intervention when working with asd 
students and to explore the use of virtual reality as an intervention method",Virtual reality
